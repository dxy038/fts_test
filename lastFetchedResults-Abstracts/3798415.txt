This paper describes a robust version to the TEAM 22 benchmark optimization problem and presents the methodology WCSA (worst case scenario approximation) to solve this problem and other similar cases. The robust multi-objective TEAM 22 model was built from its classical configuration by assuming the imprecisions in the design space. General and specific robust optimization formulas were developed to elaborate WCSA approach. WCSA adds an uncertainty parameter in the objective and constraint functions to perform the role of the systemÂ´s imprecisions. A multi-objective genetic algorithm approach was chosen to deal with the robust formulation and to find out the set of robust minimizers that matches with the problem requirements. The behavior of the robust Pareto front is also examined.

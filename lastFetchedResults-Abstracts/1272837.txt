The objective of this study is to identify parameters influencing trace elements (TE) vertical distributions in an Andosol–Andic Cambisol climosequence. In order to understand processes involved in the current distribution of trace elements from basaltic rocks to associated soils, six pedons developed on Tertiary massive basaltic formations, located at similar position in the hill-slopes, submitted to the same wet mountainous climate but under various microclimatic conditions (altitude and annual rainfall), were considered. The six studied soils are andic and rich in organo–metallic complexes. Two different and quantitative methods were used to compare the geochemical distributions of major and trace elements, both being calculated with Ti as invariant element: isovolumetric mass balance and enrichment factors. Anthropogenic, pedogenetic, microclimatic, inherited factors were discriminated. Anthropogenic influences are pointed out for K in two pedons and for Pb in all studied sites. Distributions of other TE are affected by discontinuities between underlying rocks and soil horizons. Zinc and Cu distributions are controlled by organic matter whereas Cr and Ni distributions are influenced by pedogenetic processes. Results emphasize the relative trace element immobilization in andic soils under temperate climate.

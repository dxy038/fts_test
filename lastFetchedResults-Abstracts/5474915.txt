This paper presents a cascaded five-level inverter DC separated sources and output LC filter. The objective is to propose and develop a passivity-based controller (PBC) and empathize its advantages when is applied in multilevel inverters, especially in cascaded multi-cell power converters (inverter/rectifier). The focus of the developed PBC, is that the inductor current and/or the voltage capacitor tracks a desired reference, in order to use the multilevel inverter as a power line conditioner. Explanation of power stage, model and control design are developed in this paper. Simulation and experimental results are shown in order to validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the PBC

Prediction of necrosis has a clinical relevance in all fields of plastic surgery. The new application of indocyanine green (ICG) fluoroscopy in plastic surgery allows an objective quantification of skin perfusion and a high topographical resolution. The aim of the present study is to determine threshold values for flap perfusion under well-defined experimental conditions.

Twenty random pattern flaps with a length to width ratio of 4:1 (8×2 cm2) were dissected on the anterior abdominal wall of 20 male Sprague–Dawley rats. ICG fluoroscopy was performed at the end of the operation. The animals were sacrificed at the seventh postoperative day with a reliable necrosis of the distal part of the flaps. Postoperative ICG fluoroscopy then was analysed both in regions that will survive and undergo necrosis.

At day 7 a mean area of 5.5 cm2 (57% of the total flap area) survived and a mean of 3.8 cm2 (43%) became necrotic. The surviving part of the flap had a mean perfusion index of 62% compared to reference skin. The distal parts of the flap that necrotised showed an average perfusion index of only 19% postoperatively. Differences were statistically highly significant (p<0.001).

Indocyanine green fluoroscopy is a useful tool to evaluate perfusion topographically and predict necrosis. From a statistical point of view a perfusion index of less than 25% of the reference skin can be considered as a sign of developing flap necrosis

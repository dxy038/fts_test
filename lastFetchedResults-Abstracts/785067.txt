Objective: assessment of energy needs is a critical step in developing the nutrition care plan,
especially for individuals unable to modulate their own energy intakes. the purpose of this study was to assess
precision and accuracy of commonly used prediction equations in comparison to measured resting energy
expenditure in a sample of “oldest old” adults residing in long term care (ltC). Subjects and Design: resting
energy expenditure (mree) was measured by indirect calorimetry in 45 residents aged 86.1 ± 7.3 years, and
compared to frequently used prediction equations (pree): Mifflin St.Jeor, Harris Benedict, World Health
organization and owen. Precision and accuracy were determined by concordance correlation coefficients and
number of individuals within ± 10% of mree. Bland altman plots with linear dependence trends were
constructed to visualize agreement. to complete analyses, the common 25 kcal/kg formula was assessed and
alternative formulas were determined for best fit by regressing adjusted mree on body weight. Results: mree
averaged 976.2 ± 190.3 kcal/day for females and 1260.0 ± 275.9 kcal/d for males. the strength of the
relationships between pree and mree were only moderate (r = 0.41 – 0.72). in examining linear trends in the
Bland altman plots, significant systematic deviation from mree was detected for all pree. two kcal/kg
formulas were generated: 20.6 kcal/kg for females and 22.7 kcal/kg for males, which were not significantly
different. Conclusion: none of the prediction equations adequately estimated energy needs in this sample of the
“oldest old.” a simple formula using 21-23 kcal/kg may be a more practical and reliable method to determine
energy needs in the ltC setting.

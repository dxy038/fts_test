It is proposed a novel fault detection technique applied on indirect matrix converter (IMC) in order to detect open circuit faults in bidirectional switches. An IMC under input power factor control in generation systems based on Microturbine (MT) is considered in this study. The IMC under open-circuited switch failures provides continuous operation, since the performance detriment is not drastic although power quality considerably decrease. This work will focus this particular case where faults are not quite evident. The proposed detection technique is based on the continuous wavelet transform and the global wavelet spectrum function applied to the IMC input current. Simulation results are presented in order to verify the proposed diagnostic tool.

This article presents an algorithm to integrate the passive and active control for automotive suspension systems. The objective of the algorithm is to simultaneously find: 1) the optimal values of the stiffness and damping ratios for the springs and dampers; and 2) an optimal stabilizing controller such that the active control energy is minimized subject to the prespecified RMS constraints on the outputs and the constraints on the stiffness and damping ratios. The algorithm is given in the linear matrix inequality form, and the convergence is guaranteed

This research aims at the development of switching power supply circuits that supply electric power from distributed power sources to electronic devices. A typical switching power supply uses constant voltage control, but in addition to constant voltage control, we propose constant current control enabled by means of digital PWM (pulse width modulation) control and a bidirectional DC-DC converter capable of converting energy in two directions using a single DC-DC converter. This paper supposes that the aforementioned technology will be applied to streetlight systems that use solar cells, LEDs and batteries. Experiments on the charging operation using batteries and LEDs, as well as of the discharging operation using solar cells and batteries, were conducted, and this technology was evaluated based on those results.

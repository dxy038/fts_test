The objective of this study was to create a superhydrophobic surface using polymers that are non-fluorinated and applying them to a surface via rapid expansion of a supercritical solution (RESS). Solubility studies of poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) and a statistical copolymer of vinyl acetate and vinyl pivalate (P(VAc-VPi))in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) were carried out using an extraction procedure. It was found that the most suitable process parameters for spraying these polymers using the RESS technique were 30 MPa, 40 °C and 10% (v/v) acetone as a co-solvent. The surfaces produced were characterized in terms of their morphology and hydrophobic properties by scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measurements, respectively. The most hydrophobic surfaces were obtained by spraying the P(VAc-VPi) copolymers, giving advancing water contact angles in the range of 120–155° due to the hydrophobic character of the polymer and the microstructure formed with the RESS technique. These results show great promise for the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces using non-fluorinated polymers applied to surfaces via RESS technique.

This paper presents an isolated three-phase bidirectional AC-DC converter with a novel modulation strategy that enables Zero-Voltage-Switching (ZVS) for all switches over the whole AC line period. The AC-DC converter allows the direct coupling of a three-phase AC system with a DC port applying a single high-frequency transformer. A novel modelling approach for the power flows and the derivation of the control variables under ZVS conditions are provided. The design of components including loss models and simulation results of a 11kW electric vehicle battery charger to connect to the 230V<sub>rms</sub>, 50Hz mains considering a battery voltage range of 380V to 540V validate the theoretical analysis.

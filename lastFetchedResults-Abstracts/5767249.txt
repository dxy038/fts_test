The aim of this paper is to deal with the resource-constrained multiple project scheduling problems (rc-mPSP) with fuzzy coefficients, which is well known one of NP-hard problems, by a hybrid genetic algorithm with fuzzy logic controller (flc-hGA). The objective in this paper is to minimize total project time in the project. Because traditional optimization techniques canpsilat cope with the rc-mPSP problems with fuzzy coefficients effectively, so we presents a new approach based on the hybrid genetic algorithm (hGA) with fuzzy logic controller (FLC). For rc-mPSP with fuzzy coefficients, the approach was tested on a set of standard problems and compared with other approaches. The computation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

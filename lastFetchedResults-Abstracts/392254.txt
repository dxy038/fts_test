Objective: Bilateral same day surgery has been performed rarely because of the risk of postoperative sensorineural hearing loss following conventional myringoplasty or tympanoplasty (CMT). Simple underlay myringoplasty (SUM) through the ear canal has been developed by Yuasa R, Saijo S, Tomioka Y, et al. Office closure of eardrum perforation with fibrin glue (in Japanese), Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg (Tokyo) 1989;61:1117–1122, which has little risk of sensorineural hearing loss. We tried bilateral same day surgery using this technique and evaluated its outcome.
Methods: Of 86 cases with bilateral perforated chronic otitis media that we treated between 1995–1997, 25 cases underwent bilateral same day surgery. Bilateral SUMs was performed on seven patients, SUM and CMT on 16 patients, and bilateral CMTs on two patients.
Results: Closure of perforation was successful in 18 patients (72%) on both sides and in seven patients (28%) on one side. Postoperative air–bone gap of less than 20 dB was achieved in 15 cases (60%) on both sides and in 23 cases (92%) on one side.
Conclusion: Bilateral same day surgery for bilateral perforated chronic otitis media is possible if the operative indications are considered.

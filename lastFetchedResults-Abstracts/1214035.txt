Pt catalyst supported on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) has been prepared via ion-exchange and it was characterized by XRD, TEM, N2 physisorption and CO chemisorption. The Pt/CNF catalyst has a small Pt crystallite size in the range of 2–3 nm. This catalyst has been tested in the dehydrogenation of decalin, which is a cycloalkane proposed in the literature as H2 storage media for vehicles and portable devices. The objective is finding a Pt catalyst suitable for in situ generation of H2 from chemical storage in decalin. The results revealed that Pt supported on CNF outperforms a Pt catalyst supported on micro–mesoporous activated carbon. Finally, we propose a reactor configuration aiming at the intensification of H2 production in continuous.

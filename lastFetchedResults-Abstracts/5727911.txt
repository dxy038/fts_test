With stereo audio steping into peopleÂ´s daily lives, spatial parametric technology comes to its broad prospects for development. Spatial parameteric technology is a method for stereo compression. MDCT is excluded in the current scheme for spatial cues representation,due to its lacking of phase information and energy conservation. In this paper, Construction of new spatial parameter codec framework in MDCT domain, and Optimization of calculating for the new module, to reduce computational complexity of the system. A Modified Spatial Parameter Codec Algorithm in MDCT Domain was proposed to improve it. The MDCT-MDST conversion, in matrix form, is approximating to a banded sparse matrix. To compare with the EaacPlus system, the output stereo of the new system gains a considerable subjective and objective test scores. This research make a contribution to the spatial parametric technology in MDCT domain, and provide a new train of thought to reduce complexity of EaacPlus system.

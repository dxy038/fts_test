The optical video signal transmission is the most practical method for long distant communication in Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for underwater applications. Due to the fragility of the fiber material, this conventional method requires high maintenance. The umbilical cable also requires a large winch in consideration for the material fatigue issue. A novel technique, named, FAMPLC combines the voltage frequency and the current amplitude modulations over an embedded power supply that allows independent bidirectional copper base communication, between the controller and underwater vehicle. This technique allows an analog video signal transmission in one direction while digital or pulse wave transmission in the opposite direction. In this research work, B/W video signal was sent from ROV over the current as amplitude modulation and is detectable in the FAMPLC server by the Thevenin equivalent circuit.

Surveys of fish larvae and oceanographic conditions were conducted along transects across the shelf break region in the East China Sea (ECS) in May 2001. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and assemblages of fish larvae across the shelf break region and their relationships to mesoscale hydrographic features. There was a warm surface streamer from the Kuroshio which extended toward the shelf region of the ECS; concurrently, we observed the intrusion of the less saline shelf water into the subsurface layer towards the offshore. In all 66 taxa (65 families and 1 order) of larvae were collected by oblique net tows using a bongo net, the larval fish density and number of families sampled were lower in the low-temperature area. Based on cluster analysis and environmental factor, two larval fish assemblages were identified: off-shelf/Kuroshio and shelf break. In shelf break assemblage, Auxis spp. and Diaphus spp. were abundant in the warm surface streamer. In contrast, Maurolicus japonicus, Synagrops spp., Bregmaceros sp. and Champsodon spp. were found in the off-shelf region where the offshore intrusion of less-saline water occurred. This different pattern of the horizontal distribution would reflect vertical distribution of the larvae in the water column. Moreover, copepod nauplii density was higher in the upper layer of the shelf region. Thus, dynamic interactions between the Kuroshio and shelf waters at the frontal boundary are concluded to potentially affect larval fish transport and prey availability.

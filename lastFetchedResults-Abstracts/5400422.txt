Broadband characterizations are very useful in many applications as they operate over a wide range of frequencies. The objective of this paper is to study the transient responses of various well-known antennas over broad frequency ranges. As such, the phase responses of these antennas as a function of frequency are of great interest. In the ensuing analysis, each antenna is excited by a monocycle pulse. Many antennas show resonant properties, and numerous reflections exist in the antenna outputs However, some of the antennas are inherently broadband, up to a 100:1 bandwidth. Hence, the transient responses of these antennas can be used to determine their suitability for wideband applications with low cutoff frequency. Here we are specifically interested in dealing with century bandwidth antennas.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe prevalence of and risk factors for HIV among persons with newly diagnosed class III (confirmed) and class V (suspected) cases of tuberculosis (TB) patients in Los Angeles County.

METHODS: HIV testing was performed on 1307 blood specimens after routine tests were completed at six TB clinics in Los Angeles County. HIV test results were matched to demographic and risk behavior information by use of an unlinked study methodology.

RESULTS: The overall HIV prevalence rate was 10.8%. By demographic characteristics, the highest prevalence rates were observed among persons born in the United States (15.7%), males (14.1%), blacks (14.3%), and those aged 30â€“44 years (14.4%). Confirmed TB cases (14%) were more likely to be HIV-infected than were suspect cases (9.6%). Risk behaviors associated with positive HIV serostatus included the injection of nonprescription drugs, having sex with an injection drug user, and use of noninjection forms of heroin, cocaine, and tranquilizers. Men who have sex with men were more likely to be HIV-infected than were heterosexual males.

CONCLUSIONS: HIV testing and counseling should be a standard of care in TB clinics. The observed high HIV prevalence rate reinforces the importance of designing prevention strategies that specifically target patients with TB.

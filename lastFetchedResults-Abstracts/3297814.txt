Traditional method to determine photovoltaic (PV) station power penetration limit adopts complex power flow dynamic calculation, which is time-consuming and inaccurate. An approximate linear optimization algorithm was proposed to calculate PV station power penetration limit in weak grid. It transformed the complex problem of nonlinear objective function and constraint condition into a simple linear problem to calculate the accurate PV power penetration limit. A 13 nodes typical distribution weak grid system was founded in Digsilent software to verify the advantages of this algorithm. The simulation results have proved the rapidity, high accuracy and efficiency of this algorithm.

In this paper, we present the development of quadratic serendipity shape functions on planar convex and nonconvex polygons. Drawing on the work of Bompadre et al. (2012) [1] and Hormann and Sukumar (2008) [2], we adopt a relative entropy measure for signed (positive or negative) shape functions, with nodal prior weight functions that have the appropriate zero-set on the boundary of the polygon. We maximize the objective functional subject to the constraints for quadratic completeness proposed by Rand et al. (2013) [3]. Along an edge of a polygon, the approximation is identical to univariate Bernstein polynomials: the choice of the nodal prior weight function ensures that the shape functions satisfy a weak Kronecker-delta property on each edge. The shape functions are well-defined for arbitrary planar polygons without self-intersections. On using a modified numerical integration scheme, we show that the quadratic patch test is passed on polygonal meshes with convex and nonconvex elements. Numerical tests for the Poisson equation on self-similar trapezoidal meshes and quasiuniform polygonal meshes are presented, which reveal the sound accuracy of the method, and optimal rates of convergence in the L 2 norm and the H 1 seminorm are established.

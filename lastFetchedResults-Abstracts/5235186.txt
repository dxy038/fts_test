This paper focuses on the optimization of location inventory routing problem (LIRP) taking the retailersÂ´ customer time satisfaction degree into account. Based on the model of LIRP, a multi-objective programming model of LIRP which accounting to customer time satisfaction degree is built. Then an improved genetic algorithm is introduced to solve the model. Finally, a set of computational experiments are conducted, the results show that the model is suitable and the method is available.

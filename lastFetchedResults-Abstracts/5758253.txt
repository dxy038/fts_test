In this paper, we consider a robust cooperative output regulation problem in a class of uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems. It is assumed that only some of the agents are able to access the exosystem, and thus the problem has to be solved by cooperation among different agents. An internal model based control strategy is proposed such that, regardless of small parameter perturbations of the agent and control law, the objective of asymptotic tracking and disturbance rejection can be achieved by the control law.

This paper is devoted to the study of the pseudo-Lipschitz property of Pareto solution map for the parametric linear semi-infinite vector optimization problem (LSVO). We establish new sufficient conditions for the pseudo-Lipschitz property of the Pareto solution map of (LSVO) under continuous perturbations of the right-hand side of the constraints and linear perturbations of the objective function. Examples are given to illustrate the results obtained.


Background and Objective: Urinary tract infections and bacteremia are the major problems in renal transplant patients, which are mostly due to immunesuppressive regimens, surgery, and exposure to the germs in hospital. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial agents in the blood and urine samples of kidney transplant candidates. 
Material and Methods: In this one-year-long study, thirty-three renal transplant candidates were assessed for urine and blood cultures. One urine and blood samples from each patient before transplantation and three samples after transplantation were collected.  The Samples, using standard microbiological methods, were investigated and infectious organisms identified.
Results:  In 133 urine samples, Escherichia coli (20.5%), Enterobacter spp. (5.3%), Klebsiella spp. (3 %) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1.5%) were isolated.  In the blood samples, Enterobacter spp. (9.1%), Escherichia coli (6.8%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.8%) and Klebsiella spp. (0.8%) were isolated. 
Conclusion: The results indicate that urinary tract infection was high in patients with transplanted kidney, and E. coli is the most common cause of this infection.

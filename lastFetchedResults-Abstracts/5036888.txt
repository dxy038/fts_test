Radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies have been used by the military to gain in-transit visibility and improve inventory management. The advantages of using RFID to track assets over using barcode have been broadly recognized. However, recent research has proven that RFID is vulnerable to attacks. This brings a challenge at a time when RFID systems are being employed in various applications, including military supply chain systems. In this paper, underlying vulnerabilities of RFID system are analyzed, different attacks that can be made against RFID system are illustrated, and countermeasures against the attacks are recommended. The objective of this article is to secure military logistics by identifying the common threats to RFID systems

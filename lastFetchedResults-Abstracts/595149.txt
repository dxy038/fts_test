Objective: To find out the frequency of proteinuria and its known risk factors (duration of diabetes, status of glycemic control and concurrent hypertension) in diabetics.Material and Methods: This hospital based observational study was carried out from November 2003 to May 2004, at Medical A Unit Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar. A total of 100 patients were selected through non-probability purposive type sampling. AH established diabetics were included irrespective of the type of diabetes, age and sex. Questions were asked regarding the type and duration of diabetes. Blood pressure of each patient was measured. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) and 24 hours urinary protein were done to assess the glycemic status and proteinuria.Results: Seventy-one patients (71%) had macroalbuminuria (overt nephropathy). Twenty-nine patients (29%) had microalbuminuria (incipient nephropathy). Duration of diabetes in 79 (79%) of the patients was less than 10 years with a mean duration of 7.4 (± 5.01). Seventy nine (79%) of the patients had HbAlc of greater than 7% and mean HbAlc was 8.59 (± 1.82). Hypertension was present in 37 % of the patients.Conclusion: Majority of the patients had overt nephropathy (macroalbuminuria). Most of the patients had relatively shorter duration of diabetes. Diabetes was uncontrolled in the majority of the patients and hypertension was present hi around one third of the patients.

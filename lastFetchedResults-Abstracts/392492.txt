Objective: To evaluate the patency and effectiveness of inferior meatal antrostomy for the treatment of maxillary lesions. Methods: Patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic sinusitis who underwent inferior meatal antrostomies at St. Marianna University Toyoko Hospital and followed up for at least 1 year after surgery were selected. Thirty sides of 27 patients were analyzed. Postoperative mucociliary function was examined in seven sides of seven patients. Results: No closure was observed in all 30 procedures. Out of 30 antra, 26 (86.7%) had normal antral mucosa. Recurrent mucosal lesions inside the maxillary sinus were successfully treated through the inferior meatal window. No cases showed circular flow on the india ink test. All sinuses exhibited a discharge from the middle meatal window and three out of seven sinuses exhibited a discharge from the inferior meatal window. Conclusions: Although long-term follow-up is required to determine the patency of inferior meatal antrostomy, initial results are encouraging. The inferior meatal window provides both intra- and postoperative benefits.

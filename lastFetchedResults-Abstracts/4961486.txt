In this paper the state-feedback control problem for linear uncertain systems is considered. The performance objective is the expectation of a quadratic integral cost function, and the &#8220;worst-case&#8221; state-feedback controllers is designed to accommodate uncertain parameter. We give computable bounds for such performance. For an LTI system, our bounds are the square of &#8459;<sub>2</sub> norm of the system actually

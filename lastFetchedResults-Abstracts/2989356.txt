In this paper, the problem of the objective evaluation of trainee performance from simulators, and the subsequent prediction of the traineeÂ´s competency, is solved in two ways: (i) using a linear factor structure and linear factor dynamics, in the case of large samples of trainees and simulator tests, and (ii) using a nonlinear Hopfield overlap-based structure and nonlinear overlap dynamics, in the case of small samples of trainees and simulator tests

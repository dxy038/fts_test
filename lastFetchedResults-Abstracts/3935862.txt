This letter reports an experimental demonstration of an indoor angle-diversity optical wireless communications system. This operates at 1.25 Gb/s and provides bidirectional communications between two terminals. Each terminal uses three transmitting "cells" giving a field of view of approximately 25&#176; &#215; 8&#176; over a range of approximately 3 m. Data is transmitted to a terminal that uses three receivers to obtain a similar reception field of view. Link operation at a bit-error rate &lt;;; 10e-9 is reported, together with an overview of the system configuration.

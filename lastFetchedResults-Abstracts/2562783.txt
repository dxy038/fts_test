In critical analysis, different aspects of an issue will be analyzed from point of view of current discourse of society. The objective of this paper, is to critically analyze the economic goals of development plans (pre and post revaluation). In this respect, many papers and research report has been considered and the results show that critical discourse have paid attention to plans and its economic goals, from social, political and cultural point of views, and so have positive, vague and contradictory impact on economic goals. Even though 30 different concepts have been erected in this area but the plans have been evaluated only based on the two, namely (1) quantitative goals of few macrovariables and (2) quantitative goals of sectors. This implicitly shows the ineffectiveness of social discourse on economic goals of development plans. It should be mentioned that the main goal of any development plan, i.e.
“development”, is not clearly defined in planning system. So, the most important lesson is that, the development and development plans of the country should be define carefully and have an academic acceptance on them. The next finding is that the economic goals of development plans are not based on any wellknown economic school of thought. So in this environment, the financial resources of government have be used to overcome the shortcoming and emergency needs of the economy and that is why they were not so successful.

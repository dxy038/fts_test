With multimedia technology rapid development and popular application in the wireless sensor networks (WSN), it become a facing problem necessarily that the wireless sensor network need to support quality of service (QoS) for all kinds of services. Accordingly, this paper builds a multi objective programming model and presents a QoS routing algorithm for WSN, which can also run efficiently with best-effort traffic. Simulations and comparisons with some typical route algorithms show that our algorithm is robust and effective.

Objective To study the prescription and preparation technology of Prunella ethanol extract dispersible tablets. Methods Take disintegration time as indexes, the prescription and preparation technology were optimized by an orthogonal design. The hardness, suspended uniformity, dissolution were investigated and preliminary stability were tested through accelerated test. Results The optimum prescription was: active components 40%, loading agent MCC 50%, disintegrating agent PVPP 8% and lubricant magnesium stearate 1%. The dispersible tablets were prepared under the optimum technology with hardness 5.1&#177;0.3 kg&#183;mm<sup>-2</sup>, satisfactory suspended uniformity, stable quality and accumulated dissolution in 30 min was more than 90%. Conclusion The prescription for the dispersible tablets was reasonable and its technology is feasible, which meets the quality requirement of the disperse tablets.

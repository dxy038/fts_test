Objective: To know the pattern of lipid profile in obese and non-obese type-2 diabetes mellitus patients as compared lo a control groupMaterial and Methods: One hundred (50 obese and 50 non-obese) diagnosed patients having diabetes mellitus minimum for the last three years were randomly selected from the outdoor patient department of medicine, Khyber teaching hospital, Peshawar during the year 2002. Obesity was taken as body mass index of more than 25 kg/m'. One hundred healthy individuals were selected from among the staff of Khyber medical college, Khyber College of Dentistry, and Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar to constitute the control group. They had no history of any chronic illness. Subjects suffering from cardiovascular diseases, kidney disorder and hepatic disorders were excluded from the study. Fasting serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and VLDL-C were determined by enzymatic calorimetric method and calculated by using Friedewald (J972) formula.Results: The levels of serum triglycerides (I 70.15±10.3 mg/dl v.v /59.01 ±10. II mg/dl), total cholesterol (191.61 ±18.61 mg/dl ' vs 182.61 ±17.6 mg/dl), LDL-C (113.12±1L0I mg/dl vs 102.69+11.17 mg/dl) and VLDL-C (34.03±2.03 mg/dl vs. 31.80±2.0 mg/dl) were higher in diabetic patients as compared to the control group, while HDL-C (43.39+6.41 mg/dl vs. 57.69±7.06 mg/dl) was lower as compared to the control group.Conclusion: Dyslipidemia is a significant finding in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients.

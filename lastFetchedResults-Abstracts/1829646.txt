This paper addresses the motion control problem of wheeled mobile robots as a class of nonholonomic systems. The proposed control method is based on fast terminal sliding mode control in which the control objective is trajectory tacking. In order to design a terminal sliding mode control for this class of systems, we use extended chained form of the wheeled mobile robot. The proposed method leads to finite time convergent tracking of nonholonomic systems. Simulation results show the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Background and Objective: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have been shown to be a feasible option for cell therapy. There is increasing evidence that BMSCs have the potential of differentiation into GABAergic like neuron cells (GLNCs) in vitro under appropriate induction protocols. GABAergic dysfunction is implicated in several neurological disorders. The present study provides evidence for an in vitro potential of BMSCs to transdifferentiate into GLNCs. 
Materials and Methods: BMSCs were collected from long bones of adult Sprague–Dawley rats, following three passages of cell culture, BMSCs were preinduced using 1 mM B-mercaptoethanol (BME) and 10 µM retinoic acid (RA), they were then induced by creatine 5 mM in different days as an inducer. In preinduction and induction stages, the effects of these inducers on differentiation of BMSCs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. 
Results: Our results indicated that after induction stage, a high percentage of GLNCs is expressed. According to GABAergic markers (GABA antibody), 5 mM creatine and 10 µM RA after 4 days had a prominent role on differentiation of BMSCs to GLNCs.
Conclusion: BME, RA and creatine induce differentiation of BMSCs into GLNCs.

In this paper, we consider a controller failure time analysis problem for a class of symmetric linear time-invariant (LTI) systems controlled by a pre-designed symmetric static output feedback. We assume that the controller fails from time to time due to physical or purposeful reason, and analyze stability and H<sub>&#8734;</sub> disturbance attenuation properties for the entire system. Our objective is to find conditions concerning controller failure time, under which the systemÂ´s stability and H<sub>&#8734;</sub> disturbance attenuation properties are preserved to a desired level. For both stability and H<sub>&#8734;</sub> disturbance attenuation analysis, we show that if the unavailability rate of the controller is smaller than a specified constant, then global exponential stability of the entire system and a reasonable H<sub>&#8734;</sub> disturbance attenuation level is achieved. The key point is to establish a common quadratic Lyapunov-like function for the case where the controller works and the case where the controller fails.

This paper describes an abstract framework for autonomous robot programming called GOLEM. The aim is to let a developer design the behaviour of a robot in accordance with a rational model, with the objective of mimicking human behaviour. GOLEM organises a robotÂ´s activities into goals and sub-goals, linked to one another through specific relationships. Execution of goals does not obey a pre-fixed sequence. Rather, the next goal to achieve is selected, each time, on the basis of an evaluation of its opportunity. This characteristic gives the robot a full awareness of the decision of which goal it should try to achieve, stressing and improving the concept of autonomy.

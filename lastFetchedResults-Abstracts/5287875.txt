In this paper, we extend the multi-objective bimatrix game in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Since determining payoffs is frequently depended on the judgment and intuition of the players in the game, we describe the payoff of each strategy in intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Then, an IFWAA operator is used to obtain the integral payoff matrices. Based on the score functions of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, we propose a non-linear programming model to find the mixed Nash equilibrium solution. An example is also provided to illustrate the procedure of the proposed method.

This paper reports on a battery-powered telemetric command receiver for electronic site selection in multichannel neural recording applications. The receiver selects seven recording sites from a total of 28 available sites, according to four pre-defined site-selection patterns, via a 1-MHz, 5-Kb/s, amplitude-shift-keyed (ASK) link. The seven selected sites can then be wirelessly monitored via a 100-MHz frequency-modulated (FM) link. The receiver also performs power management to increase battery service lifetime. A bidirectional wireless recording microsystem incorporating this receiver is fabricated on a 4.6times4.6-mm<sup>2</sup> chip using the AMI 1.5mum 2P2M n-well CMOS process. Design methodology and architecture of the receiver together with measurement results from its wireless analog front-end are presented

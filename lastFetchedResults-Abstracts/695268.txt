The objective of this work was to test a molecular genetic method for in situ monitoring of aerobic benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) biodegrading microorganisms. Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23DO) genes occur in bacteria that biodegrade benzene, toluene, xylenes, phenol, biphenyl, and naphthalene. A competitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QC-PCR) technique using a single set of primers specific for an entire subfamily of C23DO genes was recently developed. To determine whether bacteria containing these C23DO genes actually exist in environments contaminated by BTX, aerobic microcosms containing previously uncontaminated soil were amended with different aromatic hydrocarbons and DNA extracts were analyzed by QC-PCR for C23DO genes. Anaerobic microcosms were established to confirm that oxygen was also necessary for the enrichment of C23DO genes. Field testing was done at two sites undergoing monitored natural attenuation. In microcosm experiments naphthalene, m-xylene, and p-xylene strongly enriched for C23DO genes while benzene, toluene, and o-xylene produced only transient, weakly detectable genes. In the field study, C23DO genes were detected in groundwater samples contaminated with either xylenes or naphthalene. The results of this study demonstrated that molecular genetic techniques can provide an accurate and rapid method to detect microorganisms capable of aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. Such a technique would be useful for monitoring the effectiveness of aeration technologies and for documenting microbial processes for monitored natural attenuation.

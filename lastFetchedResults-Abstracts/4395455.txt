For a micro-grid, the voltage and frequency may fluctuate due to the switch on and off of heavy power loads. In order to relieve the potential fluctuations, the characteristics of the micro-grid are analyzed and a droop control based power control strategy of the energy storage system (ESS) in the micro-grid is proposed in this paper. By adjusting the active and reactive power injection of the ESS, the voltage and frequency can be regulated within acceptable ranges. The proposed scheme is then tested on a dynamic test micro-grid. The simulation result shows that the power control strategy can achieve the objective of stabilizing both voltage and frequency of the micro-grid.

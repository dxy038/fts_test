Objective
We investigated the comparative effects of resveratrol (trans-3,4′,5-trihydroxystilbene), trans-3,3′,5,5′tetrahydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene, and yuccaols A and C isolated from the bark of Yucca schidigera on oxidative stress in resting blood platelets and blood platelets activated by different agonists (thrombin or thrombin receptor activating peptide).
Methods and results
Tested phenolics (1–25 μg/mL) reduced, to different degrees, the level of reactive oxygen species measured by the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence and changed the production of O2− measured by the reduction of cytochrome c in resting blood platelets. They also inhibited the generation of free radicals in blood platelets activated by thrombin (P < 0.05) or thrombin receptor activating peptide (P < 0.05). Treatment of platelets with resveratrol or yuccaols A and C at the concentration of 25 μg/mL increased (statistically non-significant) the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in these cells (P > 0.05), whereas trans-3,3′,5,5′tetrahydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene and the alcohol yucca extract reduced lipid peroxidation in blood platelets (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
Resveratrol and other phenolic compounds from the bark of Yucca schidigera inhibiting free radical generation in blood platelets may be beneficial in protecting against cardiovascular diseases when hyperactivity of platelets is observed.

The AIEE board of directors has endorsed President HullÂ´s proposal for a constitutional convention of engineering societies toward the objective of establishing an appropriate joint national engineering organization &#8220;to deal with the social, economic, and professional problems common to all engineers,&#8221; and has taken action providing for the AIEE to participate in such a convention. This subject is believed to be of some direct concern to every member of the Institute. Its discussion by Section and other groups is suggested, so that membership opinion may evolve and Institute officers be guided accordingly. Comments are invited for the &#8220;Letters to the Editor&#8221; columns.

The paper is devoted to planning reasonable master production scheduling in complex supply chain system for companies with small batches and multi-items. A multi-objective scheduling optimization model is developed for improving the rates of Payment and Profit and efficiency, and determining the scheduling rules, the implementation plans, and dynamic optimization model. The model can be solved using DNA genetic algorithm. This method can resolve dynamic scheduling problems for the mixed-model assembly lines, and it has good prospects of application in scheduling on automobile assembly enterprise.

The paper considers the problem of a single batch scheduling problem whose processing times are fuzzy numbers. The objective is to minimize the sum of completion times. A batch processing machines can handle up to B jobs simultaneously. The processing time of a batch is equal to the longest processing time among the jobs in the batch. A rule that the optical batch schedule satisfies is given and two algorithms are presented.

The objective of this article is to compare two concurrent VSC-based topologies suitable to interconnect two MV distribution grids. These power-electronics-based devices must not only control the power flow between both grids, but also compensate for power quality phenomena. For this reason, size comparison is made separately according to the function that they develop. The first part of the paper establishes mathematical formulae to compare the sizing requirements of the UPLC and the MVDC when the objective is power flow control. The second part of the paper proposes guidelines and basic aspects that should be considered when addressing power quality compensation.

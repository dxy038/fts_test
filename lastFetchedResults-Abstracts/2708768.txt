The assurance of quality of experience (QoE) and provisioning of high throughput of the system represent the main goals of future wireless and mobile networks. This paper presents novel and practical cross-layer QoE-aware radio resource allocation (RRA) algorithms for the downlink of a heterogeneous orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system. The objective of the proposed algorithms is to assure the appropriate level of QoE for each user of the system by incorporating application-layer parameters and subjective human perception of quality into the RRA process. We propose two user-oriented joint subcarrier and power allocation algorithms with low complexity for real-time and interactive services. The first algorithm dynamically allocates resources by assuring the same level of QoE to all users of the system, whereas the second algorithm introduces the efficient trade-off between the user´s QoE and the spectral efficiency of the system. By considering application-layer parameters and user´s perception of quality, high users´ QoE and explicit control of data rates can be achieved. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithms achieve significant increase in the level of QoE compared to previous works, a fair distribution of capacity among users and near to optimal solution of QoE for the OFDMA system.

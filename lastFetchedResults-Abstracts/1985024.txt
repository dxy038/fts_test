An objective of workpackage 3 within the European Research Project “TRACE” was the identification of PCR markers for the detection of plant species related to honey. Within the project “Miel de Corse”, a protected designation of origin (PDO) honey and “Miel de Galicia”, a protected geographical indication (PGI) honey as well as German and English honeys were analysed. Beside the development of plant species specific real-time PCR systems a method has been established for the detection of DNA derived from plant species in general.

Focusing on the importance of identity formation during adolescence, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of identity status in using coping strategies in stressful situations, in visually handicapped adolescents. The data was collected from 96 visually impaired and sighted adolescents students, male and female, between 15-19 years old, in Tabriz, Maragheh and Tehran. The method was causal-comparative, using the tests: The Dellas Identity Status Inventory-Occupation, and Coping Inventory of Endler & Parker, and were analyzed via Multiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and t-test. The results showed that there are significant differences between identity status and coping strategies, in the visually handicapped group and sighted adolescents, but the gender was not significant.

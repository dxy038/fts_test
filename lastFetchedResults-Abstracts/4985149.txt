The determination of the optimum cable prestresses in the design of cable-stayed bridges is considered. At the bridge site, cable length adjustment is necessary to alter stress distribution and geometrical configuration of the bridge. To solve these problems fuzzy regression analysis has been successively applied for the construction of real cable-stayed bridges. An attempt is made to improve the method based on fuzzy regression by introducing the concept of satisfaction. The degree of satisfaction is defined in such a way that when the objective of a designer is completely achieved, the satisfaction degree is one, and when the objective is not achieved at all, the satisfaction degree is zero. To treat the satisfaction in the formulation, fuzzy mathematical programming is used, in which the satisfaction degree is reflected in the determination of membership functions for prestresses of cables and bending moments of structural members

Proposed is a robust algorithm for scaling registration of point sets, in the way of introducing the bidirectional distance measurement into the least square problem, which is solved in the way the iterative closest point algorithm does by iterations. At each iterative step of this algorithm, bidirectional correspondence is set up between two <i>m</i>-dimensional point sets, and then a simple and fast iterative algorithm is used to compute the rotation, scale and translation transformations. Experimental results demonstrate its robustness and high accuracy over previous algorithms.

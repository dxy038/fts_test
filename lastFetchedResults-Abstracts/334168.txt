Objective
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors.
Materials and methods
Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with Levovist was performed on 62 consecutive patients (53 with pancreatic cancer, four with islet cell tumor, three with inflammatory pancreatic tumor, and two with metastatic tumor). The vascular and perfusion image phases of the tumors were evaluated and compared with the findings of contrast-enhanced computed tomography.
Results
Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed tumor vessels around and/or in the tumor at the vascular image phase in 79% of pancreatic cancer patients (42/53). At the perfusion image phase, 96% of pancreatic cancers (51/53) were classified as hypoenhancement type. However, tiny spotty or irregular heterogeneous enhanced lesions were found in 84% of hypoenhanced pancreatic cancer patients (43/51). The presence of small vessels at the vascular image phase was closely correlated with the presence of these intratumor regional enhanced lesions at the perfusion image phase (Îº coefficient=.42). The sensitivity of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (100%) for pancreatic cancer was superior to that of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (91%), but no significant difference was observed between the two (McNemar test: P=.063).
Conclusion
Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with Levovist successfully visualizes fine vessels and enhancement in pancreatic tumors and is useful for evaluating pancreatic tumors.

patent's right charters according to official order of Health Ministry of Iran in 1381. Mean age (~SDJ of patients was
40.05(~ 13.06) and educational stand of about 50% of patients was less than high school. The patients were aware of
84 percent of questions about their knowledge and they mentioned 64% of their rights were considered at hospital.
Nevertheless only 30( 14%J patients had seen the patient's right charter before that time and only 13(6%J patients
had reed it this study showed that there is some weakness in performance of the patient's rights in hospital and also
notification about these rights was weak. In Some rights awareness of patients had obvious effect on its accomplishment

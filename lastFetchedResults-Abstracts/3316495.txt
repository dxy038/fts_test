This paper explores the role of digital and physical materiality in relation to the use of Fit bit activity tracking devices. Materiality concerns properties of a technology that transcend space, time, and particularities of the contexts. Our objective, in particular, is to examine how digital and physical properties may play a role in shaping user´s perception and actions around the use of Fit bit devices. The primary findings are (1) both digital and physical material properties of the device together provide a material framework, which constrains and enables users´ activities, and (2) both forms of materiality are contingent upon the design/form of the device. As a result the materiality of digital information cannot be studied without examining its entwining with the information technology that records, processes, shares, and represents it.

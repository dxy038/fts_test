To solve the problem of sub-contractor selection existing in the construction market, in this paper, the author constructs the selection model based on bilevel programming, in which the upper planning objective is to minimize the total cost of construction enterprises subcontracting and the lower planning objective is to maximize the quality of subcontractors service, and then the paper uses the genetic and double iterative algorithm to solve the model. Finally, according to research examples, it comparatively analyzes with different algorithms to verify the validity of the model, that is to say, when the sub-contractor selection is a long-term and repeated in stages, the bilevel programming model can be a good incentive for subcontractors to improve service quality, and reduce the service price.

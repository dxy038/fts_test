Background and Objective: The AIDS epidemic is considerably widespread
across the world, turning out to be an exigent problem. The aim of this study
was to assess the impact of educational intervention based on the Theory of
Planned Behavior (TPB) on the prevention of AIDS among health volunteers in
Sirjan County.
Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study in which 120 health volunteers
attending health centers in Sirjan city, were selected to participate in this study;
60 in the intervention group and 60 in the control group. The intervention was
conducted over three sessions for 60 minutes. Data were collected by a valid
and reliable 40-item questionnaire before intervention and three months after
the intervention. Data was analyzed by chi-square, Fisherâ€™s exact, paired t-test
and independent t-test.
Results: The average scores of both groups according to awareness level, attitude
toward behavior, functioning, behavioral intention, mental norms and
perceived behavioral control had no meaningful differences before the intervention.
But after educational intervention, the average scores of all variables
increased meaningfully in the intervention group (p < 0.001). But, there was no
increase or significant difference in the control group.
Conclusion: TPB was effective in educating health volunteers. Therefore, it is
suggested that TPB can be used in training AIDs-prevention behaviors.

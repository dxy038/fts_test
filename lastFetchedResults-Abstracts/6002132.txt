In this paper, decoupled neural fuzzy sliding-mode control design method for highly nonlinear systems is proposed. The decoupled control method provides a simple way to achieve asymptotic stability for a class of fourth-order nonlinear system into two second-order subsystems by a separate control objective expressed in terms of a sliding surface for each subsystems. Using the proposed method the second subsystem is successfully incorporated into the first one via a two-level decoupling strategy. In the controller design method, reaching mode and sliding mode control of sliding mode control is approximated based on neural network control and fuzzy logic control method respectively. Two simulation results of a cart-pole and ball-beam systems are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

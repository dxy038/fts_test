Efficiency of forced-air cooling processes is measured by process time and product temperature uniformity. Ventilated packaging is required to achieve a rapid and uniform cooling process. Product type, produce positioning and orientation and container venting have significant effects on airflow patterns. To optimize the design, airflow patterns and temperature distributions inside a ventilated package should be known. The objective of this study was to determine airflow patterns and temperature distribution in ventilated containers including stacked layers of spheres using computational fluid dynamics and turbulence model. Effects of flow dimensionality, turbulence intensity, mesh sensitivity, opening size and ratios for venting and air inflow rate were investigated. This study is expected to provide a better method for analyzing cooling performance of ventilated packages.

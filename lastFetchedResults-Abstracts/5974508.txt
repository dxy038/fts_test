In this contribution, we present a new Compton imaging algorithm developed for the DESPEC experiment. Its main objective is to optimize the imaging capabilities of the system composed by a set of Ge Double Side Strip Detectors (Ge-DSSD) coupled to AGATA, the Advanced Gamma Tracking Array, developed by a homonymous European collaboration. The imaging algorithm has been tuned to find the emission position of the detected &#947; rays in the specific configuration of the DESPEC experiment, where an active implantator will play the role of emission source in isomeric and beta decay experiments.

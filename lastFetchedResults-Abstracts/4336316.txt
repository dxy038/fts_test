This paper presents the implementation of the nonlinear security constrained optimal power flow - SCOPF problem solution based on distributed processing with the objective of real time application. The optimization problem is solved by the interior point method and the security constraints are considered by the use of Benders decomposition techniques. The parallel algorithm was implemented using the MPI - message passing interface system and was also integrated to an actual energy management system - EMS using the resources available on its distributed platform. Results obtained on a 16 dual-processed nodes Cluster of computers are presented for an actual Brazilian equivalent network composed of 3073 busbars, 4547 branches and 963 active and reactive controls, for a list of 700 contingencies. The results obtained demonstrate the high efficiency and applicability of the developed distributed tool at Control Centers for real time security control.

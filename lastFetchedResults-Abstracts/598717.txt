Problem statement: The objective of this study was to obtain the dying characteristics of the Jinda chili, a commonly grown variety in the Northeatern of Thailand, using the continuous fluidizedbed dryer in reducing moisture content of dried chili up to 13% wet basis as comparable to the dried chili in the market and to investigate the effect of drying temperature and drying air velocity. Approach: Drying characteristics was to study under varying conditions of drying temperature (50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100Â°C) and drying air velocity (4, 5 and 6 m sec-1). Results: The drying time decreased within the increasing of drying temperature and drying air velocity. Drying air velocity affected the drift and continuously moves of chili particle outward from dryer chamber under continuous fluidized-bed technique. The decreasing of moisture content effected with increasing of a compound capsaicin of dried chili compare to fresh chili. The diffusion coefficient of moisture content increased with increasing all drying temperature and drying air velocity. Conclusion: Drying temperature was the significant factor of the chili moisture content reduction. Drying air velocity affected the move of chili outward from chamber under the continuous fluidized bed drying process.

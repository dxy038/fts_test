The analogue component link equipment (ACLE) system for for transmission of component video signals is proving to be a popular and economic approach for electronic news gathering (ENG), and other mobile operations. The system was conceived from the requirement for equipment capable of transmitting analogue component signals down a single communications path. Current users have indicated that integral sound facilities would be desirable. If the audio can be encoded with the vision signal then additional audio equipment is not required and reception of coherent sound and vision is guaranteed. The objective therefore was to develop a dual channels sound system that would provide optimum quality for minimum complexity, size and cost. The author describes the development plan and preliminary system tests

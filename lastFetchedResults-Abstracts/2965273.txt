This paper presents new algorithms for yield enhancement of redundant memories. These algorithms are based on the technique of spare cutting for a redundant memory chip in which repair is implemented by row/column deletion. Different approaches are proposed: some of these approaches are based on a fully exhaustive process, while others try to heuristically reduce the computational overhead involved in determining the repair-solution of a redundant memory. Conditions for unidirectional and bidirectional cutting (i.e. cutting either along the rows and/or columns of the memory) are analyzed

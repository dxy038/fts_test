Inner-product calculations are often required in digital neural computing. The critical path of the inner product of two vectors is the carry propagation delay generated from individual product terms. In this work, a novel and high-speed realization of an inner-product processor for the multi-valued exponential bidirectional associative memory (MV-eBAM) is presented in order to reduce the carry propagation delay, wherein the treatment of inner product of two vectors is given. Notably, a systolic-like architecture of digital compressors is used to reduce the carry propagation delay in the critical path of the inner product of two vectors. The architecture we propose here might offer a sub-optimal solution for the digital hardware realization of the inner-product computation.

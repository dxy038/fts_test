Introduction &Objective: Studies contirm that a number of
nutritional and environmental lactors may negatively affect
spermatogenesis and cause male infertility. Carnitine is an
important lactor lor sperm motility. Carnitine deficiency
decreases sperm motility and may cause male infertility. The
~ aim of this study was to assess the effects of carnitine on
: sperm parameters in infertite males with idiopathic
~ asthenosperrnia.
: Materials & Methods: This study is a before and after
: clinical trial performed on 40 asthenosperrma men who were
: treated with 750 mg per/day carnitine in Fatemieh infertility
: research center in years 2006-2007. Sperm parameters

: data were analyzed using SPSS10 and paired T-test
KEYWORDS:

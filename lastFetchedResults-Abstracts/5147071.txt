A kind of distributed multi-objective optimization algorithm based on multi-agent is proposed in this paper, which is based on the theory of multi-objective optimization. Traditional multi-objective optimization is combined with agent technology in this algorithm. There are objective functions, cooperation algorithm and communication in each agent. Multi-agent system (MAS) is made up of agents. Coordination and communication between agents are used to implement multi-objective optimization computing. The validity of the proposed algorithm is testified by using actual optimal result

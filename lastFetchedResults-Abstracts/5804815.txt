A project whose objective was to provide an overview of built-in-test (BIT) considerations applicable to microwave systems, modules, and MMICs (monolithic microwave integrated circuits) is discussed. Available analytical techniques and software for assessing system failure characteristics were researched, and the resulting investigation provides a review of two techniques which have applicability to microwave systems design. A system-level approach to fault tolerance and redundancy management is presented in its relationship to the subsystem/element design. An overview of the microwave BIT focus from the Air Force Integrated Diagnostics program is presented. The technical reports prepared by the GIMADS team were reviewed for applicability to microwave modules and components. A review of MIMIC (millimeter and microwave integrated circuit) program activities relative to BIT/BITE is given

Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) aims at maximizing a population of customers which are located within a specified range of time or distance from some new servers which should be located. A number of extensions have been proposed for this problem, one of which is considering queuing constraints in the model. For an example, location of a limited number of servers in such a way as to maximize the covering considering the constraint regarding to the queue length. In this paper, we extend the proposed model by Correa and Lorena [3] which maximizes the covering. We consider a more objective function in such a way as to minimize the total distance between the servers and demand points. A genetic algorithm based heuristic is proposed to solve the model and results are compared with that of given by CPLEX as a standard solver to estimate the performance of the given algorithm.


Background: A paucity of data exists regarding the prevalence and relationship of hypomagnesaemia with clinical symptoms of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in pediatric patients.

Objective: In this study we evaluated the prevalence of magnesium (Mg) deficiency in pediatric patients with MVP syndrome and attempted to clarify the effect of Mg therapy on alleviating their symptoms.

Methods: The present study was conducted from April 2010 to January 2012, and included 230 patients (90 males and 140 females) with symptoms of mitral valve prolapse and mean age of 11.6Â±3.66. Serum magnesium (Mg) level less than 1.5 mg/dl was defined as hypomagnesaemia. Patients with 2 mm leaflet displacement and maximum leaflet thickness of 5 mm in echocardiography were considered to have classic MVP, while those with leaflet thickness less than 5 mm were considered as non-classic MVP. Patients with hypomagnesaemia were orally treated with 4.5 mg/kg/day Mg chloride for 5 weeks followed by re-evaluation of symptoms of chest pain, palpitation, fatigue and dyspnea.

Results: Hypomagnesaemia was found in 19 (8.2 %) of 230 patients with mitral valve prolapse. The re-evaluation of patients with Hypomagnesaemia after 5 weeks of Mg therapy, showed statistically significant relief of chest pain (P=0.01). However, no significant changes was detected in regard to palpitation (P=0.06), fatigue (P= 0.5) and dyspnea (P=0.99).

Conclusion: This study revealed that the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia in pediatric patients with mitral valve prolapse is relatively low compared to adults, but treatment with oral Mg in patient with hypomagnesaemia decreases chest pain.

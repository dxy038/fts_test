Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare arterial stiffness in long-term users of estrogen who were postmenopausal, age-matched women who did not use estrogen, and women of fertile age. Study Design: In this clinical cross-sectional study, carotid, femoral, and aortic stiffness (estimated as elastic modulus and stiffness β index) were assessed by ultrasonic phase-locked echo-tracking in 17 women who were postmenopausal and who were treated with 17 β-estradiol implants (mean age, 68.8 years; mean duration of treatment, 20 years), 17 age-matched (±1 year) untreated women, and 20 women in the fertile age period. Results: Compared with women of fertile age, both postmenopausal groups had significantly higher stiffness elastic modulus and stiffness β index (carotid, P < .001; femoral, P < .05; aorta, P < .001). However, for all 3 arteries, both stiffness indices were similar in estrogen users and nonusers and did not differ significantly. These results remained after an adjustment for systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Conclusion: These data indicate that the arterial stiffening that is related to aging/menopause is not substantially affected by long-term estrogen therapy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:189-94.)

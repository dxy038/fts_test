Concerns about the environment and green energy brings a huge development opportunity to plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). PEVs have an outlook to enhance the functionalities of the power grid. Using PEVs, lets us feed power from the vehicleÂ´s battery packs back to the grid or to pull power from the grid to recharge the batteries. It means that we have a bidirectional flow of power between the vehicle and the grid. PEVs improves the social welfare by reducing the customer costs. The most important point in using a vehicle to grid (V2G) is to evaluate the behavior of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PEV) owners and estimate their acceptance facing the demand side managements programs (DSM). In this paper, a mathematical model is presented for evaluating the reaction of PEV owners in response to electricity price. This method allows the utilities to have a short term scheduling in order to balance the available power and demand utilizing the PEVs.

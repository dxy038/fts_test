Master Logic Diagram (MLD) depicts the interrelationships among the independent functions and dependent support functions. Using MLD, the manner in which all functions, sub-functions interact to achieve the overall system objective can be investigated. This paper reports a probabilistic model to analyze an MLD by translating the interrelationships to a graph model. The proposed model uses the flow-graph concept and Moment Generating Function (MGF) to analyze the dependency matrix representing the MLD with embedded self-healing function/sub-functions. The functions/sub-functions are featured by failure detection and recovery mechanisms. The newly developed model provides the probability of the system failure, and system mean and standard deviation time to failure in the MLD. An illustrative example is demonstrated to present the application of the model.

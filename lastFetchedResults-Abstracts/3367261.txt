Broadband satellite systems are an integral part of communications technology, aiming to provide a wide range of services to a society that increasingly expects ubiquitous access to broadband telecommunication services. Key drivers behind the development of these systems include rapid growth in the use of the Internet, PC- and TV-based e-commerce and interactive broadcasting services. In the UK, broadband satellite service trials are currently being conducted by BT, amongst others, with a primary objective of providing services to areas where asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) technology has not been deployed. Two key factors for the success of broadband satellite technology lie in the area of overcoming constraints associated with frequency spectrum and orbital resources. This paper provides a review of technologies employed in geostationary (GSO) and nongeostationary (NGSO) satellite networks designed for the provision of broadband services to fixed and portable ground terminals within the 12 to 30 GHz frequency range. After reviewing the system design parameters related to the use of the radio frequency spectrum, consideration is given to the issues involved in sharing spectrum between GSO and NGSO satellite networks

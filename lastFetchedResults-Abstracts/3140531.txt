Focusing on the limitation of single information, multiple information fusion technology shall be used to obtain the description of edge information of objective scene to the utmost. Multi-source information fusion is utilized in this paper to mainly research how to fuse multi-image information so as to achieve the stable extraction of image edge feature. An improvement of robust Fisher dimension reduction method is put forward and elaborated in this paper.

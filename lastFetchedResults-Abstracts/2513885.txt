Objective (s): According to estimates in 2010, approximately 273000 pedestrian in the world lost their lives due to traffic accidents. Studies have shown that the majority of traffic accidents related to pedestrians, particularly in high-income countries occurred in urban areas and More deaths from traffic accidents in densely populated cities in the world is attributed to pedestrians. Because of the importance of choosing a suitable method for the detailed study of traffic accidents related to pedestrians, this review was conducted to compare different methods and reviews and also determination the strengths and weaknesses of each of these methods.
Methods: in this review study we used exist data and evidences based on searching in electronic databases. All studies found entered in endnote software and based on study goals we extract different methods and analysis used to crashes related to the pedestrians.
Results: History of traffic accidents related to pedestrians back to the 1980s. During the 1990s, new methods such as GIS and statistical models used in the study of traffic accidents related to pedestrians. During these years, several studies using GIS and statistical models were used. In recent years, due to the advances obtained in various applications, the researchers in the field of traffic accidents related to pedestrians have been studied using modern and advanced methods and by combining various techniques provided the grounds to identify more precisely effective factors on spread and severity of traffic accidents related to pedestrians.
Conclusion: there are various methods for the study of pedestrian accidents and injuries and in the recent years, methods for analysis of this type of injuries have had more evolution. In light of recent developments, in terms of methodology and software, problems in identifying the causes of this type of injuries more decreased and events and new insights in this field is obtained.

Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin which can be produced in cereal grains infected by Fusarium Head Blight (FHB). Alteration of DON by the plant often involves conjugation of the respective mycotoxin to certain functional groups or molecules. Conjugation of DON with glucose results in Deoxynivalenol-3-β-d-glucopyranoside (D3G), which has been found to be the main DON metabolite in wheat. The objective of this research was to identify the fate of D3G and DON during wheat processing using LC–MS–MS and GC, respectively. There was an approximate reduction of 61.8% in the detected DON level of the flour compared to the whole wheat. DON levels detected during the fermentation stage were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the mixed dough. D3G detected in the flour was 23.7% lower than detected in the whole wheat. There were no significant differences (P < 0.05) in the D3G detected in the dough samples. However, the baked bread had significantly (P < 0.05) less D3G detected than the dough. Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of enzyme hydrolysis on DON detection in whole wheat. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) between the wheat treated with α-amylase, cellulase, protease, and xylanase. DON detection levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher after treatment with protease (16%) and xylanase (39%) compared to the wheat composite. These results suggest that DON may be bound or embedded to the cell wall matrix or protein component of the wheat kernel due to the rise in detection of DON after these enzyme treatments.

Inroduction & Objective: A feeding trial was conducted to examine the effects of dietary supplementation of lysine and methionine on growthperformance and haemato-biochemical status in beluga, Huso huso.  
Materials and Methods: 240 fish with average weight of 144.6 Â± 4.64 g were fed one of four the experimental soy protein based diets D0 (without lysine or methionine supplementation), D1 (lysine supplementation alone), D2 (methionine supplementation alone) and D3 (both lysine and methionine supplementation) were fed to triplicate groups for 12wk. L-Lysine and DL-methionine were added to the diets containing 344 g kg-1 soybean meals at 12.02 and 12.94 g kg-1 of dry diet respectively. 
Results: Significant higher weight gain, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, condition factor, feed efficiency ratio, haemoglobin concentration, white blood cell and total blood protein were observed in fish fed soya protein-based diet supplemented with both lysine and methionine than that of fish of other dietary groups.  There were no significant differences among fish fed diet supplemented with either methionine or lysine. Growth performances, feed utilization and haemato-biochemical status of fish fed control diet was significantly lower than those of fish fed diet supplemented both lysine and methionine and supplemented with either methionine or lysine. 
Conclusion: The present study showed that soybeen meal could be included in the beluga diet up to 344 g kg-1, to replace 40% of fishmeal supplemented both lysine and methionine without any adverce effect on the growth performances and feed utilization.

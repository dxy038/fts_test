A several cycles of design-verification-modification are needed during traditional design, which is very time-consuming. Topology optimization is rapidly expanding in the recent years in the field of structural mechanics. Currently it is widely applied to structural design. The combination of topology optimization and sizing and/or shape optimization has been adopted for flight vehicle structural design, which results possible better designs. In the paper, continuum structural topology optimizations as well as size optimization are combined for a folding wing structural design. A structure optimization problem is established using Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method, it consists of the thickness variable of the skin and the relative element density variables of the tip part of the folding wing. The design objective is to minimize the compliance of the whole structure, and the constraints are structural mass constraints and stress constraints. The problem was solved based on commercial software package HyperWorks&#8482;. The resulting design shows that a new tip structure which satisfies the requirements of stiffness and strength was reconstructed.

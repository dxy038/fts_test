Wheeled mobile robot is one of the well-know nonholonomic system. Uncertainty of the robot influences the robotic performance of tracking control. A two-wheeled self-balance robot is taken as the research objective. Using the control Lyapunov function (CLF), the system stability has been proven. Through the data fusion of output information of accelerometer, odometric and gyroscope, its disturbance was decreased in the course of the tracking control and the real-time control characteristics were enhanced. The simulation result indicated that the wheeled mobile robot tracking can be effectively controlled through the data fusion of sensor information. There was good effect in the actual experiments

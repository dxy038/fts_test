Objective: This study evaluated rat knee joint development and the role of cell death in knee joint cavity formation.
Materials and Methods: l08 right rat limbs of 13-19 days old embryos were selected, fixed, serial sectioned about 5-15 ÂµM thicked after tissue procsesing and stained with hematoxiline 8- eosin, alcine blue and phosphatasc acid. All slides were studied with light microscopy.
Results: Limb buds protruded on the 13th day of development. Separation primary and end parts of the limb bud by two circular constrictions and hemogen, compact cell mesenchyme without vessels condense on the 14th day of development, have able been observed.
In the 16 day-old embryo, the primary circular constriction became a 3 layer interzone which has 2 compact cellular layers in the lateral side and one noneompact cellular layers in the middle. More dead cells were seen in the middle zone. In the 17 and 18 day-old embryos, the death of cells were seen in the surface of the femur and tibia bones.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that knee joint cavity formation after programmed cell death can be observed in interzone, but no main factor induced this phenomenon were determined.

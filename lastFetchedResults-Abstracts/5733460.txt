Radial pulse signal analysis is an extensively explored diagnostic tool in traditional Indian as well as Chinese school of medicine. Objective examination of radial pulse signal and effect on its temporal domain characteristics features, as a result of activities conducted on healthy individuals have been evaluated. Radial pulse analysis, using pulse peak-peak variability-basis, on lines similar to heart rate variability, has been performed. Analysis of radial pulse signal for extracting respiration, thermoregulation and auditory perception related rhythms, prominently visible in HRV spectrum, has been attempted and results compare well with those reported from HRV analysis. Effects of posture change on pulse signal, have also been examined.

A fast and effective service restoration algorithm allowing multi-tier or system-wide switching and capacitor control actions is developed for large-scale, radial distribution networks. The service restoration problem is formulated as a constrained multiple-objective optimization problem. A solution algorithm designed to consider networks with predominately manual switches is developed which utilizes information calculated from three-phase power flow analysis to restore as much priority and total load as possible while requiring a minimal number of control actions and amount of geographic travel distance. Simulation results are presented for a 399 bus distribution network and compared to a service restoration algorithm which avoids multi-tier switching

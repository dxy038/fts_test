ackground: The relationship between self-concept and academic achievement has been much discussed in psychological literature. Study the effect of self-regulation strategies training on the self-concept and mathematic academic achievement has also been of researchers' concern.  
Objective: the aim of this study was to determine the effect of self-regulation strategies training on the self-concept and mathematic academic achievement of the third grade students in Arak guidance schools. 
Method: A sample of 69 students (including 2 classes), selected through multi-phase random selection, was assigned to both experimental and control groups. An Ahlovalia self-concept pretest was administered to both groups and the scores of mathematics from formative assessment during the first 45 days of the semester were considered as pretest scores. Then, the experimental group attended to self-regulation strategies training for 12 sessions, but the control group received no training. Finally, both groups were administered Ahlovalia self-concept post-test, and the scores of mathematics from formative assessment during the three months strategies training were considered as post-test scores mathematics. 
Results: The data were analyzed through MANOVA. The results showed that self-regulation strategies training significantly increased the self-concept and the mathematic academic achievement of the subjects at p=0/01 level. Also, self-regulation strategies training positively affected all sub-scales related to self-concept except the behavior subscale.
Conclusion: training self-regulation strategies can be an appropriate action in order to increase students' self-concept and their mathematic academic achievement respectively

In this paper, we present a new spatial error concealment algorithm with dynamic texture estimation and geometric interpolation. First, we apply a variant version of dynamic programming to image pixels around a corrupted image region. It dynamically estimates the texture in a corrupted image region. With the best estimated texture, lost pixels are recovered by the geometric interpolation. We apply the texture estimation and geometric interpolation to the pixel sequences from the upper and lower of the lost region, the pixel sequences from the left and the right of the lost region, the pixel sequences from the upper and the left of the lost region, and pixel sequences from the lower and the right of the lost region. Then, the best result is selected based on the set up criterion and use it for error concealment. From experimental results, the proposed spatial error concealment provides the enhancement of the dynamic capability in capturing the image texture as well as subjective and objective quality improvement of concealment results in recovering the corrupted region of images comparing to the previous works.

Pain management has become a serious concern for Romanian doctors. Pain is the most frequent reason why patients come in ED. The objective of this study was to assess pain after treating it with Paracetamol, Tramadol, Fentanyl and combinations of these drugs. Their beneficial effects and minor side effects that appear in the patients treated with opioids should confirm our trust in using them as analgesics. 22% of the patients that took part in the study received other treatments as well for their associated pathological conditions (HA, IMA, AOMI), but these did not influence the main effects of the analgesics.

The wide frequency ranges and complex vehicle structures which must be considered in automotive EMC analysis result in frequency responses containing large numbers of resonant features. This makes the validation of numerical models by simple visual comparison of measured and computed results extremely difficult. A more quantitative approach based on the analysis of feature amplitude, frequency and &#8220;Q&#8221; factor has been found to be of benefit in providing objective figures of merit which can be used to rank such correlations. These techniques may also be applied to the assessment of experimental repeatability and the optimization of numerical models

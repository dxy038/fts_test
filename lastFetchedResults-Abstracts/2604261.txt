Reservoir operation is one of the most important tasks of water resources management.
Genetic algorithm (GA) as a robust approach can be presented as optimization
technique in recent years. In this paper application of GA in optimization of reservoir
operation (in three cases) has been introduced. Water supply for agriculture and
domestic use and hydro-power plant were the objective function of the model. Results
of the model for three cases were compared to each other. The most suitable case was
introduced.

Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the fastest growing diagnostic imaging procedures. Rapid advances in imaging technologies in conjunction with their widening adoption are some of the issues that are compelling healthcare providers to restructure their systems as they seek to offer a higher quality of care to a growing volume of patients. This paper presents the application of simulation to facilitate the planning of a new CT facility for a hospital. The objective of the study was to evaluate how patient experience would be impacted by proposed design options. Waits for service were utilized as a parameter to quantify the patients´ quality expectations, and hence the satisfaction derived from the healthcare services received. This study was also intended to clarify whether an additional CT-scan unit was a necessity to improving the patients´ experience.

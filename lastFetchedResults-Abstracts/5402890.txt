Identifying possible viral-host protein-protein interactions is an important and useful approach in developing new drugs targeting those interactions. In this article, a recently published dataset containing records of interactions between a set of HIV-1 proteins and a set of human proteins has been analyzed using association rule mining. The main objective is to identify a set of association rules among the human proteins with high confidence. The well-known Apriori algorithm has been utilized for discovering the association rules. Moreover, we have predicted some new viral-human interactions based on the discovered association rules.

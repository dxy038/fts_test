In the near future, many conventional video applications are likely to be replaced by immersive video to provide a sense of ldquobeing there.rdquo This transition is facilitated by the recent advancement of 3D capture, coding, transmission, and display technologies. Stereoscopic video is the simplest form of 3D video available in the literature. ldquoColor plus depth maprdquo based stereoscopic video has attracted significant attention, as it can reduce storage and bandwidth requirements for the transmission of stereoscopic content over communication channels. However, quality assessment of coded video sequences can currently only be performed reliably using expensive and inconvenient subjective tests. To enable researchers to optimize 3D video systems in a timely fashion, it is essential that reliable objective measures are found. This paper investigates the correlation between subjective and objective evaluation of color plus depth video. The investigation is conducted for different compression ratios, and different video sequences. Transmission over Internet protocol (IP) is also investigated. Subjective tests are performed to determine the image quality and depth perception of a range of differently coded video sequences, with packet loss rates ranging from 0% to 20%. The subjective results are used to determine more accurate objective quality assessment metrics for 3D color plus depth video.

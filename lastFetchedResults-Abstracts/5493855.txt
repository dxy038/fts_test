In this paper, a novel level-based hardware/software partitioning heuristic has been proposed. The algorithm operates on functional blocks of designs represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAG), with the objective of minimizing the processing time under various hardware area constraints. In most existing methods, the communication overhead and the fact that the vertices mapped onto the same computing unit have less communication, is overlooked during the partitioning decision, while the proposed algorithm considers this fact during partitioning.

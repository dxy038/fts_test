The concept of the intelligent engine is a generically derived solution which can be applied to any type of engine. The engine performs complex functions, from the operation of a vehicle to that of a complete factory. By making measurements which relate the specific to the global, it is possible to use the concept of data fusion to give an understanding of the engine and in turn create new knowledge. The specific engine chosen for this programme is the combustion engine. The objective is to make measurements which increase understanding of both the temporal and spatial evolution of the high speed, pressure and temperature within the combustion environment. There are three major challenges: (1) to make measurements in an extremely hostile region; (2) to make multi-sensor measurements which map simultaneously the local and global performance of the engine; this will be done with three levels of sensor: a local probe, a distributed measurement and a bulk properties measurement; (3) data fusion methodology will be used to create general rules taken from a wide range of industrial examples to design sensors, evaluate results and create a generic model of the process. The data fusion model could then be used as part of a reverse engineering tool to create a family of intelligent engines

A multiuser detection based on quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) with Pareto optimality is proposed for the space-time block coded-multicarrier code-division multiple-access (STBC-MC-CDMA) system. Due to the spatial diversity, the signals received at the different antennas are faded independently, resulting in an independent log-likelihood function (LLF) for each antenna. To resolve the multi-objective dilemma when choosing one signal estimation for multiple receive-antenna-branches, each quantum particle updates its value in a Pareto optimal way. Simulations and comparisons with the QPSO and the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

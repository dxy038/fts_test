Objective
To invetigate image preference after photodynamic therapy (PDT).
Deign
Propective, cro-ectional tudy.
Method
eventeen patient with neovacular age-related macular degeneration were teted by color viion, contrat enitivity, and near viual acuity (VA) with poitive image and negative image before, 1 week after, and 3 month after PDT.
Reult
Before PDT, 13 patient (76%) preferred poitive image; the difference wa not ignificant (P < .04). One week after PDT, 16 patient (94%) preferred negative image. The average near VA improved to 27 letter on poitive image and to 32 letter on negative image (P < .00001). Three month after PDT, near VA declined to 19 letter on poitive image and to 26 letter on negative image (P < .000001). Color viion and contrat enitivity remained contant during all examination.
Concluion
Although PDT may not alter the neuroenory retina, it may affect intraretinal function by changing image preference.

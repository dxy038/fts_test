The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy to predict starch pasting properties in barley flour samples. A total of 180 barley flour samples sourced from the University of Adelaide germplasm collection, harvested over three seasons (2009, 2010 and 2011) were analysed using both ATR-MIR and the rapid visco analyser (RVA) techniques. Calibrations (n = 100) were developed using partial least squares (PLS1) regression and full cross validation. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the standard error in cross validation (SECV) were 0.74 (SECV = 875 RVU) for peak viscosity (PV), 0.63 (SECV = 561 RVU) for trough (THR), 0.80 (SECV = 173 RVU) for breakdown (BRK), 0.74 (SECV = 126 RVU) for setback (STB), 0.77 (SECV = 679 RVU) for final viscosity (FV), and 0.73 (SECV = 0.57 s) for time to peak (TTP). The RPD values (SD/SEP) from the validation indicated that only BRK can be accurately predicted (RPD = 4). We have demonstrated that ATR-MIR spectroscopy has the potential to significantly reduce analytical time and cost during the analysis of barley flour for starch pasting properties.

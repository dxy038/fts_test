Abstract

Background and Objective:  With the development of human societies,  the needs for different types of health services are increasing. Because of limitations and shortage of national resources, the awareness of health administrators about appropriate allocation of resources leads to efficient use of assets. The aim of this study was to measure the workload and efficacy of nursing staff in internal ward.
Material and Methods: This descriptive and cross sectional study was conducted on, via census sampling, all nursing activities  performed by 10 nurses for 94 patients in Panje-Azar Hospital of Gorgan.  To determine the efficacy, we asked the subjects to fill out a researcher made, validated questionnaire and measured the time of their presence in the ward. Data analysis was performed by analysis variance, using SPSS-16 software. 
Results: Of   total time of presence,   20.3% is spent for documentary activities whereas only 0.49% for patient education. Overall, the spent time for direct and indirect nursing activities is 46.46% and 53.54%, respectively. The efficacy of nursing staff is 62%,  the highest (66.6  %) for morning shift and the lowest for night shift (58.34  %). There is no significant difference, using analysis variance, in efficacy rates of work shifts  (morning, evening and night).
Conclusion: In spit of efficacy of over 50 percent in different shifts, the educational programs related to time management, human resource development and electronic nursing are necessary to increase the efficacy.

This report outlines the management of a 30-year-old man with severe multiresistant mycobacterium tuberculosis of his right lung. Despite medical therapy he had open tuberculosis with positive sputum smears. A right pneumonectomy was undertaken, but due to distorted hilar anatomy, the superior vena cava was resected. Postoperatively, superior vena cava syndrome developed and failure of venous drainage was demonstrated by bilateral arm venography and computed tomographic scanning. The superior vena cava syndrome was successfully relieved using an aortic homograft as a superior vena cava replacement instead of a spiral vein graft or a prosthetic conduit.

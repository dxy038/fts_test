This paper outlines recent developments in optical remote sensing of Landsat TM data for air quality monitoring for atmospheric particulate matter having a diameter less than 10-micro meter (PM10). The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the developed algorithm and suitability of remote sensing data for PM10 mapping. We used a DustTrak Aerosol Monitor 8520 to collect in situ data. The PM10 data were collected simultaneously during the satellite Landsat overpass the study area. An algorithm has been developed based on the optical aerosol characteristic in the atmosphere to estimate PM10 over Penang Island, Malaysia. The digital numbers were determined corresponding to the ground-truth locations for each band and then converted to radiance and reflectance values. The atmospheric reflectance values was extracted from the satellite observed reflectance values subtracters by the amount given by the surface reflectance. The surface refleatance values were retrieved using ATCOR2 in the PCI Geomatica 9.1 image processing software. The atmospheric reflectance values were later used for PM10 mapping using the calibrated algorithm. Results from this research have indicated that PM10 data have positive correlation with atmospheric reflectance in two visible bands (Red and Blue band). Finally, the map of pollution concentration generated from the satellite image using the proposed algorithm to illustrate spatial distribution pattern of air pollution for the study area. The proposed algorithm produced high correlation coefficient, R, and low root-mean-square, RMS, values. The concentrations of PM10 are high in the industrial zones and urban areas of Penang, Malaysia.

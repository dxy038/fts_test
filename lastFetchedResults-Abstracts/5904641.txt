A task-given-type examination is a name coined by us to identify a method of school examination. In this method: (1) a group of questions is provided to students with enough time in advance before examination; and (2) an appropriate number of questions are randomly selected from these questions to form the actual examination conducted on the examination day. We experimented with this method in our class of Management System Design in Aoyama Gakuin University. Our objective was to know the characteristics of this method. The questionnaires conducted before and after the examination revealed some facts, such as that the majority of students had a favorable impression of the examination, and that the students could prepare effectively in a shorter period of time than in a normal type of examination.

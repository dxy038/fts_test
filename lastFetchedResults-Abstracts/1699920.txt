Detailed stress analyses of complicated engineering composite structures are computationally challenging due to the complexities of the microstructure. In this study, the primary objective is to close this gap by bringing high computational efficiency and scalability of MapReduce to the stress analysis problem. A new multi-goal MapReduce that extends the popular MapReduce programming model to multi-goal computations is proposed and combined with global/local analysis method to develop an efficient global/multi-local stress analysis strategy. The proposed approach is finally applied to the multi-phase and multi-layer plain weave composite laminate structure. The computational results are finally compared with the results of direct finite element computation and traditional global/local analysis in single node.

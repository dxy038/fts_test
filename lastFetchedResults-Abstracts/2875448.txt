Reliability is one of the most important parameters of dependability. It is addressed whenever we want reliable, available and safe systems. Indeed, reliability acts on the availability and security of systems. It must be considered throughout the overall life cycle of the product or system (design, manufacturing, operation). The objective of this communication is to build an overall approach of reliability for mechatronic systems since they are complex and multi-technology integrating several properties such as: dynamic, hybrid, reconfigurable, and interactive.

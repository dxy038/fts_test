A 10-kH and 100K ECL compatible field programmable array logic IC with 3.6-ns propagation delay and 1.0-W power dissipation has been developed. The device is organized as 12 inputs, 64 product terms, four outputs, and four bidirectional I/Os. The device also features the ability to complement the output by programming the polarity. To facilitate field programming and testing, an on-chip PLA causes the device to emulate a TTL compatible 2048/spl times/1-bit PROM, and the PLA is also used to control the device in test modes of operations to enhance the testability. The excellent speed-power performance has been realized by use of an oxide-isolated dual-layer metal process and an optimized circuit design.

The present paper is based on the question of the place of public diplomacy in America’s Middle East policy with a focus on the Presidency of Obama. It was hypothesized that public diplomacy always had great importance in America's foreign policy toward the Middle East. Since the Bush administration's foreign policy legacy for Obama was a poor public image of the United States among Muslims and in the Middle East, Obama introduced the recovery of America’s soft management in the Middle East as one of the pillars of his change strategy. For example, in Obama's Middle East policy towards the Islamic Awakening, although the main objective is still presenting American values and ideas, there is a change of approach. The same goal is pursued not through the war of ideas as in the Bush era, but through the logic of symbolic multilateralism with an emphasis on interests, where they claim to advocate values such as democracy and popular demands.

Technological advancement in IC- manufacturing continues to increase in demand of about 8-10% per year. Due to continued and rapid growing market for IC industry, extension of semiconductor manufacturing sites wafer fabrication (fab) is necessary. Large-scale firms have to transfer the manufacturing technology from one country to another in order to save cost. One of key issues for the firms is to make sure the most efficient and practical way for technology transfer. The objective of this research is to propose a systematical analysis methodology for international intra-firm technology transfer in the IC-industry. This paper utilizes an international case study on a recent technology transfer in the IC industry. A set of key performance index (KPIs) are defined to measure the grade of success of the project management. This study uses KPIs evaluation of the technology transfer project setup success key factors (SKFs) and process. We combine the literature review, interview expert and project management to construct individual KPIs of technology transfer project. Technology transfer is closely related to knowledge transfer. ItÂ´s a time limited transaction and is treated as a project. A structured and organized procedure with dedicated teams at the sending and receiving site is necessary. The &#8220;copy smart&#8221; methodology is applied in this case study. The findings of this study suggest further improvements for technology transfer projects can be made by locating the project leader at the receiving site in order to have better control.

Increasing wheat production area due to some environmental limitations is not a possible strategy. Thus, only rational is to enhance the yield per/hec. The objective of this study was to measure the technical efficiency of wheat growers and to identify the inhibiting factors for yield increase under irrigated wheat of Ilam province. This study employs a tranlog frontier production to examine and estimate technical inefficiency of Ilam wheat farmers. The results showed that the average technical efficiency level is %78. Also, wide dispersion of land units is recognized as a preventing factor in wheat production. The results also indicated that with increasing of farmers' experience, technical inefficiency can be decrease and wheat farmers may use inputs more efficiently. There is significant and positive relationship between increasing wheat technical efficiency and farmers' experience.

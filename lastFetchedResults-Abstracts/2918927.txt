As the complexity of aircraft systems is increased and performance requirements become more demanding the use of parallel processing to implement the basic control functions within very short sample times is now essential. Reliability of such systems is a primary concern as the shutdown of a controller for even a fraction of a second can result in the loss of an aircraft and pilot. Software for monitoring and safety checking of such systems is a major burden on the control computers and currently there is not enough free processor time within the sample period to perform all of the desired monitoring on engines presently in operation. Further, it is envisaged that, in future engines with more complex geometry the monitoring task will be formidable. The paper describes a project in collaboration with Rolls-Royce Military Aero-Engines (Bristol) investigating the use of Inmos Transputers in gas turbine engine control. A main objective of the work is to produce a fault tolerant High Integrity Computer module for gas turbine engine control

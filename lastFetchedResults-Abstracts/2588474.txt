Design, simulation and optimal selection of cosine-linear frequency modulation waveform (CNLFM) based on correlated ambiguity function (AF) method for the purpose of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is done in this article. The selected optimum CNLFM waveform in contribution with other waveforms are applied directly into a SAR image formation algorithm (IFA) and their quality effects performance in comparison to each other is analyzed. The quality performance analysis includes both the qualitative AF diagrams and the objective image quality metrics assessments. Then, by changing the SAR system parameters based on the proposed CNLFM waveform, other quality metrics are also derived. The simulation results verifies the robustness of the proposed CNLFM waveform implementation as a suitable NLFM alternative for LFM waveform.

A promising and shortly emerging energy supply chain network based on residential-scale microgeneration through micro combined heat and power systems is proposed, modeled and optimized in this work. Interchange of electrical energy can take place among the members of this domestic microgrid, which is connected to the main electrical grid for potential power interchange with it. A mathematical programming framework is developed for the operational planning of such energy supply chain networks. The minimization of total costs (including microgeneration systemâ€™s startup and operating costs as well as electricity production revenue, sales, and purchases), under full heat demand satisfaction, constitutes the objective function in this study. Additionally, an alternative microgrid structure that allows the heat interchange within subgroups of the overall microgrid is proposed, and the initial mathematical programming formulation is extended to deal with this new aspect. An illustrative example is presented in order to highlight the particular significance of selecting a proper optimization goal that thoroughly takes into account the major operational, technical and economic driven factors of the problem in question. Also, a number of real-world size case studies are used to illustrate the efficiency, applicability and the potential benefits of the microgeneration energy supply chain networks suggested in this study. Finally, some concluding remarks are drawn and potential future research directions are identified.

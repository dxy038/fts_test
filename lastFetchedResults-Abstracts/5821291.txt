Presents a system for panel-discussion conferencing over ATM networks. Recent studies of B-ISDN and ATM-LANs point to their potential for various communication applications. These networks are especially suited for real-time multimedia information communication using video, audio and data. With our new conference system, group communication for conference service is provided through various ATM connections. This paper first outlines the system. It goes on to describe the system architecture and configuration. The systemÂ´s main features are also presented. The system uses ATM connections effectively to allow all members to participate in a conference as much as they desire. Multimedia processing enables a strong bidirectional connection among the panel group members. The floor group members are linked with a weak unidirectional connection. Thus, network traffic can be decreased by using asymmetrical connections or unidirectional connections between participant terminals and the communication server

The epizootic diseases could be considered as most important threats in hatchery and cultured Ornamental fish farms that may faced with mortality occurrence and economic lost. Viral Nervous Necrosis (VNN) was emerging disease and approved in Golden grey mullet of the Caspian Sea in recent years. Study on histopathology changes of some important ornamental fish such as Guppy, Zebra, Oscar and Gold fish to acute virus of VNN was main objective in this research that carried out in Virology Lab of Inland Water Aquaculture Institute in Aug.2010. So after adaptation period challenge affaires were done on them with supernatant of affected mullet fish with Bath challenge and Intravitreous injection in Guppy and zebra fish and I.P method in Oscar and Gold fish. Then all exposed fish were investigates and mortality cases and clinical signs were recorded daily. Suspected samples were taken from affected fish with abnormal swimming behavior, lethargy, exophthalmia and skin darkening and then delivered to laboratory for histopathology and Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT). In comparison of control group, some histopathological lesions such as edema, inflammation, hyperemia, necrosis and pyknotic in nuclear of cells and clear vacuolation were observed in brain tissue and less than in retina. Also, IFAT findings approved completely mentioned histopathology results. Therefore it could be concluded that mentioned ornamental fish species could be sensitive to acute virus of VNN

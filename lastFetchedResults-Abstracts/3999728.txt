A novel low-cost coaxial-type single transistor outline-can (TO-can) bidirectional optical subassembly (BOSA) using an all passive alignment BOSA platform and only one typical glass-sealed TO-can package is presented. This proposed BOSA platform is sufficiently compact to integrate in a single TO-can package and realises the reduction in cost by simplifying packaging processes. The measurement results of 3 dB bandwidth of the proposed single TO-can BOSA are 10.3 GHz for transmitter part and 8.2 GHz for receiver part, respectively. The clear eye diagram for transmitter part with 14.5 dB of the extinction ratio and 4.7 mW of output optical power and -26.3 dBm of receiver minimum sensitivity at a bit error rate of 10<sup>-10</sup> are obtained under 2.488 Gbit/s operations.

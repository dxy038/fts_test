This study presents a design method of an energy control strategy for parallel hybrid electric vehicles by using fuzzy multi-objective optimisation. By converting the electric energy consumed by the electric motor into an equivalent fuel consumption, the overall vehicle fuel economy and the corresponding emissions could be treated as the optimisation objectives. Then a minimum average weighted deviation method is proposed and intends to find the Pareto optimal solution, considering that its flexibility could content the variations in emission requirement in different districts. The simulation results reveal that, compared with the conventional rule-based control strategy and fuzzy logical control strategy, the proposed fuzzy multi-objective control strategy not only improves fuel economy and emission level but also maintains the battery state of charge within its operation range effectively.

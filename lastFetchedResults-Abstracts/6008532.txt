In de-regulated power systems the power flow control problem gains importance when an interconnected power transmission system is operated at or close to its power-carrying limits. Thus, the minimization of unscheduled power flows need to be succeeded efficiently and fast. In this paper, the effects of the devices both series capacitors (SC) and phase shifting transformers (PST) on the minimization of unscheduled power flows are presented. The problem is formulated as a multi objective optimization problem in fuzzy environment. The constraints and objectives are defined using fuzzy membership functions. A finalized problem after fuzzy decision is solved using genetic algorithm. The method is applied to the IEEE 30 bus test system, and the results are presented.

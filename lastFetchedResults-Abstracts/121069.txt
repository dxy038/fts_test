The objective of the paper is a numerical study of the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas in a monolith reactor with Pt/Ce-Zr-La catalyst. A dynamic one-dimensional two-phase reactor model of the processes with accounting for both transport limitations in the boundary layer of a fluid near the catalyst surface and detailed molecular unsteady-state kinetic model for surface reactions have been developed and verified with the transient experiments data. The mathematical model was used to explain a transient behavior of the process in the monolith reactor during start-up (ignition). Also studied is the influence on the process dynamics such parameters as linear velocity, equivalent diameter of triangular channel and effective thermal conductivity of the monolith. It was found that higher linear velocity and equivalent channel diameter as well as the worse axial conductivity of solid phase favor decreasing a time delay in syngas production in the Pt/Ce-Zr-La/_-Al2O3 honeycomb monolith with a triangular shape channels.

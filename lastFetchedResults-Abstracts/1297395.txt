This paper considers the two-parallel machines scheduling problem with rate-modifying activities. In this model, each machine has a rate-modifying activity that can change the processing rate of machine under consideration. Hence the actual processing times of jobs vary depending on whether the job is scheduled before or after the rate-modifying activity. We need to make a decision on when to schedule the rate-modifying activities and the sequence of jobs to minimize some objective function. We provide polynomial and pseudo-polynomial time algorithms to solve the total completion time minimization problem and total weighted completion time minimization problem under agreeable ratio condition.

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of coracoclavicular screw fixation in displaced distal clavicular fractures. Methods: Sixteen patients with Neer Type 2 displaced distal clavicle fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Fixation was performed using a coracoclavicular screw with washer application. After union the screw was removed under local anesthesia. Radiographic evaluation was performed and the clinical outcome was assessed using the Constant score. Results: All patients achieved painless osseous unions. However, one patient showed significant displacement of the fracture due to loosening of the screw one month after surgery. The screw was removed and the fracture was healed with some deformity. All patients returned to their pre- injury level in 3 months. The mean Constant score was 98. Conclusion: Coracoclavicular screw fixation in the treatment of distal clavicular fractures is a reliable, simple and cost effective technique.

This research studied the characteristic of electrical properties of E. sanguinea by evaluation of complex impedance and complex permittivity. Apply Cole-Cole plot technique to explain the behavior of RC impedance form simulation and measurement. The objective of this study was to build up a new electrical equivalent circuit model from RC circuit model of E. sanguinea with MLEMF. The results revealed that there were a correlation between impedance from measurement and simulation with correlation value equal to 0.83 at 95% confidence interval. The RC impedance of E. sanguinea of each chemical component, i.e., protein, chlorophyll, carbohydrate, lipid and phosphorus was behavioral in semicircle varied to frequency which give the correlation with complex permittivity. The model can be used for design of water supply system by MLEMF for treating algae bloom water. This is an innovative electric simulation applicable to the electric engineering and other related fields of study.

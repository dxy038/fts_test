There is now a wide variety of solid state devices available for use as oscillators and/or amplifiers in microwave systemsFigure 1 illustrates this variety. The choice for a specific application is based on a number of performance factors, some of which are listed in Table I. In this paper we shall explore relative device performance with the objective of providing the potential user with a basis for choosing the best device for his application.

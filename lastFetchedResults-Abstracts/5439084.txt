Medical images are often corrupted by random noise, leading to undesirable visual quality. Thus, image denoising is one of the fundamental tasks required by medical imaging analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method for the reduction of Gaussian noise of Computed Tomography (CT) image and Rician noise of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image based on a given set of standard images and the Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). Experimental results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed technique over various other methods in terms of both objective and subjective evaluations.

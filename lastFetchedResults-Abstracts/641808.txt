OBJECTIVE: An acid-induced-viscosity (I-V) complex containing alginate, citrate, and insoluble calcium was incorporated into a glucose-based beverage. We hypothesized that the acid I-V beverage would become viscous in the stomach (due to the solubilization of calcium and its interaction with alginate and citrate) and would blunt glycemia.

METHODS: Thirty subjects were used in a double-masked, placebo-controlled crossover study evaluating the acid I-V complex. The placebo was a glucose-based beverage that had a similar total dietary fiber level and initial viscosity (Control). After a 12-h overnight fast, serum glucose and insulin were monitored over a 3-h postprandial period.

RESULTS: The postprandial mean peak incremental change from baseline in serum glucose tended (P < 0.06) to be lower for the acid I-V product. The net incremental area under the curve (AUC) for serum glucose was reduced 75% (P < 0.01) by the acid I-V product, which was due mainly to an increased undershoot. The mean peak incremental change from baseline in serum insulin was higher (P < 0.05) for the acid I-V product. Net incremental AUC for serum insulin did not differ (P > 0.20) between products.

CONCLUSIONS:

Results of this study suggested that the acid I-V complex may attenuate the postprandial glycemic response to a glucose challenge in healthy subjects

clinical trials that have assessed the best approach for treating under-nutrition in old age
are scarce. Objective: to determine the impact of an intensive nutritional intervention program led by a dietitian
on the health and nutritional status of malnourished community dwelling older adults. Methods: Sixty-eight
eligible participants (age<75) were randomly assigned to a dietetic Intervention treatment (dIt), an intensive
nutritional intervention led by a dietitian, or a medical treatment (mt), a physician-led standard care group, with
an educational booklet regarding dietary requirements and recommendations for older adults. an additional 59
eligible participants who were unable to participate in the randomization were included as a non-randomized
“untreated nutrition” group (Ung). Results: over the 6-month follow-up, the dIt group showed significant
improvement in cognitive function (from 25.8±4.5 to 26.8±4, p=0.04), and depression score (from 7.3±3.9 to 5.4
±3.9, p=0.04) compared with the change in the other 2 groups. the dIt group showed a significant improvement
in intake of carbohydrates (+15% vs. +1% in the mt and +3% in the Ung), protein (+8% vs. +2% in the mt and
-3% in the Ung), vitamin b6 (+20% vs. +7% in the mt and +8% in the Ung), and vitamin b1 (+22% vs. +11%
in the mt and 0% in the Ung). the dIt group had a significantly lower cost of physician visits than the other 2
groups ($172.1±232.0 vs. $417.2±368.0 in the mt and $428.1±382.3 in the Ung, p=0.005). Conclusion:
Intensive dietary intervention was moderately effective in lowering cost of services used and improving medical
and nutritional status among community dwelling older adults.

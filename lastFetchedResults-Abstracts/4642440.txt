Data services offered by the traditional spatial data system always can not meet the final customer needs. Scientists often spend a lot of time on data preprocessing according to specific application targets. In this paper we formulate the problem and study on the on-demand service model for spatial data. The objective is to integrate a large number of fundamental data pre-processing tasks into data access procedure, and minimize the time cost. The research based on OGC WCS standards, and the data system can provide high level spatial data products to meet applications requests. We use this on-demand data service model in Spatial Information Grid platform for case study, and conducted close examination of comparison study with traditional methods.

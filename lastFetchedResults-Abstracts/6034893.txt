In this paper, we get a lateral dynamic model of an unmanned vehicle by using a system identification method and design a lateral controller. The system input is the steering wheel angle of the vehicle with constant longitudinal speed and the output is the yaw of the vehicle. With the system identification method using subspace method, to achieve a control objective, we design the robust lateral controller using the model equation. And we compare the robust control performance designed by using the system identification method with that of the physically modeled system.

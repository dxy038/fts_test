The objective of this work is to use the concept of energy harvesting i.e. to receive Radio Frequency (RF) and Microwave signals present in the atmosphere and converting these signals into DC, in order to store it or power some circuit like charging a mobile. To implement this concept, an antenna is required to capture RF and microwave frequencies of GSM and WiFi signals in the surrounding. Designing an antenna is the focal point in realization of wireless cellular charging device. RF signals cannot be used to drive a load such as battery of a mobile phone, therefore rectification and a boost up is required done in the third phase which is Voltage Boosting and Rectification. A complete implemented system is being proposed in this paper with successful demonstration of using GSM-900 and GSM-1800 signals for charging a cellular phone. The research paper is a contribution towards the concept of wireless energy transmission at the same time it proves the idea of collecting and converting GSM and WiFi signals, to drive our low power consuming devices, from Radio towers and other wireless transceivers that is of no use otherwise.

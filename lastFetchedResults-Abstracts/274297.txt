In the present study, a new type of sandwich panels with prismatic cores, which are capable of load bearing as well as
cooling, is optimized to have minimum weight and maximum heat transfer performance. In order to simultaneously minimize
the total weight and maximize the heat transfer performance, a multi-objective optimization approach has been
developed using genetic algorithms. A set of compromised solutions, known as the tradeoff surface, is obtained. The tradeoff
information between the two objectives is exploited in terms of multi-functionality of the sandwich panels, and the relation
between the two objectives is quantified in the present study. The detailed configurations and dimensions of the
sandwich panels at the optima are provided. Some basic characteristics of the sandwich panels with prismatic cores have
been observed in terms of their multi-functionality.

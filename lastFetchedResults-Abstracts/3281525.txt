A cooperative amplify-and-forward (AF) wireless relay scheme consisting of M sources, N relays, and L destinations all equipped with a single antenna is studied in this paper. The main objective is to design jointly and iteratively the closed-form of minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based source precode and relay amplifying matrices under a jamming environment with transmit power constraints and aggregate power constraints. With the derived optimal source precode and relay amplifying matrices, the jamming influence on system performance with both transmit and aggregate power constraints is examined numerically by using Monte-Carlo simulations.

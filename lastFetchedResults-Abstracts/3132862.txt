Liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) is one of the most exciting technologies, combining the optical modulation characteristics of liquid crystals with the power and compactness of a silicon backplane. The objective of our work is to improve cell assembly and inspection methods by introducing new equipment for automated assembly and by using an optical inspection microscope. A Suss-MicroTec Universal device bonder is used for precision assembly and device packaging and an Olympus BX51 high resolution microscope is employed for device inspection.

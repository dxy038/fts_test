This paper describes the application of minimum variance and one-step optimal controllers to the control of conversion in a solution polymerization reactor. The objective is the servo control of polymer conversion. A new saturation and controller windup algorithm proposed in Ogunye (1994) was implemented for the set-point tracking control policies. The improvement in closed-loop performance using this saturation algorithm over that obtained when the input saturates (open-loop response) was demonstrated at the simulation level

In this paper, a fast evaluation system for remote real-time health monitoring and evaluation of long bridge structure is proposed. The main idea of this system is to apply the reliability design theory for static structure into the dynamic remote health monitoring and reliability evaluation of bridges. The real-time safety evaluation of bridges includes the following components: (1) dynamic acquisition of optimal statistical parameters through distribution testing of fitting performance; (2) real-time analysis of section dynamic reliability of bridge structure; and (3) evaluation of bridge structure reliability by using PNET method in comparison to the standard reliability index commonly used in highway engineering. This research first realizes the real-time dynamic bridge reliability analysis based on the monitoring data analysis and then evaluates in real time the objective health conditions of bridge. The performance of remote monitoring and evaluation over long bridges demonstrates that the proposed evaluation system can deal with real-time information monitoring, evaluate reliably the bridge safety and promote intelligent development of bridge structures.

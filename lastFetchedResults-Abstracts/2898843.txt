With the continuing growth of modern communication technologies, demand for image data compression is increasing rapidly. Techniques for achieving data compression can be divided into two basic approaches: spatial coding and Transform coding. This research paper presents a proposed method for the compression of digital images using hybrid compression method based on Block Truncation Coding (BTC) and Walsh Hadamard Transform (WHT). The objective of this hybrid approach is to achieve higher compression ratio by applying BTC and WHT. Several grayscale test images are used to evaluate the coding efficency and performance of the hybrid method and compared with the BTC and WHT respectively. It is generally shown that the proposed method gives better results.

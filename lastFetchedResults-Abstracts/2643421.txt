Renal masses can be categorized as benign and malignant lesions. Among
the renal malignancies, renal cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy.
However, other rare malignant lesions should be considered in differential
diagnosis.
Primary renal lymphoma is quite rare and might be mistaken for renal cell
carcinoma. Due to lack of lymphatic tissue in the kidney, pathogenesis of renal
lymphoma is controversial. In the present case, a 75- year-old man presented
with a locally advanced renal mass and after resection of the mass, a diagnosis
of Non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma was confirmed.

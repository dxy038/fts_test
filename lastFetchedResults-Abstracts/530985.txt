Background: Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Different factors have been contributed in the pathogenesis of glaucoma including H. pylori infection. Objective: To determine the levels of anti-H. pylori IgG antibody in the aqueous humor of patients with pseudoexfoliation and primary open angle glaucoma, in comparison with age and sex matched cataract patients. Methods: This study was conducted on 41 cases of glaucoma (21 with pseudoexfoliation and 20 with primary open angle glaucoma) and 39 cases of cataract as control group. Aqueous humor was aspirated at the beginning of glaucoma or phacoemulsification cataract surgery in glaucoma and cataract patients, respectively. Anti-H. pylori IgG concentration was measured by means of an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The aqueous levels of anti-H. pylori IgG in primary open angle glaucoma (0.44±0.64 U/ml) had no significant difference with cataract (0.24±0.52U/ml) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma group (0.63±0.71U/ml) (P=0.18 and 0.44, respectively). However, the concentration of this antibody was higher in the aqueous humor of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma patients compared to the control group (p=0.03). Conclusion: The results of this study did not support a relation between H. pylori infection and primary open angle glaucoma. The elevated concentration of anti-H. pylori IgG in pseudoexfoliation glaucoma compared to cataract patients may be due to the breakdown of blood-aqueous-barrier.

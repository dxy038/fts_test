Background and Objectives: Dilatation of cervix is essential in case of dilatation, curettage, and hysterectomy. Complications encountered during the procedure are partly related to difficulty in cervical dilatation. Also, It is important to find materials which can facilitate passage through the cervix. The present study was done with the objective of evaluating the effect of vaginal misoprostol on cervical priming in patients who are candidate for dilatation and curettage. 

Methods: This study was performed as a randomized clinical trial on 60 women who were candidate for dilatation and curettage. In 30 patients (case group), misoprostol 200Âµg (one tablet) was inserted into posterior fornix of vagina 4 hours before operation, whereas in other 30 patients (control group), placebo was used. Then, two groups were compared in terms of their need to use Hegar dilator thinner than number 5 for dilatation of cervix, the duration of operation, and curettage. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and t-test. The confidence coefficient was 95%, and the significance level was considered p < 0.05.

Results: There was no significant difference between the patients of two groups in age, parity and previous mode of delivery. Hegar dilator thinner than number 5 for dilatation of cervix was used in 4 patients (13/3%) of the case group and 11 persons (36/7%) of the control group (p < 0/05). The mean duration of dilatation and curettage was 8.9+1.9 minutes in the control group and 5.6+1.39 minutes in the case group, that was significantly different (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: According to the results of this study, vaginal misoprostol can be a suitable drug for cervical priming before dilatation and curettage; it also facilitates dilatation of cervix.

Background: Human group A rotaviruses are the most common viral agents of severe diarrhea in children and infants worldwide.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine different genotypes of rotaviruses in children with acute gastroenteritis in Karaj. 
Methods: This cross- sectional study was performed on 200 stool specimens from under 5 years old children with acute gastroenteritis referred to Bahonar hospital in Karaj from September 2011 to December 2011. Rotavirus contamination and different genotypes were determined by semi-nested multiplex Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction RT-PCR.
Findings: Rotavirus contamination was found in 27 samples (13.5%). P and G genotypes prevalence was found to be: P[8]: 44%, P[4]: 4%,  P[6] P[8]: 4% , G1: 15%, G2: 8%, G4: 8%, G9: 15% and G4G9: 8%.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, P[8], G1 and G9 were the predominant genotypes.  Lack of amplification of segments related to VP7 protein and different genotypes in considerable percentage of the positive samples suggest the necessity of using other primers and further molecular studies in order to select and design new primers.

The objective of this study was to examine the responsiveness of chemically cross-linked κ-carrageenan microspheres to different types of neutral salt electrolytes as well as to surfactants of varying chain lengths. In the presence of increasing salt concentration microsphere size changed radically from D[4,3] values of 320 μm to approximately 160 μm. The level of salt concentration needed to bring about this change varied depending on electrolyte type. This common behaviour was attributed to the difference in free cationic counter-ions concentration between the inside and outside of the microsphere and can be explained due to the effect of the Donnan equilibrium. The rheological properties of these microgels in their swollen and collapsed states were also explored with results showing that the collapsed microspheres had a greater impact on the viscosity of the system probably as a result of some aggregation of the collapsed microgels at rest due to surface charge screening at these high salt concentrations. The effect of surfactant on microsphere size showed a dramatic drop in D[4,3] values from 320 μm to approximately 120 μm for BAC, DoTAB, MTAB and CTAB at specific critical concentrations. This critical aggregation concentration was found to increase linearly on a log–log scale with the critical micelle concentration of these surfactants in water, indicating that the alkyl chain length of the surfactants had an effect on the critical aggregation concentration.

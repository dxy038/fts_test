Background and objective Chemical impurities of drinking water higher than standard values can result in irreversible harms in long term. Due to the variety of drinking water aquifers and the effect of seasons on water quality, evaluation should be performed to ensure the acceptable quality of drinking water. This study was performed to evaluate the content and changes of important physical, chemical and microbial parameters of drinking water in Davarzan province of Sabzevar.
Methods This descriptive study was performed on 39 samples obtained from drinking water distribution taps in Davarzan province of Sabzevar in autumn 2010. Physical, chemical and microbial parameters including turbidity, PH, nitrite, sulfate, phosphate, alkalinity, total hardness, chlorine residual, total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride, sodium, potassium and microbes. Laboratory evaluation was performed based on standard measurement methods. Data were analysed using SPSS and Excel softwares. 
Results PH of all samples ranged between 6.8 and 8.2. Chlorine residual was lower than standard in 4 out of 13 evaluated containers. Three containers had microbial and phosphate problems while one container had nonstandard chlorine, hardness, potassium, potassium, sodium, sulfate, turbidity and TDS. Nitrite and alkalinity was within standard range in all containers.
Conclusion Since most of the observed problems were related to chlorination, educating local water distribution workers on the process of chlorination based on containers’ characteristics, time, containers’ volume and chlorination frequency is necessary. The high presence of chemicals and microbial agents might be due to the existence of limestone in water aquifers.

An optimal strategy involving the corresponding model and approach to the generators start-up during power system restoration is presented. The aim of the method is to maximize the total power generation capability (MWh) over an optimization time period whilst considering the corresponding constraints. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method is employed to get an effective assessment towards each generator (to be cranked) by the newly introduced indices derived from the objective function together with its constraints. As a result, the relative efficiency of each generator to be started can be evaluated comprehensively and objectively. On the other hand, the priority for each generator start-up can be determined as well. The proposed method, to some extent, can make the trade off between the simulation precision and the computing efforts much better. Case study based on a 12-generator modified real-sized system illustrate that the proposed strategy could provide more comprehensive and objective decision reference.

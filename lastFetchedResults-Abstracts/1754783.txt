Objective
e, few results on well-being in chronic-pain patients have been published, while several studies in patients without pain have indicated that well-being may not be equivalent to absence of psychological distress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between psychological distress and well-being and to identify the predictors of each in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain.
s
nine women with chronic multiregional musculoskeletal pain, 41 of whom met American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia, completed questionnaires on pain, fatigue, stiffness, physical disability (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), psychological distress [Multidimensional Affect and Pain Survey (MAPS), Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90), Stateâ€“Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y2 (STAI-Y2)], and hedonic and eudaimonic well-being (MAPS).
s
ts reported increased amounts of psychological distress (STAI-Y2 and SCL-90) compared to healthy people. Multiple regression analysis of patient data demonstrated that higher psychological distress was related to higher age, more intense pain, a higher positive tender point count, and more physical disability. Well-being (both hedonic and eudaimonic aspects) decreased with higher disability, but was independent of age, pain intensity, and number of positive tender points. Bivariate correlations showed that psychological distress was moderately related to eudaimonic well-being and strongly related to positive affect, an aspect of hedonic well-being.
sion
ients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, self-reports of well-being and low psychological distress only partially overlap with each other and are differently related to major patient symptoms, supporting the relevance of the concept of well-being to chronic-pain research and a need for further studies in this field.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess rates of urinary cytologic abnormalities and cystoscopic outcomes in women with irritative voiding symptoms who were examined at a urogynecology clinic.
Study design
All urinary cytology studies results that were sent between January 1, 2000, and July 31, 2003, for the evaluation of irritative voiding symptoms were reviewed. Data were then extracted from the charts of a subset of these patients to evaluate cystoscopic outcomes. Demographics, risk factors for urothelial cancer, laboratory results, and radiology imaging results were then analyzed and compared between patients with and without abnormal cytology and cystoscopic results.
Results
Of the 1783 total urinary cytology that were reviewed, 1661 test results were read as normal (93.2%); 112 test results (6.3%) were read as atypical, and 3 test results (0.2%) were read as unsatisfactory. Seven cytologic test results were categorized as suspicious or malignant, which accounts for only 0.4% of all cytologic test results that were sent. Of the 564 consecutive women whose cases were chosen for subanalysis, cytology was normal in 91.5% and atypical in 8.5% of cases. No cytology were suspicious or malignant. Cystoscopic findings were normal in 548 patients (97.2%). Only 1 patient (0.2%) received a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma.
Conclusion
Urinary cytology and cystoscopy are low yield tests and should not be used routinely in the initial evaluation of women with irritative voiding symptoms.

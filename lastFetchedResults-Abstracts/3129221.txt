The purpose of the present paper is to investigate duality theory in fuzzy number quadratic programming(FNQP) in which the objective function is fuzzy quadratic function with fuzzy number coefficient and the constraint set is fuzzy linear functions with fuzzy number coefficient. We present first-order optimality conditions for fuzzy number quadratic programming with fuzzy number coefficient.

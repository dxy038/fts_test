The objective of this paper is to analyze the characteristics of protein permeability in alginate–polylysine–alginate (APA) and alginate–chitosan–alginate (ACA) microcapsules by mathematical models based on the balance of chemical potential. The comparison between calculated results and experimental data shows that the models can describe the process of protein diffusion from microcapsule and protein release into microcapsule successfully. The influences of membrane composition on the permeability of ACA microcapsule have been investigated and analyzed. The effect of resistance on the mass transfer is further analyzed theoretically with the aid of mathematical modeling.

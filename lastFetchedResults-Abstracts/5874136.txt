This study investigates the use of multiobjective techniques in genetic programming (GP) in order to evolve compact programs and to reduce the effects caused by bloating. The proposed approach considers the program size as a second, independent objective besides the program functionality. In combination with a multiobjective evolutionary technique, SPEA2, this method outperforms four other strategies to reduce bloat with regard to both convergence speed and size of the produced programs on an even-parity problem

Accurate construction progress measurement has been shown to be critical to the success of a building project. However, the methods of automated construction progress measurement proposed in previous studies have certain limitations because of incomplete data sets. The main objective of this research was to develop an accurate, essentially fully automated method for construction progress measurement using a 4D BIM in concert with 3D data obtained by remote-sensing technology. The proposed method consists of three phases: alignment of the as-built data with the as-planned model, matching of the as-built data to information in the BIM, and revision of the as-built status. The accuracy of the proposed construction progress measurement method was validated using 3D data obtained from an actual construction site, thereby demonstrating that construction progress can be effectively measured. The results of the proposed progress measurement methodology can be used as input for construction progress visualization and schedule updating.

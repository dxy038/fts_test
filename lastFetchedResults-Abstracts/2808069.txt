Since system load is affected by EV(Electric vehicles) charging/discharging directly, it is necessary to solve load planning and dispatching coordinately. Therefore, a coordinated operation model considering both EV users side and power generation side is built. In the EV users side, load planning scheme is got with objects to minimize charging fees and smoothing power load; in the power generation side, dispatching scheme is got with objects of minimizing fuel costs and pollution emissions. A modified multi-objective PSO (MMPSO) is proposed to solve this model. Simulations are done in a system with 10 thermal units and large-scale wind-power system.

Voice fonts are used to represent and transform the personality of speech. The spectral envelope is one of the main descriptors of voice fonts. We present a new technique to represent the spectral envelope in voice fonts which makes it possible to create a universal voice font for a given speaker which can be used for multiple languages. It enables voice fonts to be used for translingual personality transformation of speech. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach through monolingual and translingual personality transformation experiments. We also compare the performance with the phoneme class based spectral envelope representation in voice fonts through various objective and subjective tests.

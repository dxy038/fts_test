Semantic Web Services (SWS) aim at developing a machine understandable and common conceptual framework which share and accumulate concepts from different web service resources to meet a particular objective in question. Different SWS composition methods have been developed for different purpose and objectives. We have developed an agent based SWS composition method using two sets of agents i.e. Service Requester Agent (SRA) and Service Provider Agent (SPA) to represent the user´s side and the solution side respectively for the problem of a medical health planning. The SRA corresponded to the patients´ requirements of different consulted doctor and the SPA corresponds to hospitals and doctors, who specializing in a particular disease´s cure from different places. The medical health planning is primarily based on the doctor´s specialization and location. The knowledge concerned is represented in OWL, query with SPARQL, and Jena API package for interaction between Java and OWL-RDF files. We have taken a different hospitals and doctors. The composed result consists of information of different doctor form different hospitals for a particular disease.

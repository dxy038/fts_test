The design and analyses of a grid-connected residential photovoltaic (PV) system containing a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) load is presented in this paper. In this system, PV arrays and battery packs are cascaded to supply power to the load. Solar energy is harvested by PV arrays, the terminal voltage of PV arrays is regulated by a DC/DC converter to track maximum power point (MPPT) using the incremental conductance method. Battery packs work as the energy storage system and the current controlled bi-directional DC/DC converter regulates the power flow between grid and battery. The interfaced inverter is also a bidirectional inverter.

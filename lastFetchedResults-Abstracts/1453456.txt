This paper presents an investigation into simultaneous optimization of PZT-based actuators by simultaneously optimizing two sets of design variables, i.e., controlling and geometrical parameters for morphing plate structural shapes. The objective function is chosen as square of error between the actuated and desired shapes. In the optimization process, the controlling parameters are optimized using the linear least square method that is embedded into the optimization algorithm for geometric parameter design variables. The presented two-level algorithms are validated by illustrative examples. Numerical results show that simultaneous optimization of both controlling and geometrical parameters can lead to optimum actuator design that consumes less electrical energy and uses less smart materials.

The paper presents condition and structural character of exterior spiral wound bundler and spring-finger cylinder pickups, establishes the kinematic model and provides the analytical expression. The principle and design requirement of a sliding pickup roller were analyzed. The sliding curve of the sliding pickup roller, as the objective parameter, was optimized and finally designed by computer simulation method. The tests of this machine showed that it satisfied with the result of straw collecting.

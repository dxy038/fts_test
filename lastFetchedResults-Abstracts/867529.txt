This paper studies a single-machine scheduling problem with three models of learning and forgetting
effects in intermittent batch production. They are the models of no transmission, partial transmission
and total transmission of learning from batch to batch. The phenomena exist in many realistic production
systems. The objective is to minimize the makespan. We show that the problems with the models of no
transmission and partial transmission of learning from batch to batch are polynomially solvable. We also
provide two polynomial time algorithms for two special cases in the problem with the total transmission
model.

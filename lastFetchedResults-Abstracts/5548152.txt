The objective of this research is to determine a near optimal fuel efficient control strategy for an electric propulsion space vehicle to attain a predefined velocity at the target. The control strategy is represented as a chromosome and micro genetic algorithms are used to find the best solution. The control strategy uses the space vehicleÂ´s reverse thrust and the sling effect caused by the Sun.

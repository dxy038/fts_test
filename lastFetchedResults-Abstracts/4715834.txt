In addition, it provides users with interactive and enhanced services using by a bidirectional channel (or return channel). However, as digital broadcasting environment is improved, that is to say, a transport rate of broadcasting and return channel and a number of broadcasting channel is increasing, some problems have been happen to user. One of that is difficult to user to choose broadcasting channel because they donÂ´t know which broadcasting program they want to watch on many broadcasting programs, what kinds of programs are broadcasting now and so on. In this paper, we suggest personalized data broadcasting method and the terminal platform base on TV-anytime metadata for supporting broadcasting program service. Finally, we show and explain examples of the personalized data broadcasting service model such as My TV, My Guide, Search TV and My History service.

Introduction: Attempts from some colleges of medicine in Iraq were made trying
to overcome the problems and suffocations that faced undergraduate medical
studies in our country and trying to respond to our community health needs to
increase awareness, evidence-campaign for staff members of the college and for
administration and students focusing mainly on medical education quality and
best practice.
Methods: Collection of data was done through questionnaires, interviews,
documents and focus group discussions.
Results: The graduates are of good quality and having the necessary competencies
and skills when compared to national, regional and international graduates.
There is no properly objective defined mechanism to evaluate our graduates
regarding their performance in provision of health services to the community.
Discussion: There is a need to introduce a mechanism to evaluate graduates of
our college and to monitor the community perception of the quality of services
they do provide.

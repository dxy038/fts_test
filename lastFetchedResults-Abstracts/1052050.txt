Globalization is considered a kind of increasing process of assimilation and parallelism. The promotion and the extension of the communication possibilities, thus the increasing communication, conflicts, dependencies and global impressionability, create a kind of global homogeneity and parallelism. In contrast to this, the national identity is defined as a sense of belonging to a group of people, through participation in cultural and sub-cultural elements. The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact of globalization on national identity. The main question raised here is whether the impact of globalization on national identity, brings about opportunity or threat?‚Äù Relying on an analytical-descriptive method, the main argument of the article is that globalization has a dual impact on national identity. It is particularly argued that the in the context of globalization the information management plays a decisive role in converting threats into opportunities for national identity.

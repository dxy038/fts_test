In this paper, evolutionary multi-objective selection method of RBF networks structure and its application to the ensemble learning is considered. The candidates of RBF network structure are encoded into the chromosomes in GAs. Then, they evolve toward Pareto-optimal front defined by several objective functions concerning with model accuracy, model complexity and model smoothness. RBF network ensemble is constructed of the obtained Pareto-optimal models since such models are diverse. This method is applied to the pattern classification problem. Experiments on the benchmark problem demonstrate that the proposed method has comparable generalization ability to conventional ensemble methods.

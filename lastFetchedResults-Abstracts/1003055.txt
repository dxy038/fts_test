Background and Objective: Teucrium polium (TP) has shown hypoglyce-mic effect in type 1 diabetes induced by single high dose of the cytotoxic agent streptozotocin (STZ) in rats. This study was conducted to evaluate whether its aqueous extract could have such an effect in multiple low-dose STZ-induced model of type 1 diabetes in rats.
Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into control, TP-treated control, diabetic, TP-treated diabetic groups. For induction of autoim-mune model of type-1 diabetes, streptozotcin (STZ) was administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 5 days (multiple low-dose; MLD). Aqueous extract of TP was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 3 weeks, started on 4th day post-STZ injection. Serum glucose level was determined before the study and at 2nd and 4th weeks after the study. 
Results: TP extract-treated rats had a significantly higher weight versus diabetic rats at 4th week (p < 0.01). In addition, serum glucose was significantly lower in TP-treated diabetic rats at 2nd and 4th weeks as compared to untreated diabetics (p < 0.005). Meanwhile, treatment of control rats with TP extract did not significantly change serum glucose level. 
Conclusion: Subchronic TP aqueous extract treatment of rats with autoimmune model of diabetes could attenuate abnormal changes in serm glucose and this may be of potential benefit in patients with type 1 diabetes.

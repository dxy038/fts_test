In a companion paper, which constitutes the part I of the present paper, a new control for bidirectional converters has been proposed. Whereas active power exchanged with the grid depends on the sinusoidal balanced current term, at harmonic frequencies and negative sequence the proposed control emulates a resistive behavior, therefore a damping effect on disturbances is achieved. In this paper the proposed technique is applied to a front-end converter belonging to a distributed-generation (DG) system. Simulations emphasize the control capability to act as an active filter toward distorting loads belonging to the same plant.

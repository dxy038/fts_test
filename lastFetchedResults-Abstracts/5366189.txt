In Japan, several new Research and Development (R &amp; D) projects have been started, whose main purpose is to attain the efficient use of the restricted resources of frequency bands. This paper introduces the objective and outline of the project in which we have been engaged. The test-bed facility has been developed and their features, specifications and some experimental results are also described. Our project focuses on cooperative heterogeneous radio networks to improve the reliability on the radio communication link. The technology developed in the project is considered to be advanced network technology that includes the cognitive radio system being studied in many research organizations.

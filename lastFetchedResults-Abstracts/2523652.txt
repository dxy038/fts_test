This study attempts to investigate the role of public and private sector investment in the
Syrian economy over the period 1970-2010. The cointegration test indicates that GDP is
positively and significantly related to the public and private sector investment. The
Granger causality test indicates unidirectional short-run causality relationship running
from GDP to public investment, and bidirectional short-run causality relationships
between private investment and GDP. There are also bidirectional long-run causality
relationships between public investment, private investment and GDP. The study result
indicates that public sector investment has the biggest effect on the GDP, thus the Syrian
government should maintain the important role of the public sector, as well as improving
the private sector investment.

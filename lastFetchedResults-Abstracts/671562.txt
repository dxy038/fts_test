The P-vector inverse method has been successfully used to invert the absolute velocity from hydrographic data for the extra-equatorial hemispheres, but not for the equatorial region since it is based on the geostrophic balance. A smooth interpolation scheme across the equator is developed in this study to bring together the two already known solutions (P-vectors) for the extra-equatorial hemispheres. This model contains four major components: (a) the P-vector inverse model to obtain the solutions for the two extra-equatorial hemispheres, (b) the objective method to determine the Ψ-values at individual islands, (c) the Poisson equation-solver to obtain the Π-values over the equatorial region from the volume transport vorticity equation, and (d) the Poisson equation-solver to obtain the Ψ and depth-integrated velocity field (U, V) over the globe from the Poisson Ψ-equation. The Poisson equation-solver is similar to the box model developed by Wunsch. Thus, this method combines the strength from both box and P-vector models. The calculated depth-integrated velocity and Ψ-field agree well with earlier studies.

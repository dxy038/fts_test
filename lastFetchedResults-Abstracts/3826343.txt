A cordless (radio) microphone system, successfully used by CBS Television, consisting of a small microphone, miniature FM transmitter, special receivers, and a diversity antenna system is described. The need for continued development work to produce smaller, more rugged and reliable components, having as an objective a system with performance and dependability equal to that obtained from standard studio microphones, is stressed. A system of this type could materially lessen the need for microphone booms in television and motion picture studios.

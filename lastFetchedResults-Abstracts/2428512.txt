A broad experimental and analytical effort using fracture mechanics as the prime tool was conducted to investigate and improve the understanding of the mixed-mode cohesive fracture behavior of bonded joints. As a part of experimental efforts, mixed-mode fracture tests were performed using modified Arcan specimens consisting of several combinations of adhesive, composite and metallic adherends with a special loading fixture, in which by varying the loading angle, from 0° to 90°, mode-I, mixed-mode and mode-II fracture data were obtained. Finite element analyses were also carried out on specimens with different adherends. The main objective of this study was to determine the fracture toughness KIC and KIIC for a range of substrates under mixed-mode loading conditions. Another goal was to study the relationship between the stress intensity factors and the fracture toughness. Based on those analyses, mixed mode fracture criterion for the adhesively bonded systems under consideration determined. Fracture surfaces obtained at different mixed-mode loading conditions for various adherends were finally discussed.

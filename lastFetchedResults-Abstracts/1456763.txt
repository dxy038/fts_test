The maximum liquid phase penetration and evaporation behavior was investigated by using simultaneous measurement for mie-scattered light images and shadowgraph ones. The objective of this study was to analyze effect of variant parameters and fuel properties on evaporation behavior, and to investigate liquid phase penetration for the single- and multi-component fuels. The experiments were conducted in a constant-volume vessel with optical access. Fuel was injected into the vessel with electronically controlled common rail injector. It was observed that: liquid phase length is influenced by fuel properties. High-boiling point fuel within the multi-component fuel controls liquid phase length.

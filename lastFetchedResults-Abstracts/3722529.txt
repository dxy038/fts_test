In 1988 Kennedy and Chua introduced the dynamical canonical nonlinear programming circuit (NPC) to solve in real time nonlinear programming problems where the objective function and the constraints are smooth (twice continuously differentiable) functions. In this paper, a generalized circuit is introduced (G-NPC), which is aimed at solving in real time a much wider class of nonsmooth nonlinear programming problems where the objective function and the constraints are assumed to satisfy only the weak condition of being regular functions. G-NPC, which derives from a natural extension of NPC, has a neural-like architecture and also features the presence of constraint neurons modeled by ideal diodes with infinite slope in the conducting region. By using the ClarkeÂ´s generalized gradient of the involved functions, G-NPC is shown to obey a gradient system of differential inclusions, and its dynamical behavior and optimization capabilities, both for convex and nonconvex problems, are rigorously analyzed in the framework of nonsmooth analysis and the theory of differential inclusions. In the special important case of linear and quadratic programming problems, salient dynamical features of G-NPC, namely the presence of sliding modes , trajectory convergence in finite time, and the ability to compute the exact optimal solution of the problem being modeled, are uncovered and explained in the developed analytical framework.

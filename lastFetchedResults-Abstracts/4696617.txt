This paper deals with the hybrid multiple attribute decision-making problem, in which the information about attribute weights is completely unknown. In order to simplify computation, we turn interval numbers and fuzzy numbers into precise numbers. Then, we propose three weights models based on distance, entropy and index function. Finally, the subjective weight and the objective weight are integrated into resultant weight linearly by trade-off coefficient beta, which reflects both the subjective considerations of the DM and the objective information. Sensitive analysis for the order of project is put up in the example, which illustrates the practicability and validity of this approach.

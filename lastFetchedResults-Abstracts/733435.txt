Objective.
The acceptability and impact of partial smoking bans in psychiatric hospitals are not well documented. We assessed the impact of a partial smoking ban in a psychiatric hospital in Switzerland.
Methods.

Before the intervention, smoking was not allowed in bedrooms and dining rooms, but this ban was not enforced. The intervention consisted of banning smoking everywhere, except in dedicated smoking rooms. Patients and staff were surveyed before (October 2003, 49 patients and 57 staff) and 2 months after the smoking ban (April 2004, 54 patients and 54 staff). Analyses included both patients and staff.
Results.

Compared with baseline, after the intervention twice as many non-smokers reported that they were “never” exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in bedrooms (before = 25.0%, after = 54.5%, p = 0.046), dining rooms (35.5 vs. 65.5%, p = 0.037), corridors (10.4 vs. 30.9%, p = 0.001) and meeting rooms (36.8 vs. 75.0%, p = 0.012). The smoking ban was loosely enforced; although the ban reduced ETS, substantial exposure to ETS remained after it was introduced. Most participants (87%) rejected the idea of a total smoking ban.
Conclusion.

The partial smoking ban was well accepted and was associated with less exposure to ETS. However, even a partial ban proved difficult to enforce in this hospital.

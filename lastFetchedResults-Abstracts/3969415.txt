A major challenge in the design of multicore embedded systems is how to tackle the communications among tasks with performance requirements and precedence constraints. In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling real-time tasks over multilayer bus systems with the objective of minimizing the communication cost. We show that the problem is NP-hard and determine the best possible approximation ratio of approximation algorithms. First, we propose a polynomial-time optimal algorithm for a restricted case where one multilayer bus, and the unit execution time and communication time are considered. The result is then extended as a pseudopolynomial-time optimal algorithm to consider multiple multilayer buses with arbitrary execution and communication times, as well as different timing constraints and objective functions. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with that of some popular heuristics, and provide further insights into the multilayer bus system design.

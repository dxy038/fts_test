In order to improve the quality of its time and frequency services the Mexican electricity company (Comision Federal de Electricidad, CFE) by its test on equipment and materials laboratory (Laboratorio de Pruebas y Equipos de Mexico, LAPEM), requires traceability to time and frequency Mexican primary standards. A TTR-6A GPS receiver is being employed by LAPEM in order to get this objective, and the common-view technique between CENAM-LAPEM is considered.

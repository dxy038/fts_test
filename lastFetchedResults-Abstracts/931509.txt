The objective of this work was to study the effect of orange dietary fibre (1%) (ODF), oregano essential oil (0.02%) (OEO) and the storage conditions (vacuum, air and modified atmosphere) on the shelf-life of bologna sausage. Samples with ODF + OEO stored in vacuum packaging showed the lowest TBA values. ODF + OEO samples stored in vacuum packaging showed the lowest aerobic and lactic acid bacteria counts. The sensory evaluation scores were similar for samples with ODF + OEO and stored either in air or vacuum packaging. Orange dietary fibre and oregano essential oil could find a use in the food industry to improve the shelf-life of meat products

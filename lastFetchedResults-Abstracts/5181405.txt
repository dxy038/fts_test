In this paper, we present some of the most interesting results obtained in the POF-PLUS European Project, about 1 Gbps transmission over 1 mm Step Index PMMA Optical Fiber. In particular, we will present 1 Gbit/s transmission over 75 m of conventional duplex cable and using RC-LED transmitters and over 75 m of simplex cable (bidirectional transmission over single fiber) with a special laser transmitter. Both the results rely on a special physical layer specifically projected for the POF physical medium, and implemented over a FPGA platform.

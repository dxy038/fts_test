The hepatitis B virus (HBV) seroprevalence rate is known to be 25–60% in Turkey with the highest prevalence in the east and south-east. There are insufficient data on sero-epidemiology of HBV infection in children living in East Turkey. The objective of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of HBV infection in 6–17 year olds living in the largest city in East Turkey, and to correlate the serological results with epidemiological data.

l of 1091 serum samples were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

erall seroprevalence rate was 9.7% and was correlated with age (P=0.011). No statistical difference was detected between subjects with or without risk factors (P=0.77). The seroprevalence of HBsAg was 1.8%, and it was higher in children with a low socio-economic status (P=0.047). The educational status of the parents and sibling size did not affect the rate of total seroprevalence or HBsAg seroprevalence.

gh we found that the HBV seroprevalence rate in East Turkey was not as high as reported previously, we emphasize the importance of screening children in order to identify asymptomatic patients in Turkey until HBV infection is entirely eradicated with vaccination programmes.

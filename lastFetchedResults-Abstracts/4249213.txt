The graphene material system has become the subject of intense research recently due to its potentially unique properties relevant to a wide variety of technologies such as electronics, photonics and thermal management. A key challenge in realizing the potential of this interesting new material is the achievement of controllable wafer-scale synthesis of high quality graphene films. This is the objective of the DARPA CERA Program which I will give an overview of in this talk. In addition to graphene synthesis, CERA targets the development of graphene channel RF-transistors and key amplifier components such as LNAÂ´s. For these applications, a significant bandgap is not required.

This paper gives an overview of the SCERNE project, started in February 2008 for a duration of 3 years. The main objective is to allow significant advances in the CAD tools dedicated to RxTx radar chains. From circuit to system, a CAD platform gives a unified solution for efficient bottom-up analysis, allowing to extract advanced behavioral models of RF blocks, to use them in accurate DataFlow or ControlFlow subsystem simulations and finally to generate a compatible code with high level existing Radar tools (SAFAR / ASTRAD). This collaborative research project federates Xlim and Ims Labs (behavioral modeling of RF and Mixed blocks), Inria (ScicosLab tool and code generation process), Thales (radar design) and IPSIS (software &amp; hardware development).

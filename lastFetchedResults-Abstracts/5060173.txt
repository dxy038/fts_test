Hyperspectral imagery offers an effective way to automatically mapping of surface sediment types in the intertidal flat. The objective of this study is to determine the possibility of mapping sediment types in the southern Sheyang River mouth, Jiangsu Province from Hyperion satellite data with linear spectral unmixing method. Results indicate that the mapping was achieved at an overall accuracy of 84.5% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.558. Consistent with that of field survey, this spatial pattern is formed by the inherent relationship between the distribution of surface sediment and regional physiognomy, as well as the oceanic influences and evolution features.

Wavelength utilization in WDM wavelength routing networks can be improved by time division multiplexing sessions on each wavelength, and switching time slots and wavelengths. In this paper, we consider the problem of assigning time slots and wavelengths to a given set of multi-rate sessions in bus and ring topologies. Given a set of sessions and their time slot requirements, our objective is to maximize the network throughput. Bounds on frame length, and hence network throughput, under two different scheduling constraints are presented. Simulation results using a simple assignment algorithm that achieves near-optimal frame lengths in rings are also presented

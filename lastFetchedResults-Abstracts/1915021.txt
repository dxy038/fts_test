One of the prominent arguments for performing surface science studies have for many years been to improve and design new and better catalysts. Although surface science has provided the fundamental framework and tools for understanding heterogeneous catalysis until now there have been extremely few examples of actually designing new catalysts based solely on surface science studies. In this review, we shall demonstrate how a close collaboration between different fundamental disciplines like structural-, theoretical-and reactivity-studies of surfaces as well as a strong interaction with industry can have strong synergetic effects and how this was used to develop a new catalyst. As so often before the studies reviewed here were not initiated with the objective to solve a specific problem, but realizing that a new class of very stable two-dimensional alloys could be synthesized from otherwise immiscible metals made it possible to present a new solution to a specific problem in the industrial catalysis relating to methane activation in the steam reforming process. Methane is the main constituent of natural gas and it is an extremely important raw material for many large scale chemical processes such as production of hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol. In the steam reforming process methane and water are converted into a mixture of mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the so-called synthesis gas. Industrially the steam reforming process usually takes place over a catalyst containing small nickel crystallites highly dispersed on a porous support material like aluminum/magnesium oxides in order to achieve a high active metal area. There is a general consensus that the rate limiting step of this process is the dissociative sticking of methane on the nickel surface. Driven by the desire to understand this step and hopefully be able to manipulate the reactivity, a large number of investigations of the methane/nickel interaction have been performed using nickel single crystals as model catalysts. The process has been investigated, both under thermal conditions and by using supersonic molecular beams elucidating the dynamical aspects of the interaction. The results obtained will be reviewed both with respect to the clean and modified nickel surfaces. Especially the two-dimensional goldâ€“nickel alloy system will be considered since the fundamental results here have lead to the invention of a new nickel based catalyst, which is much more resistant to carbon formation than the conventional nickel catalysts. This may be one of the first examples of how fundamental research can lead to the invention of new catalysts. Other overlayer/alloy combinations, their stability, and reactivity are briefly discussed with respect to manipulation of the surface reactivity towards methane.

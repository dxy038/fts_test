From an abstract point of view, a numerical simulation implements a mathematical function that produces
some output from some given input. Derivatives (or sensitivities) of the function’s output with
respect to its input can be obtained—free from truncation error—by using a technique called automatic
di erentiation. Given a computer code in a high-level programming language like Fortran, C,
or C++, automatic di erentiation generates another code capable of computing not only the original
function but also its derivatives. Thus, the application of automatic di erentiation signi cantly extends
the functionality of a simulation package. For instance, automatic di erentiation enables, in a completely
mechanical fashion, the usage of derivative-based optimization algorithms where the evaluation of the
objective function comprises some given large-scale engineering simulation. In this paper, the automatic
di erentiation tool ADIFOR is used to transform the general-purpose  nite element package SEPRAN.
In doing so, we automatically transform the given 400 000 lines of Fortran 77 into a new program consisting
of 600 000 lines of Fortran 77. We compare our approach with a traditional approach based on
numerical di erentiation and quantify its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational e ciency
for a standard  uid  ow problem

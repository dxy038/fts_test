Introduction: With rapidly growing literature in the medical sciences being printed internationally, as well as in Iran, the need for citing references accurately has increased in importance. Accurate documentation, not only helps the proficiency of the citing author in a certain subject, but also reveals both journal's and authorâ€™s credibility and knowledge.
Objective: This study aims to assess the rate and severity of improper citation practices in articles published by The Journal of Guilan University of Medical Sciences
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 9153 references in 531 articles published in 42 issues from year 2000 to 2011 have been evaluated. From each research article, three randomly selected references (1593 references) were checked for citation errors.
Results: Out of 531 research articles, 102 instances (19.2%) were found not to allude to the referenced citation, and 127 articles (23.9%) were not cited in the appropriate accepted format. Overall, 959 references (60.2%) , were found to have some degree of error. After improving instructions for authors in 2005, and the creation of e-journal and electronic library in 2008, significant decrease of errors were found (both P < 0.001). Additionally, as more years passed by, a significant decrease in the amount and severity of citation errors was noted (P < 0.001).  
Conclusion: Although accuracy of writing references in The Journal of Guilan University of Medical Sciences improved significantly, referencing problems still exist.  Utilizing the benefits modern technologies, requesting a copy of the first page of all cited references, and stressing the importance of a trustworthy bibliography, may decrease the citation errors.

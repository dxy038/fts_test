Objective
This study was undertaken to determine which nonbiometric components of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended ultrasound fetal anatomic and maternal pelvic survey can be evaluated by fast acquisition magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the term fetus.
Study design
Nonbiometric components of the fetal survey were retrospectively evaluated by fast acquisition MR images. Thirteen components were assessed, including fetal number, presentation, placental location, qualitative assessment of amniotic fluid, and the maternal pelvis (n = 5). The fetal anatomy included bilateral cerebral ventricles, spine, bilateral kidneys, stomach, bladder, cord insertion, sex, and four-chamber view of the heart (n = 8). Studies were performed before delivery and neonatal outcomes were reviewed.
Results
All 50 neonates were normal at follow-up. A total of 94% (702 of 750) of the components were assessed by MR imaging.
Conclusion
Fetal MR imaging can assess 94% of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended ultrasound fetal and pelvic anatomic survey. If the heart is excluded, this increases to 99%.

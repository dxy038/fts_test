Gas turbine is a complex, strong non-linear and multi-variable coupling pneumatic thermodynamics system. Its typical model in stability studies consists of load-frequency control, temperature control, and acceleration control. A strong coupling relationship exists among three control systems which affect the rotate speed of turbine and the exhaust temperature of turbine. A decoupling control method is proposed inspired by the immune system and its bidirectional regulation mechanism in this paper. The structure of the decoupling controllers is designed and then the decoupling control algorithm is proposed. The decoupling control method is applied to the gas turbine system. The system is regarded as two single-input single-output systems. Finally, some simulation experiments are done to evaluate the control performance and the results show that the method is effective and feasible. The method extends the decoupling control types in the modern control theory.

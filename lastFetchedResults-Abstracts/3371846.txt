To an engineer, a "solution" usually means a set of curves or charts, while the computational technique used to obtain them is probably not important. Hence, the pedagogic objective of inculcating in a student of engineering design the "physical appreciation" of a problem can be effectively achieved through the use of "canned" design software packages.

The objective of this research is to investigate on the thermal comfort condition of low-cost multi-storey residential building located in the urban area in Malaysia. This study began with the selection of six-storey apartment blocks located in Section 7, Shah Alam as the case study project. Then, data in form of thermal comfort elements and building elements were collected from 47 apartment units from 23rd of November 2010 to 2nd of December 2010 at two (2) different time intervals, i.e. afternoon and evening. Data of these two parameters were then cross-tabulated using SPSS and described in terms of mean or average value of dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. These values were further summed up in a table to indicate minimum and maximum measures only. They were then compared with the current thermal comfort standard as well as precedent studies on the subject. Finally the results indicated that the thermal performance of urban low-cost apartment in Malaysia is still within the comfort range. However this condition can be further improved should the recommendations suggested being considered and implemented in future low-cost housing development in Malaysia.

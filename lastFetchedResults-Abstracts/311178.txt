Objective.  To test mechanical bone quality and bone mineral density of the femoral head at the day of implantation as indicators for femoral prosthesis loosening.

Methods. Mechanical bone quality of a femoral head slice was assessed by destructive compression testing combined with bone mineral density measurements using peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Fourteen patients with walking pains were attainable for a radiographical follow-up mean 7.1 years after implantation.

Results. Radiolucent lines along the stem were evident in 11 of 14 femurs, most of them seen in Gruen zones 7, 6, 1, 3, 14, and showed strong correlations to preoperative bone strength (r=−0.80; P<0.001) and axial stiffness (r=−0.75; P=0.002), yet not to bone mineral density (r=−0.67; P=0.009). Slight varus deviations <3° were noted in six femurs. Preoperative strength was reduced in this femurs to 54% (P=0.006), and stiffness to 61% (P=0.038), while bone mineral density did not differ significantly.

Conclusions. Femoral prosthesis loosening after seven years can be predicted by mechanical bone quality of the femoral head at the time of implantation. Bone mineral density measurements may also indicate future stem loosening but have to interpreted carefully, keeping in mind a poorer predictive value.

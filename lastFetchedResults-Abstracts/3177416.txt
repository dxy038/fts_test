The fundamental objective of routing in distributed networked systems is to establish reachability between any pair of nodes in the system. Compact routing schemes are a class of schemes, which aim to control the node label size and memory storage costs for routes in the search towards infinitely scalable routing systems. In this paper we propose an enhancement to route computation process, originally described by Nisse, Rapaport and Suchan, which is applicable in generalized chordal graphs. The proposed modifications allow some paths to achieve better additive stretch, thus contributing to the overall decrease in the average routing stretch.

Gold (Au) wire bonding to aluminum (Al) bond pad leads to the formation of intermetallic compounds and associated Kirkendall voids at high temperature exposures. The objective of this work is to investigate the impact of utilizing electroless nickel/ electroless palladium / immersion gold (Ni/Pd/Au) and electroless nickel / immersion gold (Ni/Au) plating on Au wire bondability and ball bond reliability. With comparison to bonding on standard Al pad, the results reported in this paper include wire bonding process window, wire pull, ball bond shear, failure modes, high temperature storage (HTS) and cross-sections assessment.

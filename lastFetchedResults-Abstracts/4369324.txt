Studies have shown that the IETF recommended active queue management scheme, random early detection (RED) suffers from low throughput, large delay/jitter, and induces instability in networks. To improve the throughput and delay of the RED gateways, double slope RED (DSRED) was proposed and was shown to outperform RED in a homogeneous TCP/IP network. The objective of this paper is to evaluate DSRED in a heterogeneous network environment. Simulation results have shown that, in a heterogeneous network, DSRED results in better performance than RED in terms of throughput and queuing delay

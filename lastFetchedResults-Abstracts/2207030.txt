A metal forming process is characterized by various process parameters such as the shape of the work piece as well as that of the product, forming sequence or pass schedule, shapes of tools, friction, temperature, forming speed, material properties of the work piece and those of tools. Product quality and production economy depend on the mechanical/thermal/metallurgical behaviours of the work piece and those of the tools, and therefore, a prerequisite for successful process design is to acquire a process model for predicting the detailed aspects of these behaviours. Optimization of the process parameters may then be performed on the basis of such modeling capability. Finite element-based process simulation can offer valuable guidelines on how the current process parameters should be modified to meet the requirements of the process and the product. This work represents a continued effort towards developing a sound methodology for process optimal design in metal forming. An optimization method for preforming roll shape design for a uniformly deformed product has been developed. The method includes the determination of an objective function incorporating the effective strain variation in the deformation zone of rolling is used.

Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is considered the most frequent soft-tissue sarcoma of late adult life. Nevertheless, the validity of this entity has been recurrently questioned by pathologists. Preliminary analyses by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of series of MFH have suggested that this tumor group is heterogeneous at the genomic level, and that at least two main genetic subgroups exist. We report an analysis by CGH of a large series of 109 MFH and on the use of clustering software for an objective classification of these tumors. We confirm our preliminary CGH results and demonstrate that two main clusters of tumors are present in the series analyzed.

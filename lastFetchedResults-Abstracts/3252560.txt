Traffic safety can be improved by detecting the road surface condition using automotive radar. This paper describes two 24 GHz measurement systems for investigating the backscattering properties of different asphalt surfaces e.g. dry, wet and icy surfaces. The first system is used for measurements in a controlled environment and the second one is installed into a test vehicle. Measurement results from dry, wet and icy asphalt are presented together with results obtained from asphalt covered with tree leaves. The ultimate objective of the road condition detection radar is to estimate the road surface friction.

For the purpose of detecting CO<sub>2</sub> leaks during ocean CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration, there is a need for independent underwater robots that can make observations while maintaining their position over the seabed against the current for long periods of time. In order to achieve this objective, a novel tether mooring type underwater robot was proposed. The robot is moored and its position is controlled by changing the length of the tether. In addition, it can sustain itself with a sea current power generation system. After that, the prototype underwater robot &#194;&#191;Anchor Diver&#194;&#191; was developed. Anchor Diver is moored by one tether, moves using horizontal and vertical rudders and moves upstream by reel mechanism. In addition, the use of a movable anchor and generator as a propeller enables Anchor Diver to enlarge its range of activity. This paper describes the detailed development of Anchor Diver and underwater experiments.

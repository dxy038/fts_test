The objective of this paper is to describe the methods used to derive surface parameters at 1 km resolution using land cover maps, climate maps, and NDVI datasets. At global scale, the GLC2000 product and the associated regional legends are used and bring up improvement compared with previous maps made with AVHRR. A new concept of classification using the SPOT/VEGETATION NDVI profiles, in order to define homogeneous ecosystems, is presented. The method is applied to Africa. Then, all surface parameters are derived for each of these ecosystems with look-up tables; the annual cycle of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) is constrained by the SPOT/VEGETATION information; an example over France is shown

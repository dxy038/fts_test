The objective of this paper is to realize a fuzzy logic controller using genetic algorithm for the position control of an electro-hydraulic fin position servo system. In this paper, a design method of a fuzzy logic controller using genetic algorithm is proposed, and it is applied to an electrohydraulic fin position servo system. To simplify the design of a fuzzy logic controller, we first introduce characteristic parameters. Then the characteristic parameters are encoded to a chromosome, and optimized through genetic operations. The effectiveness of this control scheme is verified by comparison with that of a PID control through a series of simulation studies.

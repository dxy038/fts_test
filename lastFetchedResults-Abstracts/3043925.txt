This paper deals with the optimal filtering problem of discrete-time systems, the objective is to find a filter such that an upper bound on the H<sub>2</sub> norm criterion of the estimation error is minimized while a prescribed noise attenuation level is guaranteed. A procedure to designing the optimal H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filter is presented by formulating and solving a certain convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequality constraints.

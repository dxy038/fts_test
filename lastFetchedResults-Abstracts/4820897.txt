In recent years, considerable research and development activities have concentrated on investigating the various options and systems for indoor radio communications networks. The objective has been to provide radio services with service quality and flexibility equal to that offered by wired networks. The authors have investigated the limitations on the maximum bit rate for indoor radio communications systems, and the various techniques and technologies which can be used to increase it are discussed. As an example, a network which could support a continuous transmission bit rate of 10 Mb/s per user, using the millimetric frequency band, is considered

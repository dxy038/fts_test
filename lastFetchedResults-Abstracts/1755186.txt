Objective
 induced IgE production by seminal B cells from patients with atopic eczema via interaction of B cells with galectin-3 on sperms. We studied the effect of viewing a humorous film on IgE production by seminal B cells cultured with sperms.
s
-four male patients with atopic eczema viewed a humorous film (Modern Times, featuring Charlie Chaplin). Just before and immediately after viewing, semen was collected, and seminal B cells and sperms were purified. Seminal B cells were cultured with sperms and IgE production was measured, while expression of galectin-3 on sperms was assessed.
s
viewing the humorous film, IgE production by B cells cultured with sperms was significantly decreased. Moreover, expression of galectin-3 on sperms was reduced.
sion
g a humorous film reduced galectin-3 expression on sperms, which in turn decreased IgE production by seminal B cells cultured with sperms. These results indicate that viewing a humorous film may be helpful for the study and treatment of local IgE production and allergy in the reproductive tract.

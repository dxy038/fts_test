Having insight can be reckoned as a factor for distinguishing right from wrong in critical situations. Historical studies show that having insight has been the main cause of victory for those fighting for the right side in battles that have fought between the defenders of right and wrong. In times when right and wrong are intermingled, and man loses his discrimination power, having insight can work as the only savior. In the present age when right or wrong messages are propagated by means of particular methods, techniques, and devices by different systems, institutions, and individuals with materialistic, human and divine views, and result in the formation of audience’s speech and behavior, holding fast to a strong bond which is exactly the statements uttered by the Guardianship (the Supreme Learder) by Moslems throughout the world is a necessity. Having this in mind, the researchers set out to arrange the data and the supports for the main hypothesis of the research by using the statements made by Imam Khamenei as an axis for delineating the importance and parameters, and functions of insight and the role it plays in defending values using a scientific methodology in employing Delphi methods used by both instructors and students experienced in the field of defense. The present research is applied in terms of objective and carried out by utilizing a descriptive-analytical method. The needed data were collected either through library studies using note taking, or through survey studies using questionnaires and interviews.

A number of 85 people were selected as a community sample through random stratified sampling, who filled a research questionnaire. The Friedman rank test, t-test and Mean were used to analyze data, and the effect of insight in defense was confirmed with Mean84/4  and 84 degrees of freedom.

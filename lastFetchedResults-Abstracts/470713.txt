Objective
This study was undertaken to determine the most appropriate management of the subcutaneous tissue of midline vertical incisions with 3 cm or more of subcutaneous fat.
Study design
Patients undergoing surgery within the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at University of South Florida and East Tennessee State University with 3 cm or more of subcutaneous fat were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: suture approximation of Camper's fascia, closed suction drainage of the subcutaneous space, or no intervention as a control group. Participants were evaluated daily during postoperative hospitalization and at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively as an outpatient. Demographic information, perioperative data, and wound complications were recorded and then analyzed with Ï‡2, t test, analysis of variance, and logistic regression where appropriate.
Results
Two hundred twenty-five patients were enrolled with 222 eligible for evaluation. Wound complications were observed in 34 (15.3%) patients, and 25 of these women also had wound disruption. Overall wound complication and wound disruption rates were not significantly different between groups: suture (12.8%, 7.7%), drain (17.9%, 14.9%), control (15.6%, 11.7%); P = .70 and P = .39, respectively.
Conclusion
Suture approximation or drainage of the subcutaneous tissues of women with 3 cm or more subcutaneous fat measured in midline vertical incisions resulted in no significant change in the incidence of overall wound complications or superficial wound disruption.

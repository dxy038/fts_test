This paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the resource-constrained multiple project scheduling problem. Objective described in this paper is to minimize total project time. The paper firstly analyses multi-task of many resources in a group of projects, and sets up the mathematics model. Then it brings an improved genetic algorithm, and changes the problem into the chromosome or the sequence of genes with the corresponding priority. The corresponding algorithm is proposed to optimize the objective of time. Finally, this paper gives an example to show the application.

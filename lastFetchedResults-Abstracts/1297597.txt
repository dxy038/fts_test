The semi-continuous quadratic mixture design problem (SCQMDP) is described as a problem with linear, quadratic and semi-continuity constraints. Moreover, a linear cost objective and an integer valued objective are introduced. The goal is to deal with the SCQMD problem from a branch-and-bound perspective generating robust solutions. Therefore, an algorithm is outlined which identifies instances where decision makers tighten requirements such that no Îµ-robust solution exists. The algorithm is tested on several cases derived from industry.

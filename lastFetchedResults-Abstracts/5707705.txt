Objective: A minimum parameter set for the representation of body vital signs was extracted, in order to reduce the power consumption and improve the communication security of the data transmission in special scenarios such as battlefields and disaster fields. Methods: ECG, RESP, EEG, TEMP and Acceleration signals were investigated, and the accuracies across the different parameter sets of vital signs such as HR, RR, EEG, TEMP and the Standard deviation of body acceleration were compared. Results: For single parameter, TEMP represented an overall accuracy of 92.11%; for double parameters, the combination of RR and TEMP represented an overall accuracy of 93.50%, for multiple parameters, the combination of HR, RR and TEMP represented an overall accuracy of 93.66%. Conclusion: Minimum parameter set for the representation of vital signs was explored.

Automated Human recognition is challenging area to identify the human based on characteristics such as behavioral or physical. In this paper we propose a noble approach for identifying the human by combining the two biometric face and ear recognition through bidirectional associative memory. This approach can be more suitable in passive environment such as surveillance .By combining two modality, we get the comparatively lower valuesof false rejection rate (FRR) and falsee acceptance rate (FAR). Using the proposed approach we can get comparatively lower value of FAR.

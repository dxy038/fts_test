This paper discusses the viability of using stress screened components as an alternative to system burn-in. Models are presented that were designed to aid the user in making financially responsible decisions concerning investment in infancy removal. A key assumption of this paper is that component infancy is the single most important factor needing attention in steady state products which have employed reasonably sound design and manufacturing practices. The value of the model is in its architecture; specific results from the application of the model will vary from business to business. The objective of this paper is to provide the Technical, Business and Financial communities the ability to communicate on such a diverse subject with a common language, toward a common goal.

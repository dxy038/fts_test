Objective
The interhemispheric transcallosal approach to deep-seated lesions in and around the ventricular system avoids cortical manipulation and injury. Few case series discuss the morbidity associated with this approach. This study describes the 15-year experience of the senior author in Southern California.
Methods
All pediatric patients who have undergone interhemispheric, transcallosal resections of mass lesions over a 15-year period were identified. The surgical approach was uniform with respect to positioning of the patient. Intra-operative and post-operative data were collected retrospectively from the medical records. The need for bridging vein ligation as well as the incidence of hemiparesis, seizures, memory disturbances, and the need for subsequent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion were identified.
Results
Sixty-five patients were identified. The incidence of transient post-operative hemiparesis appeared to be higher in those patients who required ligation of one or two parasagittal veins (44.6% versus 18.5%) with no difference in long-term outcome. Nineteen percent (18.5%) of patients had post-operative seizures; however, no long-term seizure disorder was identified. Nine percent (9.2%) had reports of transient short-term memory deficits. Thirty-four percent (33.8%) of patients required secondary operative intervention for CSF diversion. The total complication rate, including need for CSF diversion, transient hemiparesis, infection, post-operative seizures, and memory disturbance was 36.9%. By 1 year, the total number of patients with persistent hemiparesis, memory disturbance, or seizures refractory to medication was 4 (6.2%).
Conclusion
This series demonstrates that the interhemispheric transcallosal corridor is a versatile and safe approach in childhood, resulting in low post-operative permanent morbidity.

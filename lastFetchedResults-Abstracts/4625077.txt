This paper is a technical survey of the driver support systems from various perspectives. In the first part, vehicle Intelligence to assist drivers is defined by two objective agents which are both Target Generation Agent and Target Accomplishment Agent. The actual Target Generation Agent is explained using some concrete driver support systems. As the vehicle systems consisting of three functions for the action of going, turning and stopping, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Support and Pre-Crush Braking system are explained. After that, Japanese market introduction date and evolution of driver support systems are discussed with clarifying cognitive aspects which are the perception support, the judgment support and the execution support. And Key technologies underlying evolution of driver support systems are explained. Finally the author concludes that the knowledge and insights needed for intelligent driver support systems will be much more complex than in the case of autonomous vehicles that drive themselves.

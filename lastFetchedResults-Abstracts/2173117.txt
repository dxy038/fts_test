A unique feature of the symbiotic association between legume plants and rhizobia is the plant-derived membrane which separates the symbionts within root nodule; this membrane is termed the peribacteroid membrane (PBM). Although this membrane plays a vital role in facilitating transport and other processes in nodules, little is known about the proteins that are associated with and are an integral part of it. The objective of this work was to apply modern methods of protein purification to the characterisation of proteins of peribacteroid membrane from nodules of yellow lupine (Lupines luteus). The 17-kDa protein was isolated from purified peribacteroid membrane using size exclusion and ion exchange chromatography (FPLC). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein was determined; the sequence does not match any of the previously reported lupine and other legume sequences. Following detergent solubilisation of purified peribacteroid membrane, integral proteins of 15 to 20 kDa were purified by size exclusion chromatography.

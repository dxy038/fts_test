The paper deals with the problem of improving co-ordination between the online economic dispatch (ED) function and the very short-term advance dispatch (AD). Both procedures are formulated as optimal dispatching problems, but while a static model is used for the ED function, a dynamic model is employed in AD. The need to account for ramp-rate limits of thermal power generation even in the ED phase is satisfied by adding suitable penalty terms to the objective function of the classical ED problem. These penalties are proportional to the Lagrange multipliers associated with ramp-rate limits that are active at the AD solution. An efficient updating procedure is used to correct the penalization by taking the load forecast errors into account. The proposed co-ordination procedure can provide the snapshot ED with the long range perspective of AD without resorting to heuristic approaches. The procedure is validated by extensive testing carried out both on a small CIGRE test case and on a medium-large scale network representative of the Italian EHV system. Moreover, test results show that the CPU time requirements of the modified ED procedure are still suited to online applications

A bidirectional full-bridge CLLC resonant converter was proposed like front-end of off-grid battery inverter. The model of CLLC converter was derived. The effect of power MOSFET output capacitance on CLLC oscillation tank behavior was validated. The guideline for oscillation tank components and power MOSFETs choice was proposed. The 1kW peak-power off-grid battery inverter was built and tested.

Study Objective: To determine if a seasonal variation exists in gonorrhea and chlamydia in female adolescents.
Design, Setting, Participants: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 604 sexually active adolescent females 21 years of age and younger in a teen pregnancy prevention clinic in a small Midwestern city. Positive gonorrhea and chlamydia tests were evaluated for seasonal variation. Chi-square, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
Results: A greater percentage of tests were positive in the fall than in other seasons (P = 0.028), and there was a trend towards more cases in the summer than winter and spring.
Conclusions: Increased emphasis should be placed on prevention and screening during summer and fall.

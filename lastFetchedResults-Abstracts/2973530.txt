In this paper we study the problem of decentralized supervisory control of discrete event dynamical systems where the control objective is given in terms of predicates defined on the state space. We introduce notions of statically and rationally decentralizable predicates. When a predicate is decentralizable, we construct decentralized supervisors that can realize the predicates that define the control objective.

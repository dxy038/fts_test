This paper proposes a hybrid transmission technique based on adaptive code-to-user allocation and linear precoding for the downlink of phase shift keying (PSK) based multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems. The proposed scheme is based on the separation of the instantaneous multiple access interference (MAI) into constructive and destructive components taking into account the dependency on both the channel variation and the instantaneous symbol values of the active users. The first stage of the proposed technique is to adaptively distribute the available spreading sequences to the users on a symbol-by-symbol basis in the form of codehopping with the objective to steer the usersÂ´ instantaneous crosscorrelations to yield a favourable constructive to destructive MAI ratio. The second stage is to employ a partial transmitter based zero forcing (ZF) scheme specifically designed for the exploitation of constructive MAI. The partial ZF processing decorrelates destructive interferers, while users that interfere constructively remain correlated. This results in a signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) enhancement without the need for additional power-per-user investment. It will be shown in the results section that significant bit error rate (BER) performance benefits can be achieved with this technique.

Model-based FDI systems are considered here. The problem of constructing the diagnosed system model as well as the automatic search for the best rule base of the residual analyzer is reduced to a set of global optimization tasks. Various optimization problems are considered depending on the chosen technology of the non-analytical model construction as well as that of the residual evaluation. Most of them are characterized by strongly non-linear and multimodal objective functions or discrete search spaces, in which the searching problems are exponentially complex. In both the cases evolutionary algorithms seem to be an effective tool to solve these problems. A survey of applications of evolutionary algorithms in construction of the FDI system is given.

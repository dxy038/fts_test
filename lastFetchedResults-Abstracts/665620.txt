The objective of this study was to experimentally simulate interactions between liquid manure and soil in diffusion-dominant areas beneath earthen manure storage (EMS). A previous radial diffusion cell method was modified to include an anaerobic chamber that employed a plastic glove bag supplied with inert Ar gas. Anaerobic conditions were maintained during the entire run time of the experiment. Little oxidation of image occurred; consequently, image and image concentrations were lower than the detection limit. Chloride played a key role in redistribution of major cations and anions resulting from the image diffusion. Linear image and K+ adsorption isotherms were obtained. The resulting distribution coefficients, Kd, for image ranged from 0.3 to 0.4 L/kg. Significant image exchange reactions led to an average increase in hardness of 137% in the reservoirs, due to extraction of exchangeable Ca and Mg. Geochemical mixing modeling using PHREEQC adequately simulated the linear image adsorption at low dissolved image concentrations (<30 mM). The predicted manure volumes to cause image saturation were 1.0â€“1.4 mL/g for the glacial clay soil samples.

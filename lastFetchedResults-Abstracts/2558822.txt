Background: Phenolic compounds are one of the most important classes of plant secondary metabolites that produced in response to environmental conditions. The concentrations and compounds of media have played a significant role in production of these compounds. Production of phenolic compounds in the medium reduces the chances of success in tissue culture process or complicates the process.
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of various antioxidants and media on change in biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in callus culture of Mentha arvensis L
Methods: leaves were cultured on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D, NAA, BAP and KIN for callus induction. After selection of the best medium for callus induction, calli were subculture on MS and B5 media in combination with different concentration of Activated charcoal, Citric acid, Ascorbic acid, Turmeric and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for study of phenolic compounds. The amounts of phenolic compounds in callus and media were analyzed by spectrophotometer.
Results: The maximum callus fresh weight (3.56 gr) and dry weight (1.88 gr) were obtained in 0.5 mg/l 2,4-D. Activitated charcoal, citric acid, Ascorbic acid, PVP, have not significant effects on production of phenolic compounds whereas, both concentrations of Turmeric have significant effect. The highest level of phenol (127 ml/µg) in media and the lowest level 
(72.9 ml/µg) of phenol in callus was observed in media with 1000 mg/l of Turmeric.
Conclusion: Turmeric will be assisting a significant effect on release and absorption of phenolic compounds in tissue culture medium. This study could be contributed as an inexpensive and practical for callus induction and also could applied for production of phenolic compounds in vitro plant secondary metabolites production.

Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of SX (combination of yohimbine and L-arginine) in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Methods: This trial was a 4-week, double blind study of parallel groups of patients with mild to moderate ED. Forty married male patients with ED of mild-to-moderate severity were screened for the study entry ;among them, those aged 25-50 who reported a minimum of a- 3-month history of ED were eligible to enroll in this study. The severity of ED was based on EF domain scores on the international index of erectile function (IIEF). The scores of 15- 25 was considered as mild to moderate ED. Patients were randomized to receive one capsule of SX or placebo on demand in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated code. Results: The difference between the two groups was significant at week 4 (endpoint) (P=0.03). Four adverse events were observed over the study. The difference between the SX and placebo was not significant in the frequency of adverse events. Conclusion: This study indicates that SX is safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate ED at least in the short-term.

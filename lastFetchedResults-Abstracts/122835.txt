Background: The hematological changes in burn patients can at times manifest as severe complications.
Objective: Investigating the hematological changes in hospitalized severe burn patients. Methods: In this descriptive study, 120 patients with severe burn were chosen by convenience sampling from 3 burn centers: Towhid, Shahid Motahary and 15th Khordad hospitals during the period of 2002 - 2003. The cases were surveyed during first, third and seventh days following burn injury. A single specialist evaluated the complete blood count (CRC) profiles at 3 time intervals.
Findings: WBC was increased on the first post-bum day; however, it was decreased on the 3rd and 7th post-bum days, although within normal limits. RBC, hemoglobin and hematocrit were gradually reduced during the mentioned time intervals. Platelet counts were changed drastically, as on the 3`d post-bum day; the presence of thrombocytopenia was evident while on the 7th day the count was increased. The correlation between WBC and band cells on the first and 7th post-bum days were significant (P=0.001), while it was insignificant on the 3d day (P>0.001).
Conclusion: Since following the severe bums the occurrence of a noticeable change in platelet counts was considerable, the evaluation of MPV for differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia is recommended.

Objective: The first objective of this brief report is to examine the relationships between levels of interpersonal sensitivity and dimensions of personality, depression severity and early relationship with parents. An additional objective is to examine the differences between levels of interpersonal sensitivity in depressive subtypes. Method: One hundred and fifty four patients completed the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure [IPSM], the Temperament and Character Inventory [TCI], and the Parental Bonding Instrument [PBI]. Other measures including Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS], DSM-IV atypical symptoms and DSM-IV melancholic symptoms were obtained using clinician rating scales. Results: There were strong Pearson correlations between both the total and subscale scores of the IPSM and both temperament and character scores of the TCI. A joint principal components analysis isolated two main underlying constructs, both consisting of IPSM and TCI subscales. Patients with rejection sensitivity, an aspect of atypical depression, scored higher on the IPSM and three of its subscales, but there were no other differences in score by subtype. Conclusions: Both the IPSM and dimensions of the TCI measure similar constructs. These two constructs may help us to understand differences in symptom profile and response to therapy in depressed patients.

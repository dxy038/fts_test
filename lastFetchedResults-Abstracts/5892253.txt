A novel objective measure for assessing the quality of image in-painting is proposed. In contrast to standard image quality metrics, the proposed one takes into account some constraints and characteristics related to the specific goals of inpainting techniques. The idea is to combine spatial low-level features and perceptual criteria in the design of the objective Image Inpainting Quality Metric (IIQM). The used characteristics are the visual coherence of the recovered regions and the visual saliency describing the visual importance of an area. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed IIQM and its well adaptation to the evaluation of image inpainting results.

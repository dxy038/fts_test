This paper presents a developed ecological function for absorption refrigerators with four-temperature-level. Moreover, aforementioned absorption refrigerator is optimized by implementing ecological function. With the aim of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, an equivalent system is initially determined. To reach the addressed goal of this research, three objective functions that the coefficient of performance (COP), the ecological function (E) and thermoeconomic criterion (F) have been involved in optimization process simultaneously. Three objective functions are maximized at the same time. Developed multi objective evolutionary approaches (MOEAs) on the basis of NSGA-II method is implemented throughout this work.

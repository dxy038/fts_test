In the objective of power increase for transport applications or on-board auxiliaries systems, long fuel cell stacks may be subject to disparities (fluidics, temperature) and can be the cause of possible failures. Coupled with a fault detection strategy, the power converter associated with the fuel cell can act to manage the fault. This article is about power converter topologies applied to a segmented high power fuel cell. The fuel cell generator is a 3-part segmented Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Each fuel cell segment can be controlled independently according to its state of health (SoH). The converter topology has to be simple, compact, reliable and with a high efficiency. The resonant isolated boost as converter &#8220;technology brick&#8221;, allowing soft switching is a candidate topology to meet the technical specifications of the multi-port fuel cell-converter system.

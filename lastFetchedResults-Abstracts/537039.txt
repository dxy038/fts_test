Introduction: Employing exclusively electronic learning is not possible for practical and clinical courses. But, using a combination of different educational approaches seems to be sensible. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of mixed method of electronic and small group education with that of small group only method. 
Methods: Seventy two students of Introductory Clinical Medicine (ICM) course in School of Medicine attended this quasi-experimental study in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in the year 2008. They were randomly divided into two groups. The experiment group received a CD of Schwartz physical examination a week before running the sessions and they were asked to practice chest physical examination before attending small group training sessions. Chest physical examination skills were taught to both groups using small group training approach, one week later. Studentsâ€™ learning was measured through an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and the scores achieved by each group were compared. Students' viewpoints regarding the mixed method, was asked through a questionnaire. The results were analyzed by SPSS software using inferential statistics such as T-test. 
Results: The mean score of the test in the experiment group was significantly higher than that of the control group. Also, the mean score for following detailed technical points in examination was higher in the experiment group compared to the control group. 
Conclusion: Making use of e-learning in the mixed approach facilitates active and deep learning. Despite the difference in the scientific source of the CD and the one used in small groups, a significant effect on learning was observed in the mixed method. Therefore, before providing the needed electronic sources relevant to the curriculum, using the existing sources would be useful.

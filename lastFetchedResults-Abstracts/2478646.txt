Background and Aim : Investigating the relationship between sensory processing and behavior in 7 to 10 years old children with attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity

Objective: This study examined the association between behavioral problems and emotional status of children with attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Materials and Methods : In this descriptive-analytic study, 24 children with ADHD and 24 normal matched children in the age range of 7- 10 years old were participated. After completing a demographic questionnaire and consent informed Letter , The children&#39;s parents were asked to complete Sensory Profile Questionnaire (SP) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Results: Data analysis was performed using SPSS 16 software. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test are used to assess compliance of each variable distribution with normally distributed variables. T-test were used to compare variables (CBCL and SP scores) in the 2 groups. T-test results show that the difference between the means of two groups in sensory seeking, emotional reactivity, and low endurance /muscle tone.

&nbsp; Inattention / distractibility, poor sensory registration, fine movement/ perception and emotional reactivity are significant. The calculated t value is lower from the t-critical (1.96) and the probability error (CI 5%). But in variables such as the oral sensory sensitivity, sensory sensitivity and sedentary difference between the two groups&rsquo; averages is not significant.

&nbsp;There are significant correlations between some of Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire variables and sensory profile in sensory seeking and emotional reactivity variable, low endurance / muscle tone variables, the variable inattention and distractibility, fine movements/ perception and sensory registration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Conclusion : our study suggest that behavioral problems in the Child Behavior Checklist grows by increasing these problems in sensory profile questionnaire .

This paper proposes a method to realize better locating and sizing optimization of distributed generation. It combines the advantages of improved particle swarm optimization algorithm and principal component analysis technology. Based on artificial bee colony algorithm, it proposes the improvement about traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm to improve the convergence. Meanwhile, by means of using principal component analysis, it builds comprehensive model including several economy index, voltage stability index and constrained condition for comprehensive evaluation of multi-objective optimization to enhance credibility of the method proposed.

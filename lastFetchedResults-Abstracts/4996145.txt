Service-oriented architecture (SOA) can provide prompt and cost-effective service discoveries and responses to dynamic changing market conditions. In one of the three dimensions of SOA, reach and range, the search engine has played a very significant role toward the success of this business objective. Over the last few years, search engine marketing has become one of the fastest growing industries. Currently, search engine marketing is divided into two categories: paid and non-paid. Paid marketing includes Pay-per-Click (PPC), Contextual Targeted Text Ads, and Paid Inclusion. Non-paid marketing includes Organic Search Engine Optimization and Link Popularity. As this is still a relatively new market, most companies lack the knowledge or the tools to manage their marketing strategies and maximize the return of their investments (ROI). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of this important dimension of SOA, reach and range, and to design a web-based Search Engine Marketing Management System (SEMMS), which can be effectively applied to technical aspects in managing paid and non-paid search engine marketing required in this SOA dimension. The functionalities of the system include managing keywords and links to a website as well as producing analytical reports to track the performance of the marketing campaign.

In the present paper, the objective of hybrid control is specified and an adaptive hybrid force/motion control approach is proposed. Based on the concept of hybrid control, the task space is decomposed into position and force controlled subspaces. An adaptive scheme is presented which makes the controller robust when the robot is in interaction with an unknown non-rigid environment. By using the classical Lyapunov method, it is demonstrated that the proposed control law ensures the tracking of the unconstrained components of the desired end-effector trajectories, with regulation of the desired contact force along the constrained direction. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our prosperous adaptive hybrid control in robot-environment interaction.

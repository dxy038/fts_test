In this paper, a mathematical model for the lactic acid fermentation in membrane bioreactor is investigated. This novel theoretical framework could result in an objective criterion on how to control the substrate concentration in order to keep a sustainable and steady output of lactic acid. Firstly, continuous input substrate is taken. The existence and local stability of two equilibria are studied. According to Poincaré–Bendixson Theorem, we obtain the conditions for the globally asymptotical stability of the equilibrium. Secondly, impulsive input substrate is also considered. Using Floquet's theorem and small-amplitude perturbation, we obtain the biomass-free periodic solution is locally stable if some conditions are satisfied. In a certain limiting case, it is shown that a nontrivial periodic solution emerges via a supercritical bifurcation. Finally, our findings are confirmed by means of numerical simulations.

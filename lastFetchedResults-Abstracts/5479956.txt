The objective of the NASA ACTS Propagation Experiment is to develop long term statistics and prediction modeling techniques for advanced satellite system design. The ACTS satellite has two beacons which illuminate North America. The experiment has seven identical receiver terminals at different locations. Each receiver terminal has meteorological sensors, two beacon receivers (20.185 and 27.505 GHz), and two total power radiometers (20 and 27.5 GHz). This report presents the first two yearsÂ´ (December 1, 1993-November 30, 1995) cumulative statistics for the New Mexico ACTS Propagation Terminal (APT).

We comprehend things in the comprehensive kinds and we use universals in our language. However, the manner of their existence is unrevealed. Realism believes that they are objective; conceptualism counts them subjective and nominalism reduces universals to mere common words. Hegel's theory of universals is novel . He offers a new definition to universal and calls this notion Â«concrete universal . In his view it is a mistake to imagine that the objects which form the content of our mental ideas come first and that our subjective agency. then by the operation of abstraction supervenes. Rather. the notion is the genuine first; and things arc what they are through the action of the notion. immanent in them and revealing itself in them. This article discusses about Hegel's definition of universals . his process of approach to universal, the relation between universal and its individuals and existence of universal in Hegel's view.

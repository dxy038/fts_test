In this paper, we propose a multiple objective GA scheme to promote watermarking robustness as well as imperceptibility. In contrast with the existing GA based approaches utilizing single objective optimization, we treat the image watermarking as a multiple objective optimization problem. Based on this new perspective, the inherent conflict existing in image watermarking can be objectively handled. The experimental study shows that our method indeed outperform the conventional GA-based approach in both robustness and imperceptibility.

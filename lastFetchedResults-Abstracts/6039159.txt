The proposed network is called CCLAN (Computer and Control lab. Local Area Network). The network has been built in the Atomic Energy Authority, Computer Department. In this network, nodes are attached to a bidirectional multi-channel bus via interface units. Each node has a unique and specified priority pattern. If a node or a number of nodes have ready messages to be transmitted, the bus must be monitored first. If an idle channel is found, the nodes place their priority pattern on the channel. The node with the highest priority will capture the bus and starts transmission while the rest of the nodes will keep on monitoring the bus. A simulation program has been used to investigate the performance of this protocol. A mathematical model follows the priority queueing discipline had verified the simulation. To assess the CCLAN protocol, its performance parameters are compared with those of the CSMA/CD protocol. The parameters honored for this comparison are the time delay and the response time

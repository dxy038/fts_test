Objective: To find out the frequency, types and sites of impaction of foreign body ingestion and different management options to remove impacted foreign bodies.Material and Methods: This descriptive study was carried out in Ayub Teaching Hospital in 2001. Patients with foreign body impaction with the exception of those having esophageal pathology were included. All patients were thoroughly examined and investigated. Almost all patients underwent endoscopy. Relevant data was recorded.Results: Fifty cases were studied. Male to female ratio was 3:1. Mean age was 16.76 Â± 19.95 years. 66% of patients were below 10 years. Coin was found in 48% of cases, bones in18% and meat bolus in 8%. Mean age of coin ingestion group was lower than bone ingestion group (p=0.003). 70% of impactions were postcricoid which included all the coins. Significant association was noted between type of foreign body and site of impaction (p<0.001). Radiological investigations were positive in 69.39% cases. Significant association was found between type of foreign body and radiological findings (p=0.001). Mnor trauma was seen in 8% cases and 92% procedures were without complications. There was significant association between type of foreign body and iatrogenic complication (p=0.031).Conclusion: Coin ingestion by children was the most common presentation. X-Rays are not always reliable and diagnostic endoscopy has very important role in dealing with foreign bodies. Removal of foreign bodies posed only minor hazards to patients.

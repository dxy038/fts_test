This paper deals with simple integrator consensus problems. The objective is the design of an improved consensus algorithm for continuous-time multi-agent systems using memory effects. The novel algorithm proposes to sample, in an appropriate manner, part of the multi-agent systems information such that the algorithm converges, assuming that at each instant, agent´s control laws will also consider the sampled past information of its neighbors. Stability conditions expressed in terms of LMI´s and based on algebraic communication matrix structure are provided. The efficiency of the method is tested for different network communication schemes.

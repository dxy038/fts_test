Objective: We investigated the role of children's temperament, appraisals of interparental conflict and cognitive coping on their physical and psychosocial health. Also we examined the relationship between temperament and children's appraisals of interparental conflict and cognitive coping. Method: We used relatively stratified random sampling with 413 fifth-grade school children in Tehran (220 girls and 193 boys). Mothers responded to the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent report form (CHQ-28PF), and Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised (EATQ-R) and children responded to the Children's Perception of Interparental Conflict (CPIC) scale. Results: The findings indicate that children's temperament, appraisals of interparental conflict and self-blame are predictors of their physical and psychosocial health. In addition, temperament is predictor of children's appraisals and coping. Conclusion: The results in the form of models of the relation between temperament and adjustment, Cognitive-Contextual Framework and risk and protective factors in developmental psychopathology, signify that children's positive temperament as protective factor and negative appraisals, cognitive coping and negative temperament as risk factors can affect children's physical and psychosocial health. In addition, temperament as a contextual factor can affect children's appraisals and coping with interparental conflicts.

Background: Antithrombin (human) [AT(H)] concentrate infusions have been safely utilized in adult burn patients to counteract subclinical disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and pulmonary complications. Objective: AT(H) concentrate was given to two thermally injured pediatric patients to evaluate safety and dosage requirements. Design: The first patient was a 2-year-old with 83% total burn surface area (TBSA) full thickness flame burn and severe inhalation injury. The second patient was a 14-month-old who sustained 56% TBSA deep partial and full thickness scald injury. Each child received 10 infusions of AT(H) concentrate (106 units/kg) in the first 4 days post-injury. Result: For these two patients, the plasma AT level (normal range: 100Â±20%) increased, respectively, from 25 and 66% on admission to 224 and 217% on day 1, 114 and 116% on day 2, and 193 and 171% on day 3. Both patients tolerated the infusions well. In one patient, the eschar on all four extremities easily peeled off the subcutaneous tissues along a natural demarcation between viable and non-viable tissue with only a 40 cc estimated blood loss (EBL). Conclusions: AT(H) concentrate is tolerated in the pediatric population in the acute phase of injury. Lack of bleeding during eschar removal may be of benefit to burn excision and grafting.

To apply the dual stator-winding induction generator (DWIG) system in wind power, the optimal scheme of excitation capacitor to decrease the capacity of static excitation controller (SEC) is proposed in this paper. The optimization of excitation capacitor not only have much to do with the generator parameters and speed range, to some extent, but also are affected by wind turbine power curve and the types of loads. Based on the objective of minimizing capacity of SEC, the graphic and iterative methods are employed to achieve the optimal capacitor with the resistance load. However, for the rectifier load, this optimal capacitor should be modified properly by the way of simulation. The simulation and experimental results from the prototype of 18 kW 3/3-phase DWIG wind power system are shown to demonstrate the validity of the optimal scheme.

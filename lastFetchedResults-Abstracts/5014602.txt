Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a 4G wireless broadband technology developed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and it´s represent the competitiveness of Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) for the next 10 years and beyond. The concepts for LTE systems have been introduced in 3GPP release 8, with objective of high-data-rate, low-latency and packet-optimized radio access technology. In this paper, performance of different TCP variants over LTE network investigated. This paper describes analysis of TCP-Vegas, TCP-Tahoe, TCP-Reno, TCP-New reno, TCP-SACK, and TCP-FACK, based on NS-2 Simulator with full modeling of all traffics of LTE system. The analysis of TCP performance over LTE ensures that all TCP´s have a similar throughput and the best performance return to TCP-Vegas than other variants.

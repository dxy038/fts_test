Background and Objective: Visfatin a 491 amino acid peptide is expressed as a Pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor or Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and might be  regulated by several factors such as ; nutritional status, physical stress, suggesting a regulatory role of peripheral visfatin in energy homeostasis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of endurance training and bene extraction on resting plasma visfatin and lipids concentrations in female rats. 
Material and Methods: Twenty eight adult Wistar female rats (6–8 weeks old, 122–180 g) were used for this study. Animals were divided into four groups including: salin control, bane control, salin training and bane training. Training group was given exercise on a motor-driven treadmill for 8 weeks (at 25 m/min, 0% grade, for 60 min/day, 5 days/week). Rats were sacrificed 72 h after the last session of exercise and 4 h fasting. A one-way ANOVA was used.

Results: The data show that the mean body weight, resting plasma visfatin, triglyceride, and glucose concentrations were lower in bene-trained rats when compared with other groups; but the differences statistically did not reach to a significant level. 

Conclusion: The current results indicated that exercise plus bene extraction might have more impact on resting levels of visfatin and lipid mobilization than exercise or bene extraction alone. Data also indicate that a lower amount of visfatin in Bene-trained group was accompanied with higher plasma ATP concentration.

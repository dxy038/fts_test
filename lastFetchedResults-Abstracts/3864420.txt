The authors report measurements of fibre-optic transceiver modules which use a single optoelectronic integrated circuit (OEIC) subsystem. The optical circuit contains a DFB laser, 3 dB coupler, WDM, monitor photodiode and pin photodetector elements, which are monolithically integrated on a semi-insulating substrate indium phosphide chip. This assembly is designed to provide complete subscriber-termination functionality for bidirectional telephony and unidirectional broadband communication links for access networks. The dual-in-line module provides single fibre network interfacing, is physically compact, is stable for domestic and business environments, requires no cooling, and has the potential to be manufacturable at low cost

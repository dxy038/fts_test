The bandwidth-variable (BV) optical network architecture shows great advantage in resource utilization compared with traditional WDM networks, while its survivability is a more complicated optimization problem. In this paper, we proposed a Spectrum Reservation Matrix (SRM) model to characterize the shared path protection (SPP) problem of BV networks. The SRM model converts the spare capacity allocation (SCA) problem into a succinct mathematical form, offering static programming an effective approach of data structure and calculation. Both failure-independent (FID) and failure-dependent (FD) strategies are taken into consideration, and separate models for each case are given. An effective heuristic SPP algorithm for BV optical networks, named Minimum Spectrum Reservation (MSR) algorithm, is designed on the basis of SRM model. Holding the explicit objective of minimizing spectrum reservation cost, MSR algorithm shows better performance in terms of spectrum redundancy and blocking probability, in comparison with SPP employing min-hop strategy, in simulations.

The design of a controller for the series resonant converter (SRC) is presented with an objective to force the resonant state variables (the inductor current and the capacitor voltage) to track their optimal trajectory. The inherently nonlinear optimal trajectory control strategy is analytically shown equivalent to a modified capacitor voltage control with a pseudo-linear form. The resulting structure is shown to exhibit the decoupled dynamics of the SRC under optimal trajectory control. The controller is designed and implemented using a multirate control framework. Results are presented to demonstrate the superior dynamic performance of the proposed control with lesser implementation complexity

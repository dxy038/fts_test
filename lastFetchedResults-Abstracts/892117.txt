Prediction of the relationship between different types of mechanical loading and the failure of the intervertebral disc is so important to identify the risk factors which are difficult to study in vivo and   in vitro. On the basis of finite element methods some of these issues may be overcome enabling more detailed assessment of the biomechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc. The objective of this paper is to develop a nonlinear axisymmetric poroelastic finite element model of lumbar motion segment and show its capability for studying the time-dependent response of disc. After comparison of the response of different models in quasi-static analysis, the poroelastic model of intervertebral disc is presented and the results of short-term, long-term creep tests and cyclic loading were investigated. The results of the poroelastic model are in agreement with experimental ones reported in the literature. Hence, this model can be used to study how different dynamic loading regimes are important as risk factors for initiation of intervertebral disc degeneration.

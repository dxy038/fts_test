Anti-rutting agent (ARA) is a new composite material which aimed at improving high temperature stability of asphalt pavement. The main objective of paper is to evaluate workability and high temperature performance of ARA modified asphalt mixture, for the climate and heavy load characteristics of the northwest area. Lots of lab tests have been done to investigate the influence on three high temperatures performance, heavy loads and anti-cracking ability of the ARA modified asphalt mixture. The result of tests indicated that the ARA is a more effectively withstand heavy vehicles and higher temperatures, with the increase of ARA content this capability is more remarkable. Meanwhile, it has a good temperature susceptibility and workability. The conclusions from the tests and the analyses are significant for further applications and mechanism research of ARA modified asphalt mixture in northwest regions.

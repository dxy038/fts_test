Kaempferol (3, 4â€²,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is one of the most commonly found dietary flavonols. The biological and pharmacological effects of kaempferol may depend upon its behavior as either an antioxidant or a prooxidant. However, the clear biological effects of prooxidant or antioxidant character of kaempferol has not been clarified yet. The overall objective of the present study is to explore the role of prooxidant or antioxidant in kaempferol-induced cell toxicity. In this paper, we have proved that antioxidant pathway may be involved in kaempferol induces H460 cell apoptosis. Kaempferol-induced H460 cell apoptosis is a typical apoptosis that was accompanied by a significant DNA condensation and increasing intracellular ATP levels. Kaempferol-induced apoptosis is related to its ability to change the expression of apoptotic markers, such as caspase-3 (caspase-dependent) and AIF (caspase-independent). The overexpression of antioxidant enzyme Mn SOD protein levels, which was promoted to a new type tumor suppressor gene in several human cancer cells recently, may be an important role in kaempferol-induced H460 cell apoptosis.

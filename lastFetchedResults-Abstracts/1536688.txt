We discuss design issues for the Michaelisâ€“Menten model and use geometrical arguments to find optimal designs for estimating a subset of the model parameters, or a linear combination of the parameters. We propose multiple-objective optimal designs when the parameters have different levels of interest to the researcher. In addition, we compare six commonly used sequence designs in the biological sciences for estimating parameters and, propose optimal choices for the parameters for geometric designs using closed-form efficiency formulas.

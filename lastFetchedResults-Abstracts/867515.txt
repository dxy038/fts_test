In todayâ€™s manufacturing enterprise, the performance of customer service level (e.g., short ordering-to-delivery time,
low price) is highly dependent on the effectiveness of its manufacturing planning and control system (MPCS). However,
most of the current MPCS, employed the hierarchical planning approach, may have some drawbacks, such as structural
rigidity, difficulty of designing a control system, and lack of flexibility. Currently, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
technology has been applied to enhance the visibility, accountability, track ability and traceability of manufacturing system
whenever the accurate and detailed manufacturing information (e.g., raw material, WIP, products in factory and products
in the down streams) of products will be followed in real-time basis by RFID technique. In addition, a multi-agent
approach may be applied in a distributed and autonomous system which allows negotiation-based decision making. Therefore,
the objective of this research is to study the application of RFID technique and multi-agent system (MAS) in developing
an agent-based agile manufacturing planning and control system (AMPCS) to respond to the dynamically changing
manufacturing activities and exceptions.
InAMPCS, RFID-based manufacturing control (R-MC) module plays the role of controlling the manufacturing system in
which production items and manufacturing resources attached with RFID tag may actively feedback production status to and
receive production and operations schedule from advanced manufacturing planning (AMP) module. In addition, a bidding
process and algorithm is developed to generate operations schedule by using the characteristics ofMAS. Performance analysis
(PA) module is responsible not only for evaluating the scheduling results but also for evaluating the performance of production
execution. The development of an AMPCS for an automated manufacturing cell demonstrates that the integration of RFID
technique andMAS in developing an agilemanufacturing planning and control system can really possess the characteristics of
visibility, accountability, track ability, responsiveness, and flexibility in a distributed and dynamic manufacturing system.

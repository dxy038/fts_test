Objective: Trauma is a major health problem worldwide regardless of regional socioeconomic and healthcare status. As a leading cause of death, trauma results in severe socioeconomic damages, which could be highly prevented by optimal care. As nurses are the major professional groups involved in patient care, improvement of their knowledge and practical skill leads to more qualified healthcare staff. Nowadays, traditional methods of education cannot meet students’ needs and modern methods of training are recommended to be applied. This study, therefore, aimed to compare the effects of two methods of teaching (electronic education and teacher-based education) on students’ learning and the efficacy rate of each method on the knowledge of fourth year students of nursing and midwifery faculty in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.
Methods: In this study, the participants were randomly assigned into 2 educational groups of electronic (experimental group) and teacher-based (control group) method. All participants took a pre-test. Then each group attended the same course in a different method. Finally, post-test was taken by the participants and data were analyzed.
Results: A comparison of the mean knowledge score of both groups showed that electronic education was more effective than teacher-based education.
Conclusion: The electronic training will result in more effective learning in comparison to teacher-based method and can be applied as an appropriate and efficient method of education.

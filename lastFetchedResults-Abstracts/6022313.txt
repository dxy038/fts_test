A multi-layer embedded speech and audio coding algorithm based on bit-plane coding and Scalar Quantized Vector Huffman Coding (SQVH) is proposed in this paper. In this codec the signal sampled at 32 kHz can be coded in terms of scalable bit rates. The core codec is International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) G.729.1 which can process signal with 7 kHz bandwidth. Besides there are five extra bit-rates added and the bandwidth is extended to 14 kHz. The additional bit-rates include 36, 40, 48, 56, and 64 kb/s. Some new methods used in the additional layers are proposed in this paper. The objective and subjective listening tests show that this codec has good performance compared with reference codec.

In this paper, we present a new algorithm to deal with the real-time dynamic traffic routing (DTR) problem using a second order traffic flow model (METANET). We investigate variable structure control (VSC) as a high-speed switched feedback control resulting in sliding mode. The control objective is to minimize the difference of the travel times on alternate routes in a network setting. Accordingly, the congestion could be reduced/eliminated. The relevance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via a set of numerical simulations in the case of the same as well as different geometric conditions.

Background & Objective: The effect of simultaneous US(Ultra-Sound) with stretching, however, has not been compared with other manual stretching techniques like PNF(Proprioceptive Nueromuscular Facilitation). Furthermore, the permanency of the two techniques has not been investigated, either.
Method: This study was a randomised clinical trial on 20 non-athlete and healthy women. The subjects were between 18-26 years of age with habitual bilateral hamstring shortness(SLR). They were randomly assigned to two groups consisting of 10 subjects each. The first group received simultaneous US with stretching and the second one received hold-relax treatment for 4 weeks; three times per week. Before and immediately after treatment period, these variables were measured: passive and active SLR, passive and active knee extension, pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis. After the last session of treatment, all the variables were followed up every week, for 4 weeks.
Results: Both groups showed a significant improvement in all variables except lumbar lordosis. In comparison to hold-relax technique simultaneous US with stretching showed greater effectiveness. Moreover, this efficacy was significant in variables of left leg SLR, left knee extension and pelvic tilt. Comparing the permanency of the two treatment techniques, it was revealed that the treatment results of PNF were maintained up to the end of the 4th week of follow-up and didn't decrease significantly, while those of simultaneous US with stretching showed a significant decrease from the first week of follow-up.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that simultaneous US with stretching and hold-relax are effective techniques for gaining acute treatment results and more stable results respectively.

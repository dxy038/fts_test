Background: Vitamin–D receptor (VDR) and tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF-?) genes are thought to be important in
the intracellular killing of mycobacteria. This study aimed to determine the association of VDR and TNF-? variant with
development of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among Iranian patients.
Patients and methods: Selected regions of VDR and TNF-? were amplified, and then the PCR products were digested
using restriction enzyme (RFLP). Digested products were run on 8% polyacrylamide gel, and were stained with silver–
nitrate. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at restriction sites of BsmI, and FokI of VDR gene and SNPs of TNF-?
at -238,-308, -244,-857,-863 positions were analyzed by PCR-RFLP among 117 PTB cases and 60 healthy controls.
Results: No statistically significant difference was observed in allele frequencies of FokI of VDR and TNF-? at -238,
-244,-863 and –857 position. Although, the frequency of b allele of BsmI (p=0.001) and -308 A variant in TNF-?
promoter region (p=0.006) were significantly more in PTB patients than healthy controls. The frequency of extended
diplotypes were different in patients and control subjects (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: This study confirmed the association of VDR BsmI and TNF-? -308A with susceptibility to tuberculosis in
Iranian PTB patients. In addition, the results showed the importance of haplotypes and diplotypes analysis in
determining the host susceptibility against TB

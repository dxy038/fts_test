This work study four carrier wave phase synchronizers (CWPS) or carrier wave phase lock loop (CWPLL).The VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) output of the phase synchronizer synchronizes directly with the input carrier wave.We consider four carrier synchronizers namely the analog, hybrid, combinational and sequential. The difference between them is in the phase detector.The objective is to study the synchronizers and evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (unit interval root mean square) as function of the input SNR (signal to noise ratio).

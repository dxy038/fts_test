The weapon target assignment problem can be modeled as an optimization problem in which the objective is to assign weapons to target in order to maximize the optimum target damage value. The mathematical model of the problem is subject to various constraints depending on the availability of weapons The objective function of the problem is non linear and the constraints are linear in nature. Also, the variables are subjected to integer restrictions. In this paper quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm and its two variants are used to solve a hypothetical but realistic weapon assignment problem. The numerical results obtained by the QPSO algorithms are compared with the results given in the literature.

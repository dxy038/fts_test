The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between gas permeability and the chemical structure and conformational properties for copolymers of styrene and its homopolymer. The diffusion and the solubility coefficients of small gas molecules (He, H2, Ne, O2, N2, CH4, Ar, CO2) in amorphous structures of poly (styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) copolymer (SMA), poly (styrene-stat-butadiene) rubber (SBR), and atactic polystyrene (PS) are investigated by the transition state approach. Simulation results are found to be in good agreement with the experimentally measured values. The transport behavior of H2O molecules is also studied in the same bulk structures by fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. In general, the diffusion coefficients of the gases in these matrices decrease in the following order: SBR&gt;PS&gt;SMA, whereas the solubility coefficients follow the reverse order. The differences in the mobility of the matrices seem to be the dominant determining factor for diffusion. And the solubility coefficients depend on the free volume distribution of the matrices.

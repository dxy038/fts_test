The interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor is normally designed with two or more flux barriers per pole. The form of such flux barriers has a direct impact on the torque developed by the IPM motor, including both average value and ripple. The Machaon structure is formed by flux barriers of different shape, greatly reducing the torque ripple. Their shape must be optimized based on the number of poles, slots, winding arrangements, and PM volume. At this aim a stochastic optimizer is applied in order to find the best shape of the flux barriers with the twofold objective of achieving a smooth with a high average value.

Objective: The report of Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument development plays an important role in the validity assessment for researchers and clinicians, thus, we propose the Preferred Reporting Items for PRO Instrument Development (PRIPROID) to improve the quality of report. Methods: Accorded to the related guidelines and the report items in several famous questionnaires, and based on the research advances worldwide, the PRIPROID was identified. Results: 23 items affiliated to 7 sections were included: title and structured abstract (affiliated to Title and Abstract), rationale, objectives (affiliated to Instruction), intended application, criteria, primary conceptual framework and domains, items selection, response options, scores, times, administration mode, burden evaluation, properties evaluation, and statistical analysis (affiliated to Methods), participants, main results, and additional analysis (affiliated to Results), summary of evidence, limitations, clinical announcements, and conclusions (affiliated to Discussion), item pools or final form (affiliated to Appendix), funding (affiliated to Funding). Conclusion: The PRIPROID contains many facts in the instrument development which can help the researchers to report their achievement more strictly and access the quality of report. To adopted by the editing system, more advice from the experts all over the world are expected.

Today, it is widely recognized that optimization methodologies should account for the stochastic nature of engineering systems and that concepts and methods of life-cycle engineering should be used to obtain a cost-effective design during a specified time horizon. The recent developments in life-cycle engineering of civil and aerospace structures based on system reliability, time-dependent reliability, life-cycle maintenance, life-cycle cost and optimization constitute an important progress. The objective of this study is to present a brief review of the life-cycle reliability-based optimization field with emphasis on civil and aerospace structures.

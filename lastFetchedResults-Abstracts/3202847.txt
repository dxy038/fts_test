This paper provides observer-based consensus protocols for a group of agents modeled with LTI dynamics, under both fixed and jointly connected interaction topologies. The objective is leader-following consensus in the sense that the states of all the agents converge to that of a leader vehicle, which is also modeled as a LTI agent. Taking the information transmitted in the network as output, the observability of the multi-agent systems is investigated. The observer-based consensus protocol for leader-following consensus is presented.

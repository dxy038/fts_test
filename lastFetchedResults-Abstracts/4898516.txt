Neural networks have broad applicability to real power system problems. One of the areas in power system with huge interest in appliance of neural networks is load forecasting. In this paper the neural networks were trained and tested using 15-minute load data collected in Portugal by the electric power company EDP during a 44 day period. The artificial neural networks showed as a good nonlinear approximator, giving promising results. The main objective of the presented work is to interest power companies in the region for possible practical implementations

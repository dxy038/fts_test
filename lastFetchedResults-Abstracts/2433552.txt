This study proposes a combined fuzzy grey relational analysis method based to deal with study objective. This study objective is aimed to present a perception approach to deal with supplier evaluation of environmental knowledge management capacities (EKMC) with uncertainty and lack of information. The ranking of best supplier might be a key strategic direction of other suppliers prior to EKMC. The solving procedure is as follows, (i) the weights of criteria and alternatives are described both in qualitative and quantitative information using fuzzy set theory; (ii) using a grey relational analysis to result the ranking order for all alternatives; (iii) an empirical study of supplier ranking problem in EKMC are used to resolve with this proposed approach and the result indicates that optimal supplier is with higher protection of the environmental knowledge from inappropriate or illegal use or theft (C7) and from the best alternative supplier to study its criteria ranking.

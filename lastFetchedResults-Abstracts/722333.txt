Transportation of hazardous materials plays a significant role in economic activities in developing
as well as developed countries because of the need of industrial plants to these materials. In many
cases, production plants of hazardous materials are far from the consumers, where transportation
of materials affects the safety of the people involved. In this paper, besides minimizing the cost of
related transportation, reduction of accident probability as minimizing the risk of hazardous materials
transportation, is also considered. The importance of required time for materials delivery is
another main objective. The above issue is categorized in a vehicle routing problem with time windows
(VRPTW). In this paper, a new multi-objective mathematical model is presented and solved
by the use of a well-known evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II. Related computational results are
compared by results of Lingo software using the ?-constraint method in small-sized test problems.
A number of numerical investigations to evaluate the quality of solution sets versus time in large
sizes are performed on various test instances. Results obtained by NSGA-II were compared based
on two comparison metrics, namely spacing and quantity, in order to show the efficiency of the
proposed NSGA-II. Finally, a real-case study was considered for shipping the Chlorine gas capsules
from the Water & Wastewater Company to municipal water treatment facilities in Tehran.

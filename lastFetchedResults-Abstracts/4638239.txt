Distributed generation (DG) planning problem, i.e. finding the optimal size and location of DG units, is a Mixed Integer Non-linear Problem (MINLP). Typically finding the optimal solution of a MINLP problem is a complicated duty. This paper is focused on optimal solution of DG planning problem (DGPP) using Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) in distribution networks. DGPP is converted to an optimization problem with the multi-objective function including the minimum network power losses, the better voltage regulation and the improving voltage stability of the distribution system. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed on 33-bus and 69-bus test systems under different operating conditions. The comparative analysis is made between other evolutionary methods like GA and PSO through some performance indices to demonstrate its flexibility and effectiveness.

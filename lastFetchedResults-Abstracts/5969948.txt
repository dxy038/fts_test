This paper presents the modeling, simulation and experimental validation of a sinusoidal internal model regulator. The algorithm is used to control a three-phase PWM voltage source bidirectional power flow converter connected to the grid. This new and simpler control technique solves the problem of PI regulation without the burden of transforming time-dependent three-phase quantities into the time invariant d-q reference frame and vice versa. This new control structure is based on a complex controller (i.e. with real and imaginary parts), which achieves zero steady-state error by controlling the current space vector directly in the stationary d-q reference frame. The mathematical equivalence with field-oriented control is fully demonstrated. Simulation and experimental results for both steady state and transient operating modes are also presented. Results clearly show the indistinguishability of the two control systems

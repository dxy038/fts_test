The objective of this study was to discriminate different types of punches based on signals measured by gyro sensors. If a boxer consistently uses the same pattern of attack, his opponent could easily determine what type of punch is coming next. Thus, by feeding back information on the frequency of each type of punch, the attack pattern can be identified and the counterattack can be improved.

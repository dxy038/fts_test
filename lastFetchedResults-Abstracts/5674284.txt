The radiated noise of low flying aircraft could be used to detect and localize aircraft. With that objective in mind some problems related to detection and parameter estimation are discussed. Theoretical and experimental results on measurement errors, noise level variations and detection range are given. In addition it is shown, that classification clues can be derived from the spectral characteristics of the different aircraft signals (jet,prop.aircraft and helicopter).

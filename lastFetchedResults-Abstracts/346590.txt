Objective: Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to study the motor maps of upper limb muscles in 7 adult patients with a history of paralytic poliomyelitis. The aim of the study was to verify the potential for long-term cortical reorganization of a selective peripheral motor neuron lesion suffered early in life.
Methods: Patient selection was based on the prevalent involvement of proximal muscles in only one of the upper limbs. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from deltoid and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles. Each muscle map was characterized by area (no. of excitable positions), volume (the sum of MEP amplitudes at all scalp positions), maximal amplitude (the highest MEP recorded).
Results: In the patients, the mean area, volume and maximal amplitude were significantly greater in affected vs. contralateral deltoid (P<0.05) and vs. controls (P<0.01). No significant differences were found in APB map parameters. The APB/deltoid ratio for area was lower in the affected compared with the unaffected side and controls (P=0.06). Cortical reorganization was not significantly correlated with motor performance.
Conclusion: These findings are consistent with a rearrangement in human motor pathways targeting muscles affected by a lower motor neuron lesion.

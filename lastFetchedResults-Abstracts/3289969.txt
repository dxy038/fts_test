Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) is an evolutionary method inspired by the creatures in Mother Nature for solving optimization problems. Less than one decade after CSO is proposed, it has been improved and applied in different fields by many researchers in recent years. In this review, we majorly focus on the original CSO algorithm and some improved branches of CSO family algorithms. Some examples of utilizing CSO to solve problems in engineering are also reviewed. In the first section, the concept of the first proposed CSO algorithm is given in brief, and the improved Parallel CSO (PCSO) is described and summarized in a comprehensive way. Finally, the optimization problems in the engineering fields solved by CSO family algorithms are also reviewed. The objective of the review is to provide the overview of CSO algorithms and a brief introduction for new researchers to the swarm intelligence research field.

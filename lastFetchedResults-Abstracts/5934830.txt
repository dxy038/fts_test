Transmission of multimedia data in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network is challenging. Packet loss, delay, jitter, etc. highly degrade the performance of the network. Hence more robust techniques are required to provide better level of service quality. One crucial parameter to measure service quality is packet loss. The objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of packet loss and identify proper codec techniques for VoIP traffic. We used a packet analyzer tool (wireshark) to analyze the voice traffic.We found that wireshark could serve as an effective tool for packet loss analysis. It helped us in identifying the proper codec technique that should be used for an enhanced performance in a VoIP network.

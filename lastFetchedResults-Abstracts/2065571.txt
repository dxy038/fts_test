Background and Objective: Today, the control or reduction of pain and anxiety is considered to be of great importance. Thus, the use of complementary medicine therapies has gained much attention. The present study was performed with the aim to investigate the effect of music on anxiety and pain in patients undergoing cholecystectomy.
Materials and Method: This single-blind randomized clinical trial was performed on 60 patients undergoing cholecystectomy in Sina Hospital of Tabriz, Iran, in 2013. Subjects were selected through simple random sampling method and divided into intervention (n = 30) and control groups (n = 30) using a random number table. For the intervention group, 8 and 16 hours after surgery, the music was played for 15-30 minutes. For the control group, routine care was performed. Data collection tools included demographic information form and a visual analogue scales (VAS) for anxiety and pain. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 13, and chi-square, Students’ independent t-test, and repeated measures ANOVA.  
Results: Comparison of changes in anxiety and pain in the two groups showed a significant decrease in anxiety 8 hours (6/27 ± 3.23) and 16 hours (5.33 ± 3.03) after surgery (P = 0.001). Moreover, the reduction in pain 8 hours (7.51 ± 1.83) and 16 hours (6.61 ± 1.86) after surgery was greater in the intervention group than the control group (P = 0.001).
Conclusion: The results illustrated the positive impact of music on anxiety and pain reduction 8 and 16 hours after cholecystectomy. Therefore, this method can be used as an inexpensive and non-invasive nursing care technique.

Objective
esearch on the symptomatic burden in bipolar disorder has included patients enrolled exclusively from tertiary centers, and only a few studies have analyzed factors related to it. We investigated the proportion of time and the proportion of visits with symptoms in a cohort of bipolar outpatients followed-up for 18 months, as well as the associated variables.
s
M-IV-TR bipolar outpatients were included in a naturalistic longitudinal follow-up study, with quarterly assessment. Euthymia was defined by a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score &lt; 7 and Young Mania Rating Scale score &lt; 5. Depressive episode, by a HDRS score of &gt; 17, hypomanic episode by a YMRS score of 10–20, and manic episode by a YMRS score &gt; 20. Sub-syndromal symptoms required scores of 7–17 in HDRS and 5–10 in YMRS. Based on a detailed recall of affective symptoms in the time between interviews, time in episode was also determined.
s
ts were symptomatic for one third of the follow-up, and also one third of the visits. They spent three times more days depressed than manic or hypomanic. More prior affective episodes were related both to more time symptomatic and more visits with symptoms.
tions
f the data were collected retrospectively. Treatment was naturalistic.
sions
ipolar outpatient cohort from Spain, time with symptoms was shorter than previously found in tertiary care settings. In accordance with other longitudinal studies, those patients spent much more time depressed than manic.

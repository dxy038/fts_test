Currently, the Internet is the largest source of information where people come to look for what they need. However, this information may be misinterpretation according to the existing of multiple verbs, or serial verb constructions (SVCs) in a sentence. Although many researchers have proposed various techniques to translate the available content, most of them are not overcome with the SVCs effects. This research proposed a new mechanism that can clear this problem based on two SVCs by performing the semantic analysis and syntactic analysis in one interpretation process. The result indicates that the right denotation of sentences can be obtained. Thus, the objective of performing an automatic interpretation process of sentences over the Internet can be performed.

In this paper, we discuss the first application of recently developed L<sub>1</sub>-adaptive control methods for closed-loop control of anesthesia delivery during surgery. Our initial objective, described herein, is to design controllers that are robust to inter-patient variability, such that patients follow a prespecifled Bispectral Index profile. The controllers are designed from identification-based models constructed from clinical trial data.

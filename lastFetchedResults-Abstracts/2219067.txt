Objective(s):Although previous studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of human umbilical cord matrix stem cell (hUCM) transplantation post myocardial infarction (MI), but this stem cell resource has no potential to induce angiogenesis. In order to achieve the process of angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte regeneration, two required factors for cardiac repair agents were examined namely; hUCM and VEGF on an infarcted heart. The main objective of this research is to investigate the combinatory effect of dhUCM and VEGF transplantation on an infarcted heart.
Materials and Methods:45 min of ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery, the MI-induced
animals received 50 μl PBS, 5 μg VEGF, 5×106 hUCM cells alone, combined with 5 μg VEGF and 5×106 differentiated hUCM cells alone or combined with 5 μg VEGF through intramyocardial injection. MI group, without hUCM and VEGF served as the control group. Left ventricular function and angiogenesis
were also evaluated.
Results: After eight weeks post MI, there were significant rise in left ventricular ejection farction in dhUCM+VEGF group compared to the other treated and non-treated groups (P<0.05). Fibrosis tissue was markedly lower in the dhUCM+VEGF and hUCM+VEGF groups compared to the other treated and non-treated groups (P<0.05). Despite these benefits, vascular density in dhUCM+VEGF group was not markedly different compared to VEGF and hUCM+VEGF groups. The transplanted hUCM and dhUCM cells survived and migrated to the infarcted area.
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the dhUCM cells transplantation combined with VEGF were more efficient on an infarcted heart.

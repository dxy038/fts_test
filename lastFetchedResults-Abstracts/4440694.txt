An objective of the next generation network is the accommodation of services with different QoS requirements. This indicates that the network should provide special mechanisms in order to prioritize the access to network node resources, such as link capacity and buffer space. We studied the performance of sharing buffer space and link capacity between sessions, the traffic of which is modeled by independent general Markov-modulated fluid process (MMFP) sources. For scheduling we use the generalized processor sharing (GPS) policy, and improve previous upper bounds on the queue occupancy distributions. As an example of combining GPS with buffer management we apply our results to complete buffer sharing with virtual partitioning (VP+GPS). We also derive results on the resource allocation trade-off, with applications in traffic management and admission control

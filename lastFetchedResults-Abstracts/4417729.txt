Test case prioritization technology is to sort the test cases before the software testing designed to improve test efficiency. This paper presents a dynamic test case prioritization technique based on multi-objective. It integrates several traditional single-objective technologies so that makes it more flexible. This technology, from five dimensions, calculates prioritization values of test cases separately. Then a weighted sum is made to the values and it sorts the test cases according to the values. The results return to the storage in order to dynamically adjust the sort of test cases. This technology not only meets the high demands of regression testing, but also ensures the high efficiency of the test results.

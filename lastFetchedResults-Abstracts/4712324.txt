We investigate Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography (RIP) to estimate cardiac activity from thoracic volume variations and study cardio-respiratory interactions. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the ability of RIP to monitor stroke volume (SV) variations, with reference to impedance cardiography (IMP). Five healthy volunteers in seated and supine positions were asked to blow into a manometer in order to induce significant SV decreases. Time-scale analysis was applied on calibrated RIP signals to extract cardiac volume signals. Averaged SV values, in quasi-stationary states at rest and during the respiratory maneuvers, were then estimated from these cardiac signals and from IMP signals simultaneously acquired. SV variations between rest and maneuvers were finally evaluated for both techniques. We show that SV values as well as SV variations are correlated between RIP and IMP estimations, suggesting that RIP could be used for SV variations monitoring.

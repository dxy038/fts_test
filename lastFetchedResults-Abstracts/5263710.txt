The increasing growth of wireless communication systems has caused the usage of higher frequencies in order to have wider bands. However the increase of frequency will lead to the degradation of satellite communication performance. Rain attenuation is one of the most fundamental reasons of the degrading quality of services. Thus fade mitigation techniques used in order to compensate for excessive attenuation such as diversity protection schemes, power control and adaptive processing techniques. Among these techniques the most efficient is site diversity (SD). In this paper, the effect of SD under the rain conditions, combine both categories for the estimation of slant path rain attenuation and SD gain has been the objective to enhance the existing satellite services at Ku-band under the rain conditions. The local experimental data is used as function to enhance the prediction techniques for satellite path instead of using the theoretical models, which mainly based on experimental data of temperate regions.

Conceptual schemes for process management of image processing system is proposed here so to generate a Graphic User Interface, according to specific needs of certain users and developers. Schemes allow modifications and building-up the functionality since it based on a script-kernel and intelligent support by collaborating approach, which gives ability to use objective and reliable algorithms to solve applied tasks.

The behavior of a large number of electric vehiclesÂ´ disordered charging and discharging will bring great changes to the load curve and the adverse effects on the daily load forecasting and power scheduling. It will also have a great impact on the unit running cost and effectiveness of power system operation. In order to solve these problems, a method which electric vehicles charge and discharge orderly containing unit running cost and effectiveness of power system operation is presented in this paper. This paper uses the electric vehicle fully optimized charging and discharging model. The minimization of unit running cost and the maximization of effectiveness of power system operation are the objective functions. The number of electric vehicles of each period is the optimization variable. A project which electric vehicles charge and discharge orderly is presented by using the multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm.

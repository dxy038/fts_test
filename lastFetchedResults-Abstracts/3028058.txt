The objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between the line start permanent magnet, skeleton type brushless DC and snail-cam type switched reluctance motor. These motors are compared under the same load characteristic as a cooling fan motor of a refrigerator. The comparison consists of speed, output power, efficiency, copper loss and cost for three different motors. For the given application, the results provide an indication of the best machine suited with respect to performance and cost.

This paper presents a software platform for the integration of discrete event systems tools that is being developed within the FP7 European project DISC &#8220;Distributed supervisory control of complex plants&#8221;. The objective of this software platform is to integrate several tools dealing with Petri nets and automata. The purpose is twofold: first allow for a rigorous comparison of the methods and algorithms developed by the DISC project partners, second provide a packaged tool which would facilitate transfer of these techniques to the end users. The interchange format is compliant to the ISO standard Petri Net Markup Language PNML. The platform includes a series of plug-ins and adapters to manipulate/transform the different file formats supported by the platform.

Objective: This study aimed to ‎assess the prevalence of ‎borderline personality symptoms ‎in 16-18 year old adolescents‎‏.‏
Methods: In this cross sectional – ‎descriptive study, 422 high ‎school students (211 boys, 211 ‎girls) aged 16-18 were selected ‎by cluster random sampling and ‎simple random sampling in ‎‎2011-2012. The participants were ‎assessed using the revised ‎diagnostic interview for ‎borderline questionnaire (DIB-R) ‎and demographic questionnaire. ‎Data were analyzed using ‎Pearson correlation coefficient ‎and Spearman correlation ‎coefficient‏.‏
Results: Of the participants, ‎‎0/9% (0/22 % of the 16 year olds, ‎‎0.45 % of the 17 year olds and ‎‎0/22% of the 18 year olds) were ‎diagnosed with borderline ‎personality symptoms. Also, the ‎prevalence of borderline ‎personality symptoms in boys ‎was 0/45 % of the total sample ‎and it was 0/45 % of the total ‎sample in girls. With respect to ‎the relationship between ‎demographic variables (age, sex, ‎location, parents’ occupation, ‎parents’ kinship, parents’ ‎education and birth order) and ‎borderline personality symptoms, ‎only parents’ kinship showed a ‎weak correlation with borderline ‎personality symptoms‏. ‏
Conclusion: In the view of the ‎prevalence of 0.9% of the ‎borderline personality symptoms ‎in adolescents, attention should ‎be paid to the diagnosis and ‎treatment of this disorder. ‎Furthermore, works need to be ‎done to improve the mental ‎health and quality of life of ‎adolescents.‎

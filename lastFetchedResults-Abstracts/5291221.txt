In the Internet, nodes are identified using IP addresses that depend on their topological location. IPv4/IPv6 translation technology involves address mapping between IPv6 and IPv4 nodes and the methods used to translate protocols, where nodes are in their respective IP version of network. The various IPv4 addressing mechanisms and addressing architectures are studied. The detailed study reveals that IPv4 addressing mechanisms were proposed only when IPv4 node roams in IPv4 home network or IPv4 foreign network. The study clearly reveals that IPv4 addressing in IPv6 network is not considered. This paper points out the need of IPv4 addressing in IPv6 network and proposes a new addressing mechanism to obtain an IPv4 Care-of-Address in IPv6 network which is referred to as P46A. The paper also presents a clear implementation procedure in acquiring P46A and binding update registration with its Home Agent. In fact, this mechanism could be immediately deployed. The main objective of the proposed model is to permit IPv4 mobile users to roam freely in any network i.e., either into IPv6 based networks, be connected with internet and get serviced besides roaming in IPv4 network.

In this paper, a simple method for placing an optimal number of APLCs is presented. The algorithm is solved using genetic algorithm as the optimization method. The cost of APLCs is considered to be proportional to their injecting current which is minimized as the objective function. The voltage limit observed as a constraint based on the IEEE standard is also satisfied. In order to evaluate the proposed method, a sample system is used and the optimal locations for APLCs, their injecting currents and number as well as maximum THD are determined. The method enjoys the simplicity of configuration, accuracy of the results and reduction of the time consuming. The obtained results also show the applicability of the algorithm.

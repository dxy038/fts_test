This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization method for a Japanese domestic airline network using socioeconomic-environmental data obtained from Japanese governmental bureaus and NOAA Tsunami Data and Information. Japanese domestic air transportation information is extracted to construct an airline network constituting of airports and flights. When we define three kinds of metrics such as Risk (R), Economy (E) and Convenience (C) for an airline network based on several statistics and evaluate them, we find that there exists a tradeoff relationship between these metrics. It is shown that multi-objective optimization is possible to recover the airline network by decreasing the Risk (R) metric while simultaneously increasing the Economy (E) and Convenience (C) metrics, even in a severe situation such that some airports are damaged by tsunamis and their associated flights at the airports are all cancelled.

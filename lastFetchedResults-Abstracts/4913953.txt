In current command and control system design, the concept of information plays a central role. In order to find architectures for situation and threat databases making full use of all dimensions of information, the concept of information awareness must be understood. We consider and define some information attributes: measures of precision, quality and usability, and suggest some uses of these concepts. The analysis is Bayesian. A critical point is where subjective Bayesian probabilities of decision makers meet the objective sensor related Bayesian assessments of the system. This interface must be designed to avoid credibility problems.

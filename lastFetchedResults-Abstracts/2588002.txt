<p><strong>B</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>ckground: </strong>The objective was to investigate the relationship between serum interleukin-18 (IL-18), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels with body mass index (BMI) and abdominal obesity and also the interaction between genetic variants of apolipoprotein A-II (Apo A-II) and obesity on the levels of these factors in type 2 diabetes patients (T2D).</p><p><strong>M</strong><strong>ethods</strong>:  A  comparative  cross-sectional study  was  conducted  in  21  diabetes centers in Tehran. Totally, 180 (35-65 years) T2D patients were divided into two groups of 90 obese (BMI ≥ 30) and 90 non-obese (BMI &lt; 30), according to the BMI with equal numbers of each genotype of Apo A-II: 30 TT, 30 CC, and 30 TC. Serum IL-18, PTX3, and hs-CRP concentrations were compared between two obese  and  non-obese  groups  and  between  subjects  with  and  without  central obesity. To investigate the interaction of Apo A-II genetic variants and BMI with inflammatory factors, general linear model was used.</p><p><strong>Results</strong>: After adjusting data with confounding factors, the mean of serum PTX3 was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.050) in the obese diabetes than non-obese diabetes subjects. Moreover, obese diabetes had higher serum hs-CRP level that on obese subjects (p &lt; 0.010). No significant interaction between Apo A-II 265 T &gt; C polymorphism and BMI on inflammatory biomarkers was observed.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There was a significant difference in inflammatory markers (PTX3 and hs-CRP concentration) between obese and non-obese diabetes. In addition, there was no interaction of Apo A-II 265 T &gt; C genotypes and BMI on inflammatory markers. Weight control may be recommended to modulate inflammation and its complications in obese patients.</p>

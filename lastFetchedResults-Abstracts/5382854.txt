This paper presents a new discrete packaging configuration and an electromagnetic modeling of a bidirectional MOSFET power switch with less magnetic interference used in matrix converter application. The study is based on computing the magnetic field inside a specific new proposed low losses switching cell in order to incorporate gates driversÂ´ circuit inside the power module space volume. The novelty of the proposed configuration is the creation of a parallel magnetic field zone, which has less impact on the low level gate drive signals of the power devices. Simulations as well as experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed efficient method

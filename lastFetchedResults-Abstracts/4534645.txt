A standardized sliding-mode controller for bidirectional switching converters is described. The proposed circuit is suitable for large-signal applications and can be used in a large class of dc-to-dc switching converters. As a result, robustness and fast dynamic response against supply, load and parameter variations is obtained. The controller implementation has been performed by means of standard operational amplifiers (OA´s) and it has been tested experimentally in elementary and complex switching power converters. An integrated realization of the controller has been simulated at transistor level by means of HSPICE exhibiting similar characteristics to those presented by the OA´s-based implementation

A nonsmooth minmax programming problem, under the assumption of proper (b, n) invexity conditions on the functions involved in the objective and in the constraints, is considered. For such a problem, a sufficient optimality theorem is proved, a Wolfe type dual is presented and duality theorems relating the primal and the dual are proved. Applications of these results to certain nonsmooth fractional and nonsmooth generalized fractional programming duality are also presented.

Modelling of cold rolling and continuous annealing of the IF steel is the objective of the paper. Experimental plastometric tests were performed to determine flow stress in the temperature range characteristic for cold rolling. Physical simulations of the annealing were performed at various heating rates to various temperatures. The kinetics of recrystallization model based on the additivity rule was identified on the basis of the experimental results. In connection with the finite element model of cold rolling, the complex model for the whole manufacturing cycle is obtained. This model can be used for optimisation of cold rolling and annealing technology of IF steel strips.

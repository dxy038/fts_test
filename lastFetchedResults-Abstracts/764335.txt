Regionalism is an analytical and critical perspective which focuses on preserving special features of place and
attempts to fill the vacuum in architecture. Globalization is a complex multi-stage process that causes increasing complexity of
time and place, greater awareness across the global and acceleration of cross-cultural interactions. Therefore, the present paper
attempts to analyze global-regional interactional approach through investigating contemporary Iranian architecture in relationship
with the aforementioned phenomena and also tries to provide practical advice on establishing a constructive interaction. The
research methodology is based on content analysis and case study.
The results obtained from investigating striking cases of 4 eras of contemporary Iranian architecture and presented as a table of
global-regional interaction components (physical, semantic and ecological) show that an interactional approach is becoming
increasingly popular and global-regional coexistence is being formed in contemporary Iranian architecture, which associates with
spirit of time and its regional components. A dynamic presence and playing a componential role by contemporary Iranian
architects in this interaction have some prerequisites: an understanding of contemporary pluralism, an understanding of the other
and establishing interaction, emphasis on the role of thought, creation and innovation, objective research, a good understanding
of identity and place, past recall and identifying components of Iranian architecture.

Objective: Sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) undergo apoptosis after peripheral
nerve injury.
The
aim of this study was to investigate sensory neuron death and the

mechanism
involved in the death of these neurons in cultured DRG.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, L5 DRG from adult mouse were dissected
and incubated in culture medium for 24,
48,
72
and 96 hours. Freshly
dissected
and

cultured DRG were then fixed and sectioned using a cryostat. Morphological and
biochemical features of apoptosis were investigated using fluorescent staining (Propidium
iodide and Hoechst 33342) and the terminal Deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) method respectively. To study the role of caspases, general caspase
inhibitor (Z-VAD.fmk, 100 ?M) and immunohistochemistry for activated caspase-3 were
used.   
Results: After 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours in culture, sensory neurons not only displayed morphological
features
of apoptosis but also they appeared TUNEL
positive. The
application
of
Z-VAD.fmk
inhibited
apoptosis
in
these
neurons
over
the
same
time
period.
In
addition,

intense
activated
caspase-3 immunoreactivity
was
found both in the cytoplasm and the
nuclei
of these neurons after 24 and 48 hours.
Conclusion: Results of the present study show caspase-dependent apoptosis in the sensory
neurons of cultured DRG from adult mouse.

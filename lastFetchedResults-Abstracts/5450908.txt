In this paper we study a simple jump linear system in the context of networked control systems. The objective is to show the equivalence between this simple stochastic recurrence and a random walk on a self-similar graph whose vertices are the visible points of the plane. These results strongly suggest that tools of graph theory, statistical physics, combinatorics and even number theory can be brought to bear on problems in control theory.

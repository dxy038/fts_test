To the problem of bit and power allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, a novel framework was proposed which introduced the game theory and a new algorithm was applied. Firstly, the power allocation problem was described as non-cooperative Game process. Secondly, combined with influences of required quality of service (QoS), the frequency efficiency was formulated by a utility function and the cost of resources by a price function. Finally, the objective of power allocation was expressed as maximum net utility for each sub-carrier. Considered the algorithmÂ´ s limitations, a second power allocation was assigned, in reaching the optimal performances.

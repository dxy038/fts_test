A prototype video monitoring system has been constructed to monitor and manage high occupancy vehicle lanes near San Diego, CA. A major project objective was to develop a system using off the shelf hardware and open system computer standards. We discuss the overall structure of the video system, and then how various hardware and software modules were selected and integrated into the system. Next we discuss how the open systems concepts aided and simplified the design and implementation of the system. Finally, we discuss how opens systems can aid in the development of Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS)

This paper investigates the access time of mobile nodes to infrastructure networks in Mobile Hybrid Networks (MHNs), e.g., sensor-actuator networks, where mobile nodes move around the coexisting infrastructure networks. In such networks, mobile nodes may relay data packets in a hop-by-hop fashion, and eventually deliver packets to the wired networks. Our objective is to study the lower bound of the access time, which implies the minimum time to deliver data packets from low-speed, unreliable wireless networks to the high-speed, reliable infrastructure network. In particular, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the packet propagation speed in MHNs, and to show that there is a unified lower bound on the access time regardless of data forwarding schemes. When wireless nodes move at an average speed of v and variance &#963;<sup>2</sup> towards an AP, and their density &#955; is small (e.g., the network is sparse and surely disconnected), we prove that the expected access time is lower bounded by (L<sub>b</sub>(0)-r)<sup>2</sup>/&#963;<sup>2</sup> packet mobility is unbiased and L<sub>b</sub>(0)-r/v for the biased case, where L<sub>b</sub>(0) is the distance from the source node to the nearest access point. Here, packet mobility is the mobility of a packet due to both node mobility and data transmissions. We further propose a routing scheme to achieve such theoretical bounds.

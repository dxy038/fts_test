The objective of this study was to determine the potential influence of fluctuations in the sex hormones progesterone and oestradiol-17Î² (E2), on biomarkers of bone resorption (hydroxyproline [HYP] and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b [TRAP5b]) during the oestrous cycle of Holstein cows. Over the course of the study, plasma HYP concentrations did not change and alterations in the concentration of TRAP5b negatively correlated with E2 levels: enhanced TRAP5b activity correlated with decreased E2 concentrations below a defined level. This finding enhances the understanding of calcium homeostasis in post-partum dairy cows.

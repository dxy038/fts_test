According to basic principles of viable system model (VSM), electromagnetic launch measurement and control system was designed with data collection, data analysis, data control. Firstly key points were set in this system. Secondly data were collected by high-speed card and low speed card, and then data were processed by industrial personal computer(IPC). Thirdly all key points were monitored by control system. Fourthly expert system implemented data analysis and provided reference for objective management. Finally all of these were theoretical support for successfully operation of electromagnetic launch system.

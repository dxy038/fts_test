More than 90% of the population of the Gaza Strip depends on desalinated water for drinking purposes. About 90% of the groundwater is unacceptable for drinking as a result of contamination by nitrate and chloride. One of the major options for resolving the water problems is the utilization of desalination technology for both sea and brackish water. The objective of this article is to address desalination water management in its embryonic stage in the Gaza Strip. The sources of drinking water supply, distribution system and the environmental impact of brine water will be fingered in detail. Desalination facilities range from large seawater plants to small brackish desalination units on a home scale. Governmental, non-governmental and private desalination plants are common. The distribution system of desalinated water is a responsibility of governmental, non-governmental, private small community bodies and even individuals. Disposal of brine water is made either directly or indirectly into the sea, sewage system, poor land, channels, wadies, etc. Brine constituents have an adverse impacton the surrounding environment, e.g., sea life, soil, wastewater treatment plants and the groundwateraquifer. The lack of real environmental impact assessments, especially for mid- and home-scale units may lead to a deterioration of the environment. The fragmentation of the responsibilities of water desalination, distribution of desalinated water and the disposal of brine water suggest that urgent action should be taken (e.g., legislation or establishment of a supervisory body). In other words, strict policies and management actions are to be taken in order to alleviate the health and environmental impact of an important and uncontrolled new system.

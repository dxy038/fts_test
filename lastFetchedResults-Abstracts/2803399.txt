This paper is main to find the best way to make a plan about the generators operation. Firstly, we describe all conditions as constraints exactly. Secondly, we simplify the models by using zero-one liner programming. Thirdly, we use non-liner optimization and integer programming to create the objective function. Because of a great quantity of work, we use interior-point method as an example to increase efficiency. Also, we offer a way to get the optimum solution by using Lingo. The method and solving process provides a theories analysis foundation for optimization of generators and other related problems.

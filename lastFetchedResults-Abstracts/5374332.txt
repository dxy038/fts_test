Engineering students begin their first year with fundamental science and pre-technology courses which give little knowledge about engineering. As a consequence, some of the freshmen have no idea about engineering, and are lack of objective and interest in engineering. This paper presents how to help the freshmen have a general idea of engineering and an overall understanding of what they are going to study. One project activity outside curriculum in a LEGO lab and two outside-classroom DIY activity cases are presented. After three years practice, students had more interest and passion in engineering and showed their talents.

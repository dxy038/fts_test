The authors consider static and adaptive-decentralized optimisation of the performance of a distributed computing system with a central processor (CP), denoted by <e1>S</e1><sub>0</sub> loosely coupled to <e1>N</e1> peripheral processors (PPs), denoted by <e1>S</e1> <sub>i</sub>, <e1>i</e1>=1, . . ., <e1>N</e1>. Each PP receives a stream of Poisson job arrivals with a rate &#955;<sub>i</sub>. The arriving load at <e1>S</e1><sub>i</sub> is distributed between the CP and itself with probabilities <e1>P</e1><sub>i</sub> and (1-<e1>P</e1><sub>i</sub>) respectively. The service time distribution at each processor is arbitrary with mean 1/&#956;<sub>i</sub> and second moment <e1>E</e1>[<e1>Y</e1><sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>], <e1>i</e1>=0, . . ., <e1>N</e1>. The objective is to determine the probabilities <e1>P</e1> <sub>i</sub>, <e1>i</e1>=1, . . ., <e1>N</e1> so as to minimize the expected steady state response time of jobs. The authors solve the problem for the case of known parameters through nonlinear optimization techniques and develop a centralized computational algorithm. An adaptive technique for each PP to compute its optimal <e1>P</e1><sub>i </sub> is developed. The latter technique is useful when the system parameters are unknown a priori. In this case, it is assumed that the CP gives the processing time (of a remote job) to a PP when returning the remote job submitted by that PP. The sequences of estimates (computed by PPs) are shown to converge to the jointly optimum routing probabilities with probability 1 and in the mean square sense. Simulation results demonstrate the practicality of the adaptive approach

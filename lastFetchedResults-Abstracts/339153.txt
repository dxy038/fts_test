Objective
Many studies suggest that growth hormone (GH) is important for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. The objective of this study is to determine if the genetic absence of GH reduces hematopoietic function and recovery, by testing various points in hematopoiesis, from numbers and functional abilities of primitive stem cells to the maintenance of normal numbers of differentiated cells.
Materials and Methods

Analyses were conducted on blood and bone marrow to compare GH-deficient C57BL/6J-Ghrhrlit / Ghrhrlit (lit/lit) mice with their normal (lit/+) littermates. Flow cytometric analysis was used to measure numbers of HSC and progenitor cells based on antigenic markers. Spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) were examined to determine function of common myeloid progenitor (CMP) cells. Competitive repopulation assays were conducted to test whether normally functional HSCs are produced and supported in the lit/lit hematopoietic environment.
Results

The lit/lit mutant mice produced HSC and progenitor cells at least as well as their lit/+ control littermates. In CFU-S assays, the CMP from the lit/lit mice functioned as well as those from the lit/+ controls. Marrow cells from lit/lit mice repopulated irradiated recipients long-term better than did marrow cells from C57BL/6J+/+ controls; thus, HSC produced in the absence of GH can replenish irradiated recipients. When lit/lit mice were used as irradiated recipients, they supported HSC function as well as lit/+ control recipients did; thus, the lit/lit hematopoietic environment can support normal hematopoiesis.

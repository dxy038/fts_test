This paper evaluates the most common performance index criteria employed in Automatic Generation Control (AGC) using a detailed Load Frequency Control (LFC) model considering the physical constraints. Moreover, it introduces a robust and efficient performance index criterion capable of minimizing the settling time and overshoot of the system response to load changes which cannot be obtained by common performance index criteria. The results show that common performance index criteria such as Integral of the Absolute Value of the Error (IAE) and Integral of the Square of the Error (ISE) cannot be the best criteria to obtain minimal settling time and overshoot. Furthermore, some cases are observed where ISE is employed and best performance is achieved in terms of performance index criterion but the AGC scheme cannot remove the steady-state error completely. However, the proposed multi-objective performance index criterion has the best performance in minimizing settling time and overshoot simultaneously.

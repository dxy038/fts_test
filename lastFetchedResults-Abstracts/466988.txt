Objective: Chronic, painful bladder symptoms are diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for urologists and gynecologists. The aims of this study were to evaluate women with menstrual cycle-related changes in their interstitial cystitis symptoms, to treat them with hormonal manipulation, and to follow them long term. Study Design: The cases of women who were referred to a tertiary care center with interstitial cystitis and menstrual cycle exacerbation of symptoms were evaluated in a retrospective study. Fifteen women had undergone laparoscopy that was followed immediately by cystoscopy and bladder hydrodistension. Patients were then treated with leuprolide acetate or oral contraceptive pills. Results: Patient age ranged from 23 to 48 years. The duration of symptoms ranged from 1 to 26 years. Ten patients (67%) had findings of both interstitial cystitis and peritoneal endometriosis. Five of 15 patients (33%) had interstitial cystitis, but no endometriosis was found. Symptoms improved for 8 of 9 women who were treated with leuprolide acetate and for 5 of 6 women who were treated with oral contraceptive pills. Patients were followed up for an average of 55 months. Conclusion: Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered together with hydrodistension of the bladder for women with pelvic pain and irritative bladder symptoms that are exacerbated premenstrually. Endometriosis is often present in patients with these complex symptoms. This is the first report of hormonal treatment for chronic, cyclic irritative bladder symptoms; improvement appears to occur even when endometriosis is not identified by laparoscopy.

In practical project management (PM) decision problems, environmental coefficients and related parameters
are frequently fuzzy in nature, and a decision maker (DM) must simultaneously consider various
conflicting objectives in a framework of imprecise aspiration levels. This work focuses on developing a
two-phase fuzzy mathematical programming (TPFGP) approach for solving the multi-objective PM decision
problems in a fuzzy environment. The original fuzzy multi-objective programming model designed
here attempts to simultaneously minimize total project costs, total completion time and total crashing
costs with reference to direct costs, indirect costs, contractual penalty costs, duration of activities and
the constraint of available budget. An industrial case is used to demonstrate the feasibility of applying
the proposed approach to real-world PM decisions. Consequently, the proposed approach yields an efficient
solution and overall degree of decision maker (DM) satisfaction with the determined goal values.
Several significant management implications relating to the practical application of the proposed
approach are also presented. Overall, the main contribution of this work lies in presenting a two-phase
fuzzy programming methodology for solving real-world PM decision problems with multiple objectives.

In this paper, considering the fuzziness and roughness coexist in production practice, we put forward a kind of programming problem that objective function is fuzzy function, constraint conditions are rough sets. Using the restriction and complementary relationship of the principle and secondary indexes, and coupled with the compound quantification description for fuzzy number, we analyze the essential characteristic of fuzzy decision and use the fuzzy information of composite quantitative strategy, give a fuzzy rough programming model based on the comprehensive effect. Finally we give a concrete solution scheme.

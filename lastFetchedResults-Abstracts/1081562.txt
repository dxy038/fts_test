The objective of this work is to present experimental data that would show the effect of temperature, salinity, pressure and the presence of anti-scale additives on CO2 solubility in seawater. The paper examines the solubility of CO2 in real seawater and real seawater dosed with two different anti-scale additives. The study has been performed at temperatures between 60ºC and 90ºC and at pressures of 1 and 2 bar. To assess the effect of each anti-scale additive on CO2 gas solubility varying doses, 2–10 ppm of anti-scale additive have been used. For the purpose of the experimentation an experimental rig has been designed to ensure adequate contact between the gas phase and the aqueous phase. The continuous quantitative analysis of CO2 concentration flowing from the experimental rig was measured using a CM-5011 Carbon Coulometer. A mass balance was carried out to calculate the amount of CO2 absorbed into solution; Henry’s law constant was then calculated.

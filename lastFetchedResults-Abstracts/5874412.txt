This paper establishes a framework for designing fast, robust, and distributed algorithms for solving network utility maximization problems with coupled objective functions. We use two case studies in wireless communications to illustrate the key ideas: reverse-engineering the algorithm based on the KKT conditions of the optimization problem, and proving the properties of the algorithms using monotone mapping, contraction mapping, and supermodular game theory.

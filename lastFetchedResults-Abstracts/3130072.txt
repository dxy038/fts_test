Multi-shop rescheduling problem (MSRP) in the condition of rush orders is put forward. Disjunctive graph is employed to demonstrate the MSRP. The weighted mean flow time of both original jobs and rush orders are used as objective function. The weight for rush orders is much bigger than that of original jobs, so the rush orders would be produced as early as possible in the new schedule. Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to solve the MSRP. Numerical experiments are conducted. The results demonstrate that the rush orders are processed soon and the original jobs are not delayed much.

Endoscopic high-speed laryngoscopy in combination with image analysis strategies is the most promising approach to investigate the interrelation between vocal fold vibrations and voice disorders. So far, due to the lack of an objective and standardized analysis procedure a unique characterization of vocal fold vibrations has not been achieved yet. We present a visualization and analysis strategy which transforms the segmented edges of vibrating vocal folds into a single 2-D image, denoted Phonovibrogram (PVG). Within a PVG the individual type of vocal fold vibration becomes uniquely characterized by specific geometric patterns. The PVG geometries give an intuitive access on the type and degree of the laryngeal asymmetry and can be quantified using an image segmentation approach. The PVG analysis was applied to 14 representative recordings derived from a high-speed database comprising normal and pathological voices. We demonstrate that PVGs are capable to differentiate and quantify different types of normal and pathological vocal fold vibrations. The objective and precise quantification of the PVG geometry may have the potential to realize a novel classification of vocal fold vibrations.

Following a brief discussion of the nature of radio noise, the basic problems of radio-noise measurement are outlined. The need for standardization of method is emphasized, and a review is given of activities both here and abroad directed to that end. For comparison, the present status of standardization in the related field of acoustic-noise measurement is also discussed. The objective of "readings proportional to annoyance" is stated, and the need for subjective or listening tests to measure the degree of attainment of that objective is set forth. The paper concludes with a chronological account of the different instruments which have been used to measure radio noise, with descriptions of the fundamental characteristics of each. Particular attention is given to the new quasi-peak type of radio-noise meter with logarithmic scale recently standardized by the Joint Coordination Committee on Radio Reception, of the Edison Electric Institute, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and the Radio Manufacturers Association.

Silica fibres doped with thulium ions have provided efficient, tunable sources around 2 &#956;m, a wavelength of interest in the medical field and in laser radar. To date these have been low power devices, e.g., 2.7 mW in the first reported result. The authors used a germano-silica-based fibre doped with approximately 840 ppm of Tm<sup>3+ </sup>. Initial results were obtained with a core diameter of 8.6 &#956;m. This gave a cut-off wavelength of 1.7 &#956;m and ensured monomode operation at 2 &#956;m while allowing a good launch efficiency for the 1.064 &#956;m pump, which was launched into the fibre with a 10&#215; microscope objective. A resonator was constructed by butting cleaved fibre ends against dielectric mirrors. The output mirror had a nominal transmission of &lt;5% in the range 2.0-2.4 &#956;m and the input mirror was &gt;99.5% reflecting over the same range. Laser action was observed at 1.986 &#956;m, with a maximum power output of 209 mW for 1.3 W absorbed

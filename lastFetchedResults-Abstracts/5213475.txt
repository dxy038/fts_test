More electric aircraft technology enables the power supply of flight critical equipment such as the electronic flight control system. In the process of designing an electric power supply system in an aircraft, system safety and reliability are key requirements. Other important factors are low weight and low life cycle costs (LCC). Fault tree analysis is used to analyze a possible top event such as a malfunction for a primary rudder function. In a complicated design, a malfunction can be caused by a number of failures in different equipments or systems. The objective with the presented work is the feasibility of evaluating risks and the impact of a failure in a specific component, regardless of where in the system the component is located. The system is assumed to be part of an UAV for flights in populated areas

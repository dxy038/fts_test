This work is an attempt to develop a methodology that defines and delemines the "best" (thermodynamic-like) control performance deliverable by a control system to a plant whose model is uncertain, and whose inputs and outputs are constrained. A model-based control framework is used. The controller design problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization, and connections to other formulations are established. Nonlinear system representation through finite Volterra series is proposed. The results of our first attempts to solve the corresponding optimization problems are elaborated on.

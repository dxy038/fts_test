In this paper, a parallel system together with an adaptive workload balancing algorithm is proposed for view synthesis on multi-core platforms. Based on system level data parallelism, an adaptive workload balancing method is proposed for depth image based rendering by evaluating the number of non-hole pixels after warping. Experimental results demonstrated that with the proposed workload balancing algorithm, the workload difference among the cores is reduced by 90.65% on average for 2-core systems and by 79.57% on average for 4-core systems, respectively. Compared with the parallel system without the proposed balancing algorithm, synthesis speed is further improved by 7.5% for 2-core systems and 8.9% for 4-core systems at maximum, respectively, without degradation in the subjective and objective quality.

The measurement of tumor volumes is a practical and objective method of assessing the efficacy of a therapeutic agent. However, the relative accuracy of different methods of assessing tumor volume has been unclear. Using T<sub> 1</sub>-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (T<sub> 1</sub>-MRI), Evans Blue infusion and histology the authors measured intracranial tumor volumes in a rodent brain tumor model (RT2) at days 10, 16 and 18 after implantation of cells in the caudate putamen. There is a good correlation between tumor volumes comparing T<sub> 1</sub>-MRI and Evans Blue (r<sup> 2</sup>=0.99), T<sub> 1</sub>-MRI and histology (r<sup> 2</sup>=0.98) and histology and Evans Blue (r<sup> 2</sup>=0.93). Each of these methods is reliable in estimating tumor volumes in laboratory animals. There was significant uptake of gadolinium and Evans Blue in the tumor suggesting a wide disruption of the blood-brain barrier.

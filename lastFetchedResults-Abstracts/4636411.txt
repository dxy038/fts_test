An objective method of assessment of the pathological feature known as spongiform change has been devised and implemented using image processing techniques. A successful validation of the proposed algorithm has been performed by comparison with two neuropathologists. In a test set of 50 microscopic images a strong positive rank correlation (R<sub>s </sub>=0.91) was established between the performance of the new algorithm and one of the neuropathologists. The inter-person and intraperson variations observed for the neuropathologists were not found to be substantially lower than the variations between the computer and the neuropathologists

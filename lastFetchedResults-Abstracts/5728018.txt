Treaties such as the European Landscape Convention, are increasingly requiring an "objective " view of \´landscape quality\´ to determine where planning controls and special protections should apply.

This paper presents a method for automatically analyzing data in perspective view, with an example application to \´landscape quality\´ assessment.

Background and Objective: Ischemia reperfusion plays a major role in the development of pathological alterations in many different neuropathies. In this study, we evaluated the role of aminoguanidine (AG) in the functional recovery of the rat re-perfused sciatic nerve based on the behavioral scores. 
Materials and Methods: Seventy two rats were divided into 12 groups (n = 6). We used ischemic model by occluding the right common iliac and femoral arteries for 3 h with a silk suture 6-0 using the slipknot technique. Treatment groups (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) received 150 mg/kg of AG intraperitoneally 24 hrs after the induction of ischemia. After certain time intervals of reperfusion (48 hr, and 4, 7, 14, and 28 days), the function of the hind limb was assessed using behavioral scores based on gait, racing reflex, toe spread, pinch sensitivity, paw position ,and grasp.
Results: Hind limb functional deficits developed in all reperfused groups, and maximal behavioral deficit occurred on day 7 of reperfusion. The comparison of the control and AG groups revealed a better time course in recovery and improvement of the behavioral score. 
Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings suggest that post-ischemic administration of AG exhibits a neuroprotective effect against ischemiaâ€“reperfusion injury of sciatic nerve. However, further investigations are required to delineate the detailed mechanisms underlying the protective effect of AG in sciatic nerve injury.

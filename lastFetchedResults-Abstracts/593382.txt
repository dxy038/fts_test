Man`s belief in himself plays an essential part in his moral conducts. On this basis, this paper tries to explain the principles for one`s true understanding of oneself. As is understood here, belief in the dignity of human soul and belief in the depended existence of human being can be regarded as two main principles needed for a true comprehension of man. Relying on the two principles, one can attain a true conception of one`s attitude toward oneself and approve his or her conducts. Needless to say, there is a bidirectional relation between awareness of the dignity of human soul and moral conduct. More permanent the latter, more perfect the former and viceversa.

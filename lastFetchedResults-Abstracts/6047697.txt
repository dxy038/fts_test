This work presents the modeling, control and operation of a microgrid with three power sources and a storage system. The sources are solar photovoltaic, fuel cell and wind turbine. The objective of this work is to describe useful models of typical sources, the calculation of its parameters and control design of the power electronic converters of the energy sources. The modeling of the full system including all the stages of the converters is performed using PSCAD/EMTDC software package. The microgrid was designed to operate connected to the main network. The microgrid operated appropriately for different steady state operating conditions.

The author's main aim in the present paper is to carry out a comparative study of Ibn Arabi's views and those of Meister Ekhart's on the objective unity of Being. He holds that Ibn Arabi considers Being the same as God, and so does Meister Ekhart. In this regard, he refers to certain quotations from their works. The important point here is lbn Sina's considerable influence upon both of them.However, for some reasons, Ibn Arabi, never cites the name of Ibn Sina, while Meister Ekhart does so.

By integrating an interleaved bidirectional Buck/Boost circuit and a full-bridge LLC resonant circuit, a three-port converter is proposed for stand-alone PV/Battery system. The full-bridge switching unit is shared, and system cost and size are reduced. All primary switches operate under ZVS and all secondary diodes can achieve ZCS-OFF, leading to reduced switching losses. In addition, the input current ripple is small, which is favorable for interfacing renewable energy sources. Both the operation principle and operation modes are presented. Then this paper analyzes the gain and soft switching characteristics. Finally, a 500W prototype is built and tested to verify all considerations.

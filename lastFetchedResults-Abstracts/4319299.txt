Deals with the control of a sequential machine whose model is not precisely known. The objective is to design a controller that assigns to the machine a prescribed steady-state behavior. The results include necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a controller, as well as algorithms for its design. This work is motivated by potential applications in biology. It is an abridged version of Hammer (1994)

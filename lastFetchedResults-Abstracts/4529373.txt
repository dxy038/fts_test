Based on the demand of material, this paper first selected the evaluating factors about choosing suppliers, and analyzed the correlation among evaluating factors. Then, by combining the merits of Analytic Network Process (ANP) and entropy right, this paper proposed a method to calculate the compound rights of factors. The new method fully takes advantage of the relationship between factors and the objective information of each factor, which makes it closer to reality than Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), more suitable for supplier selection.

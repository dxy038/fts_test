Objective: To observe the effect on TGF-beta signaling pathway of the total flavonoids from Valerian a jatamansi Jones in hepatocarcinoma 22-bearing mice. Method: Hepatocarcinoma 22-bearing mice models were established, and the mice were randomly divided into model group, tegafur group, high-dose and low-dose Valeriana jatamansi Jones group. The gene expression difference chart in TGF-beta signaling pathway in difference groups were examined by using the gene chip technology. Results: Comparing with model group, there are 7 genes expression in TGF-beta signaling pathway were significant regulated in the other three groups. The expression of Cul1, E2f5, Myc and Smad7 was up-regulated, while the expression of Comp, Smad1 and Thbs4 was down-regulated. Conclusions: The total flavonoids from Valeriana jatamansi Jones can play a important role in regulating the abnormal gene expression in TGF-beta signaling pathway in hepatocarcinoma 22-bearing mice.

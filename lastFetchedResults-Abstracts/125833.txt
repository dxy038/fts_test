Introduction: Physical inactivity is one of the cardiovascular disease (CAD) risk factors. Watching '[V is a predictor of inactivity which is related to CVD risk factors and obesity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of leisure-time physical activity and television watching on atherosclerosis risk factors in housewives and employees.
Materials & Methods: In a cross sectional study performed as the first phase of Isfahan Healthy Heart program(IHHP) in Isfahan, Najaf-Abad and Arak by random clustering sampling, 6391 women were selected and divided into two groups: housewives and employees. Data were collected by standardized questionnaire and height, weight, blood pressure, blood glucose and blood lipids of participants were measured. Leisure-I ime Physical Activity (LTPA) was measured by Baecke questionnaire in MET-minute/week and TV watching (TM was measured in minute/week. Data were analyzed by using t-test, chi-square, multiple and logistic regression at P<0. 05.
Results: In group I(housewives n=6030 and group 2 (employees n=361) the mean of (LTPA) were 49.98+95.64 and 91.99+126.99 minutes/week respectively(P=0.001) and the mean of time spending for watching TV were 141.64+104.90 and 128.44+82.54 minutes/week respectively (P=0.005). In housewives LTPA had a significant negative relationship with triglycerid (TG) (P=0.02, ,8=-0.03), TV watching had a significant positive relationship with Body Mass Index (BMI) (P=0.00 8=0.04) and a .significant relationship with LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C) (P=0.03, /3 =-0.02). In employees there was no significant relationship between LTPA and TV watching with atherosclerosis risk factors. The odds ratio (95% CI) of being obese in relation to LTPA and TV watching were 0.9999 and 1.0010 respectively (P-0.382 and P-0.003).
Conclusion: According to the level of LTPA in women especially in housewives and its inverse relationship with TG, increasing their LTPA is recommended. Also the level of TV watching in housewives was higher than employees and it had a significant relationship with BMI. Therefore, decreasing the time spending on watching TV is an important way to control obesity for all women, specially for housewives.

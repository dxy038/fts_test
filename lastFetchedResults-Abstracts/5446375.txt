Currently, the satisfaction of user is becoming one of the most important topics concerned by the service providers. So we propose the approach method for the objective QoE measurement through the QoS parameters. The measurements and provisioning of the quality of service (QoS) are generally defined in terms of network delivery capacity and resource availability, not in terms of satisfaction to the end-user. The fundamental assumption behind such traditional provisioning is that the measured quality of service is closely related to the quality of experience (QoE) for the end-user. In the paper, we describe the QoS and QoE correlation model, and the QoE evaluation method using QoS parameter in the converged network environment is studied.

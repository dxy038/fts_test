Visible and near-infrared bidirectional reflectance factors at three view zenith angles in the principal plane of the Sun were collected throughout the growing season of 1992 with airborne radiometers during the HAPEX-Sahel experiment near Niamey, Niger. A coupled radiative transfer model for a discontinuous bush canopy over a continuous herb layer was used to estimate the fractional interception of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (f<sub>IPAR</sub>) by the vegetation canopies at several subsites. Results for the bush-fallow subsite located within the west central site are examined. The relationship between instantaneous f<sub>IPAR</sub> and canopy reflectances was investigated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a novel Normalized Difference Relative Shadow Index (NDRSI) which made use of the additional information obtained by sampling the canopy bidirectional reflectance. The NDVI showed a strong positive relationship with increasing f<sub>IPAR</sub> while the NDRSI showed an equally strong but negative relationship, indicating a potential for bidirectional indices such as NDRSI to estimate canopy variables such as f<sub>IPAR</sub>

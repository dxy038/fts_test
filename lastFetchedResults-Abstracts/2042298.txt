A study was initiated with the objective of evaluating the effects of sonication treatment on quality characteristics of apple juice such as polyphenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, catechin, epicatechin and phloridzin), sugars (fructose, glucose and sucrose), mineral elements (Na, K, Ca, P, Mg, Cu and Zn), total carotenoids, total anthocyanins, viscosity and electrical conductivity. The fresh apple juice samples were sonicated for 0, 30 and 60 min at 20 Â°C (frequency 25 kHz and amplitude 70%), respectively. As results, the contents of polyphenolic compounds and sugars significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) but the increases were more pronounced in juice samples sonicated for 30 min whereas, total carotenoids, mineral elements (Na, K and Ca) and viscosity significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) in samples treated for 60 min sonication. Losses of some mineral elements (P, Mg and Cu) also occurred. Total anthocyanins, Zn and electrical conductivity did not undergo any change in the sonicated samples. Findings of the present study suggest that sonication technique may be applied to improve phytonutrients present naturally in apple juice.

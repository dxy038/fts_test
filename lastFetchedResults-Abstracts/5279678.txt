In order to have high gain LLC resonant characteristics in the bidirectional power transfers, a bidirectional Secondary LLC (SLLC) resonant converter with auxiliary inductors and resonant capacitors is proposed. Auxiliary inductors and resonant capacitors are connected in the secondary side of the proposed converter. An 1kW prototyped bidirectional SLLC resonant converter for interfacing the 400V DC buses is built and tested to verify the validity and applicability of the proposed converter.

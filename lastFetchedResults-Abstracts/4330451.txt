Sound source separation techniques are known to be very useful in many applications. High fidelity and audio oriented applications are a challenging issue in this topic, however, existing algorithms are far from performing with such a high quality. In this paper, a subjective and objective evaluation are carried out for several algorithms designed for dealing with stereo music mixtures. The performance of these algorithms applied to acoustic scene resynthesis in a Wave Field Synthesis system is discussed.

Objective
rpose of this study was to describe causal attribution of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Japanese patients.

s-sectional study design was used.
g
tting for this study was 5 hospitals in urban areas in Japan.

enience sample of 155 patients admitted with AMI was used.
es
 attribution was assessed by a semi-structured interview. Known risk factors were assessed by medical record review and patient interview.
s
-two different primary causes for AMI were identified. Patients most commonly cited smoking, stress, and diet as risk factors. Except for smoking, Japanese patients did not identify their cardiac risk factors as a cause of their AMI. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, patients with a recorded history of coronary heart disease were significantly less likely to attribute their cardiac risk factors to their AMI (P &lt; .05).
sions
ive education and counseling of patients after an AMI must be coupled with their view of what factors put them at risk for future AMIs.

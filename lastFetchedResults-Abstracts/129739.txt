BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hinosan and diazinon are organophosphorate pesticides with contacting and penetrating effect that are used in agriculture against rice blast. Therefore, with regard to high use of these pesticides in the north of Iran, their harmful effects and high rates of infertility that are increasing every year in Mazandaran province. This study was performed to determine the effects of hinosan and diazinon on sperm parameters.
METHODS: This experimental study was performed on sperm samples of subjects who referred for semen fluid analysis (SFA). The sperms were affected by hinosan and diazinon (0.001&0.0001 concentration). The sperm number, motility and grading at the times of 0, 1, 2 & 4 were recorded. Data were analyzed by repeated measurement and compared with normal condition.
FINDINGS: Hinosan and diazinon can reduce sperm motility by time (p< 0.05), but the increase of dose had not significant effect on sperm motility decreasing. During the study, changes in increasing of grade I & grade II was statistically significant (p< 0.05), but these changes were not significant in grade III.
CONCLUSION: According to the findings, diazinon and hinosan can exert their reducing effects on number and motility of sperm as a time dependent profile. These effects are not dependent to the dose of the materials.

Objective.The familial aggregation of lipid levels, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) was studied in schoolchildren in Cuenca, Spain.

Methods.A cross-sectional observation study was made of 307 schoolchildren of both sexes, age range 9-12 years, from three schools in Cuenca, Spain, and of 346 parents. Social and demographic variables, weight, height, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were evaluated.

Results.The Spearman coefficients of correlation for total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and BMI for parents and daughters were 0.34-0.42 (P< 0.01). These coefficients of correlation for parents and sons were lower (P> 0.05). The coefficient of correlation for blood pressure in parents and sons was low (P< 0.05). None of the variables showed any coefficient of correlation between spouses. The sexual differences in the correlations between the levels of the different variables were confirmed by multiple regression analysis. Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels and BMI accounted for larger percentages of variability in these parameters in daughters than in sons. The paternofilial aggregation of HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels was weak. The only variable that accounted for a significant variability in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) was weight in children of both sexes.

Conclusions.The familial aggregation of lipid levels and body mass index showed sex differences. The paternofilial aggregation of blood pressure was weak. There was no relation between spouses.

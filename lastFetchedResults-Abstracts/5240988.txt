An objective of this research is to optimize the designing parameters of a 6-DOF parallel manipulator required the large workspace for the sophisticated and complicated work on the basis of mechanismÂ´s compactness. The method uses a genetic algorithm with respect to the maximization of tranlational/rotational workspaces and isotropy of mechanism to obtain the optimal linkage parameters. It is studied for fifteen cases which are divided by combination of translational and rotational workspaces corresponding to the range of translational motion and tilt angle of the end-effector. To decide the best model in the total optimized cases, compactness of mechanism, translational workspace, rotational workspace on the boundary of translational workspace, and global conditioning index (GCI) as kinematic performances, and then kinematic performances of best model are verified by comparing to those of the preexisting model

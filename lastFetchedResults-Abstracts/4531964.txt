The achieved work on the propagation channel of Wireless Body Area Networks has reached today a significant level. However, a large dispersion of reported results, notably as regards Path Loss is observed, both in anechoic chamber and in indoor premises. This work is motivated by this context, the main objectives being on one hand to explain (at least partly) and on the other hand to reduce this dispersion. Measurements have been performed in an anechoic chamber with two human subjects over a 1-12 GHz frequency band. A comparative analysis of the Path Loss involving nine UWB antennas of various types is presented for the Hip-to-Chest and Hip-to-Wrist scenarios. A statistical analysis of the corresponding dataset with a parametric approach with respect to various UWB frequency bands, antenna distance from the body and arm position is exposed next. Parametric models depending on either parameter extracted for various bands, are finally provided. The main objective of is to reduce the variances of the resulting statistical models through a parametric approach and categorization of antennas.

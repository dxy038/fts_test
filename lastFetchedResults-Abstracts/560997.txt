The objective of this work is to clarify the place and role of the "right" in a legal order and its connection therein. Is the right beyond legal order or does it find its validity and its justification within the legal order? What changes or challenges does the lack of "right" or its rejection create in a legal order? Why is that the realists and legal sociologists do not accept it? Have they managed to generate a just legal order? Have the metaphysists who insist on metaphysical justice, established a realistic legal order? If the "right" is a value, does it contradict with an empirical view move away legal order from reality? Does elimination of the value from legal order, not direct it towards excessive-realism and especially etatist-realism?

The use of lessons learned in project management is still not fully satisfactory. The current web-based project management systems (WPMS) mainly support project lifecycle with no much consideration to project initiation and closing. The main objective of this paper is to incorporate the features of semantic web and features of wiki technology to capture project lessons learned knowledge. This paper also illustrates how the semantic wiki can utilize structured collaboration knowledge sharing to improve closing and initiation phases in project management. A prototype has been developed using semantic MediaWiki in virtual environment, real project data obtained and inserted into the system. A questionnaire has been designed and used for data gathering in an Egyptian engineering and construction company. Questionnaire analysis showed that semantic wiki improved lessons learned capture process.

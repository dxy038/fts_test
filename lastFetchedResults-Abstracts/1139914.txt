This paper describes one of the potential applications on utilising the Revisited General Method (RGM). The RGM procedure allows for the identification of an isolethal processes for a specified product. The objective of this research study was to analyse the potential implementation of simultaneous sterilisation utilising the RGM procedure.

In order to maximise the output from a specified plant location processing different products and container sizes, isolethal processes were identified for various product/containers from which a common set of process conditions could be chosen for simultaneous sterilisation of different product lots in the same retort.

The opportunity to carry out simultaneous sterilisation and the possibility to employ alternative processes (same F value) provides flexibility to optimise retort utilization. Within a pre-established range of F values, it was possible to obtain all the combinations for simultaneous sterilisation. The potential implementation was analysed studying 16 different products.

This procedure is of special relevance for companies that normally work with many different products at the same time.

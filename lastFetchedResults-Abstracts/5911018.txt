The increasing number of Web service providers with numerous functionally similar or same Web services produced a new problem of choosing a suitable Web service for the requester based on his expectations. The quality of service (QoS) can be used to select and rank functionally similar Web services. In this paper we define four Web service provider qualities to distinguish functionally similar and qualitatively competitive Web services. The main objective of this paper is to explore the mechanism which breaks the tie that may arise among functionally similar and qualitatively equivalent (competitive) Web services during Web service selection and ranking.

Iran is mostly mountainous topography , tectonic and seismic conditions too varied geological and climatic conditions , natural conditions has for a wide range of major landslide . landslide in Iran has a natural hazard cause many human loss and economic damage every year. Indetification of factor affecting existing of landslide as well as its zonation in the given watershid is one of the basic tools for landslide control and selection of appropriate and effective soloution as well.                                           
Sarand chai basin is in east Azarbaijan and weastern region Harris. And is subbasin of the (Aji chai) lake. The geographic coordinates of the study area is along the eastern longitude 46,31,14 to 46,37,12 and north latitude 38,13,45 to 38,37,12 . The study area covers an area of 76/ 02 km2 in the weastern part sarand chai . Due to the important issues of landslides and mass movements in the basin. The main objective of this study is landslide hazard zonation in area.                                                                        
  Important factor in the occurrence of landslides , were (slop , aspect ,elevation , rainfall, landuse, litology, distance from drainage, distance from fault). Using geological maps ,topographical and satellite imagery in GIS format places landslide were on the map. And to analyze the data obtained from the LNRF model as conceptual used. Final landslide zonation map based on three different classes(low, medium, high). Landslide zoning the area showed that the high risk area is allocated to the largest area(49/31 percent) and dispersion landslides associated with the aspect factor.

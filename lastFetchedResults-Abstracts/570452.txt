Implementation of total quality management plays an important role as a progressive phenomenon in educational and cultural organizations. The main objective of this study is to compare the current situation versus desirable perspective of academic libraries in Yazd University in implementation of total quality management evaluated by managers and staff of the libraries. Independent t-test results suggested the managers have estimated the situation (M= 3.33). The independent t-test results to assess the difference in employees' attitudes about the desirable situation, was obtained as 4.33, compared with that of the managers which was 4.22. Apparently, the employees have higher expectations over the desirable situation rather than the managers. The dependent t-test results to assess the difference in managers’ attitudes about the current versus desirable situation, showed a meaningful difference of (p < 0.01). The employees’ attitude towards the desirable situation (s= 0.39, M= 4.15) had a meaningful difference with their attitudes towards the current situation (s= 0.65, M= 3.04). People’s attitudes towards the current and desirable situation, had a high meaningfulness among all the eleven principles of quality management (p <  0.01). Meaningful differences were observed in multivariate analysis of variance aiming at assessing the effects of position and qualifications on the current eleven principles (p <  0.05). The results of multivariate analysis of variance to assess the effects of position and qualifications on the current eleven principles suggested that the effect of position on the components of desirable situation was not meaningful. Meanwhile, the results in effects of qualification suggested that individuals with different qualifications and university degrees had diverse attitudes towards the principles regarding the desirable situation.

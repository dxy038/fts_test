This paper discusses the performance of two different line voltage stability indices previously studied in literature the Line stability Index (Lmn) and Voltage Collapse Point Indicators (VCPI). The objective is to identify which index is most suitable for being used in control applications. The results presented here will provide a first indication. The indices were tested in the IEEE 39-bus system. The RTDS simulator was used to create data sets and the indices where computed using the control block components for real time operation. This method was chosen to have the values of the indices available for future development of control algorithms based on stability indices.

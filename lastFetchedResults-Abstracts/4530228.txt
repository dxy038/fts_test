The main objective this paper is to control NBTI (Negative Biased Transistor Instability) and leakage current in SRAM by the combination special techniques known as recovery boosting and zero aware asymmetric SRAM cell. NBTI commonly observed in P-channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor when stressed with negative biased voltage at elevated temperature. This paper proposes a combination of recovery boosting and zero aware asymmetric SRAM cell. This combination is used to reduce power and leakage current. Compared to conventional SRAM and the modified SRAM, the proposed multi SRAM shows power saving of 21.25%.

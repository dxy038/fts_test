Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the level of plasma high sensitive c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in preeclampsia and to compare hs-CRP levels between normal pregnant women, mild preeclamptic, and severe preeclamptic women. Materials and Methods: Serum hs-CRP levels were investigated in 40 cases of normal pregnant women, 37 cases with mild preeclampsia and 38 cases with severe preeclampsia in the third trimester of pregnancy. Venous blood samples were collected at admission to the hospital at least 6h before delivery for measurement of hs-CRP by immuno turbidometric method. The student t-test was used for comparison of proportions.
Results: There were significant difference in the means serum hs-CRP between normal pregnant women and mild preeclamptic women (P<0.05). Serum concentration of hs-CRP were significantly higher in severe prceclampsia (p<0.05) than normal pregnancy. There were also significant differences in hs-CRP levels between mild and severe
preclampsia (P<0.05). Conclusion: We found higher levels of hs-CRP in mild and severe preeclampsia than normal pregnancy and also these results suggest that hs- CRP are increased more in severe preeclamsia than mild preeclampsia , and may be useful in prediction and diagnosis of the severity of preeclampsia.

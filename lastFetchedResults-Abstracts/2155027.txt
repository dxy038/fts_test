The objective of this research paper is to assess the biosorption potential of almond shell residues for methyl orange dye. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model described the dye biosorption process with a good fitting. The relationship between the pseudo-second-order model constants and the biosorption performance was also evaluated. The equilibrium data fit well with the Langmuir isotherm model presenting that the biosorption was the monolayer coverage of dye on the biosorbent and the homogeneity of active sites for dye binding on the biosorbent surface. Based on the Langmuir model, a single-stage batch biosorber was also designed to predict the biosorbent mass for certain percentage dye removal. Besides, the standard Gibbs free energy change was also calculated to define the nature of biosorption process. These results revealed that the utilization of almond shell residues as dye biosorbent could be an interesting option from both environmental and economic point of view.

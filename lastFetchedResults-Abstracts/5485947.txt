Today, thanks to a variety of electronic media, our cognitive world has been expanded to a practically unlimited degree. Since 1960s, with the rapid growth of the automated evaluation system (AES), many benefits, such as frequent writing practice, immediate scoring, objective reporting, instructional tools, form-focused feedback, context-focused feedback, formative feedback, and diagnostic feedback, etc. have been provided for English writing teaching. Thus it is important to have a good understanding of how to integrate AES into English writing teaching. This paper, based on a classroom report, first introduces how to use Writing Roadmap&#8482; (WRM) 2.0, published by CTB/McGraw-Hill, to generate feedback on college English writings in EFL classroom and develop the learnerÂ´s cognitive process of writing, and then discusses its advantages and issues that need attention.

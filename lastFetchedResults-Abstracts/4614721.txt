Hypertext interchange and bidirectional conversion between text and hypertext are largely considered two different applications. In the authorsÂ´ research, a system (SGML-MUCH) for importing and exporting SGML documents into and from a collaborative hypermedia system - MUCH (Many Using and Creating Hypermedia) system - is developed. The SGML-MUCH system is able to support both hypertext interchange and text-hypertext bidirectional conversion. The SGML-MUCH system is developed following the SHyD model, which uses international standards SGML and HyTime as intermediate formats. An SGML DTD based on a widely accepted hypertext reference model- the Dexter model, is defined to represent both text and hypertext documents. Text and hypertext documents in different formats can be imported into the MUCH system by going through the SGML representation

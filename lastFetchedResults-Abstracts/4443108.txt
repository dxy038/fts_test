Analytical optimisation design methods generally have weights which are adjusted by the designer to get a good design. To combine analytical and numerical methods, one can simply use numerical search techniques to find `good´ weighting parameters for the analytical optimisation problem. This note briefly describes how one such numerical search technique, the method of inequalities (MOI), can be combined with analytical optimisation design methods such as McFarlane and Glover´s loop-shaping design procedure (LSDP) to provide a multi-objective mixed optimisation robust controller design method. Its application to the design of an unknown plant is described

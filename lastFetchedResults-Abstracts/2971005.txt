We formulate the logical topology design of wavelength-routed ring network as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. For a given traffic demand matrix, the objective function of the optimal problem is to minimize the average packet hop distance. We take the bidirectional ring network as an example. For different network architecture parameters, the numerical results and analyses were provided. In addition, we also compare the case of a unidirectional ring network with bidirectional ring network. The optimal results can be used to maximize the utilization of network resource in the ring network design

This paper investigates the setpoints compensation for a class of complex industrial processes. Plants at the device layer are controlled by the local regulation controllers, and a multirate output feedback control approach for setpoint compensation is proposed such that the subsystems can reach the dynamically changed setpoints and the given economic objective can also be tracked via certain economic performance index (EPI). First, a sampled-data multivariable direct output feedback proportional integral (PI) controller is designed to regulate the performance of the subsystems. Second, the outputs and control inputs of the plants at the device layer are sampled at operation layer sampling time to form an EPI. Thus the multirate problem is solved by a lifting method. Third, static setpoints are generated by real time optimization (RTO) and the dynamic setpoints are calculated by the compensator according to the error between the EPI and objective at each operation layer step. Finally, a rougher flotation process model is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this paper, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is used to find the optimal location of thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) and its parameter in order to increase total transfer capability (TTC), reduce total transmission losses and reduce voltage deviation. This multi-objective optimization problem is solved by using the MOPSO with sigma method and encouraging results are obtained.

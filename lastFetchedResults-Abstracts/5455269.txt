In this paper, a scheduling algorithm with memory function suitable for homogeneous tasks on heterogeneous computing has been studied. With the objective to find the best point between matching and load balancing, the concept of memory has been used to improve the existing algorithm, and the simulation of our algorithm has been performed. The results demonstrated that our new algorithm has shorten the makespan greatly, and better scheduling performance has been achieved.

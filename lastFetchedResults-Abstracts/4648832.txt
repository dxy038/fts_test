In the paper we introduce a group members arrangement as a new parameter for analyzing multicast routing algorithms finding multicast trees. We also propose a new multicast routing algorithm without constraints. The objective of STA (Switched Trees Algorithm) is to minimize the total cost of the multicast tree using a modification of the classical Prim´s algorithm (Pruned Prim´s Heuristic) and the SPT (Shortest Path Tree) algorithm that constructs a shortest path tree between a source and each multicast node.

This paper illustrates the process used for capacitor placement on an existing radial distribution feeder with an objective of reducing the downstream power loss while minimizing total cost. The Loss Sensitivity Factors are used to determine the candidate buses for capacitor placement and an experimental methodology is used to find the exact optimal capacitors locations and capacitors sizes. The method is tested on an existing 13.2kV feeder. Simulation is done using CYME and results are presented.

The biosensor and sample collection unit was developed to be portable, easy to use and applicable in third world countries. The sensor detects the presence of niacin, a metabolite specific to M. tuberculosis. Experimental results show that the sensor was able to detect M. tuberculosis in 5 to 7 days. The results have demonstrated the capability of using this optical technique to perform rapid detections.

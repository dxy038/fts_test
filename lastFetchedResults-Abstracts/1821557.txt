Objective
g breath contains elevated concentrations of volatile sulphur components (VSCs). Therefore, morning breath is recognised as a surrogate target for interventions on breath quality. Nevertheless, factors influencing morning breath are poorly understood. Our aim was to evaluate concentrations of VSC at the time of awakening.
s
edure was developed to collect breath samples at home. Intra- and inter-person variations were determined in two small studies based on measurements of hydrogen sulphide, methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulphide in healthy volunteers.
s
t levels of VSC were found directly after waking up, followed by a significant decline afterward. Considerable day-to-day variation was found, but could not be linked to dietary intake. A significantly higher concentration of H2S and CH3SH was observed in the group of female subjects compared to males.
sions
orning breath is used as a target for interventions, breath collected at the time of or shortly after waking up is preferred over breath collected later during the morning. Gender plays an important role in VSC levels, and should be taken into account.

An important factor to be considered in electric power system expansion planning is the security of service that the system is able to provide. In restructured power systems, variables such as agents' profit or Locational Marginal Price (LMP) variances are considered in transmission expansion planning. To have a secure network this plan would be refined for simulated contingencies. This paper proposes a new method for transmission expansion planning in which the grid owner is responsible for expansion while benefiting a fair benefit percentage. The defined objective function of transmission expansion tries to maximize Global Welfare (GW) and reduce the construction cost as well as the cost of security enhancement. For different scenarios of expansion; at first, the cost of security enhancement is calculated and then it is considered in the objective function of expansion. None of the existing methods have considered the optimum security enhancement cost into the objective function along with the other factors of transmission expansion planning under market environment. To implement the proposed method on large scale networks, the ordinal optimization is used and simulation results are	&
performed for the modified "Garver 6-bus test system for expansion" and "IEEE 24-bus reliability test system".

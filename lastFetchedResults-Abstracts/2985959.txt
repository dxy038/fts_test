Presents the existing compensation designs for the ALFA adaptive optics system that is implemented on the 3.5 m telescope at the Calar Alto observatory (operated by the Max-Planck Institut f&#168;ur Astronomie (MPIA) in Spain). The ALFA system uses a modal compensation architecture. This architecture is presented with the objective of highlighting the modal compensation design problem. The compensator design is developed. The paper presents both comparative-and scientific results obtained with the compensator designs

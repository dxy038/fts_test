Next, we propose classifications of alert broadcasting services and systems, followed by two case studies where system characteristics and supporting services are described in terms of the concepts proposed in the paper. Finally, the future direction of the alert service and system is presented. The paper will contribute as a reference to the development for emergency alert service standards for various broadcasting systems.

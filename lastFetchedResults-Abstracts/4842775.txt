In this paper, we focus on fuzzy multilevel multiobjective programming problems with fuzzy domination structures where multiple decision makers in a hierarchical organization have the membership functions for their own objective functions and the corresponding fuzzy domination structures. After introducing decision powers and the solution concept based on the &#194;&#191;-level sets for the fuzzy convex cones which reflect fuzzy domination structures in membership space, we propose an interactive fuzzy decision making method to obtain the satisfactory solution which reflects not only the hierarchical relationships between multiple decision makers but also their own preferences for their membership functions. An interactive process is demonstrated by means of an illustrative numerical example.

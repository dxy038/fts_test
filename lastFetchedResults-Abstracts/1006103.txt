Objective(s): The use of biogenic selenium nanoparticles for various purposes is going to be an issue of considerable importance; thus, appropriate simple methods should be developed and tested for the synthesis and recovery of these nanoparticles. 
Materials and Methods: In this study, a fungus was isolated from a soil sample, identified as Aspergillus terreus and used for extracellular synthesis of selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs). UVâ€“Vis spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum studies were carried out to confirm Se NPs formation within 60 min. Dynamic light scattering and scan electron microscopic methods were also used to characterize both size and shapes of the Se NPs. 
Results: The results show that spherical particles with average size of 47 nm were formed by adding a culture supernatant of A. terreus to selenium ions solution. 
Conclusion: This approach appears to be an easy and appropriate method for extracellular synthesis of small Se NPs. Extracellular synthesis of small Se NPs has not been reported yet

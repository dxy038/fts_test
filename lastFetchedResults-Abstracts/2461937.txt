IFMIF (International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility) will be a fusion dedicated facility producing a large amount of neutrons with the appropriate energy spectrum to test materials and subcomponents for DEMO and future Fusion Power Plants.

the high flux area of IFMIF will be devoted to reduced activation structural materials for first wall and blanket, the medium flux area will be dedicated to functional materials for breeder blankets. In particular, the Liquid Breeder Validation Module (LBVM), will host experiments related with functional materials for liquid breeder blankets. Since IFMIF neutron spectra have been intended to fit the most irradiated areas of a fusion reactor in the high flux area, the irradiation conditions in the LBVM placed in the medium flux area of IFMIF have been assessed. The effect of some neutron shifter/reflector components to optimize the neutron spectra have been evaluated in order to find out the proper irradiation conditions for functional materials for liquid breeder blankets.

ore, the objective of this report is to summarize the neutronic calculations developed to evaluate the viability of IFMIF neutron source to perform relevant irradiation experiments on functional materials for liquid breeder blanket concept for future nuclear fusion power reactors (ITER, DEMO). The irradiation parameters evaluated for this purpose are: the tritium production for liquid breeder material (Pbâ€“17Li) and the damage dose (dpa) and gas production to damage dose ratios for Al2O3 and SiC functional materials.

in conclusion is that, it is possible to perform relevant irradiation experiments on functional materials for liquid breeder blanket concept for the future nuclear fusion reactor DEMO. Nevertless, the use of some shifter components will be needed to optimize some irradiation parameters.

Spatio-temporal data model is a data model which completely simulates the objective world in terms of time, space and semantic features. It is an abstraction and representation of the objective real world. Spatio-temporal data model which focuses on the state description based on the time stamps is most natural for the space data with typical characteristic at all time points. This paper introduces four types of spatio-temporal data models applied the Beijing urban history data model which describes the spatial characteristics for urban form and urban spatial structure of Beijing city based on the events during history process. These four types of models focus on state description. Their advantages are that it is natural, simple and easy to be implemented for describing discrete urban outline and material space factors which are changed discretely.

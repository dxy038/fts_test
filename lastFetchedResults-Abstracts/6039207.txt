This paper deals with the problem of reliable guaranteed cost control problem for nonlinear singular systems governed by a set of differential-algebraic equations. A more practical model of actuator failures than outage is adopted. The objective is to design a reliable guaranteed cost state feedback law, which can tolerant actuator failure, such that the cost function of the closed-loop system is guaranteed to be no more than a certain upper bound. Based on the Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI), the sufficient condition of existence and design method of desiring reliable controller is presented. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

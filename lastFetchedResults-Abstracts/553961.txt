The objective of this study was to validate the Iranian version of the Social Achievement Goal Orientation Scalc and test the Social Achievement Goal Orientation theory in the context of Iranian students. A total of 403 Iranian high school students completed a Social Achievement Goal Orientation Scale and an Achievement Goal Questionnaire. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the hypothesized model of social achievement goals. The fit of the proposed three-factor model was promising and moderate support for the three factor structure of social goal orientation was found using scores from an abbreviated 13-item SAGOS. Graded Response Model showed an information function that was peaked at the upper end of the scale, indicating that severe social goal orientation Is measured with most precision. Convergent validity for the new measure of social achievement goals was established. Findings generally supported the trichotomous framework of the social achievement goal orientation theory with Iranian students. Consistent with the academic goal orientation theory, findings indicated that social mastery and performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals had positive relationships with academic goals.

The author proposed an effective wavelet-based ECG compression algorithm (Rajoub, 2002). The reported extraordinary performance motivated us to explore the findings and to use it in our research activity. During the implementation of the proposed algorithm several important points regarding accuracy, methodology, and coding were found to be improperly substantiated. This paper discusses these findings and provides specific subjective and objective measures that could improve the interpretation of compression results in these research-type problems.

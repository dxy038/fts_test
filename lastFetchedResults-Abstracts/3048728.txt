The objective of this paper is the design of a stabilizing switching control scheme for a class of nonlinear systems. Such systems are relevant to nonlinear plants represented by means of a finite set of nonlinear discrete-time models. A finite set of receding-horizon control laws is defined for each of the nonlinear discrete-time models representing the plant. A rigorous stability analysis is carried out yielding theoretical constraints to be satisfied by the switching strategies to guarantee stability properties. Simulation results on a case study of practical relevance are also presented showing the effectiveness of the multi-model switching control scheme.

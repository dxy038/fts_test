An investigation of ceramic humidity sensing elements based on titanium dioxide with dopants of PbO, Bi2O3 and Na2CO3Â·10H2O has been performed. To study the complex influence of dopants and sintering temperature on the parameters and characteristics of the ceramic humidity sensors, an experimental design has been performed. A multi-objective optimization based on the method of general loss functions was carried out. The optimal composition of dopants and sintering temperature were determined to obtain ceramic sensors with optimal parameters. Experimental samples based on this optimal composition and temperature were prepared and investigated.

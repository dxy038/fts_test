Customer knowledge can enhance company value by gathering, managing, and sharing knowledge. Companies continuously transform customer knowledge into company value through knowledge management (KM) that can provide more value for their customers and stakeholders than their competitors can. Gathering, managing, and sharing customer knowledge can be a valuable managerial method to raise the competence of enterprise. The objective of this research is therefore to propose a customer knowledge management (CKM) model to transform customer knowledge into company value. A case study for global retailer is used to examine the feasibility and effect of the proposed CKM model. Results show that the CKM model can effectively reduce the required time of maintenance to improve the customer satisfaction.

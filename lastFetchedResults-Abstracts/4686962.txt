This article summaris the most sipificant results applicable to the angular (AD) and space (SD) diversities cxpriment, started at the beginning of May 1991 and stili in progrss - on a 60 Km line-of-sight mia digital radio link in the north of Italy. The primary objective of this test is to evaluate the performances of thcsc fading countermeasurements in order to give the opportunity to compare them each other. Specal attention has been dedicated to the role of elevation position of the dual beam antenna and the angular separation of the two beam. The achieved results have shown that AD could be a suitable solution to counterbalance multipath fading activity also if it sounds to be less effective than SD, at least in the adopted dual beam antenna set ups.

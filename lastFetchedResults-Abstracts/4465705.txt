This paper presents an efficient Differential Evolution (DE) based solution for harmonic elimination pulse-width modulation (HEPWM). The aim is to solve for the set of transcendental equations that determine the switching angles of the HEPWM waveform. The objective function of the DE is designed to minimize (to near zero) the selected harmonics and at the same time allows for the fundamental component of the output voltage to be controlled independently. To verify the method, simulation is carried out using MATLAB simulink. The computed switching angles are applied to a three phase voltage source inverter. Typical results are shown and discussed.

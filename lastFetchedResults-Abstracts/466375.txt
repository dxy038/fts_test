Objective: We performed a meta-analysis to examine the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing postoperative infections among nonlaboring women undergoing cesarean delivery with intact membranes. Study Design: A computerized literature search was performed with MEDLINE. Studies were included if they contained data on patients undergoing cesarean delivery in the absence of labor and ruptured membranes. Only randomized trials with a placebo control group were included. Results: Seven studies were found. Use of antibiotics decreased the risk of all infectious outcomes reported. When the results of 4 studies were pooled, prophylactic antibiotic use was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative fever (relative risk, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.44). A similar reduction was noted for endometritis in 4 studies (relative risk, 0.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.38). Two studies reported on wound infection and showed a trend toward a protective effect (relative risk, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-1.45). Conclusion: The prophylactic use of antibiotics reduces the risk of postoperative infectious complications after cesarean delivery even in the population at lowest risk.

[6 SM 421-8 PWRD, T-PWRD January 1997]. The goal of the present study was to perform a series of statistically designed tests on several types of short air gaps under lightning voltages of nonstandard waveshapes. The objective was to compare the critical breakdown voltage levels, V<sub>50</sub>, and the volt-time characteristics of these short air gaps under lightning voltages of various waveshapes. The results of the critical breakdown voltages were presented previously. The results of the volt-time characteristics are presented in this paper.

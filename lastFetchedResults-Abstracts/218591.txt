Objective: Although in vitro studies have shown that high concentrations of glucose
can induce dysmorphogenesis of the embryonic kidney, the possible adverse effects
of exposure to intrauterine hyperglycemia on kidney development, especially in regard
to nephrogenesis, has not been evaluated.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of maternal diabetes on glomeruli
structures of the offspring, focusing on the following parameters: glomeruli volume
and number, mesangium volume, mesangial cell number and glomerular capillary
volume.
Materials and Methods: Before mating, fifteen female Sprague Dawley rats, divided
into three groups, were diabetes induced by a single intraperitoneal dose of 65 mg/
kg streptozotocyn (STZ). After 30 days of breast feeding, ten offsprings from each
group (two per mother) were randomly selected for kidney removal. The kidneys
were weighed and their tissues were processed for light microscopy. Glomerular features
were evaluated quantitatively using dissection as well as the Cavalieri method
and were then compared with sham and control groups.
Results: At birth, the mean body weight of diabetic mothers’ offspring (DO) was significantly
lower than that of the control group’s offspring (CO) and sham group’s offspring
(SO) (p=0.001), however, the mean body weight of the 30 day-old DO was not
lower than that of CO and SO (p>0.05). The total renal volumes, cortical volumes,
glomerular mean and total volumes, total mesangeal volumes, total capillary volumes
and total glomerular numbers were significantly lower in the DO than in CO and SO
(p<0.05). The numerical density of glomeruli and mesangial cells per glomeruli were
significantly greater in DO than in CO and SO (p<0.05).
Conclusion: We concluded that intrauterine hyperglycemia is accompanied by a
nephron deficit which may not be compensated within the first 30 days after birth.

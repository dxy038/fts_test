Objective: It has been greatly attempted to learn more about chemical information on finger prints using new vehicular technique use for the detection of a variety of substances, including narcotic drugs and medicines, as well using nano particles bound to specific antibodies. Over the last few years, the sensitive techniques of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry have been found for the detection of residues in samples with very low values. Method: In this study, sampling from fingerprints was taken through optimized methods with chemical solvents and then by the techniques of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the detection of chemicals in the fingerprints. Samples included a group of volunteers aged 30 to 40 years. Sampling was done by means of glass slides and extraction with solvents of sodium hydroxide, methanol, and chloroform solutions. Analysis and detection of debris, including nicotine, Tramadol, Methamphetamine, and Cocaine was fulfilled using derivatization and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Findings: The results showed that the use of derivatization as a sensitive method along with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry can detect very small amounts of nicotine in existing samples. Conclusion: The results of this research can be used as a way to detect drug residues in finger prints and ultimately they can be important in providing a standard method for the analysis of these residues.

In this paper we introduce a mathematical modeling tool (called classic general model: CGM) for the general problem of hardware-software codesign so that different partitioning algorithms can be easily and quickly developed and compared in this same framework. CGM introduces a simple but efficient model which supports single/multiprocessor, primal and dual approaches, fine or coarse granularity. CGM determines solutions by stating mapping, implementation and permutation arrays. For judging among solutions of a certain algorithm, an objective function is defined. After modeling the problem by CGM we have a classic problem: finding the best values for elements of three arrays to optimize the objective function. We have modeled an object-oriented partitioning algorithm based on CGM. The promising results show the benefits of the CGM in development and comparison of partitioning algorithms

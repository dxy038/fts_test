The objective of this study is to compare the temperature control, occupant comfort, and energy usage for four thermostats with different time constants installed on a wall in a real building zone equipped with a commercial variable air volume (VAV) unit with hydronic reheat coil and a direct digital control (DDC) system. This study was performed using experiments on a VAV system controlled by thermostats with different time constants. The experimental results verify that a sluggish thermostat causes higher energy consumption, less occupant comfort, and a lack of temperature control

This paper analyzes the performance and complexity of four heuristic approaches applied to a synchronous multicarrier multiuser detection (MuD) of single/multiple transmit antennas and multiple receive antennas code division multiple access (S/MIMO MC-CDMA) system. The genetic algorithm (GA), simulation annealing (SA) and Tabu search (TS) heuristic algorithms (HA) in a single-objective optimization form were considered. Monte-Carlo simulations showed that the performances, after convergence, achieved by the four near-optimum HA-MuD S/MIMO MC-CDMA are identical. However, their computational complexities differ depending on the operation system conditions. Therefore, the HA-MuD complexities were carefully analyzed in order to determine which one has the best trade-off between bit error rate (BER) performance and implementation complexity aspects.

Background and Aim: Chest X-Ray (CXR) is a simple and low-cost imaging modality for recommendation or diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Radiographic findings of pulmonary TB could be considerably variable in different age groups.  The goal of this study is to evaluate the incidence of radiologic findings of pulmonary TB in pediatric and adult age groups and to assess their dissimilarities.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective descriptive-analytical study, we reviewed CXR of the patients with pulmonary TB during 5 years, between September 2005 and August 2010, at against TB Center of Birjand University of Medical Sciences. The relation between age and radiographic findings, including lymphadenopathy, pneumonic consolidation, calcification, pleural effusion, atelectasia, bronchectasia, cavity and necrotic lesions, milliary pattern and normal CXR, was assessed. 
Results: Of 197 patients which included 126 (64%) were female and 71 (36%) were male. Thirty two patients (16.2%) were children ( aged 0-13 years) and 165 patients (83.8%) were adults (?14 years). In pediatrics group, lymphadenopathy was the most radiographic finding (87.5%) and in adults group, pneumonic consolidation was the most radiographic finding (78.2%).
Conclusion: In pediatric pulmonary TB, lymphadenopathy is the most common radiographic finding, in comparison to adults group in which pleural effusion, cavity and necrotic pulmonary lesions, bronchiectasis, calcification and milliary pattern are significantly more common.

Recently a single-input-dual-output unidirectional matrix converter has been proposed based on unidirectional indirect matrix converter and nine-switch inverter. This paper develops and generalizes (Uni- and) Bi-directional single-input-dual-output matrix converters using a (Uni- or) Bi-directional current-source rectifier (CSR) and dual-output inverter (nine-switch or Five-Leg inverter). Features such as sinusoidal input and output, unity input power factor and bidirectional and unidirectional power flow can be provided with the proposed converters. In addition, in this paper, the traditional space vector modulation (SVM) strategy for indirect matrix converter is generalized for single-input-dual-output matrix converters (SIDO-MC), supporting both constant frequency (CF) and different frequency (DF) modes. For this purpose several switching vector placement patterns are proposed and used in SVM method. Simulation results verify validity and performance of the proposed converters and SVM method.

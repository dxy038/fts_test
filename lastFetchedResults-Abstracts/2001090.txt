In this paper, the concept of stability for fuzzy control systems
is discussed from a mathematical point of view. Our main objective
is to investigate the stability of fuzzy linear systems with bounded
input and bounded output. Necessary and sufficient conditions for this
kind of stability are presented by a theorem and it is illustrated by
solving an example.

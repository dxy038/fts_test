It has been shown that if the impulse response at the switch side of the input/output filter networks in a resonant transfer system has zeros at integer multiples of the switching time, then the steady-state performance of the system is given, simply, by the open-circuit current transfer characteristics of the filters. Because the impulse response is uniquely related to the current transfer function, the design problem becomes one of meeting system passband and stop-band loss specifications with a suitably chosen current transfer function, while at the same time, ensuring that this function is such that the impulse response is of the correct form. The design method presented in this paper achieves this objective with the help of automatic digital computation. The method is such that by controlling the magnitude of the maximum approximation errors to the impulseÂ´response requirement, control is retained over the magnitude of the pass-band loss ripple and the magnitude of the minimum stop-band loss.

The objective of the experiments was to evaluate the effects of porcine ovarian cortex cells (pOCCs) during in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oocytes on IVM of porcine oocytes, in vitro fertilization (IVF) parameters and subsequent embryo development. The pOCCs was cultured in the 500 μl TCM199 without hormone until the confluence, and then cultured in 500 μl TCM199 supplemented with hormone for 12 h before the oocytes added. Porcine oocytes were co-cultured with the pOCCs monolayers in the co-culture system for 44 h, following fertilized in the mTBM for 6 h. Finally, the presumptive zygotes were cultured for 144 h in the NCSU-23 supplemented with 0.4% BSA. The results showed that matured M II oocytes in the co-culture group were higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Although penetration did not differ between the co-culture and control groups (P = 0.481), polyspermy declined in the co-culture group (P &lt; 0.05), whereas male pronucleus (MPN) formation was improved in the co-culture group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). More blastocysts developed in the co-culture group than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05); however, the cleavage rates and the mean number cells per blastocyst showed no significant difference between the treated group and the control group (P = 0.560 and 0.873, respectively). In conclusion, the presence of the pOCCs monolayers during IVM enhanced the maturation quality of the porcine oocytes, reduced the polyspermy, increased the percentages of MPN formation and blastocyst, but the blastocyst quality was not improved.

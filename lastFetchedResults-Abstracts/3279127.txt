In this paper, our aim is to present existing methods and techniques related to the artificial vision which is an active subject of research. In this work, we elaborate a recognition system of objects in an image for a sorting application. The corner stone of our work is based on the recognition and sorting of objects (geometrical shapes) in an image in artificial vision. The application of these images is achieved using a fixed camera having a regular and permanent field of vision with a consequent angle on a conveyer which holds the objects to be observed. The Objects´ recognition process requires knowledge of our camera characteristics. In order to calibrate this camera, we propose to use a simple Web camera configured to get a photo of the conveyer´s centre. The objective is to seek for objects in the images, which are considered as unitary and not sequences of images. In this case, the development of automatic methods is required to ensure the sorting rapidity but with additional complex processing to make it efficient. The analysis determines simultaneously both the recensement and arithmetic counting, then the detection of faults based mainly on the comparison of the object shape with the shape defined previously and using this operation the sorting is made. A complementary system equipped with sensors and programmable automata is used to eject each object into corresponding panel.

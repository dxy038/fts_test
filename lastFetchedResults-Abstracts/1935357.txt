BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vitex agnus castus is used as alternative medicine for treatment of endocrine disorders in women. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of vitex agnus castus in ovarian histomorphology in rat with induced polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 
METHODS: In this study, 48 Sprague Dawley rats (200±20 g & 10 weeks ages) with normal estrous cycles were randomly divided into four groups: Control (received distilled water), Sham, PC and PT. To develop PCOS letrozol was administrated (1mg/kg) by gavage for 28 days to the PC and PT groups. Sham and PT (after induction of PCOS) groups received 365 mg/kg vitex agnus-castus extract orally by gavage for 30 days. At the end of experiment, rats were sacrificed, both of ovaries were dissected out, and prepared section of ovaries stained with Hematoxylin-eosin for histological study. 
FINDINGS A significant decrease in number of preantral follicles (PAF), antral follicles (AF) and corpus luteum was observed in PC group compared to other groups, but number of primary follicles did not show significant difference between groups. Diameter of antral follicles, thickness of theca of follicle and tunica albuginea of ovary increased significantly in PC group compared to other groups. However thickness of granulosa layer decrease in PC group compare to other groups. Treatment by vitex agnus castus resulted to increase number of PAF and AF, corpus luteum (6.42±0.64 vs.3±0.18), decrease number of cystic follicles (1.28 ±0.42 vs. 5.66±0.49) and decrease thickness of theca of follicle and tunica albuginea of ovary and increase thickness of granulosa layer of AF.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that vitex agnus castus in administrated dose has positive effect on the condition of ovarian follicles in the experimental PCOS.

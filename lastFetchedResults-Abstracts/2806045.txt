The objective of this paper is to present the current status and possibilities of microgrid in Nepal. There are many possibilities of microgrid implementation, interconnecting micro hydro power plants (MHPs). Hybrid microgrids could also be formed interconnecting MHPs with wind turbines or photovoltaic systems. The challenges and benefits of implementing a microgrid are presented in this paper. The paper also presents the case of first pilot microgrid installed in Nepal.

An integrated converter is a synthesized converter based on the overall system integration, which is simplified by the system objective and can implement the system functions similar to the discrete converters. An integrated converter consists of converter sets; each converter set has a special function defined by the designer. A family of DC/DC boost based integrated rectifiers with two active switches can be derived by the integration concept. A boost+push-pull integrated converter is introduced and derived. To regulate the output voltage and shape the input current, a new simple digital control method is applied. In contrast to the conventional analog control methods, the principal idea of this new digital control algorithm is to use real-time analysis and estimate the required on time of the switches based on the value of the output voltage, input inductor current, and input voltage. The high capacitor voltage stress caused by the compatibility of the integration can be reduced by two methods. Pulse regulation control method is used to control this converter. Simulation results are presented.

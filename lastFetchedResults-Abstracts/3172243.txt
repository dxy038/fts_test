This paper considers the problem of stability analysis with an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance for a class of production networks of autonomous work systems with delays in the capacity changes. The system under consideration shares information between work systems and the work systems adjust capacity with the objective of maintaining a desired amount of local work in progress. An appropriate Lyapunov function is utilized to establish some delay-range-dependent conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities for the stability analysis of the network.

Despite facing ups and downs throughout history, mysticism is still alive and like every astonishing idea, it has its own proponents and opponents in a way that some regard it as the nature and essence of religion and faith and some as that of profanity and infidelity. From among the criticisms brought against sufism, the ones that has emphasized the practical and behavioral aspects of sufism (a Sufi criticizing another Sufi) depicted a more equitable and at the same time objective portrait of the damages to mysticism comparing to the ones that has criticized the theoretical and intellectual viewpoints of gnosticism and mysticism. To this end, in this paper, we have attempted to study the criticisms brought forth in Masnavi, which is one of the recognized references in the domain of mysticism.

Self-management and self-healing capabilities are the keys to Wireless Mesh Networks(WMNs). In this paper, a cloud computing based management system for WMNs is proposed, its goals are to optimize the network control for long-distance and large-scale WMNs. The systemÂ´s objective is carried out on our test bed, the management cloud gathers data from various nodes in WMNs, and creates dynamic situation diagrams which can be used to assess the performance of the whole networks and perform fault predictions, then WMNs can achieve self-management and self-healing.

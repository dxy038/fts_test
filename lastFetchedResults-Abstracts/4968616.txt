A testing strategy was proposed to deal with the parallelism of unit testing based on the priority of function. The influence of parameters, global and local variables on the proper realization of the control flow of function was analyzed in this paper. The quantitive mathematical model of the weight influencing factor was built, and a directed acycline graph with weight was generated by combining the function´s control flow chart. Further more, the tested function´s critical path was given by the algorithm based on AOE-net. After a test case was done, the hypo-critical path was chosen until the test criterion was guaranteed. The experiment results showed that with a scheduled test time among modules, the software test efficiency was improved achieving the objective of software quality assurance(SQA).

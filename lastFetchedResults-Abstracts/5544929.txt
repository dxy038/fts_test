According to the characteristics of the operational behavior and runtime state of application sever, the resource consumption time series are observed and modeled by fuzzy wavelet network (FWN) with fuzzy logic inference and learning capability. The objective is to model the extracted data series of systematic performance parameters to predict software aging in application server. The dimensionality of input variables of FWN is reduced by principal components analysis (PCA), and the structure and parameters of FWN are optimized with adaptive genetic algorithm (GA). Judging by the model, we can get the aging threshold before application server failed and preventively maintenance the application server before systematic parameter value reaches the threshold. The experiments are carried out to validate the efficiency of the proposed model and show that the aging prediction model based on FWN with adaptive genetic algorithm is superior to the neural network (NN) model and wavelet network (WN) model in the aspects of convergence rate and prediction precision

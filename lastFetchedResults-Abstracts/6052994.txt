We define and investigate the problem of multi-resource manycast over optical burst switched (OBS) networks for supporting distributed computing applications. In multi-resource manycast, each destination has multiple computing resources, and each source generates requests that require multiple resources. For a given request, the problem is to select a set of destinations that have the required available resources and to And routes to these destinations. This problem differs from the traditional manycast problem in that different destinations have different resource availability. The objective is to minimize the resource blocking rate, which results from burst contention in the OBS network and from resource unavailability at the destinations. We investigate various approaches to implement multi-resources manycast over OBS networks, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes through simulation.

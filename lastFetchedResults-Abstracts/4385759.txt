A model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for dc-dc boost converters is proposed in this paper. The proposed control scheme is implemented as a current-mode controller. Two control loops are employed, with the inner loop being designed in the framework of MPC. Two different objective functions are formulated and investigated. The control objective, i.e., the regulation of the current to its reference, is achieved by directly manipulating the switch, thus a modulator is not required. As a prediction model, a hybrid model of the converter is used, which captures precisely the continuous and the discontinuous conduction modes. The proposed control strategy achieves very fast current regulation, while exhibiting only a modest computational complexity. Simulation and experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

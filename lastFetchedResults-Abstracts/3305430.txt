To solve the capacity vehicle routing problem (CVRP) more effectively and save related resources, this paper proposes a multi-objective joint optimization problem of loading problem and CVRP (LCVRP), and builds the appropriate mathematical model. We design a multistage algorithm to solve it. In the first stage of the algorithm, we give a novel loading algorithm to work out the minimum number of transport vehicles. Numerical experiments manifest that we can get the minimum vehicles in LCVRP, and the satisfactory solutions of LCVRP are better than those of CVRP in some instances of VRPLIB. The experiment part of this paper shows the testing for E022 instance in detail.

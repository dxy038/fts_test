In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient resource allocation method to simultaneously improve both downlink and uplink energy efficiency (EE) for time division duplex (TDD) systems with carrier aggregation (CA). We aim at EE tradeoff between downlink and uplink by optimizing the power and bandwidth allocation on each carrier component (CC) for each user. The objective function is a sum of several fractional functions, therefore, a novel nonlinear sum-of-ratios programming technique is used to solve it. We first transform the problem into an equivalent and better tractable one and then propose an iterative algorithm to find the global optimum solution. Numerical results show that our method can converge with an acceptable number of iterations and achieve flexible EE tradeoff between downlink and uplink.

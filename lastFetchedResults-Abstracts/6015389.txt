In this paper, an exact inversion of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models based on manipulation and interpretation of fuzzy rules is proposed. First, the considered fuzzy model is decomposed into MISO elementary subsystems. Then, the inversion of each subsystem is studied. In this framework, the original MISO subsystems are transformed into SISO ones, whose rule conclusions are determined according to the suppressed input variables at each sampling time. The objective of the proposed transformation is simply to make easier the inversion mechanism. Finally, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology, two simulation examples are given

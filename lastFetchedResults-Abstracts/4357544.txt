The interface design of software used on Home Appliances targeted at satisfying passengerÂ´s physiology and psychological needs when operating the machine to the maximum extent is a complicated synthetic topic which embracing ergonomics, visual communication design, user experience design, behavior psychology, cultural studies of the consumer, optics and Chromatics and so on. So, it is very difficult for us to find a unified criterion which can be used to estimate the interface design of software used on Home Appliances. In order to further guarantee that the evaluation process of the interface design of software used on Home Appliances is scientific and Objective, this paper established the evaluation index system firstly centered around the user experience, then used AHP method to compute the weight of each index and constructed the evaluation analytical model of the interface design of software used on Home Appliances. This method effectively overcomes the subjectivity and arbitrariness in the evaluation process. Finally, we also have designed software which can use the method to evaluate the design.

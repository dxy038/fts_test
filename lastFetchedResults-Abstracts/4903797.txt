The dynamic nature of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) may result in a cluster of nodes being isolated from the remaining network, especially when deployed in a terrain with blockages. In order to facilitate scalability and to provide connectivity between partitions that might occur in wireless networks as a consequence of mobility, we can envision a ´range extension´ network that consists of airborne communication platforms, or geostationary/low-Earth-orbit satellites. These airborne/satellite nodes maintain communication links with specific ´gateway´ nodes among the mobile ground nodes. To communicate with a node that is geographically distant or belongs to a different network partition, an ad hoc node can relay its data packets through an appropriate mobile gateway and via the range extension network. If we envision that the MANET is divided into different groups and a mobile gateway is deployed for each such group, an objective then is to determine the trajectory of the mobile gateway to best serve the ad hoc group to which it belongs, in terms of network performance metrics such as throughput and latency. In this paper, this problem of computing the optimal position for a gateway is reduced to a linear optimization problem by means of some simplifying but realistic assumptions. We suggest methods that may be deployed to enable the gateway to follow this optimal trajectory as closely as possible (within the practical constraints imposed by its velocity and maneuverability). Simulation results for various scenarios show a 10-15% improvement in the throughput and latency, per gateway domain, if a gateway has a dynamic trajectory whose locus follows the computed optimal position, as compared to a gateway that is statically placed at a regular position, or to a gateway that has a random trajectory.

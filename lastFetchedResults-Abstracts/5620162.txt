Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research is an increasingly important pillar of national security and military interest. A high fidelity discrete event simulation is prerequisite to any systems implementation. The synchronous parallel environment for emulation and discrete event simulation (SPEEDES) is a versatile and powerful tool that can be used for realization of this objective. A suite of five expert measures the efficiency a parallel UAV swarming SPEEDES application. Results indicate that the conservative time management produces more than twice the speed up as optimistic time management.

OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to investigate whether the demonstrated beneficial effects of antibiotics on maternal and neonatal morbidity are altered when glucocorticoids are part of the treatment of preterm premature rupture of membranes. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a metaanalysis of five published, randomized trials of antibiotic treatment in preterm premature rupture of membranes in which glucocorticoids were used as additional treatments and compared the results with those of a previously published metaanalysis of antibiotic treatment in preterm premature rupture of membranes, which excluded studies with concomitant glucocorticoids. Primary outcomes included chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, neonatal sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and neonatal mortality. A logistic regression analysis was performed to test whether glucocorticoids significantly influenced the effect of antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: Among the 509 patients from five trials on antibiotic and glucocorticoid treatment published between 1986 and 1993 antibiotic therapy did not show any significant effect on any of the outcomes analyzed. In contrast, antibiotic therapy without concomitant use of glucocorticoids significantly reduced the odds of chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, neonatal sepsis, and intraventricular hemorrhage by 62%, 50%, 68%, and 50%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis showed that glucocorticoids significantly diminished the effect of antibiotic treatment on chorioamnionitis and neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSION: Glucocorticoids appear to diminish the beneficial effects of antibiotics in the treatment of preterm premature rupture of membranes. A careful selection of patients who are likely to benefit from both therapies is therefore recommended. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:899-908.)

The employment of the finite element (FE) method in conceptual and detail design of a secondary deck platform for trailer bodies is presented. The main objective of the project is to design a versatile, light and cheap secondary deck. To assist the designer with sufficient means for the concept generation and evaluation process, the FE method is used in order to gain fair structural analysis data. Assistance from the computer software stimulates creativity, reduces the time required in the design process, and eventually increases probability to gain customer satisfaction. This approach is precise enough for comparison purposes at this stage of the design process. The structural data gained is compared mainly with weight and access criteria.

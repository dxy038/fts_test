We use the Hamiltonian algorithm to quickly align optical axes that must be precisely positioned with multiple degrees of freedom when coupling optical devices. The Hamiltonian algorithm utilizes the mixing properties of a dynamical system and efficiently searches for the global minimum of the objective function in an optimization problem. Simulations show the mixing effects when searching for the global minimum. Coupling fiber experiments show that using this algorithm optical axes with multiple degrees of freedom can be aligned efficiently and that several fibers can be aligned in parallel. The practicality of our technique is also shown by experimentally coupling array fibers

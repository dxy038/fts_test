One of the main themes and topics of children and teenagersâ€™ poetry in our country is God. Since audience of such poems enjoys lesser mental faculties and experiences to comprehend abstract concepts so various tools should be made objective and tangible in such implications for them. The existing characteristics, vocatives, bounties and prayers in nursery rhyme indicate that nursery poets have adopted nature as a tool for depiction and characterization of God for children and teens. Sky with its belongings, rain, cloud, star, sun and moon as well as earth with mount, plane, sea and the existing flowers and plants and group of animals and often livestock, especially birds and in particular butterfly, nightingale and pigeon are the main core of those images, which were portrayed by nursery poets. God is present in most detailed natural phenomena in nursery rhyme and it is interwoven with all segments and elements. God has been observed in nursery rhyme by pantheist view that is the bequest of mysticism.

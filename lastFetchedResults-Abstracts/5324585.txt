The objective of the semantic Web is to develop better ways to document semantics and extract knowledge from the Web, making the Web easier to process by both machines and humans. Semantics Web services are more progressive and potential to increase semantically the interoperability between service partners than traditional business services.However, at present,Web Service and Semantic Web are primarily using ontology concept and relation to reveal literal meaning, but the implicit meaning of terminologies are poor to comprehend in describing service parameters and methods as well as the profile of participant. In this paper, we propose a pragmatics oriented approach to understanding the semantics of concepts used by service partners. We address how to model and map concerning context, then present a planning approach to understanding the real intention of service partners.

Considering the parameter uncertainties of the fuel slosh, a nonlinear adaptive control scheme was proposed for a kind of liquid-filled spacecraft to both control the motion of the spacecraft and suppress the fuel slosh modes, where the fuel slosh modes were characterized by a multi-pendulum model. For the solid-liquid coupling model, a Lyapunov-based designed method was proposed to directly develop the control law. The parameter adaptive law was designed using the adaptive control method and a parameter projection method was proposed to ensure the estimates of the parameters in a suitable range. Using a two-pendulum model in the simulation, the simulation results showed that the designed controller could achieve the expected control objective and illustrated the effectiveness of the controller.

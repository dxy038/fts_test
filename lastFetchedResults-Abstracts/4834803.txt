Organizations increasingly depend on the innovation behaviors in order to get the best possible outcome from information systems that have been put into place. However IS research literature shows few studies in understanding the patterns of system usage behaviors that yield innovative or novel ways of using organizational information systems. This paper firstly examines the past information system usage literature and concepts. Based on explorative &amp; exploitative innovation theories from organizational management literature, then the paper develops a conceptual model of information system innovative usage and organizational long-term and short-term performance. With the questionnaires from over one hundred enterprises in China, we find that the proposed model is empirically tested and three hypotheses are supported. The results show that exploration &amp; exploitation of IS usage are positively related to organizational performance. Finally, the paper gives some discussions. The main objective of the paper is to highlight the significance of innovation in information system usage research.

The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of initial pH, the adsorbent size and the contact time on the efficiency of adsorption of copper ions from copper sulfate solution with corncob particles. The surface morphology of adsorbent was observed using a scanning electron microscope, both before and after the adsorption. The porous and tubular structure of the corncob indicated the capability of corncob in adsorption of metal ions of the solution. In order to study the equilibrium sorption extent, Langmuir model and Freundlich model were used. The maximum Cu (II) binding capacity, qmax, calculated from Langmuir isotherm model was increased with increasing the initial pH and decreasing the adsorbent size. In addition, the results revealed that contact time is another important factor in sorption, the maximum adsorption occurred at the first 20 minutes and after that the sorption rate decreased and finally it reached a constant value after 2 hours.

We use the example of the allocation of tours to mailmen to illustrate the general idea that interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) can be applied to a range of task allocation problems where the task performers are humans. In this application of IEC, each participant is presented only with the portion of solution corresponding to his/her task (tour). In addition to the subjective evaluation of solutions by the participants, the solutions presented to the participants are pre-optimized according to objective criteria.

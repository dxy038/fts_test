The brain continuously receives the visual information or the information corresponding to some stimulus and elaborates and perceives this information. It uses electrical signals to process this information and then analyze it. The encoding of this complex information into simple electrical signal is done by the fundamental building block in the brain, called neuron. This paper deals with the effect of bidirectional communication with the neuron in the brain that is supplying the signals coming from the neurons externally and artificially to the brain and producing the same effect as that of the original signal. The paper also describes the hypothesis being investigated using data from an epileptic patient. The idea stated in the paper can help in developing an implantable neural system that can co-exist and bidirectionally communicate with the living brain tissue and thus substitute for the lost cognitive function due to damage and / or disease

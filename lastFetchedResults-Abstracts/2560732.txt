Genitourinary tuberculosis usually occurs in young adults and the middle-aged and is very uncommon
in the paediatric population. It generally presents with haematuria, pyuria, irritative voiding symptoms and flank
pain; presentation as a renal mass is highly unusual. We report a two-year-old girl who was referred to the Nil Ratan
Sircar Medical College, Kolkata, India, in June 2014 with abdominal pain. Subsequent radiological investigations
revealed a left renal hypoechoic mass lesion. A left nephroureterectomy was performed on suspicion of a Wilmsâ€™
tumour. Histopathology indicated an epithelioid granuloma with lymphocytic infiltration, suggestive of a tubercular
aetiology. A Mantoux tuberculin skin test was positive; however, there was no evidence of tuberculosis detected
elsewhere in the body and the source of the infection could not be identified. A diagnosis of renal tuberculosis was
made and the child was treated with antitubercular drugs. The patient was asymptomatic at a six-month follow-up.

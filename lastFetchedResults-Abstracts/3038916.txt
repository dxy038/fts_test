The Differentiated Services architecture provides basic building blocks for quality of service (QoS) support within the Internet. Definition of scalable QoS mechanisms in the data path was a main objective. However, in order to provide guaranteed end-to-end reservations on demand the management of highly dynamic resource reservations by control entities (e.g., those performing admission control) must be scalable as well. This paper presents the DARIS architecture that provides a scalable management for QoS-based end-to-end services in the Internet. It defines a novel concept of dynamic and hierarchical aggregation of reservations, which operates on the network level of autonomous systems (AS). The aggregation concept reduces the managed reservation states as well as the number of signaling messages that have to be processed by management entities in intermediate AS. The aggregation concept was evaluated in detail using simulations including real Internet topologies.

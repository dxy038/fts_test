Cultural algorithm is a well suited optimization technique for several multiobjective optimization problems. In this paper this cultural approach is used to solve reactive power planning problem considering the real power losses and the deviation of a given voltage schedule combining as a multi-objective model. Var control method is the key of optimal reactive power flow problem. In this paper the proposed method expands the cultural algorithm with a crossover operation to handle the non-linear optimization. Optimization of RPP problem is done with continuous and discrete control variables such as generator bus voltages, setting of on-load tap changer of transformers and the reactive power output of the compensating devices placed on different bus bars. The proposed algorithm is applied on IEEE 14 bus test systems to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results obtained by the proposed technique are compared with other population based heuristic techniques.

The experimental information available in the literature regarding the patterns of breakage of agglomerate materials is scarce, particularly in dynamic loading. The primary objective of this paper is to present our findings on the breakage patterns of the agglomerates and the interparticle bond. A high-speed digital video imaging technique is used here to gain an insight into the impact behaviour of individual agglomerates against a target plate. Several breakage patterns are observed. Agglomerates may suffer localised damage only, with the disintegration of the damaged zone into very fine debris, or localised damage combined with fracture. The frequency of occurrence of these patterns depends on the impact velocity and agglomerate structure. The pattern of breakage affects significantly the size distribution of the impact product. An investigation of the breakage of individual interparticle bonds is also presented. Two forms of failure are observed, internal (cohesive) and interfacial (adhesive) failure. The morphology of the fractured surface depends greatly on the type of breakage. Internal breakage shows irregular surfaces due to crack jumping, whereas interfacial failure produces clean, smooth fracture surfaces. These observations should provide the necessary foundation for the development of a fundamental model of agglomerate breakage.

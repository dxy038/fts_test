This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm for analyzing the best mix of distributed generations (DG) in a distribution network. The multi-objective optimization aims at minimizing the total cost of real power generation, line losses and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and maximizing the benefits from the DG over a 20 years planning horizon. The method assesses the fault current constraint imposed on the distribution network by the existing and new DG in order not to violate the short circuit capacity of existing switchgear. The analysis utilizes one of the highly regarded evolutionary algorithm, the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) for multi-objective optimization and MATPOWER for solving the optimal power flow problems.

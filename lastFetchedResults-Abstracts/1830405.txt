Recently full factorial design approach has been used to assess the recycling potential of a given
waste. The objective of this study is to identify the significant factors and interactions involved in maximizing
compressive strength of concrete when chromium waste is used as admixture. In this respect, experimental
factors at two levels, which are admixture type (chromite/ chromite+ superplastizer), admixture percentage (5-
15%) and cure duration (7-28 days), are selected as possible candidates affecting the compressive strength.
The modeling technique presented in this paper is based on 23 full factor experimental design and can easily be
implemented to see the effect of any input factor on a given response variable. According to the full factorial
analysis, at the 5% percentage level when Naphtalene sulfonate is added to concrete with chromite waste, the
compressive strength will be good enough after 28 days. The results demonstrate that chromite waste after
neutralization can be used in construction industry.

The modeling of power transformer faults and its application
to performance evaluation of a commercial digital power
transformer relay are the objective of this study. A new method
to build an EMTP/ATP power transformer model is proposed in
this paper. Detailed modeling of the transformer relay is also discussed.
The transient waveforms generated byATP under different
operating conditions are utilized to evaluate the performance of the
transformer relay. The computer simulation results presented in
this paper are consistent with the laboratory test result obtained
using an analog power system model.

A supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is an integrated platform that incorporates several components and it has been applied in field of power systems and several engineering applications to monitor operate and control a lot of processes. In future electrical network, SCADA systems are essential for an intelligent management of resources like distributed generation and demand response, implemented in smart grid context. The main objective is to manage the residential industrial consumption, reducing or curtailing load to keep the power consumption in or below a specified set point, imposed by the customer and the generation availability.

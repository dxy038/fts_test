This paper proposes a methodology for the load shedding scheme for electrical power system by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The process AHP is a structured technique for dealing with complex decisions. In this paper, an effective method that can solve a multiple criteria and multiple objective decision-making problems was introduced to the load shedding scheme in electrical power system problem in order to gain a scientific and objective maintenance scheduling. Firstly an AHP model is built up on the base of analyzing correlative factors with an example given to indicate how the AHP is applied.

Automatic optical inspection (AOI) of micro drill bit becomes more and more important with the rapid expanding of printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing industry. Distinguished from most traditional manual inspection approach, AOI is time-saving, objective and non contact. In this work, a pattern classification method is proposed for the AOI of micro drill bit in PCB manufacturing, in which three features of drill bit blade are extracted for classification. In order to be independent on the clamp that can guarantee the exact position of drill bit blade for photography, and reduce the cost of the AOI system, an image registration method is used to align the drill bit blade, which can also make the feature extraction much easier. The evaluation result indicates that the approach works well for the AOI of micro drill bit. It is real time, more detailed result providing and low requirement on photographic device.

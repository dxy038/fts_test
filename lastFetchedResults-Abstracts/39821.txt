The objective of this study was to evaluate correlations between annual average daily traffic (AADT) and storm water runoff pollutant concentrations generated from California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) highway sites. Analyses of data collected from the Caltrans fouryear (1997-2001) highway runoff characterization program revealed that, in general, pollutant concentrations from urban highways were higher than those found from nonurban highways. For a limited number of pollutants, however, the concentrations from nonurban highways were found to be higher than the concentrations from urban highways. No direct linear correlation was found between highway runoff pollutant event mean concentrations and AADT. However, through multiple regression analyses, it was shown that AADT has an influence on most highway runoff constituent concentrations, in conjunction with factors associated with watershed characteristics and pollutant build-up and wash off. The other noticeable factors shown to influence the accumulation of pollutants on highways were antecedent dry period, drainage area, maximum rain intensity, and land use.

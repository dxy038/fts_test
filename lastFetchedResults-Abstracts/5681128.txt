Visual analytics is an active research topic in both 2D image/video and 3D graphics/animation. Given a constrained resource budget, the performance of compression algorithms can be enhanced by incorporating human perceptual factors into the quality assessment processing pipeline. However, human perception can be applied not only to visualization, but also language and other sensations and related cognitive processes. In this paper, we review how objective and subjective evaluation metrics can be applied in graphics visualization and transmission, and suggest future research trend of applying perceptual factors in a broader range of applications including clinical interfaces and the rapidly developing 3DTV research.

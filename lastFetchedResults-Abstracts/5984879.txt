Chaotic synchronization can be transformed to design a suitable control law for the asymptotic stability of chaotic synchronization error system at the origin. ItÂ´s necessary to discuss an approach of chaotic synchronization based on exponent stability, for exponent stability is one of more superior asymptotic stability types. A theory of exponent stability was introduced into chaotic synchronization, and a chaotic synchronization approach based on exponent stability of the chaotic synchronization error system was discussed , when all the states of the objective chaotic system are measurable. The approach based on exponent stability for chaotic synchronization was presented on the basis of Lipschitz conditions or the bounded property, which makes the chaotic synchronization error satisfy exponent stability, and the capability of chaotic synchronization be improved, while the chaotic systems arrive at chaotic synchronization. Based on theoretic analysis, simulation results had shown its capability is satisfying and will have a perfect application prospect when applied in the fields of chaotic secure communication etc.

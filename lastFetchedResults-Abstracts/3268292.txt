This paper addresses the resource allocation problem in collaborative relay-assisted OFDMA networks. Recent works on the subject have mainly considered symmetric source-to-relay and relay-to-destination resource allocations, which limits the achievable gains through relaying. In this paper our focus is two-fold. Firstly, we consider the problem of asymmetric radio resource allocation, where the objective is to maximize the system throughput of the source-to-destination link under various constraints. In particular, we consider optimization of the set of collaborative relays and link asymmetries together with subcarrier and power allocation. Secondly, we pay attention to the effects of imperfections in the channel-state information needed in the resource allocation decisions. We derive theoretical expressions for the solutions and illustrate them through simulations. The results validate clearly the additional performance gains through asymmetric cooperative scheme compared to the other recently proposed resource allocation schemes.

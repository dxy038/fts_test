A novel planar dual-band monopole antenna with circular polarization (CP) operation is proposed. By appropriately introducing an inverted L-shaped strip-sleeve shorted at the ground plane, the proposed dual-band CP design can easily be achieved with the impedance bandwidth (RL &#8805;10 dB) of about 1932/339 MHz and the 3 dB axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth of about 250/360 MHz for 2.4/5.2 GHz wireless local area network (WLAN) applications. The measured peak gain and radiation efficiency are about 3.6/4.5 dBic and 97/65 % across the operating bands, respectively, with nearly bidirectional patterns in the XZ- and YZ-planes.

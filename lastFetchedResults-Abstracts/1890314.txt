Objective(s): In this study, we aimed to analyze the relationship
between the diagnostic ability of fused single photon emission computed
tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) images in localization of
parathyroid lesions and the size of adenomas or hyperplastic glands.
Methods: Five patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and
4 patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) were imaged
15 and 120 minutes after the intravenous injection of technetium99mmethoxyisobutylisonitrile
(99mTc-MIBI). All patients underwent surgery
and 5 parathyroid adenomas and 10 hyperplastic glands were detected.
Pathologic findings were correlated with imaging results.
Results: The SPECT/CT fusion images were able to detect all parathyroid
adenomas even with the greatest axial diameter of 0.6 cm. Planar
scintigraphy and SPECT imaging could not detect parathyroid adenomas
with an axial diameter of 1.0 to 1.2 cm. Four out of 10 (40%) hyperplastic
parathyroid glands were diagnosed, using planar and SPECT imaging and
5 out of 10 (50%) hyperplastic parathyroid glands were localized, using
SPECT/CT fusion images.
Conclusion: SPECT/CT fusion imaging is a more useful tool for localization
of parathyroid lesions, particularly parathyroid adenomas, in comparison
with planar and or SPECT imaging.

This paper proposes a method that takes imperfections in multiobjective optimization problems into account. The main objective is to determine a feasible design space for fuzzy design variables that respects fuzzy restriction rules and optimizes the defuzzified objective functions. The proposed method uses the Fuzzy Finite Element Method (FFEM) to calculate fuzzy solutions (namely displacements and frequencies) and genetic algorithms for exploring the design space of fuzzy design variables. These elements are explained in detail and then applied to design a drop-tower impactor sled defined with imperfections.

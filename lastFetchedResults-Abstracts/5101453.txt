In this paper we present a method for seamless enlargement and editing of intricate near-regular type of bidirectional texture function (BTF) which contains simultaneously both regular periodic and stochastic components. Such BTF textures cannot be convincingly synthesised using neither simple tiling nor using purely stochastic models. However these textures are ubiquitous in many man-made environments and also in some natural scenes. Thus they are required for their realistic appearance visualisation. The principle of the presented BTF-NR synthesis and editing method is to automatically separate periodic and random components from one or more input textures. Each of these components is subsequently independently modelled using its corresponding optimal method. The regular texture part is modelled using our roller method, while the random part is synthesised from its estimated exceptionally efficient Markov random field based representation. Both independently enlarged texture components from the original measured textures representing one (enlargement) or several (editing) materials are combined in the resulting synthetic near-regular texture.

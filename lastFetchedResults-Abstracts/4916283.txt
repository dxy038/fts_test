The objective of this paper is to show that saturation routing, often in the past considered inefficient, can in fact be a viable approach to use in many important applications and services over an ATM network. This is demonstrated by showing that the ratio, defined as f, of routing overhead cells over information cells is small even for large networks. f is calculated using typical network parameters with analysis as well as simulation. An M/D/1 queuing model is used to prove that the effect of saturation routing in degrading network performance is insignificant for the expected ATM network traffic. Also, the constraints on network parameters are derived and stated as: (&#961;<sub>s</sub>)&lt;1, f&#8810;1, and f&#8810;(&#956;-&#955;)/&#955;; where (&#961;<sub>s</sub>), &#956;, and &#955; are the link utilization factor with saturation routing, the cell service rate, and the mean cell arrival rate, respectively

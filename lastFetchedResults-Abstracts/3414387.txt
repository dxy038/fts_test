We consider the problem of joint battery management and modulation optimization for maximizing the lifetime of a battery-powered autonomic wireless system while satisfying certain quality-of-service constraints. Our objective is to design the optimal transmission schemes adapting to the battery state, the delay constraints, and channel conditions. A delay-constrained data-transmission scenario is considered, where the battery state information is only available at the beginning of the entire transmission duration. The corresponding problem is formulated as a multiobjective stochastic optimization problem, which is hard to solve. We approximately transform the original problem to a multiobjective deterministic optimization problem by using a lower bound to replace the objective function of the original problem. The optimal, as well as efficient suboptimal solutions are developed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly increase the lifetime of the battery-powered autonomic wireless systems

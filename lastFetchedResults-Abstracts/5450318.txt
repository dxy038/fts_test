The objective of this paper is the presentation of a methodology for airborne hyperspectral image analysis of semi-urban areas. Urban areas present challenging problems for remote sensing analysis, given the diversity and complexity of theirs land covers. This study is necessary for mapping biotopes and for a detailed assessment of the different types of manmade materials abundance in the urban space, differing between vegetated and non-vegetated areas. The main points for the classification of urban covers are studied and a methodology is presented. As a case study an AHS image of Alcala Campus University is used for the evaluation of results.

Parallel processing methods for accelerating radar cross-section (RCS) calculation for general 3D conducting targets are investigated and evaluated. The main focus of this work is to develop methodologies that exploit the use of parallel computing environments during the post-processing phase of general method of moments (MoM) programs used for surface integral equations. The primary objective of this research is to examine the processor requirements incurred when multiple processors are used to solve for an overall RCS in a parallel manner. A secondary goal of this study is to evaluate the solution accuracy of asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) based techniques used in conjunction with this parallel post-processing approach. A selection of illustrative and informative computational examples for benchmark RCS targets are solved and compared to direct MoM reference solutions using the CLUMEQ Supercomputing Centre at McGill University

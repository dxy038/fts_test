The objective of the investigation was to measure the amplitude and duration of a supershort avalanche electron beam (SAEB) generated in atmospheric pressure air and to optimize the cathode design in compact accelerators with gas diodes to increase the SAEB amplitude. The number of electrons and the X-ray exposure dose measured downstream of a gas diode foil in atmospheric pressure air were 6.2 &#215; 10<sup>10</sup> and 1.8 mR, respectively.

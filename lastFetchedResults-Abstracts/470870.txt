Objective
The purpose of the study was to describe resident and faculty perceptions on the impact of the 80 hour work reform on residency training.
Study design
Surveys were distributed to resident and faculty at a major university-based teaching institution. All responses were anonymous. Information abstracted from the survey included: demographic characteristics and resident and faculty perceptions on resident education, patient care, resident work environment, and quality of life after the institution of new regulations on resident duty hours. Descriptive and comparison analyses were performed.
Results
Ninety-four residents and 56 faculty members responded. Significant differences were detected in resident and faculty perceptions that work reform improved resident education (52.3% vs 20.8%, respectively, P< .01), and worsened quality of patient care (8.8% vs 45.3%, respectively, P< .01). Both residents (84.4%) and faculty (90.7%) agreed that work reform improved resident quality of life.
Conclusion
Faculty and resident perceptions differed on the impact of the work reform on patient care and resident education but agreed that it improved resident quality of life.

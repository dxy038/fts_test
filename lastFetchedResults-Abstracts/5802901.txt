The purpose of this paper is to use Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) combined with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for choosing an English coursebook in the university. First of all, 12 English teachers were interviewed, and the elements of English coursebook were introduced. Next, the proposed GRA combined with AHP method is applied to analyze the importance of coursebook elements. Finally, the results are shown in the Grey Student-Problem chart (GSP) which also presents the optimal route for choosing an English coursebook. Through the proposed method, it not only analyzes the expertÂ´s opinions in an objective, scientific way, but also helps English teachers choose a suitable English coursebook. In the future, this proposed method is suggested to be use in other decision-making fields, such as business or medical fields.

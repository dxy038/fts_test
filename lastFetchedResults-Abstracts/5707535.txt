Nowadays general anesthesia is maintained using as the controller the human intervention, relying only on the quick and certain response of the anesthesiologist to the surrounding conditions, in order to provide the adequate state of anesthesia for the three main components - hypnosis, analgesia and paralysis. One of the most advantageous breakthroughs in anesthesia has been the appearance of depth of anesthesia monitors, assisting anesthesiologists in the hard job of knowing the hypnotic state of a patient. This information allows a way of closing the loop for administration of the hypnotic drug, and a more secure maintenance of hypnosis. The objective of this work was to apply sliding-mode control techniques to the model structure of the hypnotic in the human body (measured by the effect), and evaluate the robustness of this method to expected deviations from the average patient.

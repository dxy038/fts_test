In this paper, it is analyzed the optimal routing problem within autonomous systems, with particular emphasis when the objective is the optimal links loads balancing for a greater efficiency in the utilization of resources committed for IP networks. The used model belongs to the MCF (Multicommodity flow) family of networks flow problems and, after characterizing the type of solution yielded by this kind of model, it is discussed the feasibility of its implementation in networks operating under OSPF and MPLS protocols.

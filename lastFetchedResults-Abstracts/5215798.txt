Peer-to-Peer (P2P) live streaming technology has been proved to be one of most successful way to provide live video services over the Internet. Although such approach is very attractive, current provided services could not satisfy all users´ Quality of Experience (QoE). Suppose in a small group, when users all watching a live TV program, such as a live soccer game, some peers might saw a goal minutes after other peers. Longer latency among peers would reduce users´ interests and causes their dissatisfactions. In this paper, we first introduce our motivation to this problem. Then we formulate this problem and conclude an objective function. After that, a novel centralized algorithm is proposed, but this algorithm needs complete knowledge of the overlay network which cannot be satisfied in reality. So, with the same guiding principles, we proposed a distributed scheme. Preliminary simulation results have shown our distributed scheme performs close to the centralized one, and outperforms other approach.

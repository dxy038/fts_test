A decoupled adaptive neuro-fuzzy (DANF) sliding mode control system is proposed to control rotating stall and surge in jet engine compression systems. In this way, on-line learning ability is employed to deal with the parametric uncertainty and disturbance by adjusting the control parameters. The control objective is to drive the system state to the original equilibrium point and it proves that the control system is asymptotically stable.

 oil and plant indicators are the main criteria recognize the function of natural ecosystems and
to evaluate their potentials. The objective of this research was to determine some of the soil and plant ndicators at mountainous rangeland in Hamadan province. By using the Landscape Function Analysis method, the potential of four main aspects of region were evaluated. The vegetation type of study area was shrub-grassland. The properties of ecological patches (shrub and grass), inter-patches and also the 11 soil parameters were measured on the 3 transects of 50 meters length. The density and volume of the grasses and shrubs at the two difference aspects were measured by using point-center-quadrat method and plots of 3m2 areas. The index of landscape stability and nutrient cycling was higher on the east and north aspect than the other aspects for patches of shrub and grass, respectively. The most important ecological indicator on all aspects was shrub life form.

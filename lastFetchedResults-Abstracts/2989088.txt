In aeronautical traffic systems, reliable propagation simulation and modelling are absolutely necessary to achieve safe aeronautical communication. This paper applies the numerical ray-tracing method on propagation modelling to model satellite-to-aircraft communication in aeronautical satellite communication systems. The objective of this paper is to simulate the power loss and time delay of the received signal on the aircraft antenna. Ray-tracing models are designed to simulate data like power and time delay of direct and diffuse signals, as well as Doppler shift and carrier-to-noise ratio of received signals along the aircraft path

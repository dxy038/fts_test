This paper presents a method to select the load buses for the placement of distributed generation (DG) based on loss reduction and voltage improvement sensitivity of the system. The DG placement and its precise size to reduce the line loss has been considered and evaluated. To achieve this objective, the following parameters such as line losses, line capacity and voltage profile should be evaluated in all states and the best solution is selected. The proposed methods are tested by a series of simulations on an IEEE 15-bus test system.

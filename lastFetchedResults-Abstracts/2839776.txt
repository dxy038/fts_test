The objective of this work is to determine the amount of nitrogen oxides per hour in a period of one year of a steam boiler of 420 t/h, from SC CET SA Borzesti and SC CET SA Bacau, that uses lignite and biomass as fuel. In the second phase of paper was carried out a comparative study of nitrogen oxide emissions caused by the methodology used by SC CET SA Borzesti and SC CET SA Bacau, based on CORINAIR emission factors, and the mathematical model obtained on the monitoring steam temperature at the inlet and outlet of the boiler.

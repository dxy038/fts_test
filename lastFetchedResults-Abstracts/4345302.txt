The paper investigates the importance of an all-optical packet router with QoS capabilities logical performance simulation. The objective of the work is to study in detail the role of all important factors to be taken into account when designing a computer model of optical packet router performance. The hardware general architecture of an all-optical packet router is presented, and QoS and performance improvement mechanisms are reviewed. The functions of router control unit and aspects of control algorithms are discussed. Simulation conditions and objectives and directions of performance examination are presented as well.

Agricultural activities can accelerate significantly the soil natural erosion processes. Thus, for a sustainable environment, the modeling of soil erosion losses is a fundamental step towards the rationalization optimization of the agricultural land use. In this research, the model &#8220;universal soil loss equation&#8221; (USLE) was used; test site was a watershed in a region of highly intensive agriculture in Sao Paulo State (Brazil); and GIS/remote sensing techniques were employed for spatializing the soil erosion losses by water. The main objective was to test different approaches of modeling the USLE topographic parameters: &#8220;Z&#8221; and &#8220;S&#8221;. For the &#8220;S&#8221; parameter there wasnÂ´t a statistical difference, but for &#8220;L&#8221; the approaches of modeling cause significant differences in the final spatialized results, showing the need to improve the methods of modeling the most USLE impacting parameters

Based on the universal approximation capability of the Takagi-Seguno (TS) fuzzy systems, we present a solution to the model reference control of continuous time nonlinear systems problem. Using the assumption that a fuzzy model exists for the considered nonlinear systems class, a direct TS fuzzy adaptive controller is designed to achieve the tracking objective. It is not required to estimate the fuzzy model, only its existence assumption is required. The proposed adaptive scheme is asymptotically stable, and the. tracking error converges to zero. Simulation results illustrate the proposed algorithm performance.

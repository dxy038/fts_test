Several applications for renewable energy conversion make use of variable speed generators. A conversion from variable frequency to grid frequency is therefore essential. One part of the converter is a rectifier. A rectifier model is presented, which is integrated in a time stepping finite element simulation environment where the generator and circuit equations are solved simultaneously. The model handles bidirectional alternator speeds as the application is a linear generator for ocean wave energy conversion. The rectifier model is extended with a load model, consisting of R, L and E, and simulations show what impact the rectifier has on the generatorâ€™s behaviour.

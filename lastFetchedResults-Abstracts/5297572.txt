The objective of the present work is the study of the seasonal and annual vegetation dynamics in order to detect degradation processes. A multiresolution analysis (MRA) based on the wavelet transform is proposed for studying the non- stationary degradation process. MRA gives a simple and fast method for decomposing a signal into its components at different temporal scales. The 1km MEDOKADS (Mediterranean Extended Daily One-Km AVHRR data set) imagery series over Spain have been considered for this study. Descriptive statistics in terms of trend and variability image have been derived from the proposed methodology. The robustness of the technique has been successfully analysed in terms of the precipitation data.

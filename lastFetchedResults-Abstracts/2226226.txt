The objective of this study was to evaluate the concentration of these acute phase proteins(Serum amyloid A, Milk amyloid A and serum Haptoglobin) and alteration in hematological values in some inflammatory diseases in dairy cattle. Fifty-six Holstein dairy cows with some inflammatory diseases were used in this study including: subclinical mastitis, hematological infections (Theileriosis and Anaplasmosis), metritis, pneumonia and displacement abomasums (n= 8 each). Clinically healthy cows were selected as control group (n= 8). Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein of both groups. One sample of pooled milk from both groups was taken after the milk samples gathered from four quarters of each cow were mixed. There were significant differences in mean concentrations of serum and Milk amyloid A between clinically healthy cows and diseased cows and also, between abomasal displacement and other infectious diseases (P &amp;lt;0.05). There were also significant differences in Haptoglobin concentrations between cattle suffering from subclinical mastitis, theileriosis and pneumonia compared to those with anaplasmosis, abomasal displacement and metritis (P &amp;lt;0.05).Our results indicated the application of serum Haptoglobin, Serum amyloid A and Milk amyloid Ameasurements as indicators of inflammatory diseases in dairy cattle. In conclusion, the current report shows Haptoglobin, Serum amyloid A, and Milk amyloid A measurements could be successfully applied in cattle as valuable indicators of inflammatory diseases.

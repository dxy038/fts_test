For any wireless network based on mm-wave radio systems to be viable, the cost of the infrastructure must be much lower than is currently the case. One approach that promises this cost reduction is the radio over fiber, where radio signals at the carrier frequency are delivered over an optical network to the radio access point. Benefits of this centralized approach are that expensive and delicate pieces of equipment can be located in a beginning environment and costs can be shared between a number of radio access point. However, the integration of such systems is conditioned by the development of low cost radio components, antennas, the packaging as well as the optic/radio transductors. The paper explores therefore the areas of strategic importance in integration of new antenna array topologies, which are appropriated for use as a building block for the millimeter wave fiber wireless system that employs an intelligent multi-beam antenna where the direction of each sharp beam can be adoptively controlled. Thereby, the objective of truly monolithic array with integrated planar antennas and phase shifters was the driving force behind the development of the aperture coupled patch element, which is especially relevant for these systems. The effectiveness of this antenna array has been experimentally confirmed. Finally, it is worthy to note that the small wavelengths allow miniaturize of the size of components such as antennas which are very important for portable sets as well as base station (BS) facilities, which need to be readily installed.

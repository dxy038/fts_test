Objective: To explore the characterization of DNA fingerprints among Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don and other species, and to establish effective method to identify Fritillari cirrhosa D. Don from other species. Methods: Genomic DNAs were extracted from Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don and other species by the phenol method respectively. The specific primers for Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don were designed by Primer Primer 5.0 according to the 5srDNA sequence in GenBank (Acession No. AF 2303201.1), and PCR technique (Polymerase Chain Reaction) was carried out to amplify the amplicon from the Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don and others species. Results: The complete 19.3 kb DNA fragments were obtained from the Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don, F. prezwalskii Maxim, F. unibracteata Hsiao et K.C. Hsia. Only fragment with 274 bp was amplified from the Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don. Conclusion: The DNA fingerprint of Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don showed the specific characteristics, which could be used to identify Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don from others species. The method is an effective, simple, rapid and reliable in identifying the Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don from others species.

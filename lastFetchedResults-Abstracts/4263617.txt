Several power converters have been proposed for Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) systems to generate high frequency current to excite the primary side inductive coils/tracks. This paper proposes a modified cascaded multilevel converter (MC) topology based bidirectional IPT (BIPT) system with reduced number of power electronic components and low converter losses. The proposed topology is suitable for high power - low to medium voltage IPT applications. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.

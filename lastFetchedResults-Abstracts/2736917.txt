The overall objective of this IEEE Power Electronics Society (PELS) Special Issue on high-frequency-link power-conversion systems is, therefore, to bring out the highlights of the ongoing world-wide activities in this area of advanced research to expose, analyze, and resolve the critical research and developmental challenges. The Special Issue received a total of 132 manuscripts for review considerations of which 35 manuscripts have been accepted for final publication. These publications encompass all four broad categories of high-frequency-link power-conversion systems (i.e., dc/ac, ac/dc, ac/ac, and dc/dc converters) with broad applicability in the following areas of application: photovoltaic energy, wind energy, electric vehicles, fuel-cell energy, energy storage, uninterruptible power systems, motor drives, high-frequency-ac power distribution systems, high-voltage direct- current transmission, active load emulator, smart/micro grid, solid-state transformers, induction heating, railway traction drive, pulsed power, plug-in hybrid-electric-vehicle, battery charging, inductive power transfer. The contributions of the articles compiled in this special issue are multifold encompassing topologies with plurality of stages and/or levels, modulation, loss-mitigating switching, high-frequency magnetics, control, modeling, switched-capacitor power conversion, power-factor correction, and broad overview of the Special-Issue subject area.

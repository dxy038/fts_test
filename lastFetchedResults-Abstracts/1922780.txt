Carvedilol is a β1-, β2-, and α1-adrenergic blocker that is approved for the treatment of hypertension. A new once-daily, controlled-release (CR) formulation of carvedilol has been shown to be effective in a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. In this article, we summarize the primary results of, and present additional analyses from, that trial. A total of 338 patients with essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥90 and ≤109 mm Hg) were randomized to receive carvedilol CR 20, 40, or 80 mg or placebo for 6 weeks. The primary objective was to compare the effects of the 3 carvedilol CR doses with placebo on 24-hour mean blood pressure using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Mean DBP and systolic BP (SBP) at the drug trough (20–24 hour) blood levels for carvedilol CR and comparison of DBP and SBP at the drug peak (3–7 hour) blood levels for each dose of carvedilol CR and placebo were investigated. The effects of carvedilol CR on heart rate and pulse pressure were also examined. Once-daily administration of carvedilol CR, alone or in combination with other agents, produced clinically and statistically significant reductions compared with placebo for both DBP and SBP after 6 weeks of treatment for the following parameters: trough blood pressure by office cuff or ABPM measurements, peak blood pressure by ABPM, and 24-hour mean blood pressure by ABPM. Placebo-corrected trough-to-peak ratios for DBP were &gt;0.6 for each carvedilol CR dose. Heart rate and pulse pressure were each significantly reduced compared with placebo for each carvedilol CR dose. We conclude that carvedilol CR is a very effective antihypertensive agent with clear dose-related peak blood pressure reduction and continuous 24-hour control.

A compact printed monopole antenna using two U-type slot working at Bluetooth/WiMAX/WLAN service is present. The antenna can be implemented with a small dimension similarly to the conventional strip-type slot. Based on the simulation and measurement results, triple-band antenna using two U-type slots are very effective in rejecting unwanted frequency in terms of its selectivity and small real estate. The overall dimension of the antenna comes around 30 mm&#215;30 mm&#215;1mm. The measurement results show that the antenna offers excellent performance with Bluetooth ranging from 2.28 GHz to 2.9 GHz, WiMAX ranging from 3.3 GHz to 3.85 GHz and wireless local area network (WLAN) ranging from 4.72 GHz to 6.4 GHz. The proposed antenna gives bidirectional pattern in the E-plane and omni-directional radiation pattern in the H-plane over the frequency range and relatively stable. This antenna configuration would be quiet useful for wireless communication systems.

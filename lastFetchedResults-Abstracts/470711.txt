Objective
The purpose of this study was to describe long-term outcomes for women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) after evaluation in a CPP specialty clinic.
Study design
This was a prospective observational cohort study of women treated for CPP at the UNC Pelvic Pain clinic between 1993 and 2000. The primary outcome was improvement in pain and the main exposure was treatment group: primarily medical (pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, physical therapy, or combinations of the 3) or surgical (hysterectomy, resection or ablative procedures, oophrectomy, diagnostic surgery, pain mapping, vulvar or vestibular repair). Univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses were performed to look for relationships between background characteristics, treatment group, and improvement in pain.
Results
Of 370 participants; 189 had surgical treatment and 181 had medical treatment. One year after evaluation, 46% reported improvement in pain and 32% improvement in depression. Improvement in pain was similar in both treatment groups and odds of improvement were equal even after adjusting for background characteristics, psychosocial comorbidity, and previous treatments.
Conclusion
One year after evaluation in a CPP specialty clinic, women experienced modest improvements in pain and depression after recommended surgical or nonsurgical treatment.

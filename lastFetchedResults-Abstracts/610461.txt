Introduction & Objective: Many surgical patients still experience moderate to severe pain after surgery despite efforts to administer new drugs and techniques. Postoperative analgesia clearly enhances patientâ€™s satisfaction and facilitates earlier mobilization and rehabilitation. lidocaein has been introduced as part of post operative pain management and clinical studies revealed analgesic actions in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Our goal in this study was to determine the effect of intravenous lidocaein on post operative pain of women under-going cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.
Materials & Methods: In this double blinded clinical trial study, 72 patients candidate for Ce-sarean section under spinal anesthesia were randomly selected and divided in two groups. In the case group, infusion of1.5 mg/kg lidocaein and in the control group infusion of the same volume normal saline started 15 minutes before the beginning of operation. After spinal anes-thesia with definite technique in both groups, infusion of 1.5 mg/kg/h lidocaein in case group and the same volume normal saline in the control group was administered and continued till 0.5 hour after finishing the operation. Data including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, analgesic score according VAS and using of analgesic drugs were recorded during 24 hours after the operation.
Results: Pain intensity according to VAS score in the time 2,6,12 hours post operation were significantly lower in the case group ( P2= 0.05, P6 = 0.01, P12= 0.05) .Analgesic consumption in form of suppository & IV,24 hours after surgery, was significantly lower in the case group.(P=0.001).
Conclusion: Lidocaein infusion can decrease pain intensity & analgesic consumption after ce-sarean section under spinal anesthesia.

Abstract
Heavy metals are categorized as one of the most important contaminants that
disturb soil environment and thus are harmful to terrestrial organisms. There are
many ecological indices representing such pollutions. Nematodes as indicator
organisms may be a suitable index to assess environmental conditions. The
objective of this study was to investigate the impact of different levels of selected
heavy metals (Cd, Ni, and Pb) and cow manure on nematode population changes of
indigenous soil nematodes. A completely randomized design with factorial
arrangement was carried out including three levels of heavy metals 0 (H0); 100,
500, 1000 (H1); and 300, 700, 2000 (H2) mg kg-1 of Cd, Ni and Pb respectively and
two levels of cow manure 0 (O0) and 1% (O1) with 3 replications. Soil moisture of
all treatments was adjusted at 70% of field capacity. All treatments were incubated
for 30 and 90 days. Soils were then washed and the total population, juvenile and
mature numbers of nematodes was determined. All isolated nematodes were
identified at the family level and ecological indices (enrichment, structure and
maturity) were determined. The results showed that total population, juvenile,
mature numbers of nematodes decreased significantly in all metal amended
treatments. Furthermore, calculated ecological indices tended to decline by
addition of heavy metals into soil samples.

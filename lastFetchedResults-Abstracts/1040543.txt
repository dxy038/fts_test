Residual tensile stresses often increase the susceptibility to cold cracking, and also promote brittle fracture, fatigue failure, and stress corrosion cracking in combination with tensile stresses experienced during service. Welding-induced deformation usually degrades the performance of a structure. Thus, the control of welding residual stress and distortion is a crucial task in welding manufacturing. There are too many factors that affect welding residual stresses and distortion. Besides material properties and design-related parameters, the welding procedures such as deposition sequence and assembly sequence also have significant influence on the final residual stress distribution and deformation. In this study, a computational approach based on Quick Welder software was developed to simulate the welding temperature field, residual stress distribution and deformation in multi-pass joints. The main objective was to clarify the influence of deposition sequence on the final residual stress distribution and deformation in an austenitic stainless steel tube–block joint with J-groove. The simulation results indicate that deposition sequence not only significantly affects the distribution of residual stress but also can alter the deformation mode to a certain extent. In addition, it was found that the last weld pass seems to have the largest contribution to the final welding residual stress filed of current tube–block joint.

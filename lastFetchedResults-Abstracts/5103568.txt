This paper describes work carried out on the design of a low cost video monitor store and forward device, with the objective of investigating and resolving the problems related to traditional security surveillance devices and video streaming over GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks. A low cost video monitor store and forward device with motion detection and remote control capabilities has successfully been designed and implemented. Both images and video were successfully captured using a low cost CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) camera and this data was successfully compressed using low cost hardware. Motion was successfully detected with the device (with both good and poor lighting conditions) and compressed video files uploaded to a back-end server via GPRS. It was found that it is viable to transmit large data files over the GSM networks if the appropriate protocols were used.

The main purpose of this work is to effectively implement the "-constraint method for producing
Pareto optimal solutions for optimizing three objective functions, simultaneously, incorporating a Rotary
Hybrid Flow Controller (RHFC) as an energy flow controller. The RHFC is a hybrid compensator composed
of a Rotary Phase Shifting Transformer (RPST), a multimodule Thyristor-Switched Series Capacitor (TSSC),
a multimodule Thyristor-Switched Series Reactor (TSSR) and a Mechanically-switched Shunt Capacitor
(MSC). In this paper, a multi-objective Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is applied to optimally locate RHFC
to improve the power system operation. Fuzzy decision-making is utilized in terms of optimal location
processing, according to the best compromise among the Pareto optimal solutions. The optimal location
and OPF model are implemented in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) software in order
to optimize total fuel cost, power loss and system loadability, as objective functions, simultaneously.
Simulations are performed on IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus test systems to determine optimal parameters
and the location of RHFC. Furthermore, in order to highlight the ability of RHFC, the results are compared
to a Phase Shifting Transformer (PST) and a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) from economical and
technical points of view.

In this paper, we propose a time-domain index to assess M-wave widening during high-frequency stimulation, as an objective parameter for quantifying muscle fatigue. At high stimulation frequencies, signal truncation, due to the delivery of the electrical stimulus before the M-wave generated by the previous stimulus extinguishes, biases the spectral frequency variables usually computed to estimate M-wave widening. Thus, we propose an estimator of the scale factor between two truncated M-waves. The estimator is derived from the Scale Transforms of the two signals, with an efficient implementation that avoids limits of resolution. The method was tested on both simulated and experimental signals. The simulations showed that the proposed technique is significantly less affected by signal truncation than previous approaches. The experimental recordings were collected from 11 subjects at stimulation frequencies of 20, 40, and 60 Hz. The scale factor estimation assessed M-wave widening in the three conditions, differentiating between the different rates of change of signal widening. The method proved to be significantly superior to M-wave spectral analysis. The technique can be applied to investigate myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue at stimulation rates that could not be analyzed in the past and, thus, opens new perspectives in the evaluation of electrical stimulation for training and rehabilitation protocols.

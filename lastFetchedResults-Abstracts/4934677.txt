This paper presents a wideband bidirectional antenna using rectangular monopole with trident to excite truncated circular sector. The antenna is designed for wideband operation, especially when the antenna can satisfy the requirement of low-cost, linear polarization and bidirectional pattern. The simulation results are presented the wideband performance of this antenna. The return loss better than 10 dB covers the frequency range from 4 to 11 GHz, and the directivity at the direction toward thetas = 0deg and 180deg is 4.03 dBi to 8.23 dBi from 4 to 11 GHz. The proposed antenna obtains bidirectional radiation pattern.

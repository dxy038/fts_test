This paper presents a novel adaptive dynamic grid-based data distribution management (DDM) scheme, which we refer to as ADGB. The main objective of our protocol is to optimize DDM time through matching probability (MP) and federatesÂ´ performance. A distribution rate (DR) along with MP are used as part of the ADGB method to select, throughout the simulation, from different devised advertisement schemes, the best scheme to achieve maximum gain with acceptable network traffic overhead. As opposed to previous protocols, the novelty of our ADGB scheme is its focus on improving overall performance, an important goal for DDM strategy. In this paper, we present our scheme and highlight its performance analysis

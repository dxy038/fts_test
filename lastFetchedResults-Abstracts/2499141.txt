<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong>Due to contagiousness of pertussis, a rapid and sensitive method for diagnosis is required to initiate the treatment and interrupt its transmission.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>To detect <em>B. pertussis </em>strains, we used two real-time PCR targeting IS<em>481 </em>and BP283 sequences and compared factors influencing culture and real-time PCR results.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Totally, 779 specimens were collected from patients among which 11 (1.4%) were culture positive. Using IS<em>481 </em>and BP283 primers, 122 (15.6%) and 100 (12.8%) were diagnosed as infected specimens respectively. There were significant relationships between the real-time PCR method for diagnosis of <em>B. pertussis </em>and age, sex and vaccination of patients before sampling.<br /><strong>Conclusion: Â </strong>The real-time PCR is superior and much more sensitive than culture for diagnosis of <em>B. pertussis</em>. However, the sensitivity was improved when both IS<em>481 </em>and BP283 were used. Correct sampling and transportation of specimen also improved the detection rate in our research.</p>

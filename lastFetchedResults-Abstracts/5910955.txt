SNMP protocol is a simple network management protocol. As an important part of most network management software, its resource wastage and efficiency have important influence on the performance of the whole system. According to study, the main bottleneck of SNMP software is MIB objectsÂ´ storage and search. This paper proposes to use multi-path tree to keep the entire structure of MIB to eliminate the repeated storage of mutual identifiers by analyzing the structure of MIB tree. Compared to widely used Hash table, multi-path tree promotes the efficiency of resource usage. On the basis of that, this paper also proposes a high speed algorithm to search MIB objects by the combination of multi-path tree and AVL tree. The method above has been successfully applied to the Bidirectional HDTV Signal Transmitting System and it is proved to be efficient and reliable in actual network environment.

Value plays a central role in services and is considered as the ultimate objective that both providers and customers pursue through providing and consuming a service. In this paper, based on a brief discussion of the service value concept, we present a service value life cycle model (SVLC), where the value delivery process is decomposed into 7 phases (bi-lateral searching, bi-lateral negotiation, unilateral preparation, co-production, transferring, usage, and payment). Each phasepsilas repeatable tasks, output, quality metrics of the process and output, and possible innovative design decisions, were elaborately analyzed. A C2C service system, Taobao.com, is briefly discussed to help understand SVLC in the real world. Comparisons between SVLC and traditional service research shows that SVLC provides some significance to systematical service innovations and service quality metrics design from life cycle (temporal) point of view. Potential effects on service computing research and some future work are also discussed.

The design of fuzzy controllers for the attitude stabilization of a satellite is proposed. In the first step, the original satellite controllers, two classical linearized controllers, are superseded by two fuzzy controllers. The objective is to obtain faster convergence time and lower steady-state error. The two fuzzy controllers are then consolidated to form one fuzzy controller in the next step, retaining the same effectiveness of control. Simulation tests are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the fuzzy controller. Inference disturbances are included in the simulation.

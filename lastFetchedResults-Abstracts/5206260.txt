The objective of this work is to propose a whole solution for simulating power systems based on the use of behavioral DC/DC converter models. The proposed model is a generic model whose parameters can be obtained from datasheets (especially useful to model commercial converters) or equivalent tests. The model has configurable features which can be activated or disabled in order to perform optimal simulations or to generate models with different levels of abstraction to be used in a top-down design methodology.

Objective To study associations between
crime and psychiatric disorders among adolescent
males in a representative population-based cohort
study. Method The sample includes 2,712 Finnish
boys born in 1981. Information on criminality consists
of offenses registered in the Finnish National
Police Register 1998â€“2001. Crime was classified
according to frequency and type (drug, violent,
property, traffic, and drunk driving offenses). Information
on psychiatric diagnoses between 1999 and
2004 was collected from the Finnish National Military
Register. Results Of the 2,712 boys, 22% had a crime
registration during the 4-year period, and 10% had at
least one psychiatric disorder according to the Military
Register. Those with psychiatric disorders accounted
for 49% of all crimes. Of those with more
than five crimes (n = 98), 59% had psychiatric diagnoses.
After adjusting for other crime types and
childhood socio-economic status, property crime was
independently associated with several diagnoses:
antisocial personality (APD), substance use (SUD),
psychotic, anxiety, and adjustment disorders. Drug
offending was independently associated with APD,
SUD, and psychotic disorder, and traffic offenses with
APD. Conclusions Youth crime is predominantly
associated with antisocial personality and substance
use disorders. Crime prevention efforts should focus
on boys showing a risk for antisocial and substance
use problems. In particular, property, drug, and repeat
offenders need mental health and substance use
assessment. There is a need to develop integrated
mental health and substance use treatment services
for young offenders within or alongside the criminal
justice system.

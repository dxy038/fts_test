Objective(s): This study was conducted to determine and compare the dietary intake and anthropometric indices of male high school students in rural and urban areas of Zarrinshahr, Isfahan.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study 348 high school adolescents aged 14-16 years were selected by stratified random sampling. Weight and height were measured and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Dietary data were collected by a dietitian using two 24-hour dietary recalls and a qualitative food
frequency questionnaire.
Results: The prevalence of underweight was 12%, 7% and 8% in adolescents aged 14, 15 and 16 years,respectively. The prevalence of overweight was 5%, 6% and 5% in adolescents aged 14, 15 and 16 years and that of obesity was 8%, 4% and 0%, respectively. Dairy consumption was higher and the intake of bread was lower in adolescents residing in industrialized urban areas compared to their counterparts in rural regions (241±124 vs 217±137, P<0.05 and 251±96 vs 264±117 g/d, P<0.05, respectively). Energy (301U581 vs 2424±572 kcal/d, P<0.05), fat (106±41 vs 74±36 kcal/d, P<0.05), SFA (37±14 vs 29±15 g/d, P<0.01), protein (94±31 vs 71±26 g/d, P<0.05) and vitamin C intake (72±56 vs 52±50 mg/d) were higher in boys residing in industrial city areas compared to those in villages. The contribution of the morning snack to total energy intake was higher in adolescents residing in industrial and non-industrial urban zones compared to rural areas (16.U3.5 and 17.4±2.4 vs 13.5±1.4 percent, P<0.05).
Conclusion: Although the impact of socio-economic factors on obesity prevalence and the consumption of high fat foods and energy intake were evident in some cases, it seems that underweight is still a major nutritional problem in ZarrinShahr. This study highlights the need for programs to improve nutritional status in this age group (especially in rural areas) and to promote consumption of healthy foods particularly in urban areas.

Strength training has an important role in the exercise and it also has numerous benefits on the health of human body and spirit. eccentric contractions as a part of resistance exercise is associated with negative physiological changes. therefore our objective was to determine the effects of a single bout of eccentric resistance exercise on the urinary markers of protein catabolism and muscle damage such as urea, creatinine and 3-methylhistidine. 24 non-athletes male students (20±1.54 years, body mass index 22.6±3.8 and body fat percent 13.41±4.21) were randomized into experimental (n=12) and control (n=12) group. Experimental group performed a single bout of eccentric resistance exercise including 50 eccentric contractions at ?85 of 1-RM with non- dominant hand. Urinary samples of  urea, creatinine and 3-methylhistidine were taken before exercise until after intervention. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-test at p < 0.05. There was a significant increase in urinary urea, creatinine and 3-methylhistidine after an eccentric resistance exercise in experimental group compared to control group. a single bout of eccentric resistance exercise results in an activation of the muscular protein catabolism, and damage due to increase in degradation of myofibrillar contractile protein.

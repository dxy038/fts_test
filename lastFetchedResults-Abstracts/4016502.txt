A number of emerging broadband services require the ability to manage multiple parties and/or media. For instance, broadband videoconferencing bridges together more than two parties. A telemedicine service could enable doctors to converse over bidirectional video and audio connections, and share X-rays and patient data over unidirectional data connections. To manage the complexity of multiple parties and media, a rigorous model of the connectivity of a call is essential. Furthermore, an application-level protocol is needed so that a broadband service may request changes to the connectivity. A promising object-oriented model and protocol is at the heart of the connection view state approach. This approach was created to enable call party handling, which may be defined as &#8220;intelligent network control of stable calls with two or more parties&#8221;. The ITU-T has standardized this approach for narrowband calls. Extensions to the connection view state approach have been proposed to support broadband services

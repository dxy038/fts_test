Context and Objective: Countermeasures is one of the most important issues on the international responsibility that articles 49 to 53 of the draft plan of international responsibility of wrongful conduct caused by governments are devoted to this topic. International Law Commission deals the purpose, scope, conditions and other matters of mutual Countermeasures. On the other hand, as one of the aspects of modern cyber-attacks Cyber interventions have been identified.
Cyber-attacks are taken by a government to target a basic infrastructure of another government including the banking system, energy and public transport which connects to a computer network and since these attacks are considered as blatant attacks on the use of force and interference in the internal affairs of the state the main question in the debate is that in case of a cyber-attack which considered as a breach of obligations, what steps could be taken by the attacked Government? Do these measures are permitted only by the attacked Government or the third states would be able to take them? If so, would not the international peace and security be affected?

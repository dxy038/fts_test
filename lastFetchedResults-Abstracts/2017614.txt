The objective of these investigation were use of berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum ) in double cropping system (after autumns crop) to improve forage production in Shahrekord region. The experiments were carried out in the preliminary, research and farmer field condition in 2005, 2006-7 and 2013 respectively. In 2005 the results showed that there is possibility of double cropping of berseem clover after canola and one cut dry forage was harvested with 3343 kg ha-1. In 2006-7 results revealed that the most dry forage yield of berseem clover in double cropping after canola was obtained from 6 and 16 July planting (with 25.7?C and 24.4?C daily average temperature respectively) and use of 25 to 30 kg ha-1 seed rates (upper 4000 kg ha-1 dry forage) in research field condition. In 2013 results showed that there is possibility of double cropping of berseem clover after barely in farmer field condition and one cut dry forage was harvested with 2750 kg ha-1 and 20.7% protein. In generally the results represented that double cropping of berseem clover after canola and barley is advisable for Shahrekord region and other area with similar climate. This plant also had positive effects on production efficiency and soil fertility in rotation.

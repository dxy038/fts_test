Recent research studies aimed to simulate facial expressions or motions due to muscle contraction using biomechanical models ranging from basic to advanced muscle constitutive models. However, these models are based on generic geometries and there is a lack of experimental data for the numerical simulation as well as for the model validation in a clinical context. The objective of our present study was to perform facial mimics simulation using subject specific data derived from MRI technique. Zygomaticus major muscle is modelled as a transversely isotropic hyperelastic material. Then the resulting effect of its shortening and lengthening process on the facial mimics simulation was performed using Finite Element Analysis. Simulation results were presented and discussed. Such study will be of interest for defining objective criteria to evaluate the facial disfigurement patients and to perform the functional rehabilitation.

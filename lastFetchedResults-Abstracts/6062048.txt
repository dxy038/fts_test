Applying wireless techniques in the greenhouse is one of the most important trends of the agricultural development. In the clustered wireless network with definite network level, the deployment of cluster head nodes has a great influence on the performance of the network. This paper discusses a three-level network model of the wireless monitoring and control system based on the multi-span in greenhouse. The cluster head nodes in network with traits of wireless sensor network and wireless motion network are designed with GPRS Module and Zigbee Module CC2430. Taking single multi-span greenhouse as an example, we adopt the improved LEACH clustering algorithm to analyze the influence of the cluster head nodes number on latency and energy consumption., The optimized cluster head nodes deployment strategy based on the multi-objective optimization method is given to ensure the highly efficient data transmission. We optimize the cluster head nodes deployment, determine the best number of the cluster head nodes in single multi-span greenhouse based on MATLAB and analyze the influence of the low lever cluster head nodes number on latency, energy consumption and the total nodes number. The network has great improvement on the real-time and lifetime with the optimized cluster head nodes deployment compared with one clustered network.

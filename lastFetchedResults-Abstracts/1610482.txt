Gas hydrates have a large capacity for the storage of gases and are an attractive method for gas filtration and transportation. However, hydrate formation is usually controlled by the rate of crystallization and thus it can be a slow process. A technology that will rapidly and continuously form hydrate is necessary for scale-up.

l reactor with an inner volume of 25 l has been designed, built and installed to form hydrates by injection of water through spray nozzles from the top of the methane-filled reactor. This method allows to maximize interfacial area between reactants and to minimize mass transfer barriers and thermal effects that negatively affect conversion of reactants into hydrate. A system was developed to remove heat released during hydrate formation, and to reach a good level of temperature control inside the reactor. A novel system for hydrate recovering and unloading was also designed. The objective of experimentation is to lower energetic costs of hydrate formation, also through surfactant promotion. Anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS, was tested. Results of a first set of experimental applications of the reactor for rapid methane hydrate formation are presented.

The objective of this paper is to investigate effects of air voids on ultrasonic wave propagation in fresh cement pastes, and relate ultrasonic wave parameters to cement setting times. First, Biot's theory was used to analyze wave propagation in poroelastic media containing air bubbles. Then, in the experimental study, both the compressional (P) and shear (S) waves were monitored in cement pastes with different water/cement ratios (w/c = 0.4 and 0.5) and various air void content (0.1%â€“5.3% by cement paste volume). Experimental results indicated that existence of air bubbles in cement paste significantly decreases the P wave velocity, but has little effect on the shear wave propagation. Further analysis shows that the shear wave velocity corresponding to the Vicat initial setting times is a relatively constant value for the investigated air content range. This study shows the potential of using shear waves to monitor setting and hardening process of cement.

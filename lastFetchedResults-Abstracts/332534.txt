Objective
Phase-separation within HEMA-free all-in-one dental adhesives may result in the entrapment of droplets within the adhesive resin. Strongly air-blowing prior to polymerization, can remove most of these droplets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect these droplets may have on the resistance of the adhesive–tooth interface to NaOCl degradation.
Methods

The micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) to enamel and dentin was determined when a HEMA-free all-in-one adhesive was applied either following a mild or strong air-blowing technique. The bonds were also exposed to an aqueous sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution for 1 h, following a recently introduced methodology to mimic in vivo bond degradation.
Results

This study revealed that strong air-blowing of the adhesive only resulted in a significantly higher micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) to dentin, but not to enamel. Likewise, NaOCl only reduced the μTBS to dentin for both the mild and strong air-blowing technique, but again not the μTBS to enamel. Failure analysis by SEM clearly revealed that strong air-blowing is less effective in droplet removal when the adhesive was applied in small and narrow class-I cavities, as compared to when it was applied to flat surfaces.
Conclusions

NaOCl did preferentially dissolve the hybrid layer at dentin, and more for the mild than for the strong air-blowing technique. A strong air-blowing procedure resulted in a more NaOCl-resistant hybrid layer, so that it can be concluded that a HEMA-free one-step adhesive definitely benefits from a strong air-blowing technique.

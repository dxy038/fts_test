Background & Objective: Periodontal problem is a common infectious disease in human. Certain systemic diseases that may influence on development and progress of periodontal disease, recent evidence have approved effects of the periodontal disease on a few systemic diseases including acute myocardial infarction and vise versa. This study evaluated clinical periodontal indices and determined the prevalence of periodontal disease in patients with myocardial infarction.

Materials & Methods: The study was carried out in 125 patients (25 females and 100 males) aged 39-70 years that admitted due to MI in Ekbatan Hospital, Hamadan in 2005. The subjects were examined periodontally and their clinical indices (bleeding on probing index, probing depth, clinical attachment level) were measured. Sex, age and the number of remaining teeth of each patient was recorded in a chart. The conditions with positive bleeding no probing index or attachment loss> 1 mm were recognized as periodontal disease. Results: In the study, the patients aged 56.32 ± 6.77 years (meant SD) and 20% of them were female. The findings showed that the mean probing depth and the mean attachment level was 3.38 ±0.35 mm and 3.55 + 0.4 mm, respectively. The bleeding on probing index was 72.8%± 20.46% on average. It was achieved a mean number of 18.33 ± 5.55 for the remaining teeth. The prevalence of periodontal disease was 89.6% in the patients with MI. Conclusion: Results of the present study showed a high proportion of periodontal disease with in MI patients. Further more, the aged teeth missing was very early.

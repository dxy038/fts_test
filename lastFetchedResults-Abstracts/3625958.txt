Explicit expressions are presented for a bidirectional computer-corrected network analyser using matched-impedance normalisation. It is shown that this procedure simplifies the equations and considerably reduces the number of error terms possible in measurements with network analysers. In addition errors due to source switching, if they do arise, can be rigorously accounted for. However, this requires an extended calibration procedure with a two-port network standard.

Simulation is an effective means to study pedestrian flow, and PTSim is a pedestrian simulation package developed by the authors. In this study, the authors constructed unidirectional and bidirectional flow simulation experiments in PTSim. Based on the collected data, capacity and Volume-Density-Speed relationships were analyzed for unidirectional situation. Meanwhile, capacity considering LOS for bidirectional flow was also collected; besides, the Lane-Formation phenomenon reappeared in PTSim. The experimental results are useful for pedestrian studies.

Objective
To evaluate the developmental situation of children that undergo  operation because of syndromic and non-syndromic craniosynostosis.
Materials & Methods 
In this prospective study, 24 children (4 to 16 months of age) who underwent neurosurgeryical intervention because of non-syndromic
(79%) and syndromic (21%) craniosynostosis were recruited. For psychological evaluation, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-
Second Edition (BSID-II) was applied one month before and one year after surgical correction. The scale consists of three parts, Mental
Developmental Index (MDI), Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI), and Behavior Rating Scale. The MDI and PDI yield age-standard scores
(100 ± SD).
Results
Mean baseline BSID-II scores revealed a mild delay in mental and motor scores (MDI: 84.3±2.1; PDI: 80.5±4.2) in non-syndromic craniosynostosis and a moderate delay in mental and motor scores (MDI: 70.3±3.1; PDI:64.3±1.7) in syndromic craniosynostosis. Mean postoperative BSID-II
score revealed improved motor scores (MDI: 91.3±0.1; PDI: 91.3±0.2) in non-syndromic craniosynostosis and mean postoperative BSID-II
score revealed a mild delay in mental scores and no change in PDI. Among children with syndromic craniosynostosis, mean BSID-II score
indicated mild baseline deficits in both mental and motor scores post operatively.
Conclusion
Mental development and prognosis was better in non-syndromic craniosynostosis comparing syndromic craniosynostosis. Surgery is effective in neurodevelopmental growth in non syndromic types of craniosynostosis but in syndromic type, remodeling surgery does not significantly affect neurodevelopmental outcome.

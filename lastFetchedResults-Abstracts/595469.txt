Objective: To determine the obstetric characteristics and complications of teenage pregnancy. Methodology: This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted at Gynae 'A' unit, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar from January to December 2009. The analysis included data on 61 singleton adolescent women with > 24 completed weeks gestation and were compared with 367 women in their twenties, after taking informed consent. The data was retrieved after interviewing the women and also from the hospital-based maternal health medical records including demographic details, complications of pregnancy, and maternal and neonatal outcomes. Information was recorded for all the cases on structured proforma. Results: This data showed that adolescent pregnancies were at increased risk of operative vaginal delivery (14.7% vs 20% [p <0.05]) and perinatal mortality of 18%(5 stillbirths and 6 early neonatal deaths) particularly hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (31.2 vs 8.1% [p<0.05]), placental abnormalities(13.1 vs 6.8 [p<0.05]) and anaemia (41 vs 15 [p<0.05]). On the other hand it was observed that adolescent pregnancy was associated with lower risks of cesarean delivery and macrosomia and preterm delivery ([p>0.05]). Further adjustment for weight gain during pregnancy and Apgar score at 5 min did not change the observed association. Conclusions: These results suggest that teenage pregnancies were at increased risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes particularly hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, placental abnormalities and anaemia compared to adult pregnancy.

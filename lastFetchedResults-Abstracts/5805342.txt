This paper introduces the objective of increasing the power handling capability of all-inductive dual mode waveguide filters is introduced using multiple circular inductive posts. 3D electromagnetic models are built for other conventional alternative designs (coupled resonator waveguide filter, and all-inductive in-line dual-mode waveguide filter), and used to compare to the proposed design models. The comparison proves that the proposed filter is superior to other conventional designs from power point of view without degrading other specifications.

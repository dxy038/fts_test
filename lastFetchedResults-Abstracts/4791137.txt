Based on the study of situation and influence of water resources shortage at Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Zone, the author set up a preliminary water shortage risk assessment index system using &#8220;state-pressure-response&#8221; model. Then expert investigation method, AHP method and multivariate statistical method were applied jointly to finish the index screening. Next, the indexes were ranked according to the comprehensive weight which was calculated by AHP method. The relationship between the indexes were eliminated by multivariate statistical methods such as cluster analysis method, gray associate analysis method, multiple correlation analysis method ,etc,. The representative indexes were retained. The results achieved through different methods were basically the same. At last, a comprehensive, objective and reasonable risk assessment index system was established.

Since its application in the government-invested projects in China, the agent construction system has made remarkable achievements. However, the relative risk research in this area is still relatively backward. According to the characteristics of agent construction project, the risk factors and appropriate consequences are summarized, and the concept of the combination weights is put forward. Based on the Rough set theory, the risk combination weighs are calculated. Finally the transitive closure method is applied to make the fuzzy cluster analysis against the risk factor combination. This paper sets up a simple and objective method for the risk management of the agent construction project, and the example verifies the feasibility of this method.

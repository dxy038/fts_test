The rapid emergence of new network scenarios and architectures, such as Data Centers Networks (DCNs), Path Computation Element (PCE), and Software Defined Networking (SDN), has refreshed some on-line routing-related problems, objective of many research efforts in the past. As a result, new scalable and efficient path computation algorithms are required to address particular characteristics and demands of on-line scenarios, such as those brought by inaccurate Network State Information (NSI), strongly affecting the overall blocking probability. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based PCE scheme, referred to as PPCE. PPCE is devised for highly dynamic network scenarios, aiming at reducing the amount of signaling messages as well as the blocking probability.

After each disastrous storm event quick and reliable information of the extent of forest damage is required. This study investigates different remote sensing data and analysis methods for their possible fields of application to detect blowdowns. Therefore both optical satellite sensors and synthetic aperture radar data in various frequencies were evaluated. Obligatory aspects under consideration were the operational usage, the heterogeneity of the Swiss landscape, the effects of topography and season in Alpine regions and last but not least the financial conditions. Classification results were compared to aerial images which were interpreted manually on an stereoscopic base. The pros and cons of the sensors and the analysis techniques are very heterogeneous. In order to assign the appropriate data with the most suitable classification method, the primary objective of the classification must be set up.

The main objective of the paper is to study the thermo-physical properties of acetone/water mixture as a function of a different volume fraction at the different operating temperatures. This paper deals with the study on the acetone/water mixture, mainly the enhancement of heat transfer co-efficient, thermo-physical properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat and viscosity. The thermo-physical properties play a major role for the heat transfer enhancement. The experimental set up will lead to more heat transfer applications in future.

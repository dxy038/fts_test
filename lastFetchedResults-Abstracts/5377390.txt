This paper introduces a fuzzy mixed-integer linear programming (FMILP) model to solve the aggregate production planning (APP) problem. The FMILP formulation is developed in which both fuzzy and possibilistic uncertainties appear in the same model. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the benefits of adopting fuzzy mathematical programming approach to model APP problems. To achieve the objective of this paper, a real industrial data from a resin manufacturing plant (see Omar and Teo [1]) were used to develop the proposed FMILP. In addition, the results of the FMILP were compared with the results from the deterministic model proposed by Omar and Teo [1]. The findings indicate that significant cost savings were achieved by adopting the fuzzy programming approach.

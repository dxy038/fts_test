Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of attention, distraction and sleep on CO2 laser-evoked potentials (LEP) relating to C-fibers (ultra-late LEP).
Methods: Non-painful CO2 laser pulses were delivered to a tiny skin area of the dorsum of the right hand. Ultra-late LEP were recorded from 10 normal subjects in 5 different conditions: control (wakefulness), attention, distraction, drowsiness and sleep (stage 2).
Results: The amplitude of ultra-late LEP was slightly increased during attention and significantly decreased during distraction, relative to the control. The ultra-late LEP decreased much in amplitude or almost disappeared during sleep. However, significant differences in latency among the conditions were not found.
Conclusions: We confirmed that the brain responses relating to signals ascending through C-fibers were much affected by the level of consciousness, being consistent with the findings of late LEP relating to AÎ´-fibers. This is the first study to indicate the important characteristics of ultra-late LEP relating to consciousness, suggesting that they include cognitive function and also that one has to be careful of the change in alertness when recording

PBL (Problem Based Learning) has been used for teaching in number of courses for a long time. The objective of this learning method is to encourage the students to study from reality problem. The problem that often occurred during the PBL process was a failure of the project.

We used an agile method to increase the high level of complement by setting a play role of students. The result revealed that the students who used Agile method were completed the satisfied project in 95% rather than those students who rejected to use the proposed technique.

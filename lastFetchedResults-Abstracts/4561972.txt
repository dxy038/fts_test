This research is a continuous study from the previous research and concentrates on analyzing biological effects on blood count (hematology) and blood bio-chemistry. Radio signal generator was set to WiFi frequency of 2.4 GHz. This frequency is transmitted and radiated by using antenna towards 30 control samples of white albino mice. The antenna is placed at 1 meter distance to visualize the amount of radiation energy as normal situation for human in receiving WiFi signal. The radiation was exposed to mice continuously everyday for 8 hours and for 6 months period. For biological test, the control samples and exposed samples were taken to Veterinary Laboratory to undergo the blood test procedure on the second week of every month, for six months period. The blood tests were done to observe any changes in average packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin, red blood cell, and white blood cell and blood biochemistry tests. The spectrum analyzer was used to monitor the RF signal level received by the samples. The objective of this research is to study the effect of biological characteristics on WiFi radiation exposure to people. The methodology for this research is conducted on a laboratory with a few cages consists of 30 male mice and they were placed at a far-field distance of 1.0m from the antenna of the RF generator source. Another cage control which consists of 30 male mice was placed far away from radiation area, almost under free-radiation. The results were categorized into three tests that are Pathology Lab, Blood Count and Biochemistry Lab. From the tests, itÂ´s shown that the degeneration occurs in the cells on some organs through histopathological procedures.

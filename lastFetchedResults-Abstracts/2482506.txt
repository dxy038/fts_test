Landslide is among the natural disasters which cause many damages such as killing and wounding many peoples and lead to homelessness millions of households every year all over the world. The main objective of this research is making landslides susceptibility zoning, using Geospatial Information System (GIS) and probability model "weight of evidence" in limited areas of Haraz watershed located in Mazandaran province. Due to the mentioned objective, by using the field trip and aerial photographs interpretation, 78 landslide points were found and mapping of these landslides were prepared. The data informations about layers of slope, aspect, altitude, slope curvature, lithology, landuse, distance of river, distance of road, distance of fault, index of stream power, wetness index and sediment transport index were considered as effective factors on landslide events; and then theirs maps were digited in GIS field. By using the laws of probability, relations among factors and landslides were considered and mapping of landslide sensitivity areas in region was prepared. Model assessment was carried out by one third of landslide points, SCAI index and ROC curve. The results showed a high correlation between dangerous map and landslide distribution. The probability model precision was estimated as very well (79.87 %) in study area. The most important innovation of this research, comparing to other researches conducted, is using the factors such as slope curvature, index of stream power, wetness index and sediment transport index, as well as simultaneous employing of two important methods for evaluating the model (SCAI index and ROC curve).

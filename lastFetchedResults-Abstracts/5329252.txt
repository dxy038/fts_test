We explore the possibility of directly coupling deferrable loads with wind generators in order to mitigate the variability and randomness of wind power generation. Loads engage in a contractual agreement of deferring their demand for power by a fixed amount of time and wind generators optimally allocate available wind power with the objective of minimizing the cost of unscheduled and variable supply. We simulate the performance of the proposed coupling in a market environment and we demonstrate its compatibility with existing technology, grid operations and economic incentives. The results indicate that the combination of existing deregulated power markets and demand side flexibility could support large scale integration of wind power without significant impacts on grid operations and without the requirement for prohibitive investments in backup generation.

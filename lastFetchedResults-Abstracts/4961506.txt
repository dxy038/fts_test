This paper describes the use of an array leads for the injection of AC current in noncontacting probe and of main and auxiliary currents in uniform field generation. The compensation methods of feasible errors due to imperfection of the leads are proposed in terms of effective field and correction of dimension by misalignment. The objective of further experiments is to apply the technique to the measurement of solenoid dimension for the determination of proton gyromagnetic ratio in low field

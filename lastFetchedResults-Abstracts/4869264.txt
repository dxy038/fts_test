The supply chain nowadays is more dynamic than before partly due to the information techniques and changes of consumer behaviors. This proposal analyzes the multiple objective optimization problems existing in the supply chain management, and the stochastic and dynamic circumstance of current supply chain. It presents a general overview of multi-objective optimization techniques, stochastic and dynamic programming. We attempt to apply these techniques to solve some optimization problems in supply chain, under changing environment. It can be a guideline of future research. There are mainly three parts of the proposal; the first is multiple objective optimization problems in the real supply chain management, and the stochastic and dynamic environment of the supply chain. The second part is the suggesting approaches dealing with multi-objective optimization problems and the stochastic, dynamic circumstance. The last part is attempting to apply these methods into a real case existing in the supply chain.

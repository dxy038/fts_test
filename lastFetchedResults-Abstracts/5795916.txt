We consider optimal cooperative control problems where multiple dynamically decoupled players cooperate to optimize a coupled objective under limited communication between each player. We present the explicit optimal control in terms of the solutions to a series of Riccati equations, therefore it can be computed in a distributed manner via standard techniques. Numerical examples including salvo guidance problems are described.

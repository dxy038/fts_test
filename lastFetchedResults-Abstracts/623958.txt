Abstract  
Background and Objective: Brucellosis is a zonosis that can be transmitted between species from animals to humans or from humans to animals, which is still a major health and economic problem. The main preventive strategy for  brucellosis is to educate rural ranchers on the basis of Precede framework.  We aimed to study the effect of educational intervention program based on Precede Model and its main components on preventive behaviors to reduce Brucellosis in the rural district of Khomein.
Material and Methods: In this pre-experimental randomized controlled study, the samples were 400 adult men of rural district of Khomein city randomly allocated to case and control groups. Data gathering instrument was a questionnaire based on Precede framework. Reliability of the questionnaire through the internal consistency test on the pilot phase was approved on 25 individual and the validity was confirmed by face validity. The intervention, based Precede framework, was a package of three 60-90 minute sessions conducted weekly.  The subjects were followed for three months and the data analyzed by independent T- test, paired T- test, analysis variance with repeated observations.  
Results: After intervention, the mean scores of predisposing (knowledge and attitude), reinforcing and enabling factors in case group is different significantly  from that in control group (p < 0.05). 
Conclusion:  Planning and implementation  of health education intervention via Precede framework could be positive in increasing preventive behaviors to reduce brucellosis incidence.

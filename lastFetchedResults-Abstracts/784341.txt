Objective Elevated parenting stress has been observed
among mothers of children with autism spectrum disorders
(ASDs) in western countries, but little is known about
mothers of Han Chinese children. The aim of the current
study was to further the knowledge about stress experienced
by Chinese mothers of children with ASD by
examining maternal parenting stress in Heilongjiang
province of China.
Methods In this cross-sectional study, data about participants’
demographic characteristics, parenting stress, anxiety,
depression, child’s behavioral problems, coping strategies,
and social support were collected though a questionnaire
survey. The participants included 150 families with ASD
children, who were consecutively admitted to the clinics of
the Children Development and Behavior Research Center in
Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang Disabled Persons
Federation, and Mudanjiang Child Welfare Home.
Results The participants reported elevated parenting
stress. Mothers’ parenting stress was associated with levels
of depression and anxiety, and child’s behavioral symptoms.
Child’s behavioral symptoms, maternal anxiety,
maternal depressive symptoms, and lack of governmental
financial support were associated with overall parenting
stress.
Conclusions Government support may play an important
role in reducing parenting stress in this population.

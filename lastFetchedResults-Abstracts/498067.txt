Background and objective: Upper aerodigestive tract have many common etiologies such as smoking alcohol use. Larynx is a part of upper aerodigestive tract, there fore, it could be postulated that Helicobacter pylori (HP) Play a role in the pathogenesis of laryngeal cancer as stomach. The purpose of this study is determining the correlation between laryngeal cancer and gastric HP and HP at the tissue level of the larynx.

Materials and methods: Our study was a Case- Control study in an Otolaryngology ward at an academic university. Totally, 65 patients with laryngeal cancer with 65 cancer free controls under went esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy of stomach. Antral and body biopsies were investigated for the existence of HP with rapid urease test. To survey the role of HP at the tissue level of the larynx, Specimens Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and benign laryngeal lesion were also investigated for the existence of HP with histopathologic evaluation and rapid urease test. Data was analyzed statistically with spss program.

Results: The proportion of subjects with positive rapid urease test for gastric HP was Similar between the two groups(49.2% aming Cases vs 40% among controls: p=0.290). However, Positive rapid ureas test (RUT) for body HP was Less among patients with laryngeal cancer and positive RUT for antral Â± body was Significantly higher in patients with laryngeal cancer (p=0.048). In 44 slides of laryngeal cancer and 30 Slides of benign Laryngeal lesions with RUT and hidtopathologic evaluation, non revealed HP existence.

Conclusion: Our study could not show the Helicobacter Pylori as one of etiologies of laryngeal cancer. However, it supportes of this hypothesis that colonization of HP in only gastric body with decreasing gastric acid protects against laryngeal cancer and antral HP with increasing gastric acid is predisposing factor for laryngeal cancer, suggesting that acid reflux is the underlying etiology.

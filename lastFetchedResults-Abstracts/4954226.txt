An experimental comparative study of various controllers for a class of AC-DC converters, known as power factor precompensators, is presented. The control objective is to robustly regulate the output voltage to a desired constant level in the presence of variations in the load, while retaining a unit power factor at the input, i.e. the input current should follow in frequency and in phase with the input voltage. Several nonlinear and adaptive control schemes are presented and compared via experiments.

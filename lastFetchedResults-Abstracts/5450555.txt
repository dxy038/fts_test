We present a methodology to systematically stress objective image quality estimators (QEs). Using computational results instead of expensive subjective tests, we obtain rigorous information of a QE´s performance on a constrained but comprehensive set of degraded images. Our process quantifies many of a QE´s potential vulnerabilities. Knowledge of these weaknesses can be used to improve a QE during its design process, to assist in selecting which QE to deploy in a real system, and to interpret the results of a chosen QE once deployed.

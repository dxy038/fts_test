Although therapy-mediated suppression of HIV-1 is effective and results in a degree of immune reconstitution, the complications resulting from life-long treatment emphasize the need for alternatives. This review discusses the use of structured interruptions in antiviral therapy to induce drug-free periods of immune-mediated control of HIV-1. Such an approach has the ultimate objective of harnessing anti-viral immune responses, reducing drug exposure (toxicity and cost) and potentially extending the clinical benefits of a suppressive treatment regimen.

The feasibility study and design is a key for engineering assets sustainability. The sustainability-based project objectives are generally derived from a project environment investigation and then relayed to the criterions or standards associated to alternatives assessment and optimization excused by planer or designer. However, it is difficult to undertake a sustainability-based planning or designing by those professionals independently on a Post-Disaster Aid Project (PDAP) after Wenchuan Earthquake. This paper tend to explore the issues relevant to decision-making on the PDAP, then a Sustainability-based Objective Relaying Approach (SORA) is presented by an empirical case study.

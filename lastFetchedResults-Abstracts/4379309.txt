In this paper, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in multi-channel cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is studied. The two fundamental issues in DSA, spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing, for a general scenario are revisited, where the channels present different usage characteristics and the detection performance of individual secondary users (SUs) varies. First, spectrum sensing is investigated, where multiple SUs are coordinated to cooperatively sense the channels owned by the primary users (PUs) for different interests. When the PUs´ interests are concerned, cooperative spectrum sensing is performed to better protect the PUs while satisfying the SUs´ requirement on the expected access time. For the SUs´ interests, the objective is to maximize the expected available time while keeping the interference to PUs under a predefined level. With the dynamics in the channel usage characteristics and the detection capacities, the coordination problems for the above two cases are formulated as nonlinear integer programming problems accordingly, which are proved to be NP-complete. To find the solution efficiently, for the former case, the original problem is transformed into a variant of convex bipartite matching problem by constructing a complete bipartite graph and defining proper weight vectors. Based on the problem transformation, a channel selection algorithm is proposed to compute the solution. For the latter case, the deterministic optimization problem is first transformed to an associated stochastic optimization problem, which is then solved by cross-entropy (CE) method of stochastic optimization. Then, the sharing of the available channels by SUs after sensing is modeled by a channel access game, based on the framework of weighted congestion game. An algorithm for SUs to select access channels to achieve Nash equilibrium (NE) is proposed. Simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

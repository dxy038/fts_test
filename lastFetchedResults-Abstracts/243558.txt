The present article reports on the research work carried out within the framework of the European project DISTOR. The objective is to conceive, analyze and test systems of storage of thermal energy of the type PCM (phase change materials) adapted to DSG (direct steam generation) technology for electricity production. A detailed model of heat transfer and fluid flow has been reported for numerical simulation of latent heat storage unit which takes into account the solid/liquid and water/vapour phase change processes occurring simultaneously in the PCM and heat transfer fluid with appropriate coupling between them. Reasonable and justified assumptions are then proposed in order to define the most significant process controlling parameters and derive a useful simplified model. Design and optimization procedure have been advised based on the present detailed and simplified models. The influences of various parameters on the operation of the system as well as the potential of new PCM composites are studied.

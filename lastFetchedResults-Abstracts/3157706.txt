Based on numerical image processing methods and visualization techniques, using the V-Sticher virtual fitting system, the research and evaluation on the realistic of fabric simulation model will be conducted. At first, the fabric performance effect in V-Sticher which is a virtual fitting system was studied, and then analyzes the correlation with the actual fabric physical properties measured by the FAST fabric style instrument. The cotton, hemp, silk, chemical fiber fabrics were tested and compared by V-Sticher fabric style instrument and FAST fabric style instrument; The main physical properties relation equation of the two evaluation systems were derived by separately. Using correlation coefficient method and neural network model, its correlation model is established, and the fabric physical properties correlation equation of the FAST system and the V-Sticher system are derived. The conversion equation can be used to conduct objective evaluation on the realistic of the V-Sticher three-dimensional imaging fabric simulation. WhatÂ´s more, using the method, the virtual fabric design is also feasible, and the method can be applied in fabric design and production process.

The objective of this study is to determine the effects of various factors on the performance of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. These factors are membrane thickness, hot-pressing conditions of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) either onto the membrane or membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and Teflon:carbon ratio in the GDL on PEM fuel cell performance. Homemade five-layer and commercial three-layer MEAs were used in the experiments. Nafion ® 112 and 115 which have nominal thicknesses of 50 and 125 μ m , respectively, were used as membranes. It was observed that fuel cell performance is inversely proportional to membrane thickness. In the case of five-layer MEAs, optimum hot-pressing conditions of catalyst-coated GDLs onto the membrane were found as 172 N cm - 2 . However, the maximum performance for three-layer MEAs was obtained with no press conditions. Also, by increasing Teflon:carbon ratio in the GDLs, PEM fuel cell performance increases up to a certain value, but further increase of this ratio worsen the performance.

In the case of two agents, competing to perform their respective nonpreemptive jobs on a single machine in the plant, this paper considers the objective to minimize the total job arrival times, i.e., the sum of time between job´s release and delivery to the corresponding agent, in the constrained optimization form. After investigating the properties of the optimal solution, we show the complexity of the problem, and present the dynamic programming algorithm.

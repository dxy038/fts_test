 Objective: Bronchial asthma is a complex heterogeneous disease of airway, which is associated with genetic and environmental factors. A complex network of enhancing and inhibitory costimulatory signals regulates T-cell differentiation and effector functions which play a central role in mediating the pathogenesis in allergic asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate and clear the role of CD86 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) as a possible immunopathogenic and etiologic factors in asthmatic patients and to find the relationship of these proteins with each other

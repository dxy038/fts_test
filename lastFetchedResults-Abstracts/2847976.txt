The rescheduling problem of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant under uncertain freshwater demand is studied. A rescheduling model of this problem is built, which is a bi-objective optimization with criterions of efficiency and stability. A rolling horizon scheduling (RHS) procedure is used to solve this problem. The framework of RHS is structured. A differential evolution (DE) algorithm is used to compute the solution, and its steps are described. The simulation results of a large-scale SWRO desalination plant with fluctuations in freshwater demand show that the performance of RHS is satisfied.

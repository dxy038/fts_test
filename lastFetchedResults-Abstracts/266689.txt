Utilizing drop-on-demand technology, we have successfully fabricated hydrogen–air polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), demonstrated some of the processing advantages of this technology and have demonstrated that the performance is comparable to conventionally fabricated membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). Commercial desktop inkjet printers were used to deposit the active catalyst electrode layer directly from print cartridges onto Nafion® polymer membranes in the hydrogen form. The layers were well-adhered and withstood simple tape peel, bending and abrasion tests and did so without any post-deposition hot press step. The elimination of this processing step suggests that inkjet-based fabrication or similar processing technologies may provide a route to less expensive large-scale fabrication of PEMFCs. When tested in our experimental apparatus, open circuit voltages up to 0.87 V and power densities of up to 155 mW cm−2 were obtained with a catalyst loading of 0.20 mg Pt cm−2. A commercially available membrane under identical, albeit not optimized test conditions, showed about 7% greater power density. The objective of this work was to demonstrate some of the processing advantages of drop-on-demand technology for fabrication of MEAs. It remains to be determined if inkjet fabrication offers performance advantages or leads to more efficient utilization of expensive catalyst materials.

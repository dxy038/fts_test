Background and Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a reticent but fatal disease worldwide. It is a health challenging issue due to its destructive, progressive and largely asymptomatic nature leading to kidney failure, accompanied by cardiovascular disease and costly treatment. Since there are fundamental problems increasing physicians effort in the process of diagnosis, electronic medical record system was designed in order to facilitate diagnosis by practitioners.

Materials and Methods: This research is of applied kind. The method of collecting information included books, articles, international system survey, patients records and the use of questionnaires.

Results: The system was designed to provide instant access to patientsrsquo  records and detect stages of disease at the time of diagnosis and is deemed to be valuable due to its facility, speed and accuracy. Its primary stage use, support the accuracy of this software in eventual diagnosis by more than 5%.

Conclusion: Improved quality of care, accurate organization of medical records, ease of use and accessibility, decreased medical errors, immediate access to information in different places, decision supporting technology and process improvement are among merits of this system.

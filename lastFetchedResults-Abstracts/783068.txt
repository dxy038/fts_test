Background We sought to develop a series
of assessment measures of psychiatric spectrum conditions
associated with major DSM-IV mood and anxiety
disorders that might capture the true phenotypes underlying
these disorders. The specific objective of this
report was to describe the methods we employed to create
instruments that could cross linguistic and national
boundaries and to evaluate the comparability of results
obtained when one of these instruments, the Structured
Clinical Interview for Panic-Agoraphobic Spectrum
(SCI-PAS), was administered in the United States and in
Italy. Method After developing, in parallel, the English
and the Italian versions of the SCI-PAS, identical protocols
were conducted in patients and control samples at
the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pisa to
examine the reliability and validity of the interview. Results
Total and domain scores on the SCI-PAS were strikingly
similar in the US and Italian patient groups and in
controls. In addition, similarly high levels of inter-rater
and test-retest reliability were found at the two sites. Finally,
virtually identical patterns of relationships were
found between the domains of the SCI-PAS and established
measures of the same constructs.Conclusions The
SCI-PAS displays similar reliability and validity properties
in the two versions. This suggests that the instrument
taps a phenotype that is consistent in American
and Italian patient and control populations

The objective of this paper is to find the robust fuzzy controller to achieve the robust stability with guaranteed cost for a class of uncertain time-delay systems. Based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model and controller, the robust stability condition is derived to ensure the robust quadratic stability of the system by using Lyapunov approach and at the same time the upper bound of considered cost is found. Moreover, the linear matrix inequality techniques are employed to solve the guaranteed cost problem. A fuzzy controller is developed to stabilize the uncertain system and keep the cost at a certain level. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed design method is demonstrated by a numerical example.

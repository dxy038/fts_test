The main objective of this active "panel" is to increase technical interaction among attendees. Team leaders will recruit participants to their team. Each team will try to clearly articulate the problems and come up with ways to solve this problem in the form of new business proposal. The teams will present their findings and business proposals in front of judges later during the conference. The winning team will be announced during the social event.

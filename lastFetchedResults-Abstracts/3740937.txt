In mobile ad hoc networks nodes should collaborate with each other to support the functions of the network. The trust management framework, which evaluates the trust of participating nodes, is used to force nodes to cooperate in a normal way. We make an effort to design a robust and attack-resistant trust management framework for the future. In this article we describe the vulnerabilities of and possible attacks on existing frameworks. An objective trust management framework is proposed to overcome these vulnerabilities. We provide a theoretical basis and skeleton for this framework. The performance evaluation and security analysis are provided showing the effectiveness and robustness of the OTMF compared with existing frameworks.

This paper proposed a novel LMI based robust multi-objective model predictive control technique. Such technique can be used to solve a trajectory tracking problem. The system is supposed to have polytopic uncertainty and subjected to asymmetric input constraints. With the proposed approach, we can guarantee the closed-loop stability and zero steady state tracking error. Finally, a canonical numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness.

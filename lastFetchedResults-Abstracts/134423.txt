Background: The use of non-prescribed antibiotic in children with diarrhea causes higher microbial resistance, poor therapeutic effects and excessive costs for both family and the government.
Objective: To determine the use of non-prescribed antibiotic in diarrheal children by mothers. Methods: Through a descriptive study at Qazvin Qods children hospital (2001), 301 diarrheal children were assessed. A questionnaire was used to collect the information based on replies given to questions made to mothers. The questionnaires contained demographic information and specific questions on history of antibiotic use, the reason for and also questions to evaluate the mother's general knowledge on antibiotic and so on.
Findings: Mother's and children's mean age were 25.37 years and 24.48 months, respectively. Sixty percent of cases were from an urban setting. Most mothers (23.6%) were found to have primary education. Two hundred mothers (66.2%) had given antibiotic to their children prior to admission to the hospital and among those, 35 (17.5%) reported the use of non-prescribed antibiotics. The most common medicines given by others (37.1%) were pills and syrups routinely used in diarrhea treatment followed by co-trimoxazol (22.8%). The reasons for use of non-prescribed antibiotic were based on a positive experience in previous diarrhea treatment in 40% of cases and lack of trust in doctors in 11.4% of cases. Ninety four mothers (33%) were found to be unfamiliar with antibiotics.
Conclusion: However the use of non-prescribed antibiotics was less than our expectation. Programs for promoting the knowledge of mothers and also their education on drugs' contraindication are necessary.

Objectives
modified glass ionomers (RMGI) have demonstrated clinical success providing immediate and long-term relief from root sensitivity. RMGIs have been recently introduced as paste-liquid systems for convenience of clinical usage. The objective of this study was to measure the ability of a new paste-liquid RMGI to reduce fluid flow through human dentin, compared to an established single-bottle nanofilled total etch resin adhesive indicated for root desensitization.
s
 permeability was measured on human crown sections on etched dentin, presenting a model for the exposed tubules typical of root sensitivity, and permitting measurement of the maximum permeability. In the first two groups, the etched dentin was coated with either the RMGI or adhesive, and permeability measured on the coated dentin. In a third group, a smear layer was created on the dentin with sandpaper, then the specimens were coated with the RMGI; permeability was measured on the smeared and coated dentin. Specimens from each group were sectioned and examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
s
he resin adhesive and the new paste-liquid RMGI protective material significantly reduced fluid flow through dentin, and exhibited excellent seal on dentin with either open tubules or smear-layer occluded tubules. The RMGI infiltrated the smear layer with resin during placement, penetrated dentin tubules, and formed resin tags.
icance
GI was equivalent to the adhesive in its ability to reduce fluid flow and seal dentin. It is therefore concluded that the new RMGI and the adhesive show the potential to offer excellent sensitivity relief on exposed root dentin.

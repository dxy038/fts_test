Executive functions are among abilities which school children require for learning in the future and deficit in executive functions in preschool children can continue into the older age and leads to serious problems in children in relation to doing their homework and other personal affairs. The objective of the present study is to determine the validity, reliability and factor structure of the per-school version of behavioral rating inventory of executive functions (parent’s form) in Iranian children. The present study comprised 592 children aged from 2 - 5 years selected from pre-school centers of the city of Isfahan in 2013 - 2014 using cluster random sampling method, with their parents answering the questions asked in this inventory. The correlation coefficient among items with a total score of factors, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, confirmatory factor analysis, and the correlation coefficient among the subscales were used to measure the reliability and internal consistency of the inventory. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed embedding items and the five-factor structure of the inventory including inhibition, shift, and emotional control, working memory and planning. In addition, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was at satisfactory level for each of the factors and the total score of the scale (? 0.60). In general, it can be concluded that the behavior rating inventory of executive function (BRIEF) for preschool-aged children is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring executive functions of Iranian children, and can be used as a suitable means for psychological research and clinical situations.

The objective of this study is to examine the role of governance on economic growth in 63 selected countries. Countries in the sample are classified into two groups: good governance and weak governance.  Panel data approach is employed to estimate specified models using the data during the period 1996– 2009. The results of this article confirm that the governance indicators have positive and statistically significant effect on economic growth. The governance indicators included in the empirical model are political stability, government effectiveness, protection intellectual property rights and corruption. Moreover, some control variables such as R&amp;amp;amp;¬D expenditures, public expenditures on education are included in the empirical model. The results of estimates show that these variables have also positive and statistically significant effect on economic growth in both groups.

Creating reactive motions with existing motion-capture systems is difficult because they require a variety of task environments. To overcome this drawback, we propose a reactive motion capture system that combines the existing motion capture system with haptic feedback and a human- scale virtual environment. Our objective is to acquire reactive motion data generated from the interaction between haptic feedback and the virtual environment, using the fact that a personÂ´s motions in real world can be represented by the reactions of the person to real objects. We asked the subject to trace the rim of the front of a cube under six task conditions and measured their fingertip trajectories as motion data. The results demonstrated that our proposed system is useful for generating data for natural-looking motions similar to real-world motions.

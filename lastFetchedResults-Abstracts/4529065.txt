Sudden service disruption due to natural or man-made disaster is one of the major threats to commercial supply chains and military logistics at present. In this paper, we present an integer-linear programming model for critical facilities protection based on time satisfaction, which could overcome the weakness of simply using time and distance in previous researches. The objective function is maximizing time satisfaction of the system in every elimination pattern. Then we combine genetic algorithms (GAs) with simulated annealing to solve this model. At the end, a numerical example is used to illustrate the application of the model, which shows the method is feasible and efficient.

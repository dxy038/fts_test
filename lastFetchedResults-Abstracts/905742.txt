The Dongtan Nature Reserve, one of the largest nature reserves in East Asia, is located in the mouth of the
Yangtze Estuary and is an important habitat for migratory birds. The Dongtan wetlands were listed in the
Chinese ProtectedWetlands in 1992, and were designated as internationally important under the Ramsar
Wetlands Convention in 2001 and as a national nature reserve in 2005. By their very nature and location,
the estuarine and coastal habitats are dynamic and their biodiversity conservation and management
relies on up-to-date spatial information. By establishing qualitative and quantitative relationships
between bird populations and key habitat factors such as elevation, land cover type, tidal creek density
and macrophytobenthos biomass, we developed an object-oriented image approach, in conjunction with
Geographical Information Systems and the data from current field surveys, to analyze and assess the
habitat suitability for the main types of birds, namely Anatidae, Charadriidae, Ardeidae and Laridae, at
the reserve. The results from this study showed that about 40% of the total area of the Dongtan Reserve
contained suitable habitats for these four bird families. The Scirpus mariqueter zone, mudflat zone, and
tidal creeks were the most important habitats for these birds. This study indicated the potential of this
approach for objective and effective evaluation of the species habitat suitability in a dynamic estuarine
and coastal area. The implications of the results as a tool for biodiversity conservation, wetland
conservation, and ecosystem management are discussed.

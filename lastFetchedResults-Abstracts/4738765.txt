A reverse transformation method based on the projective area overlapping has been presented for the surface matching in the application of automotive styling from 2-D to 3-D. The matching criteria and the objective function have also been discussed and used in the simulation matching. The simple evolutionary strategy has been implemented into the system and evaluated to realise the optimal matching. The simulation results demonstrate that the strategy applied here can tackle the surface matching problem.

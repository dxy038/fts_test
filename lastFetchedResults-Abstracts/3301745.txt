Under normal operation, a driver will manipulate the steering wheels to control the yaw rate. In an unexpected case like risk aversion, the driver will manipulate the steering wheel as to suppress a lateral acceleration. Depending on the objective of the vehicle at a given time, the D* value align with a lateral acceleration and a yaw rate is define and input. The idea here is to understand the real situations of a vehicle and use this situation to develop the ideal value by a control rule. In this research, we design the value of d, which uses a D* control, to be variable, and build a new D* control rule that correspond to change in side wind disturbance, steering-wheel operation, and the road surface condition.

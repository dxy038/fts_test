Cooperative networks have been presented as a topology for next generation mobile networks. It realizes a new form of diversity. Diversity can be achieved in MIMO relay networks using high complexity equalizers and error free forwarding to relays. It has already been proposed how to achieve joint diversity in decode and forward MIMO relay networks. To achieve this objective, power scaling strategy and channel controlled ARQ schemes were proposed. Zero Forcing Equalizers were employed to maintain low complexity at both relay and destination. Cooperative relays will be adopted in the MIMO relay networks. Closed form expressions for probability of error is derived for the system. Also a threshold based relay node selection algorithm is proposed for selecting the best relay where each relay node decides to relay or keep silent according to its own instantaneous channel gain and a predefined threshold, Mathematical expressions are derived for the above mentioned networks. Simulation results are shown for the same.

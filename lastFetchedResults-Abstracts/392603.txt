Objective: Although microsurgical bone transplant is still the gold standard, mandibular reconstruction plates (MRP) were for several years considered a fast and safe way to restore mandibular continuity without using a bone graft. New plate designs with locking screws have been recently introduced, and these may overcome some of the complications related to previous designs. We review the results of mandibular reconstruction plates in our institution from 1991 to 1995. Methods: The records of nine cancer patients who underwent lateral mandibular resections (with preservation of both condyle and symphysis) followed by reconstruction with a mandibular reconstruction plate, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were treated between 1991 and 1995 with regular Synthes and Leibinger plates (without locking screws). Immediately after tumour resection, the bone defect was reconstructed with an MRP without bone grafting. Three cases required soft tissue coverage: two flaps and one buccal fat pad flap. Results: There was immediate orocervical fistula in six cases, one of which required surgical closure; and late complications were common. One patient died due to distant metastasis 13 months after surgery without symptoms related to the plate. The remaining eight patients had their plates removed at between 9 and 52 months after reconstruction, due to screw loosening (four cases), plate exposure (one case), or both (three cases). Conclusion: Lateral mandibular reconstruction with non-locking screws and regular profile plates is no longer recommended. New plates with improved designs are currently available. Their low profile and locking screws are the usual characteristics of these new plates. More clinical experience is necessary before plate reconstruction can be recommended over microvascular bone transfer.

This paper describes a generic framework for activity recognition based on temporal signals acquired from multiple input modalities and demonstrates its use for eyeâ€“hand data fusion. As a part of the data fusion framework, we present a multi-objective Bayesian Framework for Feature Selection with a pruned-tree search algorithm for finding the optimal feature set(s) in a computationally efficient manner. Experiments on endoscopic surgical episode recognition are used to investigate the potential of using eye-tracking for pervasive monitoring of surgical operation and to demonstrate how additional information induced by hand motion can further enhance the recognition accuracy. With the proposed multi-objective BFFS algorithm, suitable feature sets both in terms of feature relevancy and redundancy can be identified with a minimal number of instruments being tracked.

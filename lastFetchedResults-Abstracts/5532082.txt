With the development of the economics, many industries continually develop different project for the industries live. However, not all projects success to arrive the goal, because many risks live in those and affect the success or not. Evaluation is the most important step, and many evaluating problem possess multiple evaluating criteria, therefore multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is extensively use on many evaluating project. The study proposes two stages of project evaluation model. First, determining a shortlist of vendors by the grey relational analysis (GRA), and then Modified Delphi technique is used to identify the most appropriate evaluation criteria. Entropy theory is applied to determine the objective weight values in the second stage. Additionally, GRA theory is applied to calculate and rank the best efficiency in the information system project (ISP) evaluating model. The proposed can provide primary clinic administrators with a decision-making and evaluation criteria that actively encourage the medical sector outsource to information technology contractors. Furthermore, GRA Entropy model can assist the primary practitioner in similar multi-criteria tasks in an objective and systematic manner when selecting appropriate information software firms.

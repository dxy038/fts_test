Speech quality of VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) may potentially be degraded by transmission errors such as packet loss and delay, which is basically inevitable in best-effort communications. This study investigates an error concealment technique for such degradation by using a receiver-based technique called pitch waveform replication. For enhancing the conventional technique, this study proposes a waveform reconstruction technique that also takes account of the pitch variation between the backward and forward frames of gap frames. From experimental results of objective evaluation, it is indicated that the proposed technique may potentially be useful for improving the speech quality, compared with the conventional technique.

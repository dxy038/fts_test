Background & Objective: Today, new technology has provided the visually impaired with equal opportunities for education and access to essential information. The use of these technologies by students with visual impairment is vital. The purpose of this study was to design an application for health training of the visually impaired and assess their views about its advantages and disadvantages.
Methods: This was a qualitative study in which a list of mental health information essential for the visually impaired was provided as a result of interviewing 15 blind individuals with different education degrees. Subsequently, this information was recorded in audio files by a person with appropriate voice and presented in the form of a multimedia compact disc. Finally, their views were evaluated.
Results: The results of this study showed that the blind were generally satisfied with the quality of the software and believed it improves their learning. However, some of the participants believed its content must be better and present more complete information about diseases. They believed that this application should be designed for other health information necessary to them.
Conclusion: Considering the role of information technology and e-learning tools in improvement of learning in the visually impaired and the necessity of health information for them, trainers and training managers must consider designing and implementing of such tools to educate essential health issues.

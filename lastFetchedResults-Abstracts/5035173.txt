Understand thermal, electrical and optics characteristics of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) is essential to achieve a good performance to the lighting system. This paper presents an optimized methodology for designing LED lighting systems. The objective is to provide the designers an optimal operation point taking into account thermal, electric and optical LED system characteristics. The proposed methodology brings the possibility to consider driver output current, heatsink size and LED junction temperature in the system design. A mathematical analysis is presented and experimental results validate the proposed methodology.

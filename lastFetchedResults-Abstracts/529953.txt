Data envelopment analysis model is a model for calculating the efficiency of decision making units (DMUs). In previous models there are some weaknesses that the most important one is changing weights of inputs and outputs in model that lead to evaluate efficiencies of DMUs with different weights. The important subject is that How we should evaluate all of decision making units with one set of weights and optimize their efficiencies simultaneously. This paper aims to present a new model that eliminates the weaknesses of previous models. Odeveloped model is designed based on multi objective decision making models and this model is solved with fuzzy solution method of multi objective decision making models and leads to creating common weights. The main object of research that was better ranking of DMUs rather than basic models have been done by using this model and this is showed with solving the model on an example.

The concept of broadcasting multimedia content from the television service providers to the viewers over the Internet is known as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). To get wide acceptance from the consumers, this technology has to provide at least same or better quality of service (QoS) than the existing satellite and terrestrial television technologies. To establish this, maintaining QoS is an important research area to provide good quality of experience (QoE) for the viewers. This paper proposes an approach to measure color error in Full Reference (FR) or Reduced Reference (RR) quality assessment method in the sense to monitor the quality for providing better service. This technique provides good results as we found measuring both subjective and objective test.

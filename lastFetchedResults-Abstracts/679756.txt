Forest fires are the main disturbance in the Mediterranean basin, exerting both immediate and lasting ecological and environmental impacts. This is in part caused by transformation of the quality and quantity of organic matter (OM), which is reflected in the structure of the whole system and negatively affects soil health and quality, also favouring the occurrence of erosion processes. However, the effects of fire on soil colloidal properties are reversible. Thus, the main objective of this work was the identification of proxies for the recovery of soils affected by forest fires. This was approached using a cross disciplinary and comparative study of fire-affected and non-affected soils at different timescales chosen from a variety of scenarios from Andalusia (Southern Spain). Changes in soil fractions and forms of OM were studied using different analytical techniques [gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC/MS), pyrolysis (Py)-GC/MS and solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)]. Among the main results is the detection of markers from the analysis of thermo-evaporation products, mainly furan derivatives, released from whole soil samples using sub-pyrolysis temperatures. Shifts in fatty acid patterns and other families of pyrolysis products from soil were observed using conventional Py-GC/MS. Extracted soil lipids were also a valid proxy and differences were found in the distribution pattern of certain aliphatic series and terpenes. Other chemical modifications were also observed after fire, and 13C NMR analysis suggests an enrichment in aromatic structures in fire-affected soils. These differential characteristics could be used as markers for monitoring the recovery of soils after wildfire events.

We consider the problem of localized energy aware routing in mobile ad hoc networks. In localized routing algorithms, each node forwards a message based on the position of itself, its neighbors and the destination. The objective of energy aware routing algorithms is to minimize the total power for routing a message from source to destination or to maximize the total number of routing tasks that a node can perform before its battery power depletes. In this paper we propose a new localized energy aware routing algorithm called OLEAR. The algorithm shows a high packet delivery rate with low packet forwarding and battery power consumption. In addition, it ensures a good energy distribution among the nodes and packets reach their destinations using smaller number of hops. All these properties make our algorithm suitable for routing in any energy constrained environment. We compare the performance of OLEAR with existing energy and non energy aware localized algorithms. Simulation experiments show that OLEAR presents comparable energy consumption and distribution to other energy aware algorithms and better packet delivery rates.

Undersea exploration is one of the pioneering fields in an oceanic environment for various tactical surveillances. Underwater acoustic communication is preferred over electromagnetic communication due to limited bandwidth, energy consumption and delay. Propagation speed in underwater environment is five orders magnitude less than terrestrial communication. The prime objective is to find out a good performance metric protocol design with recovery mode in underwater environment, so, Effective Hydrocast was proposed which was partially state full and the cost was calculated with Energy Consumption, Throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio and Propagation Delay. The concept of triangulation was introduced in order to avoid long detour paths incurred by Hydrocast. The simulations of this network in an underwater environment was estimated using ns2 simulator with Aquasim patch and comparisons had been made for Effective Hydrocast, Hydrocast, and Void Aware Pressure Routing with 100 nodes for Energy Consumption and Throughput of which Effective Hydrocast is found to be better than Hydrocast. A simple regression model is developed for the data obtained through ns2 simulation and tested without any autocorrelation between them with Durbin Watson analysis using Statistical Package for Social Science tool.

This paper presents a study about the effect of numerical parameters on an optimal path planning of robot manipulators taking into account robot actuating energy and grasping forces in manipulator gripper. The mechanical power due to actuators for manipulator motion and energy for gripper action have been considered for the formulation of a multi-objective function. The optimization problem has been formulated as subject to physical constraints, input torque/force constraints and payload limits. In this paper we have reported results of a numerical investigation of the effect of main parameters on the solution characteristics of path planning for robotic manipulators. The study has been focused on a Puma like robot and results have been discussed to compare different numerical solutions of the proposed path planning.

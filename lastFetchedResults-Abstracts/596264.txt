Goal:To analyse MDR-TB (resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin)in FBiH from 2000-2007 years by previous anti-TB treatment status. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis of the reported cases with MDR-TB in FBiH during 2000-2007 notified through drug susceptibility testing (DST) in five laboratories according to the recommendation of the WHO and IUATLD in Europe and elsewhere was done. Results: Total cases with DST results: 1034 (never treated 913; previously treated 121) in 2000; 1184 (1054;129) in 2001; 1036 (936;100) in 2002; 1042 (951;91) in 2003; 1125 (1048;77) in 2004; 769(692;77) in 2005; 908(827;81)in 2006; 951 (847;104) in 2007. MDR-TB among never-treated cases: 1 (0.11%) in 2000; 2 (0.19%) in 2001; 4 (0.42%) in 2002; 1 (0.10%) in 2003; 4 (0.38%) in 2004; 4 (0.57%) in 2005; 2 (0.24%) in 2006; 7 (0.82%) in 2007. MDR-TB among previously-treated cases: 2 (1.65%)in 2000; 7 (5.42%) in 2001; 9 (9.0%) in 2002; 1 (1.09%) in 2003; 6 (7.79%)in 2004; 5 (6.49%) in 2005; 3 (3.70%) in 2006; 10 (9.61%) in 2007. Total MDR-TB: 3 (0.29%) in 2000; 9 (0.76%) in 2001; 13 (1.25%) in 2002; 2 (0.19%) in 2003; 10(0.88%) in 2004; 9 (1.17%) in 2005; 5 (0.55%) in 2006; 17 (1.78%) in 2007. Conclusion: Data for cases registered in FBiH had shown levels of lower, stable resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs in the mentioned period. In FBiH, the yearly prevalence of MDR-TB is estimated by the national laboratory system of reporting. Primary and acquired MDR-TB are analysed separately. Procedures for testing the sensitivity of Isoniazid and Rifampicin, two anti-tuberculosis drugs which define MDR-TB, are very reliable within the SRL network.

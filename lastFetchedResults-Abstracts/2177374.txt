Food safety is of extreme importance to human health. Vanillin and ethyl vanillin are the widely used food additives and spices in foods, beverages, cosmetics and drugs. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the impact of vanillin and ethyl vanillin on the activities of CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 in human liver microsomes (HLM) in vitro, and impact on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C, CYP3A and CYP2E1 in rat liver microsomes (RLM) in vivo. The in vitro results demonstrated that vanillin and ethyl vanillin had no significant effect on the activity of five human CYP450 enzymes with concentration ranged from 8 to 128 Î¼M. However, after rats were orally administered vanillin or ethyl vanillin once a day for seven consecutive days, CYP2E1 activity was increased and CYP1A2 activity was decreased in RLM. The in vivo results revealed that drug interaction between vanillin/ethyl vanillin and the CYP2E1/CYP1A2-metabolizing drugs might be possible, and also suggested that the application of the above additives in foods and drugs should not be unlimited so as to avoid the adverse interaction.

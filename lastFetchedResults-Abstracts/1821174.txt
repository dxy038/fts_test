Objective
us studies have suggested that Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is involved in the aetiology of aggressive periodontitis as well as chronic periodontitis. In addition, some authors have also reported that serotype-specific antigens of A. actinomycetemcomitans determine the severity of disease. This study aimed to elucidate the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans and the distribution of A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes in Brazilian subjects with chronic periodontitis.

l of 486 individuals were enrolled in this survey. All patients received clinical examinations that included periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, plaque, and gingival indexes. Subgingival samples were taken for microbial analysis. The genomic DNA of A. actinomycetemcomitans was provided by PCR.
s
 486 subjects examined, A. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated in 85 (17.5%) individuals. Out of 85 positive samples, 68 were infected by at least 1 serotype, 7 by mixed infection, and 10 were non-serotyped. Serotypes d and f were not detected. Serotype c showed the highest prevalence (52.9%), followed by serotype a (31.8%).
sions
roup analysis revealed that, in slight/moderate periodontitis, serotypes c and a were significantly more prevalent than serotypes b and dâ€“f; the prevalence of serotype c in severe periodontitis was significantly greater than that of serotypes a and b. Our data were similar in Asian and Eurasian populations.

  Objective(s):Transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) is involved in colorectal cancer (CRC). The SD-208 acts as an anti-cancer agent in different malignancies via TGF-β signaling. This work aims to show the effect of manipulation of TGF-β signaling on some miRNAs implicated in CRC. Materials and Methods: We investigated the effects of SD-208 on SW-48, a colon adenocarcinoma cell line. The cell line was treated with 0.5, 1 and 2 μM concentrations of SD-208. Then, the xenograft model of colon cancer was established by subcutaneous inoculation of SW-48 cell line into the nude mice. The animals were treated with SD-208 for three weeks. A quantitative real-time PCR was carried out for expression level analysis of selected oncogenic (miR-21, 31, 20a and 135b) and suppressor-miRNAs (let7-g, miR-133b, 145 and 200c). Data were analyzed using the 2-∆∆CT method through student’s t-test via the GraphPad Prism software. Results: Our results revealed that SD-208 could significantly down-regulate the expression of one key onco-miRNA, miR-135b, in either SW-48 colon cells (P=0.006) or tumors orthotopically implanted in nude mice (P=0.018). Our in silico study also predicted that SD-208 could modulate the expression of potential downstream tumor suppressor targets of the miR135b. Conclusion: Our data provide novel evidence that anticancer effects of SD-208 (and likely other TGF-β inhibitors) may be owing to their ability to regulate miRNAs expression.

The objective of this paper is to propose an alternative method for improving the supply chain performance in terms of supply chain cost (SSC) reduction. DEA-based performance measurement was implemented. SSC was estimated by employing the activity-based costing (ABC) method. The proposed method was verified by a case-based application of an ore dressing company in Thailand. In addition, value stream mapping of lean management was employed to improve performance. The results revealed performance improvement with a significant supply chain cost reduction.

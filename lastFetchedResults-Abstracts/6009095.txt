For the depletion of the limited traditional energy and the deterioration of the living environment, it is a focus of attention of the word for utilization of clean and renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen energy. In this paper a storage system made of batteries is used for an efficient energy management in a hybrid renewable power system (HRPS). A bidirectional DC-DC converter is used to charge or discharge the battery bank. Design considerations are discussed. The control system is developed on a TMS320F2407 DSP from Texas Instruments. Finally, some experimental results of the system are presented.

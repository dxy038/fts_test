To expand the matrix converter application in high power area, a new three-level diode-clamped matrix converter topology as well as a related multicarrier-based modulation scheme is proposed. The topology inherits the features from the conventional multilevel inverter and the indirect matrix converter, which is composed of a cascaded-rectifier and a three-level diode-clamped inverter. The proposed topology can overcome the voltage rating limits of the power semiconductors for high-voltage applications to some extent. Meanwhile, except the general advantages, such as bidirectional power flow, sinusoidal input and output currents, simple switch commutation, and a compact structure, it also avoids the voltage balance issue that exists in most conventional multilevel inverters. Finally, the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed topology and modulation scheme are verified by simulation and experimental results.

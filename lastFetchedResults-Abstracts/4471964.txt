To improve utilization rate of frequency resources and ensure QoS for different users and services, this paper proposed a mixed service resource allocation algorithm for power-line communication. Firstly the multi-user multi-service power line communication is modeled as multi-objective optimization based on OFDM resource allocation. Then the optimization allocation strategy implements priority to ensure the fixed rate for real-time user and the minimum rate for non-real-time user, considering the communication throughput. The proposed algorithm guarantees the requirements in both the fixed rate of real-time user and the minimum rate of non-real-time user at less resource costs, which maximizes the system communication capacity by allocating more resources to non-real-time user. Fairness among users is maintained by scheduling subcarriers based on overall channel conditions. The experiment results illustrate that the proposed method can ensure fairness among different users within different services and achieve better throughput performance.

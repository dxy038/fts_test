Explicit path setup and constraint-based routing make Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) a suitable technology to consider QoS constraints of the user and traffic engineering (TE) objectives of the provider. This work focuses on the problem of selecting bandwidth guaranteed path for MPLS based networks. The selected path should also fulfill the providerÂ´s objective of reducing the blocking probability of requests. We achieve this dual target by combining the best of load balancing (to avoid bottle-neck links) and load packing (to avoid resource defragmentation). In addition to this, we also take into consideration the granularity of requests. We further exploit the offline or preprocessing phase for complexity reduction and online phase for interference reduction. Simulation results show that our algorithm is able to reduce the blocking probability of requests in the network for different arrival distribution (uniform or non-uniform) and varying demand size (small or large).

In the next generation cellular communication environment, the effective delivery of multimedia traffic will become an increasingly important issue. In multimedia cellular networks, we should not only minimize handoff dropping probability, but also control new call blocking probability and utilize bandwidth efficiently. In this paper, a novel preemptive time-threshold based bandwidth allocation scheme(PTTS) is presented. The main idea of the new scheme is based on monitoring the elapsed real time of handoff calls and according to a time threshold (t<sub>e</sub>), a handoff call is either slightly-prioritized or fully-prioritized and preempt a new call. A slightly-prioritized handoff call has higher priority than a new call and lower priority than a fully-prioritized handoff call. Our simulation results show that the individual quality of service criteria of multiclass traffic such as handoff dropping probability can be achieved within targeted objective and the new call blocking probability is constrained to be below a level.

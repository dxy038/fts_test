Therefore, how to avoid and reduce its impact is particularly important. Then, the emergency plan is an important part of the emergency rescue system, and the effective evaluation should be made for the highway emergency plan, which is of great importance to make fast and effective emergency response and reduce the impact of the emergency. In this paper, according to the characteristics of highway emergency plan and the related research, the evaluation index system is firstly established, then, G1 method is used in the calculation of the index weights, and thus the fuzzy evaluation method is cited to make a comprehensive evaluation on the emergency plan, which make subjective evaluation objective, so the accuracy of the evaluation have been improved. Finally an example is given to verify the proposed method, which provides the effective assessment to the highway emergency for reference.

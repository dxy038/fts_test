Because of the forward and reverse operations in green e-commerce, its trust management forms a closed-loop structure. Based on its closed-loop network model, a novel trust chain management model and corresponding evaluation system are established. Further, trust value measurement in green e-commerce is described as a fuzzy multi- objective group decision making (FMOGDM) problem with uncertain group preference, solved by a fuzzy TOPSIS and illustrated by a numerical example.

The objective of this work is to develop a greater understanding of the mechanisms controlling fretting under various vibration conditions. This information is intended to provide a basis for understanding and reducing this potential problem in automotive connectors. Toward this end, an experimental study of connector samples under multifrequency vibration has been conducted. The primary connector being investigated is a single row PC-type connector. A secondary specimen tested is a single row automotive connector

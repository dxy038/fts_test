A novel Pareto-based multi-objective fully-informed particle swarm algorithm (FIPS) is proposed to solve flexible job-shop problems in this paper. Firstly, the population is ranked based on Pareto optimal concept. And the neighborhood topology used in FIPS is based on the Pareto rank. Secondly, the crowding distance of individuals is computed in the same Pareto level for the secondary rank. Thirdly, addressing the problem of trapping into the local optimal, the mutation operators based on the coding mechanism are introduced into our algorithm. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to several benchmark instances and comparing the experimental results.

In this paper, we propose a novel video quality impairment monitoring scheme, called VR-VQMS (Visual Rhythm based Video Quality Monitoring Scheme), over an IPTV service in the presence of reduced reference. The proposed scheme quantifies the amount of quality impairment due to packet loss experienced by end users. Visual rhythm is used as feature information in the reduced reference method. We define NPSNR (Networked Peak-to-peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) as a new objective quality metric. We also define several additional objective and subjective metrics including NMOS (Networked Mean Opinion Score) to obtain statistics about location, duration, number of times, and amount of quality impairment. Two scenarios, on-line and off-line VR-VQMS, are proposed as the simple yet practical solutions for a commercial IPTV service. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme closely approximates the results from the full reference method and gives good estimation of subjective quality experienced by test observers. We expect that the proposed scheme can be implemented as a small and light agent program running on a resource-limited set-top box.

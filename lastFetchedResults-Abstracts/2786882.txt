This paper investigates the problem of direction following for planar snake robots. The control objective is to regulate the linear velocity vector of the snake robot to a constant reference while guaranteeing boundedness of the system states. The proposed feedback control strategy enforces virtual constraints encoding a lateral undulatory gait, parametrized by states of dynamic compensators used to regulate the orientation and forward speed of the snake robot.

The aims of the present research study are as follows: determining the status of
"assessment of mental-spiritual upheaval" in treatment of religious clients,
describing its measuring tools, investigating the relationship between mentalspiritual
upheaval and mental health. Hence, the criteria for identification of mentalspiritual
upheaval were established and an objective instrument was prepared for its
measurement. The primary research study was carried out on 324 undergraduate
students using General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and Allport's Religious
Orientation Scale (ROS). The results showed adequate reliability and validity of
Mental-Spiritual Upheaval Questionnaire. They also suggest that there is a
significant and positive relation between mental health and stages of mental-spiritual
upheaval. Utilization of this instrument will lead to a relatively adequate assessment
of symptoms of mental-spiritual upheaval. It is also useful for diagnosis of
individual in-depth spiritual-mental disorders

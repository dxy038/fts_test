In this paper, we consider the traffic grooming, routing, and wavelength assignment (GRWA) problem for optical mesh networks. In most previous studies on optical mesh networks, traffic demands are usually assumed to be wavelength demands, in which case no traffic grooming is needed. In practice, optical networks are typically required to carry a large number of lower rate (sub-wavelength) traffic demands. Hence, the issue of traffic grooming becomes very important since it can significantly impact the overall network cost. In our study, we consider traffic grooming in combination with traffic routing and wavelength assignment. Our objective is to minimize the total number of transponders required in the network. We first formulate the GRWA problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Unfortunately, for large networks it is computationally infeasible to solve the ILP problem. Therefore, we propose a decomposition method that divides the GRWA problem into two smaller problems: the traffic grooming and routing problem and the wavelength assignment problem, which can then be solved much more efficiently. In general, the decomposition method only produces an approximate solution for the GRWA problem. However, we also provide some sufficient condition under which the decomposition method gives an optimal solution. Finally, some numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.

In this paper, a novel three-phase, DC/AC converter suitable for distributed power applications is proposed. The system consists of three DC/DC boost converters with a common point and operating as a three-phase inverter with intrinsic step-up capability. The converter obtained can invert, amplify and, where possible, regenerate bidirectional power sources such as fuel-cells, small gas turbines, and photovoltaic arrays. There are two main advantages to the system: the use of only six insulated gate bipolar transistors and small passive elements, and the fact that it does not need reverse voltage blocking capability. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed system during both steady-state and dynamic operations.

Genetic variation is primary requirment of any breeding program which establishes from the natural evolution
and warrants sustainable production of plants under variable environmental conditions. One of the successful
methods to introgress desirable agronomic genes from bread wheat ancestors to wheat is producing synthetic
hexaploid wheat. The objective of presents study is to assess genetic diversity of synthetic hexaploid wheats
using morphological traits. Ninty-nine synthetic hexaploid wheats were evaluated under field conditions. The
results indicated a significant variation in the synthetic-hexaploid wheat genotypes. Grain yield per plant had the
highest coefficient of variation and days to maturity had the lowest coefficient of variation. Polymorphism was
observed for traits such as flag leaf color, glume color, auricle color, hairy auricle, hairy node and hairy glume.
There was a positive and significant correlation between plant height and glume length, also between glume
length and grain yield per plant. Grain yield per plant and yield components were also correlated significantly.
Correlations between phonological traits such as days to heading and days to pollination (r=0.42**( as well as
between days to maturity and days to pollination (r=0.28**) were positive and significant. The results of
stepwise regression indicated that number of grain per spike, number of spikes per plant and 1000 grains weight
could explained 47% of variation of grain yield per plant.

The overall objective of this paper is to demonstrate the ability of the spectral moments method, a new method in electromagnetism, to incorporate absorbing boundary conditions. This demonstration is done successfully with plane pulse propagation in free space, and through a comparison with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) results. The very good agreement of the results leads to the conclusion that the spectral moments method application for electromagnetic propagation and diffraction problems should be further investigated

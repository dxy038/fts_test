The Interline Power Flow Controller (IPFC) among the Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) is one of the most versatile devices, especially for power flow control of multiline systems. This paper presents a new utilization of IPFC in power systems. In this paper, IPFC is used as an Automatic Generation Control (AGC). In order to obtain this objective, Power Injection Model (PIM) among the other IPFCÂ´s models is chosen and implemented into the modified IEEE-14 bus test system. Power flow of the test system in presence of IPFC is done using programming with MATLAB software and the results are presented. The results indicate that IPFC can be utilized as an AGC.

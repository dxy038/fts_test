Automatic vehicle accident detection is a life-saving application that is vital in today´s high speed motorways. In case of motorway accidents, notification to the proper authorities must be done efficiently and expediently. The main objective of this paper is to create a Real Time Traffic Accident Detection System (RTTADS) using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) Technologies. This paper explains the hardware prototype setup for RTTADS, the algorithms used, the advantages and the limitations of the entire system. Also the configuration of the setup and application software is elaborated. Sensors installed in a vehicle detect the accident´s location, the vehicle´s speed just before the accident and the number of passengers in the vehicle. The sensors then send an alert signal to a monitoring station. The monitoring station, in turn, tracks the location where the accident has occurred and directs casualty alert to the authorities concerned.

This paper presents a pattern synthesis method based on two powerful tools of the Evolutionary computing i.e Differential Evolution, Invasive weed optimization and Firefly technique, to provide a significant side lobe reduction. The Antenna elements are embedded on a hemispherical array that leads to one of the geometry of a conformal shape. The array elements are excited with uniform amplitude excitation and progressively phased. The calculation of the element position is presented. The hemispherical array geometry is designed to meet multi objective criteria such as to achieve the desired side lobe reduction, null point detection and main beam enhancement. The exploitative changes of the Invasive Weed Optimization, Differential Evolution and Firefly algorithms have been applied for this array pattern synthesis. Simulation results of the conformal array design have been presented to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the Weed technique on the Differential Evolution and Firefly Algorithm. Empirical results clearly demonstrate the ability of IWO outperforming its competitors. By this method, arrays have the ability to produce the desired radiation pattern and could satisfy requirements for many applications.

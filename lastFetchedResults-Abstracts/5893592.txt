The technique of conceptual modeling IDEF-SIM uses the syntax of IDEF&#216; and IDEF3 adapted to the peculiarities of the simulation models. It allows the state variables and the logical elements of a discrete system to be abstracted and ordered with most representativeness. However, it is essential to establish additional measures that enhance the process of collecting and authenticating relevant data. This context has motivated this research, which suggests a model documentary that, when associated with the methodology IDEF-SIM, allows recording the details of a dynamic system in an objective and standardized way. We carried a study on a seaport, allowing verifying that the system was translated with greater speed and detail. In this sense, we concluded that the record out in detail increased efficiency in the generation of knowledge about the particularities of the system, regardless of the complexity of the problem and the computer language adopted.

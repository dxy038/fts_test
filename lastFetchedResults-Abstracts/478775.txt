Background and Objective: Bone density during childhood has an important role in development of osteoporosis. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of weight bearing exercise and calcium supplements consumption on mineral density of children's vertebral columns bones.

Materials and Methods: For this reason, a total 40 pre-elementary girl students (5 to 7 years old) were voluntarily assigned with consult of their parents and assigned in four groups according to mineral density of their vertebral column bones and amount of calcium in the current diet. These children received the intervention program for 6 months. The calcium consumption questionnaire and density evaluation apparatus (DEXA) were used for data collection. Data analysis was performed using one way ANOVA and dependent t-test.

Results: The result of data analysis showed that mean differences between pre and post tests was significant in weight bearing exercise (t=5.45, p=0.007), and weight bearing exercise with calcium consumption (t=-6.29, p=0.000) groups; but it was not significant in calcium consumption and control groups. Overall, the comparison of BMD scores in groups showed that the differences between groups is significant (F=6.101, p=0.003).

Conclusion: These results emphasized the importance of childhood as a sensitive period in formation of dense bones and increased weight bearing ability.

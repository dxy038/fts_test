In HVAC plants of mediumâ€“high cooling capacity, multiple-chiller systems are often employed. In such systems, chillers are independent of each other to provide standby capacity, operational flexibility, and less disruption maintenance. However, the problem of efficiently managing multiple-chiller systems is complex in many respects. In particular, the electrical energy consumption in the chiller plant markedly increases if the chillers are managed improperly, therefore significant energy savings can be achieved by optimizing the chiller operations of HVAC systems. In this paper an unified method for Multi-Chiller Management optimization is presented, that deals simultaneously with the Optimal Chiller Loading and Optimal Chiller Sequencing problems. The main objective is that of reducing both power consumption and operative costs. The approach is based on a cooling load estimation algorithm, and the optimization step is performed by means of a multi-phase genetic algorithm, that provides an efficient and suitable approach to solve this kind of complex multi-objective optimization problem. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by resorting to a dynamic simulation environment developed in Matlab/SimulinkTM, where the plant dynamics are accurately described. It is shown that the proposed algorithm gives superior performance with respect to standard approaches, in terms of both energy performance and load profile tracking.

Education of junior college is employment-oriented and good occupational ability training is very important for studentsÂ´ future work and career development after graduation. Using group analytic hierarchy process (Group-AHP), a model for evaluating the comprehensive occupational abilities of engineering students in junior college has been built in this study and this model is composed of objective level, criteria level and index level. Criteria level includes 3 factors of basic capacity, major skill and key competency. Index level includes 14 indices: work ethics, judgment and discrimination, teamwork, humanity, language performance, computer operation, occupational position knowledge, technical proficiency, practical operating ability, application ability of new materials, processes and techniques as well as new facilities, interpersonal communication, psychological endurance, organizational managing ability, development and innovation, etc. The results have shown that, among the comprehensive occupational abilities of students, interpersonal communication, practical operation ability, teamwork, etc. have the largest weights, which is consistent with the teaching objective of junior college towards engineering students. Based on this model, grades of comprehensive occupational abilities of students could be calculated scientifically to provide the basis for improving the teaching quality, model and methods of college.

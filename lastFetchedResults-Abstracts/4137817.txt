Using an accurate and comprehensive computer model, 805-810 and 819-825 nm band pumping of erbium-doped aluminosilicate fiber amplifiers is compared. A comparison is made for both forward and bidirectional pumping over a wide range of pump powers. It is shown that 805-810 nm pumping is more efficient if bidirectional pumping is used, while 819-825 nm pumping is more efficient if only forward pumping is carried out.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

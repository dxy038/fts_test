Objective: To examine the tolerability of single versus multiple daily dosing (SDD vs. MDD) of antidepressant drugs in clinical practice. Method: Studies comparing single versus multiple daily dosing of antidepressants were reviewed. Since there were no numeric data available on the rates of adverse events for the SDD versus MDD arms, meta-analyses were carried out to compare rates of study completers (or rates of drop-outs) with single versus multiple daily dosing. Results: The review process identified 22 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. This meta-analysis found no difference in the rates of study completers with SDD or MDD regime of antidepressants. Conclusion: Our analysis on rates of completers (or rates of drop-outs) gives us an estimation of the overall acceptability of treatment and of course, but has limited utility when compared to the rates of adverse events. Yet, the present analyses suggest that adverse events which are significant enough to result in drop-outs, are not more frequent with SDD than MDD. MDD strategy of antidepressants does not seem to be more advantageous for the acceptability of treatment and obviously is disadvantageous for compliance. Thus, a simplified treatment regimen may be practical to increase treatment success rates in depression.

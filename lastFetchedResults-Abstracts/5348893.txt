This study´s objective is to solve visualization problem of hierarchical structure for the index. The problem is formulated as determining the midpoint of the memory function and constructing the circulation modules. The time complexity of visualization algorithm is analyzed with the way of incremental expression. Through using the MATLAB to draw hierarchical structure of the index of the sample stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index, which spans from the second half of 2005 to the second half of 2007, the results show that this algorithm can achieve accurate, aesthetic and practical requirements.This study´s conclusion indicates that visualization algorithm may be efficiently applied to drawing the hierarchical structure for the index tree and it is an interesting option for certain application fields.

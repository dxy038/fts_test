In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problems in electric power communication networks. Considering the fundamental issues of resource allocation, we propose a new resource allocation model. In the proposed model, we first involve the social distance parameter to evaluate the relationship between the difference users in the same service requirement set. Then we propose an optimization model to solve the bandwidth problem for each user in a link. The optimization model takes account of a utility function with the social distance function. As an objective function, the utility function can describe the link efficiency perfectly. We finally solve this optimization model by the genetic algorithm. Then we will assess the performance of our method. According to the simulation results, our model can obtain allocate a bandwidth for each user with a high utility.

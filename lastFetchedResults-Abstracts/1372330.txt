Thin nanostructured chalcogenide films were grown using the oblique angle deposition (OAD) technique and subsequently polymerized with thin poly(amino-p-xylylene) (PPX) films. Our objective was twofold, i.e., to use deposited polymeric thin films to allow the attachment of biomolecules to chalcogenide glass thin films, and at the same time, to increase surface area by OAD to enhance surface functionality. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), together with a combination of fluorescent protein immobilization and confocal microscopy characterization. It is shown that the presence of amine groups on the surface of the polymer coated chalcogenide thin films yield a notable increment of surface coverage with proteins at large evaporation oblique angles which is expected to enhance detection performance of the film in biosensor applications.

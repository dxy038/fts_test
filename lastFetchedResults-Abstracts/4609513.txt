To satisfy the demand for high-quality and uninterrupted electricity service increases, advanced automatic voltage control systems of distribution power grid are highly required. Based on the hybrid control method of power systems, a new automatic voltage control system named as D-HAVC is proposed in this work. To handle fast changing daily load, the D-HAVC system adopts the switching control method to design control subsystem. Moreover, for each control subsystem, the fuzzy method is used to unify the value of different operation indexes, which helps to setup a practical multi-objective reactive/voltage optimization problem. Finally, the event-driven control strategy is applied in each control subsystem, which generates the control action by solving the multi-objective optimization problem after discovering violations of the operation indexes. Tasking the Shenzhen power grid as the test system, the effeteness and efficiency of the proposed method are verified.

The principal objective of the present work is to find an adequate description of natural rough surfaces in order to study backscattering from these surfaces and try in a future work to retrieve soil characteristic parameters. Previous work has shown the inadequacy of the classical description which considered rough surfaces as stationary random Gaussian processes. They proposed a multi-scale surface description considering one-dimensional surfaces and incorporated it into the integral equation model (IEM). We extend this multi-scale description to the bi-dimensional case using the Mallat algorithm and we investigate its impact on radar backscattering.

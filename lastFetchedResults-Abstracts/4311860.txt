Internet access for highly mobile users in high-speed trains or cars, underground walkways and tunnels is often challenged by intermittent connectivity with short and unpredictable connectivity opportunities. In such opportunistic communication scenarios, utilizing these connectivity opportunities to the best potential for the mobile user can be crucial to achieve an acceptable overall perceived service quality. When wireless access networks are shared between mobile and non-mobile TCP users, this objective can be difficult to achieve especially considering the long-term throughput balance. In this paper, we analyze the performance issues with current TCP implementations and propose a new rate control mechanism called RACING (Rate Control for Intermittent Networking) for increasing long-term TCP throughput for Intermittent Connectivity Nodes (ICNs) in such challenged networks. In the proposed algorithm, the sending rate is adjusted based on the expected traffic during the outage to, in a sense, compensate the ICN for the disruption. The algorithm also considers the fairness with other flows by gradually changing its algorithm closer to the original TCP according to the compensated amount. Computer simulation results show that RACING reasonably improves the performance of the ICN.

Advances in autonomy have made it possible to invert the typical operator-to-unmanned vehicle ratio so that a single operator can now control multiple heterogeneous Unmanned Vehicles (UVs). Real-time scheduling and task assignment for multiple UVs in uncertain environments will require the computational ability of optimization algorithms combined with the judgment and adaptability of human supervisors through mixed-initiative systems. The goal of this paper is to analyze the interactions between operators and scheduling algorithms in two human- in-the-loop multiple UV control experiments. The impact of real-time operator modifications to the objective function of an optimization algorithm for multi-UV scheduling is described. Results from outdoor multiple UV flight tests using a human-computer collaborative scheduling system are presented, which provide valuable insight into the impact of environmental uncertainty and vehicle failures on system effectiveness.

Mixed wettability (MXW) results from adsorption from crude oil on rock surface which is not overlain by bulk water. Crude oil/brine/rock interactions and their effect on oil recovery are often investigated after replacing the crude oil with a mineral oil. If crude oil is displaced directly by mineral oil, extreme wettability alteration, referred to as MXW-DF (direct flood), is observed. Less change is observed if an intermediate solvent, such as decalin, is used to avoid destabilization of asphaltenes contained in the crude oil; wettability conditions attained by this treatment are referred to as MXW-F (film). The oil used in a displacement test is referred to as the probe oil, the most common choice being either crude oil or mineral oil. There is strong practical interest in developing MXW-F cores that have wetting properties that are comparable to wettability at reservoir conditions. The main objective of this work is to compare the effect of probe oil solvency, characterized by refractive index, on wetting behavior, characterized by spontaneous imbibition, with MXW wettability given by the parent crude oil. The tested probe oils included mineral oils, alkanes, decalin, toluene, alpha-methylnaphthalene (AMN), crude oils and modified crude oils with both increased and reduced solvency, and base oils and solutions of emulsifiers used in synthetic oil-based mud (SBM) formulations. Wettability established by direct displacement of crude oil with an alkane (MXW-DF) showed systematic increase in water wetness with increase in solvency of the probe oil. Other approaches to tuning MXW-F wettability states by choice of probe oil are also presented. Base oils used in the formulation of SBM had essentially no effect on the imbibition behavior of MXW-F, whereas exposure of MXW-F cores to two kinds of emulsifier resulted in persistently suppressed imbibition for a wide range of probe oils.

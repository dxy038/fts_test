This paper presents a no-reference objective video quality assessment method for compressed video. Only employed two parameters are involved: the change of the bit rate for the encoded video and the difference between its successive frames, and assessed the video quality by analyzing the average change of the difference between its successive frames with the bit rate variety of the encoded video. The parameters are easily obtained through extraction. This paper provides a theoretical analysis for the proposed method, which is well suited to video quality assessment when quality degradation is from lossy compression or induced by the channel.

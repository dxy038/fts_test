This paper introduces a novel image quality metric that outperforms other existing and widely used metrics, namely the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). While objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality to quantify the visibility of errors between a distorted image and a reference image have got utmost importance nowadays, none of the proposed metrics are completely satisfactory. Structural Similarity Index has been found promising in some cases, however for medical imaging (especially for CT and MRI images) it still remains immature. On that perspective, the Perceptual Dissimilarity (PD) measure proposed in this paper has been found satisfactory enough to work with medical imaging demands.

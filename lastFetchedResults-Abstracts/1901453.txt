This study examines the effect of anger and vital exhaustion on recurrent events after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Data came from 149 patients (123 men and 26 women) who underwent successful PTCA. During 18 months of follow-up, there were 37 recurrent events (25%) for which there was objective evidence of new or progression of coronary disease. The 123 male patients with high anger were significantly more likely to have multivessel disease before PTCA (odds ratio 2.42; p = 0.04), after controlling for standard heart disease risk factors. High-anger male patients also had a threefold increased risk for recurrent events after PTCA (RR 2.94; p = 0.01), which remained marginally significant after accounting for other heart disease risk factors and residual stenosis after PTCA (RR 2.33; p = 0.09). Among female patients, these relations were much weaker and not statistically significant. Among male patients, additional adjustment for vital exhaustion did not change the risk for recurrent events associated with high anger. A composite index of psychosocial risk based on anger and vital exhaustion was significantly related (p = 0.02) to events after PTCA after adjustment for standard heart disease risk factors. These findings add to the growing body of research on the role of psychosocial factors on clinical course in patients with coronary artery disease.

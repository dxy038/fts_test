Recent investigates on performance appraisal of video segmentation methods is principally focused on the progress of objective facts of advantage. The majority of the computer visualization and image analysis problems necessitate a segmentation stage in order to discover objects or divide the image into regions. This contribution describes using color based fuzzy c-means method in image segmentation. We have compared the performance of the proposed segmentation approach with two other segmentation methods foreground subtraction method and fuzzy c means segmentation on grey images. The proposed work produces better segmentation result than other two.

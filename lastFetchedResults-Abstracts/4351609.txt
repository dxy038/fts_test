The problem of scheduling and tree routing in WiMAX/802.16 based mesh networks were not defined in the standard and are thus subject to extensive research. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint routing and scheduling in 802.16-based wireless mesh network, with the objective of determining a minimum length schedule that satisfies a given (uplink/downlink) end-to-end traffic demand. Minimizing the schedule length amounts to maximizing the spectrum spatial reuse by concurrently transmitting on as many links as possible, which we refer to as a transmission configuration (a group of links that can simultaneously transmit without violating the signal-to-interference-plus- noise ratio (SINR) requirement). Our model is referred to as maximum spatial reuse (MSR). Since there is an overwhelming number of possible transmission configurations to be assigned to time slots, we adopt the column generation technique to construct our MSR model. We present two formulations for modeling MSR, namely the link-based column generation (CGLink) formulation and the path-based column generation (CGPath) formulation. These two formulations differ mainly in the number of routing decision variables. Our experimental results indicate that the path-based formulation needs much less computational (CPU) time than the link-based formulation in order to determine the (same) optimized solution with the same spatial reuse gain.

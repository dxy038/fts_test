Due to the better performance of three-dimensional (3-D) braided composite, the new type composites have been obtained rapid development. In this paper, considering wide application of hollow-rectangular-section 3-D braided composite in engineering, the stiffness analysis of the hollow-rectangular-section three-dimensional braided composite made by 2-step method were performed. Then, the mathematical models for optimization of the stiffness of the 3-D braided composite were proposed. The objective functions are the stiffness coefficient of the composite. The design variables are the braiding parameters of the composites and sectional geometrical size of the composite. The results of numeral examples show that the better stiffness characteristic could be obtained by using hybrid optimization algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), contenting the determinate restriction. The method proposed here is useful for the design and engineering application of the kind of member.

This study addresses the cooperative fault-tolerant tracking control problem for a class of multi-agent systems subject to mismatched parameter uncertainties, external disturbances and actuator faults including loss of effectiveness, outage and stuck. The communication network is undirected connected graph with a fixed topology. It is assumed that the actuator efficiency factors, the upper bounds of the unparametrisable time-varying stuck faults and disturbance, are unknown. Different from the traditional centralised fault-tolerant tracking control problem, only part of the follower nodes can obtain the information of leader directly. On the basis of the local state information of neighbouring agents, a novel cooperative fault-tolerant tracking control scheme by using adaptive mechanism is proposed. By introducing the estimates of controller parameters driven by neighbourhood tracking errors, it is shown that not only the actuator faults in the follower nodes can be compensated, but also the global tracking objective can be achieved. Furthermore, it is proved that all closed-loop signals are bounded and all follower nodes asymptotically tracking to the leader can be achieved in the presence of actuator faults, external disturbances and mismatched parameter uncertainties. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

The development of Autonomous Vehicle or Self-Driving car integrates with the wireless communication technology which would be a big step for road transportation today. The autonomous crossing of an intersection with the autonomous vehicle will play a major role in the future of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). The fundamental objective of this work is to manage autonomous vehicles crossing an intersection with no collisions; as well as maintaining that the car drives continuously, or to decrease the waiting time at the intersection. In this paper, a discrete model of an intersection is designed. The Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication is implemented to exchange information between a car and intersection manager. The safe trajectory of autonomous vehicles for the Autonomous Intersection Management is determined and presented using discrete mathematics.

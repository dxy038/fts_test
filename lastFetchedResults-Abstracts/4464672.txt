The paper describes the ACTS ATM Applications over Hybrid Optical Fiber Coax (ATHOC) project and the ATHOC physical layer for the hybrid fibre coax (HFC) access network. It also includes reference to ongoing standardisation (IEEE 802.14, DAVIC, and DVB). The main objectives of ATHOC are to build a prototype of an ATM-based HFC system, and to demonstrate on it PC-oriented data services (e.g. Internet). This ATHOC equipment will provide the transport in the coax access network between the PC terminal at the subscriberÂ´s home connected to the CATV coax, and the CATV headend connected to the broadband ATM core network. As far as possible, the existing cable infrastructure of the CATV operator will be used for these bidirectional services

The objective of the present study is to examine the detailed heat transfer coefficient distributions over a ribbed-surface under impingement of elliptic jet arrays using a liquid crystal thermograph technique. Both continuous and broken V-shaped-rib configurations with different exit flow orientations were considered. To examine the angled rib effects, three angled ribs were discussed under jet-to-plate spacing Z = 3 for different Reynolds numbers. Measured results show that the local heat transfer rates over the ribbed-surface are characterized by obvious periodic-type variation of Nusselt number distributions. The downstream peaks are diminished for increasing crossflow effect. Compared to the results without ribs, the heat transfer over the ribbed-surface may be enhanced or retarded. Whereas, among the test angled-rib arrangements, the best heat transfer performance is obtained with a surface with 45Â° V-shape ribs. In addition, the surface with continuous ribs provides a better impingement heat transfer than that with broken ribs.

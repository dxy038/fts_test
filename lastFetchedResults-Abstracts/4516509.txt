Two groups of 10 Parkinson´s disease (PD) patients and 10 age-matched normal subjects performing normal life activities were recorded using a portable recorder and 3D gyroscopes. PD patients had sub-thalamic stimulation implantation for 20&#177;3 months. The PD patients performed the test twice: with and without stimulation. Bradykinesia and tremor of hands in PD patients was quantified and strong correlation between this objective method and unified Parkinson´s disease rating scale (UPDRS) clinical score was found.

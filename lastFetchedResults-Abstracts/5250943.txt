In the present study the air/fuel mixing in the EV17 burner exit used in the GT13E2 turbine was investigated by means Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The objective of the study was to determine the air/fuel mixing in the original burner design (reference case), investigate the air/fuel mixing with modified premix hole pattern (different impulse ratio and number of holes and recommend a hole pattern for water tunnel tests. without a significant effect on the mixing quality.

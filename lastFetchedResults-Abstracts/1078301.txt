A method of covering a cellulose support with a semi-permeable membrane is discussed. This covering was carried out in a continuous manner with very good reproducibility. Due to the expected application and specific properties of the membrane obtained, a non-standard method of evaluation of the quality of the material appeared to be necessary. An objective method of studying the permeation time of the permeate through the membrane deposited on the support was determined. All the membranes obtained were studied utilizing this method. The weight composition of the membrane-forming mixture, the parameter which had an effect on the permeation time, was studied. The membraneforming polymer to pore-forming agent weight ratio and the pore-forming agent molecular weight were studied. The relationship between the times of depositing the membrane-forming mixtures and permeation times was also established. It was found that in the membranes obtained, no pore collapsing occurred.

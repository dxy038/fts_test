In this paper, a novel approach is presented for the segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The method integrates the gamma distribution, appropriate for SAR data, in an objective function that exploits the discontinuity adaptive MRF model proposed by Li (1995). After a straightforward initialization routine that computes for each class the mean intensity value, the objective function is minimized using deterministic relaxation. Results are shown on real-world data

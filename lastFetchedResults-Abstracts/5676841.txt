Virtual environments, of the type in this paper, employ hardware and software similar to that used for virtual reality displays. However, the viewer is presented with the outputs of computer simulations, involving the solution of systems of nonlinear partial differential equations in three dimensions, superimposed on a real-world physical model. In the present application, the objective is to aid physicians in the performance of a novel and challenging clinical procedure-the noninvasive treatment of aneurysms located deep within the brain. To this end, the physician is given the opportunity of &#8220;taking a walk&#8221; inside the aneurysm and to observe the transient pressure and stress fields in the blood flowing in the aneurysm, as the heart pulses and as therapeutic procedures are implemented. Prior to undergoing an endovascular procedure, the patientÂ´s head is scanned using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

The plasma polymerization of 4-phenylbenzonitrile was carried out with the objective of synthesizing a novel conjugated polynitrile thin film with a better optical property. The structure, compositions and morphology of the plasma-polymerized 4-phenylbenzonitrile (PPBPCN) thin films were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A fine, homogenous PPBPCN film with a large Ï€-conjugated system and a high retention of the aromatic ring structure of the starting monomer in the deposited plasma films is obtained when a low discharge power of 30 W was used during film formation. For the first time, a blue emission with relatively high photoluminescence intensity for PPBPCN thin films was observed.

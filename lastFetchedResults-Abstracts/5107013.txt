Net-centricity is a property of a system-of-systems which relates to information availability and is central to network-centric operations. Quantifying the level of net-centricity, however, has not been fully accomplished. This paper proposes a method for explicitly quantifying net-centricity in terms of openness, adaptability, and cost dimensions. The method draws from the fields of complexity and network theory as well as Petri Nets to develop a repeatable, objective measure.

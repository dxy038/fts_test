In this paper, we will address a WSN deployment problem. The main objectives are i) reduce the cost of deployment, ii) ensure the requested event detection probabilities, iii) guarantee the network connectivity, and iv) maximize the lifetime of the network. We will formalize the problem as multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. To resolve the problem, we will propose a new deployment algorithm named MODA. It will be based on evolutionary and neighborhood search algorithms. The obtained results are better than the deployment strategies found in the literature.

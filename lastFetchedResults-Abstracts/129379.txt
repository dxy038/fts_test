Background and purpose: Hospital wastes pose a serious public health problem, This is primarily caused by the way individual components of the waste is handled. One acceptable method for managing the medical waste is incineration but uncontrolled incinerators can cause emission of pollutants to atmosphere.
The objective of this study was to evaluate pollutants emission from hospital waste incinerators in Hamadan.
Materials and methods: In this investigation, samples were collected from Ernam, Syna, Fatemieh, Mobasher Kashani hospital incinerators to determine the level of lead, mercury, cadmium, benzene, toluene. Xylene, carbon monoxide, sulphour dioxide and particulate.
Collected samples were analysed using gas chromatograph, atomic absorbtion, spectrometer and smoke meter in the laboratory or by SO2 and CO meter as a direct method in the field.
Results: Results show that Mobasher hospital has maximum concentration of metals fume such as lead, mercury, cadmium (1113, 540, 3340 mg/m^3, respectively). Mean concentration of sulphour dioxide was 127 ppm and for suspended particulate concentration was 639  mg/m^3. In Syna hospital, the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene, xylene and carbon monoxide were maximum (77.46, 108.64, 33.6  mg/m^3 and 1041 ppm respectively).
Conclusion: It can be concluded that hospital atmospheric pollutants are higher than EPA standards, at least with P<0.05 which can be due to inopportune opening door of combustion chamber, input of excess air mass, low temperature, unmixed solid waste and unsuitable design of the incinerator, and leak or unsuitable pollution control device.

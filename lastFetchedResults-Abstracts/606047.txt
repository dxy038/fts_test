Objective: To assess hospital performance of Lorestan University of Medical Sciences during 2001-2007.
Methods: In this study, hospitals of Lorestan University of Medical Sciences during 1380-1386 were reviewed. Data envelopment analysis in the final model has been designed with assuming variable return to scale (VRS) and based on minimization of production factors. Also, this paper applies the SFA models of Cobb-Douglas and Translog production Function and the best results based on production function was selected.
Results: The results of Data envelopment analysis shows hospital technical efficiency 0.95 and promoting technical efficiency and capacity in the hospitals studied the rate is 5 percent. The results also showed that the constant return to scale is governed the production process. The other hand, the results indicate SFA confirmed the results of DEA. In addition, the results of this method shows the hospital services production is capital intensive activity. Because beds than other factors production of higher elasticity.
Conclusion: As personnel costs allocate major part of the hospital fixed costs. Seems so removed surplus human resources based on this study can implement a major role in reducing hospital and health care costs.

The objective of this research and paper is an introduction to multimedia signals compressions under ISDN. Compression and following expansion, in agreement with standard, will be simulate with the help of programme MATLAB. AuthorÂ´s contribution is codec G.723.1 by MATLAB simulation. The ITU-T block structure is observed. Codec realization in MATLAB is applied on test speech signal and results were indicated in this research and paper. Graphics results are one part of research, in the paper is not enough place for this description. Presentation paper contains results of simulation in MATLAB programme for audiocodec by the recommendation G.723.1. This recommendation is used for ISDN as example and although ISDN is now replaced by xDSL, software base used for source encoding is available also for the future

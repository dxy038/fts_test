Techniques to develop an objective picture of radar performance on a regular basis have a particular significance in maintaining current radar net at the peak of operational capability. The significance of these methods is becoming more important and indeed more complex in terms of tracking civilian and military radars in the fields of aviation safety, the accomplishment of air sovereignty tasks and also the support of maintaining performance measures to the optimum effect over an extended period of time. Although the evaluation of the test results shall be based on the scientifically proven criteriaÂ´s and their syntheses. It is the intention of this paper to add continued momentum to show the complexity of the practical realization of the System Performance Check (SPC) applied to Ground Based Radars highlighting different test results of the performance measurements collected from the radar &#8220;in situ&#8221;.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Changes in inflammatory mediators have an important role in myocardial infraction. Since the anti-inflammatory effects of Omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular diseases was reported, this study was done to evaluate the Omega-3 effect on serum lipid profile, leptin, adiponectin, and E-selectin in patients with myocardial infraction.
METHODS: In this double blinded clinical trial study, 42 patients with myocardial infraction were randomly divided into two mediator and control group. For 10 weeks, the mediator group received 3 capsules of 1 gram Omega-3 daily, and the control group received 3 capsules of placebo (paraffin) daily. Concentration of serum lipid profile, leptin, adiponectin, and E-selectin was measured and compared at the beginning and at the end of the test. IRCT=2021070410181N1
FINDINGS: At the end of the study, after comparing the Omega-3 receiving group with placebo group, there was a significant decrease of serum level of triglyceride (120.04±53.24 versus 150.76±48.84, p=0.021), leptin (6.92±2.71 versus 9.05±2.66, p=0.007), and E-selectin (20.98±10.04 versus 6.55±4.12, p=0/011), and there was a significant increase in the serum level of adiponectin (7.24±3.50 versus 6.55±4.12, p=0.026) in patients with myocardial infraction. In both groups, improvement in the size of blood lipids (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C) was obvious when compared to the primary sizes (p < 0.05); but the difference between the two complementary and placebo group was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The results show that receiving Omega-3 on a daily basis can modulate inflammatory factors in patients with myocardial infraction.

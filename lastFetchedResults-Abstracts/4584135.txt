Objective: To assess performance of dedicated volume breast ultrasound imaging (VBUS) system integrated with a compact robotic biopsy device to provide precision image-guided breast lesion biopsy. Methods: We integrated our VBUS system with a compact robotic device having a 6-DOF articulated arm to reach any breast location. A load sensor measured force and torque to provide real-time data regarding biopsy device insertion and penetration forces. Ultrasound volume image data provided 3-dimensional lesion coordinates. Targeting and guidance algorithms optimized the path for insertion of a Mammotome&#8482; vacuum biopsy device. System performance was evaluated by scanning breast test objects having simulated lesions and a cubic grid of sample locations. We measured targeting error and reproducibility. Results: VBUS volume data were acquired in 20 sec/slice and showed ~1 mm spatial resolution with lesions clearly identified. Targeting accuracy was within &#177;1 mm over the robotic workspace. Reproducibility was excellent. Force feedback data showed good sensitivity to needle forces. Discussion and Conclusions: Ultrasound volume data assisted robotic targeting and guidance algorithms for physician control. Robotic devices may provide more precise device placement assisting physicians with biopsy procedures. This work demonstrates the potential to translate the capabilities of two rapidly developing areas of medicine: volumetric imaging and robotic devices into a fully-functional clinical volume image-guided, physician-directed robotic breast biopsy system.

This article describes the development of an objective-based industrial electrical code (OBIEC) in Canada intended for use by qualified industrial companies. The concept is to provide a "road map" for owners, engineers, and system/equipment integrators for design, equipment selection, installation, operation, and maintenance of electrical systems. At the request of a group of industrial users, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) has begun development of an OBIEC for industrial installations. This code will exist in parallel to the existing prescriptive Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) and will apply only to industrial corporations qualified to use it that have demonstrated those qualifications to the satisfaction of the authority having jurisdiction.

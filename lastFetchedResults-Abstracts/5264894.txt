A new &#8220;Robust Multi-Objective Control&#8221; toolbox is presented. It is freely distributed (www.laas.fr/OLOCEP/romuloc) and works in Matlab environment along with the parser YALMIP. The current version tackles stability, pole location, H<inf>&#8734;</inf>, H<inf>2</inf> and impulse-to-peak analysis problems. The uncertain models are all in state-space and range from interval matrices to structured rational representations. For each considered problem, the user has the opportunity to choose between parameter dependent or independent Lyapunov functions. This gives more or less conservative conditions associated with different numerical burden. The paper exposes the underlying theoretical results and illustrates the use of the tool on some examples.

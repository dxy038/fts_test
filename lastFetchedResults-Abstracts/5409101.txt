This paper introduces two concepts of the traditional quality evaluation: the subjective evolution and objective evaluation, and then several kinds of common used human visual perception image quality judgment criterion are introduced, such as: assessing the quality of enhanced images based on human visual perception, image quality assessing model by using neural network and support vector machine, gradient information based image quality assessment, natural image quality assessment metric based on wavelet-based contour-let transform, image quality assessment method based on contrast sensitivity. Some possible development directions are given for the image quality assessment research.

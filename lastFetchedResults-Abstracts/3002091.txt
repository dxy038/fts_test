With the emergence of different wireless technologies, a mobile terminal equipped with multiple interfaces can achieve a much higher bandwidth by aggregating the bandwidth offered by the individual networks. In this paper, we present a system based on Mobile IP that achieves the above objective. We discuss in detail the architectural requirements and algorithms that are needed to support the system.

A network model of trophic interactions in a tropical reservoir in India was developed with the objective to quantify matter and energy flows between system components and to study the impact of invasive fishes on the ecosystem. Structure of flows and their distribution within and between trophic levels were analysed by aggregating single flows into combined flows for discrete trophic levels. The trophic flows primarily occurred in the first four trophic level (TL) and the food web structure in this reservoir ecosystem was characterized by the dominance of low TL organisms, with the highest TL of only 3.57 for the top predator. Highest system omnivory index (SOI) was observed for indigenous catfishes (0.422), followed by the exotic fish Mozambique Tilapia (0.402). Nile Tilapia and Pearl spots show the highest niche overlap which suggests high competition for similar resources. The mixed trophic impact routine reveals that an increase in the abundance of the African catfish would negatively impact almost all fish groups such as Indian major carps, Pearl spots, indigenous catfishes and Tilapines. The other invasive fish Mozambique Tilapia adversely affects the indigenous catfishes. The most interesting observation in this study is that the most dominant invasive fish in this reservoir, the Nile Tilapia does not negatively impact any of the fish groups. In fact it positively impacts the Indian major carps. The direct and indirect effects of predation between system components (i.e. fish, invertebrates, phytoplankton and detritus) are quantitatively described and the possible influence and role in the ecosystem's functioning of the invasive fish species are discussed.

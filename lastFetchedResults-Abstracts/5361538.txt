In this paper, a fast and effective content-adaptive post-processing method is proposed for reducing the blocking artifacts of the block-coded images. The first step of this scheme is the block classification that classifies every 8times8 block as one of the three types: plain, edge and texture, based on its statistical characteristics. Our experimental results show that this classification algorithm is effective and accurate. After applying the different filters to the three types of blocks, the perceptual and objective quality of the images are improved without over smoothing the image details or insufficiently reducing the strong blocking effect on the plain region

The objective of this study is to investigate the damage mechanisms in self-reinforced polyethylene composite laminates (UHMWPE/HDPE) under monotonic tensile loading by the acoustic emission (AE) technique. Fracture surface examinations were conducted using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Using model specimens exhibiting a dominant failure mechanism, correlations were established between the observed damage growth mechanisms and the AE results in terms of the events amplitude. These correlations can be used to monitor the damage growth process in the UHMWPE/HDPE composite laminates exhibiting multiple modes of damage. Results from this study revealed that the AE technique is a viable and effective tool for identifying damage mechanisms such as fiberâ€“matrix debonding, matrix cracking, fiber pull-out, fiber breakage and delamination in the UHMWPE/HDPE composite materials.

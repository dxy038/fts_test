With the introduction of restructuring concepts to traditional power systems, a great deal of attention is given to the utilization of distributed generation. Since the integration of DG units has been known as an alternative for main grid as a resource for energy supply, the determination of optimal sizing and sitting is an important issue in the planning procedure of DG. This work presents a comprehensive multi-objective model for integration of distributed generations into a distribution network, regarding various technical, economical and environmental issues such as reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and investment &amp; running costs while the bus voltages shall be kept within acceptable limits. A genetic algorithm and a fuzzy decision making method has been proposed to solve this problem. The method is applied on IEEE-34 feeder test system and the results are presented and discussed.

Background: Possible roles of anti-inflammatory factors as well as total antioxidative capacity in reproductive processes of women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) are still being investigated and the contributions by some of them remain controversial.
Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between anti-inflammatory parameters and total antioxidative capacity (TAC) of the body during IVF. In this respect, adiponectin, interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), fetuin A and TAC analyses have been performed.
Materials and Methods: In this prospective, non-randomized, controlled clinical study, sera obtained from 26 fertile (Group-1), and 26 infertile women before (Group-2) and after (Group-3) IVF treatment were analyzed. IL-1RA, IL-10, fetuin A, adiponectin and insulin were determined by ELISA. TAC was determined spectrophotometrically. Mann-Whitney U test, paired sample t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test as well as Pearson correlation analysis by SPSS were performed for statistical analysis.
Results: Clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were determined as 30.8% and 23.1%, respectively, in pregnant group. For the pregnant, significant indirect correlations were detected between fetuin A and adiponectin (r=-0.843; p=0.035) as well as IL-10 (r=-0.846; p=0.034) in Group 2. The correlation between adiponectin and IL-10 doubled in pregnant compared to non-pregnant (r=0.929; p=0.007 vs. r=0.478; p=0.033). The correlations between fetuin A and TAC in pregnant were noted both in Group 2 (r=0.892; p=0.017) and Group 3 (r=0.875; p=0.022). No correlation of fetuin A with these parameters was detected in non-pregnant group.
Conclusion: Fetuin A, TAC, IL-10, adiponectin and their associations may be important from their predictive values for IVF success point of view. Parameters with anti-inflammatory or antioxidant property appear to improve pregnancy in women undergoing IVF.

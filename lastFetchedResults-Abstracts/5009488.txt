Active distribution networks have the capability to allow the distributed energy resources integration at reasonable costs, opening new business opportunities. Although the sharing of responsibility among the system stakeholders (e.g., the Civil Society, the DSO and DER owners) is essential, undeniably they pursue different, and sometimes opposite goals. The authors, by adopting multi objective programming to simulate the behavior of the stakeholders, aim at assessing how the system players will drive the distribution evolution under the influence of different regulatory environments. All the scenarios have been analyzed on a case study representative of a typical distribution system. The results presented can help Regulators to define a fairer asset and performance based distribution revenue.

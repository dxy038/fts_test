Here a special state variable feedback or state feedback for short is introduced with the main objective of providing a convenient method for decoupling a MIMO transfer matrix. Decoupling in general and decoupling via state feedback in particular offer obvious advantages in the design and synthesis of controllers for MIMO systems. The early parts of this paper deal with the eigenvalues, poles, and zeros as well as the controllability and observability properties of the proposed closed-loop system as compared with those of the open-loop system. The proposed method is tested on a model of a realistic physical system and results are illustrated.

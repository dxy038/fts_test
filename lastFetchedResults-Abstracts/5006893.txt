This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model to determine the optimal solutions for the problem of sizing and locating distributed generation facilities. Cost minimization is achieved through the minimization of system losses; complex power acquired from DG units and the number of connected DG units. A Simulated annealing technique is implemented to optimize the proposed multi-objective model. A typical case study is presented and the results obtained are discussed.

The aim of this work is to identify groups of patients with similar patterns that are related to a higher risk of readmission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Patients readmissions to ICUs are introduced as a problem associated with increased mortality, morbidity and costs, which complicates the performance of a good clinical management and medical diagnosis. To approach the readmissions classification problem, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm was implemented to find the different groups of patients. A multimodel approach was developed using these groups and the best clustering division was assessed through different objective functions. Two decision criteria were used for the multimodel approach, an a priori decision and an a posteriori decision. The data used, from MIMIC II database, consisted on the arithmetic means of time series of variables - acquired during the last 24 hours before discharge. The multimodel using the a priori and the aposteriori decisions were able to predict readmissions with an average AUC of 0.74 and 0.75, respectively. Consequently, the multimodel results overcame the results of previous predictive models developed for the classification of readmissions outcome.

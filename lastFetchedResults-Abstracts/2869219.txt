The main contribution of this paper is to present an optimal solution for under voltage load shedding (UVLS) problem using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (HGAPSO). The effectiveness of the proposed scheme for optimal procedure is investigated. The above-mentioned problem is converted to an optimization problem with the multi-objective function including the minimum active power losses, the maximum voltage stability, the minimum customer interruption cost and the desired alleviating transmission line under over loading conditions, in which the customer interruption cost is modeled as a quadratic function in five major load classifications on each bus. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed on IEEE 57 bus test system under different operating conditions. The comparative analysis is made between other evolutionary methods like PSO through some performance indices to demonstrate its flexibility and strong performance.

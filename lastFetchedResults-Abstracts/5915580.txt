The main objective of this work was to develop a new type of actuator. It consists of a piezoelectric ceramic disk or multilayer stack and two metal end plates with a crescent-shaped cavity on the inner surface. The plates are used as mechanical transformers for converting and amplifying the lateral displacement of the ceramic into a large axial motion in the plates. Both d<sub>31</sub> and d<sub>33</sub> contribute to the axial displacement. Sizable strains were obtained with both PZT-metal and PMN-metal actuators. Displacement amplification principle, fabrication, and measurement results are presented

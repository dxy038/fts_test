The blockade of sPLA-2, as well as the removal of calcium during the infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, prevents necrosis in mononuclear phagocytes. In addition, previous evidence indicates that the necrosis is modulated by cytokines and may condition the inflammatory environment. The production of cytokines and chemokines in response to infection with M. tuberculosis, fatty acid profile and the lactate dehydrogenase activity in mononuclear phagocytes from tuberculosis patients and healthy controls were interrelated using a principal component analysis in order to establish whether there was an association between the induction and effector stages of necrosis with the production of cytokines and chemokines.

entiation increased the ratio of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids. The oleate and palmitate correlated with differentiation, laureate, arachidonate and linolenate with infection and necrosis correlates with the production of IL-10. Monocytes from tuberculosis patients seem to be lees differentiated ex vivo.

A bidirectional ZVS DC-DC converter with active clamp topology is proposed. The proposed converter is based on the forward converter with center-tapped rectifier at the transformer secondary side. Active clamp topology is used in the forward converter to achieve ZVS feature of power switches and to regulate the output voltage at the desired value. The proposed converter has the advantages of high efficiency and simple circuit configuration. The operating principle, system analysis and design example are described and discussed in detail. Finally, the experimental results of the proposed converter are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.

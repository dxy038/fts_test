Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in cervical and amniotic fluid in women in preterm labor and with preterm premature rupture of membranes.
Study design
Women with singleton pregnancies (≤34 weeks) in preterm labor (n = 75 women), with preterm premature rupture of membranes (n = 47 women), and at term (n = 45 women) who were undergoing elective cesarean delivery were included. Cervical and amniotic fluid were sampled.
Results
Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in cervical and amniotic fluid was higher in women in preterm labor than in women at term. Cervical monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in women in preterm labor was associated with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity, intra-amniotic inflammation, delivery within 7 days, and at ≤34 weeks. Amniotic monocyte chemotactic protein-1 correlated to microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes, intra-amniotic inflammation in preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, delivery within 7 days, and delivery at ≤34 weeks in women in preterm labor.
Conclusion
Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in cervical and amniotic fluid levels are elevated in preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes and correlate to intra-amniotic infection/inflammation.

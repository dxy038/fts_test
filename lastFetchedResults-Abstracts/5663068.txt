This paper introduces the design and realization of a wearable device for dietary and physical activity monitoring. This design is based on technological advances in microelectronics and our previous prototypes which have verified the system concept. From our results, it is shown that the device meets all functional requirements as well as size and power consumption constraints essential to participantsÂ´ use. With further technological development, we believe that the size of the system can be reduced and accurate and objective dietary assessments will become possible.

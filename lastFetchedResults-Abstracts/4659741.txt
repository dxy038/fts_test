The primary objective of data mining and expert system provides good result for using knowledge base system. From the deep study, Apriori algorithm is a representation of an improved association rule mining algorithm, which helps to avoid the replication of same items. This proposed paper is an improved version of apriori algorithm that is focused on four features namely, First data preparation and select the required data, second generate itemsets that determines the rule constraints for knowledge, third mine k-frequent itemsets using the new database and fourth generate the proposed association rule that establishes the knowledge base and provide better results compared to existing method. Finally, the knowledge database of the expert system is established and stores all the rules in the database. This system helps us to obtain a homologous decision rules as an output of given input.

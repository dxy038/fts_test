In this paper, we propose an approach based on automatic derivation schemes from STATEMATE models to FNLOG specifications. STATEMATE is a semi formal method that pertains to the specification and design of complex reactive systems and builds simulations and prototypes rapidly. Though STATEMATE provides rigorous specifications, these are not verifiable to ensure and guarantee the reliability of the system being developed. To fulfill this objective, a STATEMATE specification is translated into a logic-based specification language called FNLOG which allows its verification. This paper describes the translation approach, cross references between STATEMATE and FNLOG features, and the translation algorithm.

The management of multiple systems such as machine tools, vehicles, aircraft, among others, results in a very intense flow of data between the server and embedded systems, using wired and/or radio frequency structures, demanding performance and interest in real time systems. The objective of this study is to propose a low cost scalable architecture for embedded applications, using pools of personal computers for high performance storage, retrieval and processing of information through the study of traces and real solutions for companies operating in this niche market.

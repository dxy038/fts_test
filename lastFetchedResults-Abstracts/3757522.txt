When the performance criteria for a pulsed power generator is power density, and the duty cycle remains short ( <img alt="\\ll , 20" src="/images/tex/16346.gif"/> s), then copper coils with an exciter are favored over permanent magnet rotors. If the permanent magnets are replaced with copper coils, steel, and an exciter, with the same total weight, the copper coil alternative will return a higher magnetomotive force/weight, and thus a higher power density system. A variable metric optimization is completed for a generator, assuming the objective is to charge a capacitor bank. The equations governing allowed current density in capacitor charging applications and alternating current/direct current (ac/dc) resistance ratios are derived.

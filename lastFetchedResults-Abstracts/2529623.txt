Objective: Current study aimed to determine the effectiveness of neurofeedback training on decreasing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans.
Methods: The present study is an experimental research with pretest, posttest, and control group design. Patients with PTSD were randomly selected by purposive sling method and assigned in experimental (15 persons) and control groups (15 persons). Data were collected by the posttraumatic stress disorder checklist (PCL). After the pretest, experimental group
received neurofeedback training for 20 sessions, 3 days per week. Groups were evaluated for intensity of symptoms by PCL questionnaire at the beginning and end of the study. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) by SPSS version 22.
Results: The results of covariance test showed that there are differences between adjusted mean of PTSD symptoms in groups in posttest by removing the impact of pretest scores.
Conclusion: Our findings showed that neurofeedback training has significantly decreased the score of total symptoms (F=22.506, P<0.001).

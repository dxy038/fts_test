Karetsos, C. Costopoulos, O. Pyrovolakis, L. Georgiou<br/>in the Proceedings of the 6th WSEAS International Conference on Software Engineering, Parallel and Distributed Systems, February 2007, pp. 161-168<br/><br/>The objective of this work is to develop business-to-business processes of electronic markets using Web services in order to facilitate the execution of these processes in different electronic markets. The main contribution of this approach is the promotion of interoperability, just-in-time integration, and reduction of complexity. In specific, the cooperation, orchestration and semantic mapping of Web services (termed as COSMOS) tool, which is an integrated development environment that enables the creation, design and modification of executable business processes based on the business process execution language, is used for the integration of business-to-business processes of a virtual agricultural market into a fully functional Web-based environment.

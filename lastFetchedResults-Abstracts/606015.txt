Direct costs, indirect costs and capital costs contributed to 89.21%, 5.16 % and 5.37 of the total cost respectively fixed and variable costs related to hemodialysis was 10.53% and 89.21% of total cost. Nonoptimal financial variance per session for EM and chronic patients was 12966 RLs and 15916 RLs respectively.
Conclusion: Th findings are important to financial and human resources allocation for hemodialysis services provision in hospitals. Use of economic analyses for hemodialysis services provision and for designing and development of programs is recommended.

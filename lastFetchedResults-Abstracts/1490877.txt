For multilayered plated and shell structures the formulation of the optimization problem is strongly dependant on the definition of the design variables. Therefore, the first part of the work is devoted to the definition of design variables and the forms of objective functions. Then, two numerical examples have been solved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulations and the optimization algorithm (the modified evolutionary strategy). They deal with thickness and shape optimization problems subjected to dynamic and static constraints, respectively.

Reclaimed water reusing is an effective measure to solve the water shortage problem in China. While reasonable exploitation and optimizing allocation of water resources is the effective way to realize sustainable development .Based on the characteristics that the objectives in water resources allocation system are conflicting and vague, fuzzy optimization allocation model for reclaimed and natural water resources are developed. All departments in the system are treated as independent individuals with "satisfaction degree" as their objective. Under the condition that water allocation satisfied the demand of water quality and quantity to some extent, three kinds of water resources fuzzy optimization allocation scheme of minimal satisfaction degree optimization model(MSM), integral satisfaction degree optimization model(ISM), water environment sustainable development optimization model(WSM) were obtained which can satisfy different requirement aim and provide reference for competition and cooperation among water consumer in water allocation decision-making system. A case study of Tianjin demonstrates the practical application of the models.

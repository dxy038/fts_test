Differentiated services (DiffServ) networking technologies are under development with the objective to support diverse classes of traffic that require different quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Recent studies have shown that real network traffic exhibits self-similarity or long-range dependence (LRD) in high-speed communication networks, which has a deteriorating impact on the network performance. To assist the development of admission control mechanisms, which can accommodate heterogeneous traffic including short-range independence and long-range dependence, this paper proposes a measurement-based approach to estimate the buffer overflow probability for each priority queue in a multiplexer deploying the head-of-the-line (HOL) priority discipline. The accuracy and effectiveness of this model has been verified by simulations. The results of this paper will provide a practical insight into the buffer dimensioning and admission control design of a HOL multiplexer.

This paper presents a MATLAB/Simulink simulation model for a direct space vector modulated matrix converter (MC). The power circuit model, consisting of an input filter, a matrix of bidirectional switches and an RL load, is completely implemented using the power library in Simulink, contributing to the simplicity and clearness of the whole model. Two switching strategies are modeled, simulated and analyzed together with the direct space vector modulation (DSVM): symmetrical SVM and asymmetrical SVM. Two sets of rules are proposed for these techniques in order to simplify the model implementation. Principal input and output converter variables are presented in simulations so that MCspsila characteristics and advantages can be observed. Moreover, this model is also very flexible about changing the modulation technique, the load, or removing the input filter, making it suitable for an introduction of this kind of converters in an educational environment.

Telecom providers in India are facing a tough challenge to ensure a reliable service due to non-availability of continuous grid supply. This is particularly so in rural areas. Currently, diesel generators are used to ensure continuous power supply. This increases greenhouse gas emission, fuel cost and requires regular maintenance. Instead, renewable energy sources can be effectively used to mitigate these issues and to provide a long term sustainable solution. An attempt is made to design a telecom power supply using hybrid wind/solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems. Utility grid/diesel generator are used only for backup purpose. The proposed system consists of PWM boost rectifier cascaded with a bidirectional dc-dc converter for interaction with the grid. A single dual input converter which is a combination of Cuk and buck converters, is used to process power from renewable sources. This configuration allows two sources to supply the load separately or simultaneously depending on their availability. Principle of operation of the system is discussed. In order to predict the performance of the system, detailed simulation studies are carried out and results are presented.

Hinterland transport plays a dominant role in todayÂ´s logistics chain. However, the present way of its transport planning is far from optimal. Information inaccessibility and old-fashioned communication are key issues that prevent planning reaching optimal. In addition, none contractual relationship between different stakeholders (e.g. terminal operators and barge operators) makes central planning even more difficult. This paper describes the development of an agent-based information integrated platform for hinterland waterway barge transport planning. The objective is to facilitate data exchange and establish an optimal plan for involved parties. The system can be described as a decision support and communication system in which soft agents handle communication tasks and exchange desired information among different stakeholders. The agents interact via a web interface with a so called hinterland transportation planning system where agent behaviour is coordinated, the level of information exchange is controlled and plan is created and stored. A prototype of the agent-based intelligent system has been developed which demonstrated the successful agent functioning and coordination between different agents in a web-based environment.

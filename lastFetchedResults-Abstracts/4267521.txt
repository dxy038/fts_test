The development of an integrated coastal observing system for the German Bight and Arctic Coastal Seas (COSYNA) is one of the focal issues of German marine research in the next decade. A major challenge of COSYNA is to tightly merge data from a dense observational network and modeling via data assimilation. The integrated system will focus on daily-to-weekly processes providing objective measures of uncertainty in the state estimates and forecasts. The creation of a centrally managed, operational, large-scale monitoring and modeling system is expected to strengthen und bundle expertise within Helmholtz Association centres, members of the German marine research consortium and the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency. The layout of COSYNA is based on the knowledge and open scientific questions of the German North Sea research carried out in the last two decades. COSYNA will intensively use platforms-of-opportunities like North Sea ferries, freights ship and offshore research platforms and wind mills. This participation to externally financed infrastructure of power and broadband communication and maintenance logistics will enable a cost effective construction of the system and maintain its operational mode over a long-term period. Adding to the running governmental monitoring, COSYNA seeks to pinpoint the German role in the international development of marine monitoring and long-term observational strategies in cooperation and agreement with the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency.

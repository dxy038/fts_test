This paper presents a measurement system which has as objective to define a reference frame on the capacities company to face internally the process of technological innovation of products and of processes. The system mentioned before considers the variables suggested by experts as determinants of the process of such technological innovation of products and processes to which the most appropriate indicators are selected. On this sense, using the set of indicators selected in the treatment of each one of the variables of exposed analyses sets out a general indicator of the capacity of technological product and processes innovations. The system contains all the instruments, procedures and methodology to measurement and to analysis the capacity for innovation, and it may be possible to compare the behavior of different companies in an industrial sector. Thus it contributes to acknowledge the process of technological innovation in any enterprise sector, from which is possible to be suggested actions to impel this so necessary process in the competitive world of today.

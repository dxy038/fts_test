Mobile ad-hoc networks study is based on simulations as well as the fundamental and necessary simplified assumptions of physical reality. Testing the simulations for various protocols in a practical environment shows how theories can be authenticated in practice. This also helps to identify the problems that the ad-hoc network users and developers face. Testing ad-hoc network implementations, however, also presents a number of challenges. Our approach is to build a mathematical model that can be used to simulate and test the path selection, optimal path selection from plentiful paths available from a source to the destination in Bluetooth Scatternets. We are interested in optimal path selection and its analysis in Bluetooth Scatternet routing with respect to some key parameters. The key parameter include number of intermediate hops, battery power of individual Bluetooth enabled nodes and link stability of all routes in the Bluetooth Scatternet from source to destination. The ultimate objective of this work is to determine the net result of the optimal path selection when the all these parameters are combined together as logical unit. We want to determine whether and how paths are selected and what changes take place with the mobility of the nodes. Finally the results shows that our approach of selecting the optimal path proves better in terms of data delivery from a given sender to the receiver.

Method: Selective deosages of Vitex agnus - castus were orally administrated to female rats during proestrus stage of estrus cycle and lactation.In the control group of rats distilled water was adminstrated instead of Vitex agnus - castus extract. At each stage (procestrus, and 3rd day of lactation) the animal was anaesthetized by inhalation of ether and fresh blood sample was taken from its heart. The serum was separated by centrifugation. Serum prolactin hormone was measured by RIA (Radio Immuno Assay) method. The data were analysed by ANOVA, MANOVA and LSD test at p < 0.05.

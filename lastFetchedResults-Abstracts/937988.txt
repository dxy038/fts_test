airborne instruments and extensive in situ data collection. As empirical algorithms are employed for chl-a retrieval
from remote sensing data, temporally varying factors such as surface reflection and atmospheric effects degrade the
estimation accuracy. This paper analyzes the quantitative accuracy of empirical chl-a retrieval algorithms available as
methods to correct temporal disturbances are either included or excluded. The aim is to evaluate the usability of
empirical chl-a retrieval algorithms in cases when no concurrent reference in situ data are available. Four methods to
reduce the effects of temporal variations are investigated. The methods are: Ž1. atmospheric correction; Ž2.
synchronous radiometer data; Ž3. wind speed data; and Ž4. bidirectional scattering model based on wind speed and
sun angle data. The effects of different correction methods are analyzed by using single-date test data and multi-date
training data sets. The results show that the use of a bidirectional scattering model and atmospheric correction
reduces the bias component of the measurement error. Radiometer data also appear to improve the accuracy.
However, if concurrent in situ reference data are not available, the retrieval algorithms and correction methods
should be improved for reducing the bias error.

Background and Objective: Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory, chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology. Due to the positive effects of exercise in patients with MS, we aimed to compare the effects of three combined exercise methods on serum levels of ghrelin, TNF-? and IL-10 in these patients.
Materials and Methods: Forty- eight MS patients with EDSS 2 to 3 voluntarily participated in this study and were randomly divided into four groups; experimental-1 (one session of resistance training and three sessions of aerobic training per week), experimental-2 (two sessions of resistance training and two sessions of aerobic training per week), experimental-3 (three sessions of resistance training and one session of aerobic training per week) and a control group. The subjects performed four sessions of training protocol per week for eight weeks. Blood samples were collected 5 days before and 72 hours after the training program. 
Results: The results of the data analysis using ANOVA and post hoc Scheffe test indicated that IL-10 levels significantly increased in the experimental group-3 than in groups one and two, but these changes were not statistically significant in the three experimental groups compared to the control group. The serum levels of TNF-? and Ghrelin were not significantly different among the groups.
Conclusion: It seems that concurrent combined training with an emphasis on resistance training leads to increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, decision on the best type of training programs in concurrent or combined training for MS patients calls for further research. As  related to the improvement of serum Ghrelin levels in patients with MS, further studies with longer periods of exercises along with a proper diet is required.

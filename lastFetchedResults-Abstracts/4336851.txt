A new method is proposed for estimating the thrust of linear induction motors (LIMs) which has a suitable performance in a wide range of thrust variations. This eliminates the thrust control problems encountered in low frequency and thrust levels. A new formula is proved showing the high flexibility of multi-level inverters. A fuzzy space-vector controller is adapted for decoupling control of thrust and flux of a LIM. The main objective in the new thrust estimation method and the fuzzy controller is realizing an online and efficient controller for a LIM. A simulation program is provided for investigation of the LIM transient behavior which shows a suitable performance of the proposed method

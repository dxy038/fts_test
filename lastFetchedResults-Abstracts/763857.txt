Introduction: Coronary artery disease is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases. Promotion of general self-efficacy after a cardiovascular event is the outcome that plays a pivotal role in increasing rehabilitation skills to modify healthy behaviors. Having desirable illness perception may have promoted this capability.
Objective: This study aims to determine the relationship between   perception of illness and general self-efficacy in coronary artery disease patients. 
Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 195 patients with coronary artery disease, chosen by simple sampling method, were asked to complete questionnaires of perception of illness and general self efficacy. Chi-square test was used to assess the relationship  between  dependent  and  independent  variables  and associated factors in  coronary  artery  disease  patients’  general self-efficacy.
Results: Findings of this study revealed that 74.9% of samples had desirable general self-efficacy. In most cases (73.8%) the level of perception of illness was satisfactory. Survey of variables indicated a significant relationship between perception of illness and age, level of education, occupation status, and previous training regarding self-care. General self-efficacy was significantly related to age, gender, marital status, education level , diagnosis of cardiac disease, living conditions, occupation status, previous training regarding self-care (p < 0.05). In addition chi-square test indicated that there was a significant correlation between perception of illness and general self-efficacy in coronary artery disease patients. 
Conclusion: Designing clinical educational programs and nursing interventions is effective in improving illness perception and also promotion of patients’ general self-efficacy for better self-care.

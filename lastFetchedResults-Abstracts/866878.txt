The objective of this research was to evaluate voice enhanced interface (VEI) and traditional keyboard and mouse interface (TI) in terms of users' performance, degree of satisfaction and mental workload. A trainable voice recognition software for student grade calculation was developed for the study, tested for Mandarin and English voice input, and compared to traditional input. The results show significant differences in task completion time, number of errors, satisfaction and mental workload for VEI and TI. The subjects were more satisfied with keyboard and mouse input. However, the attitude toward voice enhanced interface may change with time if improved recognition is achieved. A discussion about the comparison between the Mandarin and Cantonese voice input is also included in this paper.

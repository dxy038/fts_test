We have previously developed an adaptation of the simulated annealing for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems to construct an approximation of the efficient set of such problem. In order to deal with large-scale problems, we transform this approach to propose an interactive procedure. The method is tested on the multi-objective knapsack problem and the multi-objective assignment problem.

This paper studies a leader-following rendezvous problem for a double integrator multi-agent system where the leader system can generate a class of signals such as ramp signal and sinusoidal signals with arbitrary amplitudes and initial phases. Motivated by some techniques in output regulation theory, we propose a dynamic distributed state feedback control protocol that is able to maintain the connectivity of an initially connected communication network, and, at the same time, achieve the objective of the asymptotic tracking of all followers to the leader regardless of external disturbances.

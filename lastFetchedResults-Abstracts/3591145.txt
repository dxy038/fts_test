We identify the roles played by design versions and alternatives in an engineering database. The obvious way to implement versions is to maintain each in a separate collection of files. Because several versions must be kept on line in a design environment, the approach leads to large disk requirements. We develop B-tree-based storage structures to encode versions as ``negative´´ differential files. Our objective is to keep the disk requirements small. We discuss the effect of enormous amounts of cheap archival storage (write-once optical digital disks) on the proposed structures. We have implemented versions in the Wisconsin storage system (WiSS), an experimental database component developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Motivated primarily by the problem of efficient assignment of virtual machines to physical host machines in a network cloud, we consider an infinite-server system with several types of arriving customers. Multiple customers can be placed into one server for service, subject to general &#8220;packing&#8221; constraints. Service times of different customers are independent, even if served simultaneously by the same server. Customers are placed for service immediately upon arrival, and leave the system after service completion. A key system objective is to minimize the total number of occupied servers. We propose Greedy-Random (GRAND), an extremely simple customer placement algorithm, which is also easy to implement. We show that a version of GRAND is essentially asymptotically optimal, as the customer arrival rates grow to infinity. We also study several versions of the GRAND algorithms by simulations.

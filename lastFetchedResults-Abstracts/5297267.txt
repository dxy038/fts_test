Data aggregation has been widely applied as efficient techniques in order to reduce the data redundancy and the communication load in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, for dynamic scenarios, structured protocols may incur high overhead in the construction and the maintenance of the static structure. Without the explicit downstream and upstream relationship of nodes, it is also difficult to obtain high aggregation efficiency by using structure-free protocols. In order to address these aspects, we propose a semi-structured protocol based on the multi-objective tree. The routing scheme can explore the optimal structure by using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Moreover, by using the prediction model for the arriving packets based on the sliding window, the adaptive timing policy can reduce the transmission delay and enhance the aggregation probability. Therefore, the packet transmission converges from both spatial and temporal points of view for the data aggregation procedure. Finally, simulation results validate the feasibility and the high efficiency of the novel protocol when compared with other existing approaches.

Inter-Organizational business process coordination attempts to support the collaboration between different business processes, distributed over different enterprises. In order to coordinate the business processes of different organizations, we need to efficiently integrate different organization´s workflows to provide customized services. Cross-enterprise workflow which can streamline and coordinate business processes across organizations in dynamic Web environment provides a flexible solution. In order to address the problem of dynamic web service composition we have adopted an approach based on Service oriented Inter-organizational Workflow (SIW) along with an Agent Based Architecture. Our objective is to dynamically integrate the workflows and compose a workflow execution community customized to different workflow specifications. In our work, each of the agent capability is used to serve a particular service request and business processes are wrapped by service agents. Based on the user´s need, the process agent contacts the service selection agents to find appropriate service agents, and then negotiates with the service agents about task execution.

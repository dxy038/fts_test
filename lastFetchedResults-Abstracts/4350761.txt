In this paper, we investigate transmission distortion optimized FEC scheme over time-varying wireless channels. Our main objective is to minimize transmission distortion to satisfy a certain presentation quality by considering the media and channel characteristics such as packet importance, packet dependencies, channel state information and channel capacity. In particular, we propose a transmission distortion optimized FEC scheme that along with packet scheduling aims to minimize a weighted sum of distortion and total transmission cost under capacity constraints. We improved approximate algorithms that use the media and channel characteristics to transmit the best selected and FEC coded packet. The real-time simulation results with H.264 sequences demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms over the classical error recovery scheme.

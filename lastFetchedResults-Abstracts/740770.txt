Background
Hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and blood pressure control rates in the population with chronic kidney disease are limited. The objective of this study was to determine the state of blood pressure control in patients with chronic kidney disease.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional analysis of data of participants with chronic kidney disease from the Kidney Early Evaluation Program. The Kidney Early Evaluation Program is a national-based health screening program for individuals at high risk for kidney disease conducted in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Of 55,220 adults with kidney disease, 10,813 completed information for demographic and medical characteristics used in the analysis. Predictors of blood pressure control were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis.
Results
Hypertension prevalence, awareness, and treatment proportions in the screened cohort were high (86.2%, 80.2%, and 70.0%, respectively), but blood pressure control rates were low (13.2%). These proportions increased with advancing stage of kidney disease. Elevated systolic blood pressure accounted for the majority of inadequate control. Male gender (odds ratio [OR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.99), non-Hispanic black race (OR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89), and body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or more (OR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73-0.94) were inversely related with blood pressure control. Those with stage 3 kidney disease were more likely to have blood pressure at goal than those with stage 1 kidney disease (OR 2.08; 95% CI, 1.55-2.80).
Conclusion
We conclude that despite increased awareness and treatment of hypertension, control rates in these participants are poor. This poor control rate centers around elevated systolic pressure in people who are obese, non-Hispanic black, or male. These data suggest that those who are aware of their kidney disease are more likely to achieve blood pressure control.

The primary challenge in wireless sensor network deployment is the limited network lifetime due to finite-capacity batteries. Hence, the vast majority of research efforts thus far have focused on the development of energy-efficient communication and computing mechanisms for WSNs. In this article a fundamentally different approach and hence completely new WSN paradigm, the wireless passive sensor network, is introduced. The objective of the WPSN is to eliminate the limitation on system lifetime of the WSN. In a WPSN power is externally supplied to the sensor network node via an external RF source. Modulated backscattering is discussed as an alternative communication scheme for WPSNs. The feasibility is investigated along with the open research challenges for reliable communication and networking in WPSNs.

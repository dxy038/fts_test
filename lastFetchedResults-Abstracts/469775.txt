Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors affecting birth charges in twin pregnancies.
Study design
Clinical and financial data were obtained on 1486 twin pregnancies delivered between 1995 to 2002 at medical centers in Maryland, Florida, Michigan, and South Carolina. Maternal and neonatal length of stay (LOS) and charges were modeled by gestational age and other risk factors using a general linear model.
Results
Maternal and infant birth admission LOS and charges increased significantly with a decline in gestational age. Maternal LOS and charges were also significantly increased by cesarean delivery and preeclampsia. Newborn LOS and charges increased significantly by monochorionicity and slowed growth between 20 to 28 weeks. For mother and infants, the shortest LOS and lowest birth charges were at 37 to 38 weeks.
Conclusion
These findings reflect the substantial maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with twin pregnancies, and demonstrate that 37 to 38 weeks is their optimal gestation.

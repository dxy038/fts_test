Objective: The increasing popularity of computer games among children and aodlescents has prompted researchers to study the cognitive, emotional and behavioral effects of these games on their users. The objective of the present research was to assess the effect of computer games on the ability of mental rotation. Mental rotation is a special ability by means of which an individual can visualize the final appearance of a two- or three- dimensional object, after it is rotated to a certain degree around an axis. Method: In this interventional study which was carried out on 162 secondary school students (aged 12-13 years), a researched- designed questionnaire was distributed by means of which the degree of acquaintance of the sample group with the computer game "Tetris' was determined. Then 60 subjects were randomly selected from the group and were divided into four study and control groups, each comprising 15 subjects. First, all four groups simultaneously took a pre-test mental rotation test. Next, two groups of examinees, one comprising boys and the other comprising girls, played "Tetris' during six 30- minute sessions. Immediately after the training, all four groups took a post-test. The obtained information was analyzed by means of dependent and non dependent t-tests. Results: The results showed that the ability of mental rotation was not significantly different of mental rotation increased in the adolescents, and the girls achieved higher scores than boys. Conclusion: Models of environmental, social and biological phenomena conclude that spatial abilities in general and mental rotation in particular are more flexible in girls and women in comparison with boys and men.

In order to maintain Europe as world leader in development of safety relevant systems one of the keys would be to join together the European industrial, academic and scientific communities. One of the main industrial challenges is that any company that wants to compete in the safety-related embedded systems market and have success in business, have to develop competent systems reducing the time to market and the cost of the development and certification. The reusability of SW components is one of the solutions in this way. The technical aspects are worked out in the ARTEMIS nSafeCer project and industrial, academic and scientific communities are working together generating new methods and tools and applying them in use cases. One of the use cases of the project is an educational one and the University of Mondragon is developing it in order to use it in the Master of Embedded Systems Courses with the objective to transfer the knowledge about how to develop safety critical and certifiable systems in an efficient way.

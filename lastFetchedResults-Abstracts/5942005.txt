This paper presents DS an evolutionary swarm based algorithm suitable for parallel implementation and optimization of multi-objective goals. The algorithm has been implemented and tested using three standard benchmark functions; namely Rosenbrock, Griewank and Sshwefel. Next, we applied DS to solve the portfolio selection problem as a case study as a proof of concept to its suitability for multi-objective goals. Results are promising as compared to standard swarm.

Electrification of road transport is becoming increasingly important in the context of reaching the objective to reduce carbon emissions, particularly when combined with the increased share of renewable and other low-carbon electricity generation. However, the efficient integration of renewable generation and electrified transport might be put at risk unless the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs) is not utilised to support system operation. This paper therefore develops an analytical approach for including flexible EV load into power system scheduling while taking into consideration detailed driving patterns of a nationally representative EV fleet. This approach enables the quantification of the impact of different EV charging strategies (smart vs. non-smart) on the economic and environmental performance of the system, and in particular on the ability of the system to integrate intermittent renewable output. The approach is demonstrated on a case study for the GB system in 2030, suggesting massive cost and emission savings resulting from smart EV charging, as well as dramatic improvements in terms of reduced curtailment of intermittent wind output.

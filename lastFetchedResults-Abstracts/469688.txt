Objective
This study was undertaken to assess whether estrogen therapy (ET) reduces the risk of cognitive decline in women with cerebrovascular disease.
Study design
We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of estradiol 17Î² versus placebo for secondary stroke prevention in 664 postmenopausal women with a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 5 domain measures were obtained at baseline and exit.
Results
Among 461 women withdrawn alive without stroke, ET did not have a significant effect on cognitive measures after an average of 3 years (relative risk of MMSE decline: 0.74, 95% CI, 0.49-1.13). In women with normal MMSE at entry, estrogen was associated with less decline (relative risk, 0.46, 95% CI, 0.24-0.87).
Conclusion
In this study, estradiol did not have significant effects on cognitive measures. However, in women with normal function at baseline, there may be a benefit for ET in reducing the risk for cognitive decline

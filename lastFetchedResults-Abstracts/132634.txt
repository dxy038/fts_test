Introduction: Phenobarbital is a anti epileptic drug (AED). FDA has classified this drug as a D group and pregnant women who take this drug under appropriate conditions may have neonates with congenital malformations e.g. hypoplasia of finger or toe nails and digital phalanges, facial and skull deformities and cardiac malformations. Some of the case reports showed severe malformations for this drug such as fetal hydantoin and down syndromes.
Objective: This study was carried out to reveal the malformations spectrum of Phenobarbital malformations. Materials and Methods: 30 Balb/c mature female rats, aged 2.5 months and weighted 28 to 30 gr were housed in environmentally controlled room. A group of 3-4 females were caged with a single male of proven fertility overnight. Finding of vaginal plug on the following morning was regarded as a gestational day (GD) O. Rats were divided into experimental groups; ex. I=received 1.3 mg/kg and ex. I1=received 2.6 mg/kg doses of Phenobarbital vial and vne control group which received normal saline via intraperitoneally during the first consecutive 10 days of pregnancy. Rats were dissected in GD18 and embryos were collected and then washed with normal saline. Macroscopic observation was done by OLYMPUS SZX JAPAN stereomicroscope. Data were analysed by ANOVA and X2 tests by means of SPSS software.
Results: Most of the malformations were in the group II (dose 2.6 mg/kg). Embryos had extensive malformations in the skeletal and nervous system such as short limb, distortion and dislocation of the limbs, scoliosis, encephalocele. The group I (Dose 1.3 mg/kg) also showed these malformations but with a lower severity and some cases of exencephaly and spina bifida.
Conclusion: This study revealed that Phenobarbital can induce new severe malformations if this drug is used continuously in the early stage of pregnancy.

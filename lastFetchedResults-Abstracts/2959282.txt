This work presents closed loop, bidirectional telemetry hardware with a telecommunication system to carry data and images for remote control and monitoring of a chronically implanted device. While the uplink of the signals from the implanted unit to the external receiver was achieved via electromagnetic waves, infra-red signals were utilized for downlinking to the implanted device. Telemetry in both directions was capable of maintaining a range more than two and a half meters, although the design was not optimized for data rate. The video and data link with the remote site, which was 15 km away from the implant site, was established using intranet connections utilizing peer-to-peer communications

A new approach to blind adaption of antenna arrays is presented that has the capability to extract PCM, AM, and FDM-FM communication signals-of-interest (SOIs) from cochannel interference environments using only known spectral correlation properties of those SOIs, i.e. without using knowledge of the antenna array manifold, SOI waveform, or SOI direction-of-arrival to train the array. The class of self-coherence restoral (SCORE) objective functions is introduced, and flexible algorithms for adapting antenna arrays to optimize these objective functions are developed. It is shown that these algorithms will maximize the SOI SINR at the output of any antenna array when a single SOI with self-coherence at a known value of frequency separation and an arbitrary number of interferers without self-coherence at that frequency separation are impinging on the array

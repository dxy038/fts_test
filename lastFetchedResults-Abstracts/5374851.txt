An efficient method for optimal feeder configuration for distribution system expansion planning is presented. The problem is formulated as a combinatorial constrained optimization problem with a nonlinear, non-differentiable objective function. A solution methodology based on simulated annealing is proposed to determine an optimum configuration of existing and new feeder sections that would minimize the sum of the outage cost, the cost of feeder resistive loss, and the corresponding investment and maintenance costs of new lines and switches. Results obtained from a test distribution system show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

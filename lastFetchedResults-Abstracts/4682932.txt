NASA´s In-Space Technology Project developed advanced chemical propulsion technologies to increase performance and reduce cost for chemical propulsion systems applicable to near-term science missions. Presently the primary investment is in the AMBR engine-a high temperature, storable bipropellant rocket engine using advanced materials for its combustion chamber. Scheduled to be available for flight development starting in year 2009, the AMBR engine´s target performance goal offers payload gain for a number of science missions and a 30 percent manufacturing cost reduction over the state-of-the-art combustion chamber. Other chemical propulsion technology developments include reliable lightweight tanks for propellants and pressurants, and precision propellant management and mixture ratio control. Both technologies show mission benefits. They can be applied to most liquid propulsion systems; and they are ready for flight infusion. Work was completed on the following technologies: High temperature thrust chamber materials, low temperature gel propellants, high performance ionic and mono propellants, zero-boil off for cryogenic propellants, and lightweight foam core shielding system. Analytical tools were advanced for the post mission benefit assessment and advanced chemical propulsion component sizing. Various system trade studies were conducted to guide technology development. Examples are &#194;&#191;Pump-fed versus pressure-fed propulsion systems&#194;&#191; and &#194;&#191;Mixture ratio control.&#194;&#191; Task details are provided for all the technologies and analyses including their background, procurement mechanism, objective, status, and summary, with their literature references.

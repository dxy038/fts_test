It is well known that construction project management involves such objectives as duration, cost, quality, resource leveling and so on. It is necessary to integrate and balance multiple objectives in management process. So this paper firstly analyzes single-objective optimization models such as duration-cost model, duration-quality model and resource leveling model and the relationship between duration, cost, quality and resource leveling. On basis of that, the paper established a multi-objective optimization model of duration, cost, quality and resource leveling by taking comprehensive optimization as the goal and integrating with multi-objective technique. For traditional weighting method has strong subjectivity, an improved global-optimization-based TOPSIS solution is presented. Good results are obtained when the model is employed in an engineering case, which verifies its superiority. It provides scientific basis for project decision-making and supports the decider powerfully.

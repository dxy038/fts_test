Background: A pressure ulcer is a complication related to the need for the care and
treatment of primarily disabled and elderly people. With the decrease of the blood ?ow
caused by the pressure loaded, ulcers are formed and the tissue will be wasted with the
passage of time.
Objective: The aim of this study was to construct blood ?ow monitoring system
on the heel tissue which was under external pressure in order to evaluate the tissue
treatment in the ulcer.
Methods: To measure the blood ?ow changes, three infrared optical transmitters
were used at the distances of 5, 10, and 15 mm to the receiver. Blood ?ow changes in
heels were assessed in pressures 0, 30, and 60 mmHg. The time features were extracted
for analysis from the recorded signal by MATLAB software. Changes of the time
features under different pressures were evaluated at the three distances by ANOVA in
SPSS software. The level of signifcance was considered at 0.05.
Results: In this study, 15 subjects, including both male and female, with the mean
age of 54±7 participated. The results showed that the signal amplitude, power and
absolute signal decreased signifcantly when pressure on the tissue increased in different layers (p < 0.05). Heart rate only decreased signifcantly in pressures more than
30 mmHg (p=0.02). In pressures more than 30 mmHg, in addition to a decrease in the
time features, the pattern of blood ?ow signal changed and it wasn’t the same as noload signal.
Conclusion: By detecting the time features, we can reach an early diagnosis to
prognosticate the degeneration of the tissue under pressure and it can be recommended
as a method to predict bedsores in the heel.

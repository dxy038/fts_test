The objective of the present study is to understand the hydrodynamics and heat transfer of the impingement process, particularly the complexities attributable to the asymmetric geometry of an oblique liquid plane jet. The Navierâ€“Stokes equations are solved using a finite-volume formulation with a two-step projection method on a fixed non-uniform rectangular grid. The free surface of the jet is tracked by the volume-of-fluid method with a second order accurate piecewise-linear scheme. The energy equation is modeled by using an enthalpy-based formulation. The method provides a state-of-the-art comprehensive model of the dynamic and thermal aspects of the impinging process. Nusselt number plots and pressure distributions on the substrate are obtained. The locations of the maximum Nusselt number as well as maximum pressure on the surface are identified and compared with the geometric jet impingement point. Results for normal impingement are also obtained and are used as reference. The effects of several parameters are examined. These include jet Reynolds number, jet impingement angle and jet inlet velocity profile. Experimental and analytical data from the literature are also included for comparison.

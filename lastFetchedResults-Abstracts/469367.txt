Objective
It has been a general rule to wait with the repair of an obstetric fistula for a minimum period of 3 months allowing the patient to become an outcast. In a prospective way an immediate management was studied and antibiotics were not used, all according to basic surgical principles.
Methods
A total of 1716 patients with a fistula duration of 3 to 75 days after delivery were treated immediately on presentation by catheter and/or early closure. Instead of antibiotics, a high oral fluid regimen was instituted. The fistulas were classified according to anatomic and physiologic location in types I, IIAa, IIAb, IIBa, and IIBb, and according to size in small, medium, large, and extensive. The operation became progressively more complicated from type I through type IIBb and from small through extensive.
Results
At first attempt 1633 fistulas (95.2%) were closed and another 57 could be closed at further attempt(s), accounting for a final closure in 1690 patients (98.5%); 264 patients (15.4%) were healed by catheter only. Of these 1690 patients with a closed fistula, 1575 (93.2%) were continent and 115 (6.8%) were incontinent. The results as to closure and to continence became progressively worse from type I through type IIBb and from small through extensive. Postoperative wound infection was not noted; postoperative mortality was encountered in 6 patients (0.4%).
Conclusion
This immediate management proves highly effective in terms of closure and continence and will prevent the patient from becoming an outcast with progressive downgrading medically, socially, and mentally.

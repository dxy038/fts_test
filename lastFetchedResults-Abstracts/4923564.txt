The image fusion is an extensively useful technology. This paper proposes a new image fusion algorithm using m-PCNN, which uses the firing frequency of neurons to process the image fusion in m-PCNN. Aiming at the result of image fusion being affected by neuron parameters, our algorithm is only dependent of the parameters VT and independent of other parameters. At the same time, the relations curves about VT and mutual information and the root mean square error are presented. Moreover, compared with the others image fusion algorithm using PCNN, Experimental results show our method outperforms other methods, in both visual effect and objective evaluation criteria.

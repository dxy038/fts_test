Users who tag images in Internet using the Spanish language can be from different Spanish speaking countries in the world. Different countries with different cultures, variations in vocabulary and forms of expression, which can influence in their choice of tags while tagging images. Also, they can have different levels of tagging skills, in semantic terms (diversity of vocabulary) and syntactic terms (errors incurred while defining the tags). In this paper we present a study carried out for natives of different Spanish speaking countries, with the objective of providing user support depending on the detected language skills and characteristics of the user. Using the syntactic and semantic factors we can profile users in terms of their skill level and other characteristics, and then we can use these profiles to offer customized support for image tagging in the Spanish language.

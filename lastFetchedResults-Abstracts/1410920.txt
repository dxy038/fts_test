Graded materials, also known as functionally graded materials (FGMs), are generally two-phase composites with continuously varying volume fractions. Used as coatings and interfacial zones they can reduce thermally and mechanically induced stresses resulting from material property mismatch, increase the bonding strength and provide protection against adverse environments. In this paper, the contact problems of parabolic and cylindrical stamps on graded coatings are considered. The objective of this study is to obtain a series of analytical benchmark solutions for examining the influence of such factors as material inhomogeneity constants the coefficient of friction and various length parameters on the critical stresses that may have a bearing on the fatigue and fracture of the components with graded coatings.

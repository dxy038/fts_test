Peptide mass fingerprints were obtained for three different proteins using three different digestion procedures in triplicates with liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. For each protein the results were compared with multivariate data analysis (cluster analysis, kernel principal component analysis) and pair-wise contrast evaluation. Clear systematic differences between the digestion procedures were established for all the proteins. The visual presentation of the pair-wise differences between procedures could to some extent be related to the protein fragments, although the main objective was to identify m/z and retention regions in the original peptide maps that should be subject to further exploration.

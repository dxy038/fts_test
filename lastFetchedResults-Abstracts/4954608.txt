The ability of human to perform physical tasks is limited, not by his intellect, but by his physical strength. If, in an appropriate environment, a machine could make a detection of humanÂ´s intentions and then finish the corresponding actions. In this situation, the mechanical power is closely integrated with the mechanical strength of human arm under the control of the human intellect. As a result of that the system will be superior to a loosely integrated combination of a human and a fully automated robot. Therefore, this paper presents a force control system for industrial robotic manipulator and an active force and torque sensing technique to sends out the corresponding instruction when been effected by the external power. The proposed sensor is implemented on the top of manipulator. This sensor can be the transducer measuring and outputting forces and torques from all three Cartesian coordinates. The research objective is a 3 DOF (degree of freedom) manipulator, which can be operated in a natural and intuitive manner by utilizing the force information by the unpredicted pushing and pulling action apply to the robot during human-robot interaction. On the other hand, it can be real time implemented in the simulator system. At same time, it is confirmed that the effectiveness about maintain the stability of the 6 DOF manipulator through simulation using ODE (Open Dynamics Engine).

A systematic design approach has been developed for thermal processes combining the  nite element method,
design sensitivity analysis and optimization. Conductive heat transfer is solved in an Eulerian formulation,
where the heat 
ux is  xed in space and the material 
ows through a control volume. For constant velocity
and heat 
ux distribution, the Eulerian formulation reduces to a steady-state problem, whereas the Lagrangian
formulation remains transient. The reduction to a steady-state problem drastically improves the computational
e ciency. Streamline Upwinding Petrov{Galerkin stabilization is employed to suppress the spurious oscilla-
tions. Design sensitivities of the temperature  eld are computed using both the direct di erentiation and the
adjoint methods. The systematic approach is applied in optimizing the laser surfacing process, where a moving
laser beam heats the surface of a plate, and hardening is achieved by rapid cooling due to the heat transfer
below the surface. The optimization objective is to maximize the rate of surface hardening. Constraints are
introduced on the computed temperature and temperature rate  elds to ensure that phase transformations are
activated and that melting does not occur

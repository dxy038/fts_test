Conducted at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and HealthÂ´s (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, the experiment described in this paper is part of ongoing mine illumination research designed to explore the benefits of solid-state lighting technologies when applied to the underground mining industry. This experiment involves the comparative evaluation of cap lamps with similar spectral power distributions, focusing on the electrical and battery discharge characteristics, with a secondary objective being the benefits gained through alternative light beam distributions. NIOSH researchers conducted the investigation by comparing three commercially available light-emitting diode cap lamps and an NIOSH prototype cap lamp at varying power settings. Visual performance for the detection of hazards was quantified by recording times of detection for finding rotating targets in the peripheral field of view and objects representing trip and fall hazards on the ground. The NIOSH prototype cap lamp resulted in improvements ranging from 15% to 43% for peripheral motion detection time and 5%-23% for slip, trip, and fall object detection time, respectively, as compared with the referent incandescent cap lamp.

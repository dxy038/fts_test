In composite manufacturing processes, such as resin transfer molding (RTM) and vacuum assisted RTM, the resin is infused into a mold containing a preform. The liquid injection molding simulation, which was developed at the University of Delaware, is capable of simulating the movement of the resin flow fronts through a fiber preform, when the gate and vent locations are specified. When two flow fronts meet and trap air between them, a resin-starved area, called a `dry spotÂ´, is formed, causing a structural weakness in the final composite part. This problem can be solved by the optimal placement of gates and vents. In order to determine optimal gate and vent locations, a genetic algorithm has been used as a search tool. The objective function for the optimization is expressed as a process performance index (PPI) and incorporates the fill time and dry spot formation. The PPI is at a minimum at the optimum gate and vent(s) configuration. We demonstrate the method through a case study

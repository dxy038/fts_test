Background
A firm diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) requires demonstration of the parasite in organ aspirates or tissue biopsy samples. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the diagnostic usefulness of non-invasive testing for antibody to the leishmanial antigen K39 by means of antigen-impregnated nitrocellulose paper strips adapted for use under field conditions.
Methods
One drop of peripheral blood is applied to the nitrocellulose strip. Three drops of test buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus bovine serum albumin) are added to the dried blood. The development of two visible bands indicates presence of IgG anti-K39. 323 consecutive patients with suspected kala-azar referred to two specialist units in India, and 25 healthy controls, provided fingerstick blood samples for the test. Spleen aspirates were taken from 250 patients.
Findings
Kala-azar was confirmed by microscopy of spleen-aspirate smears in 127 patients. The K39 strip test was positive in all 127; the estimated sensitivity was therefore 100% (95% Cl 98–100). Four patients had positive strip tests but negative aspirate smears; all four responded to treatment for leishmaniasis. 217 individuals, including the 25 healthy controls, 73 patients with malaria or tuberculosis, and 119 spleen-aspirate-negative patients who had presumed malaria or cirrhosis (79) or no final diagnosis (40), had negative strip-test results. None of the 119 aspirate-negative patients developed evidence of kala-azar during 3–6 months of follow-up. The estimated specificity of the strip test was 98% (95–100; 217/221).
Interpretation
Detection of anti-K39 by immuno-chromatographic strip testing is a rapid and non-invasive method of diagnosing kala-azar, which has good sensitivity and specificity and is well suited for use in field conditions.

In this paper, we describe a GaN 3x3 matrix converter chipset, which are composed of a GaN integrated bidirectional switching chip and a GaN integrated gate drive transmitter chip using 5.0GHz Drive-by-Microwave technology. The extremely compact three phase AC-AC matrix converter such as a 25x18mm2 is realized by these GaN/Si integrated chips and novel isolated dividing couplers, which duplicate the gate signal with different references for dual-gate bidirectional switches and reduce gate lines and gate drive components by half. The proposed GaN 3x3 matrix converter is significantly more compact than the conventional one that requires numerous power switches, flywheel diodes, photo-couplers, isolated power supplies and gate drivers.

Robust design (RD) and tolerance design (TD) have received much attention from researchers and practitioners
for more than two decades, and a number of methodologies for modeling and optimizing the RD
and TD processes have been studied. However, there is ample room for improvement. Because most
existing research considers RD and TD as separate research fields, the primary objective of this paper
is to develop a sequential robustâ€“tolerance design method to jointly determine the best factor settings
and the closed-form solutions for the optimal specification limits. We then apply the proposed method
to a destructive quality characteristic. Finally, a case study and sensitivity analyses are performed for
verification purposes, and further studies are discussed.

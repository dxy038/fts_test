This paper presents a qualitative analysis for the emergence of a digital innovation ecosystem (DIE). It is based on the implementation of a local ecosystem focused on innovation and creativity (ESLIC) located in Picardy Region. The objective of this study is to propose the principles of a model for a DIE that contributes to the development of this type of socio-economic organization. It was made from a diagnosis (qualitative survey), multiple sources of information about local projects and initiatives (new and historic), and experimentation of a social network in a short period.

Control system design for a complex system encompasses the optimization of different and often conflicting objectives leading to a multiple objective design problem. In this paper, a switching strategy is proposed to solve the multiple objective controller design. Each controller is designed based on a set of performance specifications. Control realization considerations are used to ensure overall closed loop stability. Linear matrix inequalities are employed in the controller design process. Multi objective designs are always prone to over conservatism, which is greatly reduced by the switching strategy. Simulation results are used to show the effectiveness of the design methodology.

This paper presents a PSCAD based simulation model for a grid-connected Switch Reluctance Machine (SRM), which drives a fly-wheel. The system can be used as an effective means to improve power quality issues, such as LVRT, voltage sags, sudden load demands, etc., that encountered in typical power networks. The proposed PSCAD model consists of two separate modules- one for the SRM and the other for the grid side power interface. The SRM module has the flexibility to operate both in motoring and generating modes whereas the power interface module facilitates the bidirectional power flow between the grid and the flywheel in accordance with the mode of operation of the SRM. During standby operation of the flywheel, both modules ensure that the speed of the flywheel is maintained at the desired constant value by operating the SRM machine in the motoring mode. In the event of grid supply failure or voltage sag or sudden load increase, the modules change their mode of operation to generation, during which the flywheel provides its stored kinetic energy back into the grid. Results, for both motoring and generating, are presented as a proof of the validity of proposed simulation module, which can be considered as a valuable tool for investigating grid-connected SRM machines.

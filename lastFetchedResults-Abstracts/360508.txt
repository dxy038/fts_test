Study objective: To test the hypothesis that neuropsychologic test results and functional outcome will be abnormal if hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is not used in patients with severe carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Methods:  For a 1-year interval, we retrospectively identified all CO-poisoned patients who were comatose on presentation at a large, urban tertiary hospital and did not receive HBO therapy. Prospectively, 6 and 12 months after CO poisoning, we administered standardized questionnaires to assess functional outcome. At 6 months, we performed extensive neuropsychologic testing. Results:  All four patients exhibited normal performance on a neuropsychologic test battery at 6 months. The Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination was normal in all patients. All patients had normal functional outcomes. Conclusion: Normal neuropsychologic and functional outcomes are possible after severe CO poisoning without the use of HBO therapy.

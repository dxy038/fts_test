The design of supply chain networks has attracted more attention in recent years according to business and environmental factors.in this paper a multi objective supply chain network design model aims to minimize network costs while satisfying the desired service level, is presented. A fuzzy goal programming (FGP) solution approach based on fuzzy membership function concept is developed to minimize costs and amount of investment while obtain maximum service level. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the efficiency of proposed solution method.

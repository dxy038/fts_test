The Reach Optimized Architecture for Multi-rate Transport System or ROAMTS is presented, analyzed, and evaluated, leading to the case for non-ITU.T grid optics. The ROAMTS architecture promises better fiber utilization as well as the capability to adhere to the requirements of higher-line-rates especially, at 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps, in metropolitan and regional networks. The paper showcases the promise of ROAMTS whose inherent philosophy is that of treating each channel/signal in a unique way unlike conventional WDM systems. This philosophy of no-one-size-fits-all is explained from an architectural perspective. Treating each demand uniquely to maximize the total fiber utilization as well as to extend the signal-reach leads to a combinatorial-optimization problem - of finding which is the best way of allocating traffic within the ROAMTS framework. A second objective is to measure the reduction of muxponders - subsystems that multiplex lower line-rate signals into a higher granular signal using an electronic multiplexer. Performance results show significant improvement over traditional ITU.T-WDM grid systems.

One of the important tasks in the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) development program is to demonstrate the viability of the present technology to satisfactorily design, construct, deploy and operate a large-scale cold water pipe in an at-sea environment. Toward this objective a CWP At-Sea Test Program was initiated to model a 40 MWe CWP at a scale of about one-third. The initial phase I results of this program are presented herein.

There are approximately 2 million people who have glaucoma. And about 90% of glaucoma patients have chronic type disease, and most of them do not notice of their disease. Finally they will lost their eyesight by this disease. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the auto diagnostic method for glaucoma. Our objective of this study is the development of the auto diagnostic system for the glaucoma by using fundus photograph. In our system, digitized fundus photograph is tested in personal computer, and the ratio of the area of optic disk and the area of optic disk cup (named C/D ratio) is calculated and evaluated automatically. And then this system can checkup subject condition for glaucoma. In this paper, we will discuss our auto diagnostic system for the glaucoma

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In this study, relationship between computerized tomography (CT) scan findings with signs, symptoms and Glascow coma scale (GCS) of head injured patients were studied.
METHODS: In this descriptive study, 373 CT scan of 312 patients were studied that among them, 290 patients were hospitalized and 22 patients were treated as OPD cases. CT scan findings, GCS changes and clinical findings were assessed.
FINDINGS: Sixty two percent of the patients had mild head injury, 38% had moderate to severe head injury, and 42% of patients with mild head injury had normal CT scan. There was a significant relationship between CT scan findings, clinical findings and GCS (p=0.001): two-third of patients with mild head injury had normal CT scan and one-third had brain edema. 53% of patients with severe head injury had brain edema and 28% had intracranial hematoma. 84% of patients with focal neurological deficit had extraaxial hematoma and 41% of unconscious patients had intracranial hematoma.
CONCLUSION: As most of CT scan finding in patients with mild head injuries was brain edema, it seems not necessary for scanning in this group, Patients with the low GCS and severe head injury had the abnormal CT scans. So it must be chosen the patients according to clinical findings.

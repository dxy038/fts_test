The objective of the research is to study the basic elements of simulation management together with their application to a real flooding area system. The benefits of the research are to avoid risk to drinking water surrounding the Citarum river, and especially during the rainy season, analysis of relevant health and environmental aspects. The method used comparative studies of real world systems, modelling and simulation. Simulation together with improvement of computer-based tools and methods are carried out. The modelling cycle of setting up a verbal, mathematical model, reduction of the mathematical model, solving the equations, parameter sensitivity modelling, experimental design and parameter optimization are described. The simulation models of management of technology in flooding area around the Citarum river in South Bandung can be used to better understand the views of researchers, rural people, government sociologists and economists and also to provide an understanding of regulatory political, technical and economic structures in the integrated flooding management field

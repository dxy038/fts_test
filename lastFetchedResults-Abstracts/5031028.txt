The Building Energy Management and Redesign Retrofit Program is a dedicated effort by New York Telephone to conserve energy. The programs objective is to reduce building energy consumption 25 to 30% below 1976 levels by 1982. Implementation is accomplished by qualified survey teams consisting of an engineer and building operations supervisor implementing the 3 categories of BEMARR; namely, Field Operations, Redesign Retrofit and Energy Management. Examples describing each category are detailed herein. Energy Management is particularly detailed since this category utilizes the most recent technology and has a tremendous potential for savings. First year results are discussed by category and an overview of each categoryÂ´s impact on the total program is illustrated. An update on New York Telephones experimental solar, heating and cooling project is also included.

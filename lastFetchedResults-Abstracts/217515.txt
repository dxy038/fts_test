Objective: This study was conducted to determine the eventual association between copper deficiency in newborns with neural tube defects (NTD) in Northern Iran. A high prevalence of neural tube defects has been reported from this region.
Methods: This hospital based case control study was carried out on 13 newborns having neural tube defects and 35 healthy controls in Northern Iran during 2005-2006. Serum copper was measured by spectrophotometery.
Findings: Serum copper level in newborns with NTD and healthy normal newborns was 16.5 ((plus-minus)7.2) (mu)mol/l and 16.7 ((plus-minus)6.6) (mu)mol/l, respectively. In case group 38.5% of newborns and in control group 28.6% had copper deficiency. Logistic regression analysis showed no association between the presence of NTD and copper deficiency (OR:1.6, 95% CI=0.3-7.1, P=0.5).
Conclusion: This study showed no association between NTD and copper deficiency in newborns.

This paper proposes a novel data hiding method for binary images authentication aims at preserving the connectivity of pixels in a local 3times3 neighborhood and dynamically improving the "flipppability" decision by considering a larger neighborhood. The interlaced morphological binary wavelet transform (IMBWT) is employed as the basic processing tool. The primary objective of considering a larger neighborhood is to improve the visual quality of the watermarked image. The post-checking constraints ensure that the "embeddability" of a pixel is invariant in the data embedding process thus facilitates blind watermark extraction and incorporation of the cryptographic signature. "Single flipping" and "pair flipping" are discussed. The "connectivity-preserving" and "transition change" patterns are properly paired and classified so that each category is isolated from other categories, hence no ambiguity exists. The "end stroke" patterns that are orthogonal to the "connectivity-preserving" and "transition change" patterns are employed such that a double data hiding scheme can be designed.

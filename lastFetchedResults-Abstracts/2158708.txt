As Saussure says, the meaning of the unites is not in the meaning itself, but the meaning is essentially an aspect of differentiation. In this perspective, all values are attributed to the “relationship”, not to individual units or separately of words what happens accordingly for a subject (“I” or “we") and its identity: the subject defines itself by the “difference", and in order to achieve the specified identity, it needs to other one. So Landowski suggests a general pattern that consists of four different strategies about the relationship between "I" as dominant and "other"as dominated. This pattern originates from semiotics square of Greimas. These strategies include assimilation, exclusion, segregation and identity acceptance. The main objective of this paper is to show that this pattern can be used in translation’s domain that is a challenging atmosphere of contact between our language and other foreign language. But the main question is that how Landowski identity pattern can be used basically for a new reading of the translation strategies.

A three-dimensional Eulerian photochemical model is used to follow the dynamics of ozone, NOx, and CO over the Athens area, for 25 May 1990, the day considered in the APSIS project. A unique aspect of this work lies in the study of the impacts of the wind field preparation methods on the concentrations predicted by the model. Three sets of wind fields are developed. The first one used is derived from a prognostic meteorological model. The second one is calculated from available wind observations using objective: methods. For these two cases, a previous day is simulated, using the same conditions, to develop preconditioned initial conditions for the following day. For the third simulation, again two days are simulated, this time using the observed winds for each of the two days modeled. The predictions using the prognostically derived and the objective analysis wind fields are significantly different, particularly for the primary pollutants. Comparing predictions to the observations did not favor any particular method of wind field preparation. In this case, when using the prognostically derived field, the simulations are very sensitive to boundary conditions. In contrast, when using the wind fields constructed by objective methods, the simulations became most sensitive to emissions and initial conditions. This comes directly from the different residence times in the domain, which are governed by the wind speed.

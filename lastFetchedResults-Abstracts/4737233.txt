Software defined radio (SDR) is a concept that has been giving momentum in realizing a wireless multimode, multiband, multistandard radio terminal capable of operating according to a variety of different mobile communication standards. This paper investigates a number of architectural issues and trade-offs involved in the design of receiver analogue front end for a multistandard SDR with a fundamental objective of expanding the digital signal processing (DSP) toward the antenna. Receiver topologies such as heterodyne, direct conversion, low IF, wideband IF and bandpass sampling receiver configurations are described and summarized and also a suitable analog front-end architecture for SDR is suggested.

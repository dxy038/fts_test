The National Maritime Security Test and Evaluation Site (NMSTES) is a concept for a site for objective testing and evaluation of components, equipment and systems for application to port and harbor security. The initial focus of the NMSTES concept is for U.S. Navy applications. However, once such a facility comes into being, it is a logical extension to include testing and evaluation for application to commercial ports and harbors. The NMSTES operates under the anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) program to facilitate risk-rationalized investment strategies. It supports the AT/FP program by supporting system acquisition. The NMSTES provides evaluations of the performance of security components and systems in realistic conditions and technical links to national expertise in port and harbor security systems. By implementing such a test and evaluation site, system and threat detection capabilities, and cost effectiveness will be improved

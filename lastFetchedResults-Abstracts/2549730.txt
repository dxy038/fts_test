Objective (s): It is more than a decade that pre-marriage counseling is launched in Iran. However, the quality of the program has not been changed despite changes in situation and couples' needs. The aim of this study was to assess couples' and counselors' perspectives towards the program in Iran.
Methods: This qualitative study was conducted on 153 couples and 6 pre-marriage counseling providers in an urban health center in 2013, in Iran. The sample included couples participated in pre-marriage counseling program, and counseling providers. Sampling was performed purposefully through typical case sampling and expert sampling. Couples selection was done based on participants’ educational level and socio-economic status. Thirty focus group discussions were performed to obtain couples and counseling providers' perspectives. Individuals’ opinions was recorded and written. Content analysis was performed for data analysis. Transcripts were read for several times, main themes were extracted, and coding was done.
Results: Overall participants’ were unsatisfied with the program. Reasons of unsatisfactory sessions were brief and vague presentation of topics; simple, not elaborate topics; mistimed, short sessions; and using a lecture for all topics. They believed that the proper content of the program must include teaching life skills, family planning, and health issues. They also proposed different sessions for men, women, and inviting experienced experts for teaching some topics.  
Conclusion: The present pre-marriage counseling program does not meet the various needs of couples. Both its content and presentation needs major revision.

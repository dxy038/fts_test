One of the applications of photovoltaic (PV) generators today is PV-hybrid power systems for remote residences. In these systems, one or more PV array(s) are combined with another source of power (diesel and/or wind) for making a more reliable electricity supply. Batteries are used in these systems for supplying electricity during the nights as well as cloudy days. One (or more) diesel generator is used to ensure that the batteries are not undercharged. The objective of this paper is to present a numerical model for optimum sizing of the components in PV-hybrid power systems. A further objective is to present an optimum way to predict the performance of the system.

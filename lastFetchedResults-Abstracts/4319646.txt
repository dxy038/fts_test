This paper considers some strong constraints including the detected range and cycle of optic radar, the maneuvering capability of fighter plane, the difference of cruise height, constitutes the model for trajectory planning when the target moving in the mode of constant velocity movement, and designs a objective function with tr(P) and det(FIM) for actual battle. The trajectory is planned with EKF and the strategy of planning area constraints, rollback mechanism, etc. The simulation results have showed that this method has the advantages of high precision and speed. The trajectory planned can satisfy the requirement of the fighter plane and the optic radar.

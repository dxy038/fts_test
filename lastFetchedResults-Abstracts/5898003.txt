The paper analyzes reactive power optimization problem in distribution system with wind power and PV generators. Reactive power optimization mathematical model including the active power loss, reactive power compensation capacity and static voltage margin is constructed. According to the distribution systems output, reactive power output for distributed generation, reactive power control devices capacity and the tap ratio of on-load tap changer are optimized by Multi-objective Immune Algorithm based on Cluster Evolutionary. The study cases show that the proposed method is feasible and provides a reference value for the operation of wind generation system.

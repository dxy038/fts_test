In the optimal design of varied line spacing (VLS) holographic grating, it is expected to locate multiple alternative solutions in the complicated objective landscape. A cascade evolutionary strategy (CES) algorithm is proposed to solve the multimodal optimization problem. The inner ES works as a local search operator to exploit the niches, while the outer ES works as a regulator to adjust the parameters of inner ES, and introduces competition between the niches. Optimization results of both test function and practical design prove the efficiency and usefulness of CES

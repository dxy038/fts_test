Background: In IYF/ICSI treatment, several attempts have been made to quantify the
implantation potential of embryos in order to optimize the pregnancy rate. The objective was
to determine the possible factors which might have positive impact on implantation.
Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 110 IYF- ICSI cycles as first trial for
ART programs. Maternal and ovulation factors such as female age, body mass index, type of
infertility, infertility diagnosis, duration of ovulation stimulation, numbers of aspirated and
fertilized oocytes, day ofET, were compared in high (::::2 gestational sacs) and low implantation
groups (one or no sac). All analyses were adjusted for age and PCO subgroups in line with the
design of the study.
Resu lts: Our results showed that there were signific ant difference s in follicle size between
high and low implantation groups (l9.32±0.37 vs. l8.07±0.32 respectively) (p= 0.014).
Mean nwnber of grade (V) oocytes was also statistically greater in high implantation group
(p=0.035). Our results were also compared based on age and PCO diagno sis. Women younger
than 35 years old in high implantation group had higher number of grade (V) oocytes than
the other group (p=0.038). Assessing our results based on PCO diagnosis, we found that the
number of oocytes grade (IV) were significantly higher in high implantation group with non
PCOs diagno sis (4.82±2.87 vs. 4.25±3.6) (p=O.043). Non PCO women in low implantation
group had also greater number ofgrade 11 oocytes compared to the other group (p=0.0 17). The
mean follicle size was significantly greater in high implantation group than the other group
(19.32±2 .17 versus 18.07±1.76) (p=0.014).
Con clusion: Follicle size, and oocyte quality have positive effect on high implantation
potential.

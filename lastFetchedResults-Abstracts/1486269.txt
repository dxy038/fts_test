The objective of this study was to evaluate the combined effects of irradiation and carbon monoxide in modified atmosphere packaging (CO-MAP) on total plate counts, Escherichia coli K12, color, and odor of fresh beef during refrigerated storage. Beef was packaged aerobically or in CO-MAP, and irradiated at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 kGy then held at 4 °C for 28 days. Raw beef odor decreased and acid/sour, rancid and grassy odors increased starting on day 14. Initially, no difference existed for visual green color scores due to gas atmosphere. After 14 days of storage, aerobically packaged beef was greener and less red than CO-MAP packaged beef. The a∗ value of CO-MAP packaged beef was higher than that of aerobically packaged beef. Red color of CO-MAP packaged samples decreased slightly in some irradiated samples after 14 days of storage. On day 0 and thereafter, no coliforms were detect after irradiation at 1.5 or 2.0 kGy regardless of packaging format. These findings suggest that CO-MAP could be used to preserve beef color irradiated at doses sufficient to reduce microbial loads to safe levels during 28 days of storage.

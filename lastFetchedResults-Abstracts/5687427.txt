A power system operation can be optimized on the deterministic, probability, interval uncertainty and fuzzy level. A new approach to the optimization of power system operation on the interval uncertainty level has been proposed. The characteristics of power generation units, power demand, deviations of active power of power plants and water discharges of hydro power plants are considered as interval uncertainty factors. The objective of the optimization task is to minimize the maximum value of the risk caused by the uncertainty of information. The mathematical models for minimax optimization of short-term hydro-thermal scheduling problem and a new solution method called "method of planned characteristics" are presented in this paper. The scheduling problem can be solved using the planned characteristic\Â´s method in two stages: calculation of planned characteristics for the uncertainty factors, solving of the deterministic equivalent of the min-max problem. In addition the problem of unit commitment under uncertainty conditions and some problems of computation are discussed.

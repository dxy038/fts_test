A bidirectional-power-flow three-phase rectifier with high-frequency isolation and all-digital control, based on the matrix converter topology, is analyzed in this paper. The selected topology consists of a bidirectional three-phase-to-single-phase reduced matrix converter with power-factor correction and a bidirectional active rectifier. The inclusion of the isolation transformer at the switching frequency permits the reduction of volume and weight. By synchronizing the commutation of both converters and adding a saturable inductor and a blocking capacitor it is possible to achieve soft commutation for most of the semiconductor elements. An all-digital control based on a digital-signal-processor and a field-programmable gate array was used to implement space-vector modulation and output current regulation. This power converter is intended to feed the lowenergy correction magnet of a particle accelerator. Experimental results of a 1.5-kW 20-kHz prototype are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed topology.

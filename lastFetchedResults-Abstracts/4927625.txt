The EIDI (Enhanced Intelligent Database Interface) integrates artificial intelligence and database systems where the AI system can access one or more databases on one or more remote database management systems (DBMSs). The interface can support a wide variety of different DBMSs with static as well as dynamic capabilities. SQL is used to communicate with remote DBMSs and the implementation of the EIDI provides a high degree of portability. The query language of the EIDI is a restricted subset of function free Horn clauses, which are translated to SQL. Results from the EIDI are returned one tuple at a time and the EIDI manages a dynamic cache of result relations to improve efficiency. The objective of this paper is to present firstly a brief overview of the area of AI/DB integration-which worked as the main motivation behind the EIDI, then a discussion on the major features of EIDI and subsequently the architecture and salient components of the EIDI.

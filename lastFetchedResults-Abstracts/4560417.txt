Summary form only given. Seismic data compression is desirable in geophysics for both storage and transmission stages. Wavelet coding methods have generated interesting developments, including a real-time field test trial in the North Sea in 1995. Previous work showed that GenLOT with basic optimization also outperforms state-of-the-art biorthogonal wavelet coders for seismic data. In this paper, we focus on the problem of filter bank optimization using various properties of seismic data. It is often desirable to evaluate the compression performance of a transform on a set of data using a priori objective measures, to reduce extensive testings by selecting only good a priori transforms, and to tailor transforms to the statistical properties of the data set. In the scope of this work, we use symmetric AR models up to order 4 to obtain an average model of the horizontal and vertical signals of a seismic stack section. Rosten et al. (1999), have already shown that order 1 or 2 models give good results in filter bank optimization for non-unitary filter banks, using coding gain optimization. Several other criteria may be used for transform optimization. Following the theory in Tran and Nguyen (1999), we use a weighted combination of C/sub o/=k/sub C/C/sub C/+k/sub S/C/sub S/+k/sub d/C/sub D/ of coding gain, stopband attenuation and DC leakage minimization functions.

In this paper an attempt has been made to propose wind energy system associated with compressed air energy storage (CAES) fed by biogas produced by biomass in order to generate electric energy. The proposed scheme can compensate the weakness of wind energy system alone due to its variable output caused by wind power fluctuations. The proposed scheme can provide equivalent and reliable nergy system compared with plants fed by fossil fuel. CAES plant has technical and economical justifications in some parts of Iran which are flat with considerable wind, which is the main objective of present paper. CAES generally requires natural gases which cause air pollution. Another disadvantage of natural gases is world wide price fluctuations. In this paper an attempt has been made to introduce a method to use biogas generated by biomass instead of natural gas to feed CAES system, in order to compensate the disadvantages of natural gas. In proposed scheme the digestion method is selected to produce biogas from biomass which is more economical compared to other methodes. The results show that due to technical and economical justifications the proposed scheme can serve most part of Iran, and can compete with systems fed by fossil fuel, specially if the Iranian government decides to remove fuel subsidies.

The performance of a scheduling system, in practice, is not evaluated to satisfy a single objective, but to obtain a trade-off schedule regarding multiple objectives. Therefore, in this research, we make use of one of the multiple objective decision-making methods, a global criterion approach, to develop a multi-objective model for solving FMS scheduling problems with consideration of three performance measures, namely minimum mean job flow time, mean job tardiness, and minimum mean machine idle time, simultaneously. In addition, hybrid heuristics, which are a combination of two common local search methods, simulated annealing and tabu search, are also proposed for solving the addressed FMS scheduling problems. The feasibility and adaptability of the proposed heuristics are investigated through experimental results.

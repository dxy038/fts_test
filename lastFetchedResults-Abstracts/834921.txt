A finite element (FEM) study has been made to know the overall structural behaviour of a PSC inner containment (IC) dome having large steam generator (SG) openings with emphasis on the local behaviour of the steel窶田oncrete interfaces near SG openings, under initial prestress transfer. The primary thrust of the work has been in the objective of predicting the possibilities of separation at the steel窶田oncrete interface zones adjacent to the embedded plates of the SG openings. For the FEM analysis, the interface zone has been modeled using gap elements, the properties of which are derived from the results of the past experiments conducted on steel plate窶田oncrete interface specimens. Important observations have been made regarding dome deformation and the stresses with special emphasis on the local behaviour of steel窶田oncrete interfaces at and around SG openings.

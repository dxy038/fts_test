ROMANSE (Road Management System for Europe) is a multi-million pound pilot project based in Southampton. It aims to use advanced transport telematics to develop the city as a model for transport management systems across Europe. ROMANSE achieves this by providing real time traffic and travel information to influence travel behaviour, increase the use of public transport, maximise the efficiency of the transport system and provide high quality information for use in strategic policy decisions. The immediate objective was to establish an effective, multi-modal traffic and travel information centre (TTIC) which would operate in real-time. The TTIC is designed to allow operators to collect and evaluate information about the transport network, and disseminate it to travellers who can then make more effective decisions about the best travel options available

Hospital construction projects take place over several years, from the initial decision to build to their completion and start of service. The owner and his building and civil engineering department have to face many administrative processes and complex techniques. It is the role of the clinical engineer to furnish the new structure with medical equipment, by integrating the constraints of these devices in the building. At each stage of the building process, the clinical engineer must contribute to a specific mission of interface between the building and the equipment, identifying and anticipating constraints, and taking care of the good preparation of the integration of this equipment in existing buildings or buildings yet to be created. If the objective of optimal compatibility between the building and its equipment is not reached, then adaptations will have to be carried out either in progress, or after the completion of work, and will be opposed to the factors of success implemented by the actors.

In this paper, we discuss the optimization of the high frequency performance of a parallel optical transceiver module, which is electrically pluggable, and its test board. A 6-layer printed circuit board (PCB) with embedded high-dielectric constant (Dk) material was built as a substrate for the optical transceiver module. An analysis of the signal integrity (SI) and power integrity (PI) is carried out. The RF signal quality of the differential transmission lines is demonstrated by 3-D electromagnetic simulations and 4-port Network Analyzer measurements in terms of the transmission parameter S21, the reflection parameter S11, and the time-domain reflection TDR. A 4-layer test board with 16 edge-mounted SMA connectors and one 38-pin sliding connector for optical transceiver module was also constructed. Finally, Eye-diagrams of each of the 8 channels comprising the four-channel bidirectional active optical cable (AOC) are measured.

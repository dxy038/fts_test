The objective of this work is to obtain a method to perform the optimization of the a limited set of lineal mechanical actuators that produce the antenna surface deformation. This deformation is used to obtain a reconfigurable compact shaped dual reflector to be placed on the top of a train to access to a satellite communication service. The reconfigurability of this antenna is used to point to the satellite in the elevation plane. To get this objective, we propose a direct method to shape dual reflectors using a ant colony optimization (ACO) with accelerated high-frequency pattern calculation in each iteration. The efficiency of the method is based on a realistic surface description from the actuators positions and an accurate radiation calculations based on MFIE.

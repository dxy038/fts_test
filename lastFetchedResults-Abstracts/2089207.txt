Optimization of directional over-current relay (DOCR) settings is an important problem in electrical engineering. The optimization model of the problem turns out to be non-linear and highly constrained in which two settings namely time dial setting (TDS) and plug setting (PS) of each relay are considered as decision variables; the sum of the operating times of all the primary relays, which are expected to operate in order to clear the faults of their corresponding zones, is considered as an objective function. In the present study, three models are considered namely IEEE 3-bus model, IEEE 4-bus model and IEEE 6-bus model. To solve the problem, we have applied five newly developed versions of differential evolution (DE) called modified DE versions (MDE1, MDE2, MDE3, MDE4, and MDE5). The results are compared with the classical DE algorithm and with five more algorithms available in the literature; the numerical results show that the modified DE algorithms outperforms or perform at par with the other algorithms.

We studied the mineralogy of a perudic Andosol developed on the Dieng Tephra Sequence in central Java, Indonesia. The objective was to confirm the presence and determine the origin and stability of 2:1 and interlayered 2:1 phyllosilicates in well-drained Andosols. This was and still is a debated topic in the literature. Total elemental and selective dissolution, as well as microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses, were performed on the soil samples collected from this site. These analyses confirmed that andic properties were present in the soil samples. The allophane content determined by selective dissolution was 3–4% in the A horizons, and increased to 12–18% in the deeper subsoil horizons. In addition, the clay fraction contained dioctahedral smectite, hydroxy-Al-interlayered 2:1 minerals (HIS), Al-chlorite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, mica, cristobalite and some gibbsite. The silt and sand fractions were rich in plagioclase and pyroxene. The 2:1 minerals (smectite and pyrophyllite), as well as chlorite and kaolinite were of hydrothermal origin and were incorporated in the tephra during volcanic eruption. Besides desilication during dissolution of unstable minerals, Al interlayering of 2:1 layer silicates was most likely the most prominent pedogenic process. Although hydroxy-Al polymeric interlayers would normally stabilize the 2:1 clay phases, the strong weakening, and even disappearance of the characteristic XRD peaks, indicated instability of these minerals in the upper A horizons due to the perudic and intensive leaching conditions.

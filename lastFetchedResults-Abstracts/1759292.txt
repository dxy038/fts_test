Objective
 been documented that parenting a child with attention deficit−hyperactivty disorder (ADHD) can cause family strain, but less is known about the added stress of additional child health diagnoses on levels of strain. This study explores the relationship between family stressors (such as child comorbid conditions) and family resources (such as social support, community charactersitics, and parental health) on parental strain.
s
d the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) to identify children with ADHD and other comorbid mental and physical health conditions (n = 5473). Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to explore the association between parental strain, social support, mother's mental health, and neighborhood amenities within groups of children with ADHD and comorbid conditions.
s
al strain was greatest when ADHD was paired with a conduct disorder, physical disorder, or other mental health disorder. Specifically, parental strain was greatest for children with ADHD plus a comorbid conduct disorder compared with ADHD alone. It was also greater for children with other mental and physical health diagnoses compared with children with ADHD alone. Better mental health of mothers in the sample is related to reduced parental strain. Greater access to social support and neighborhood amenities also are related to reduced parental strain.
sions
r levels of social support and better mental health of parents is associated with decreased strain. Interventions aimed at relieving stress and building strategies to improve mental health can be beneficial for families with children with ADHD and comorbid conditions.

The matrix converter (MXC) is an AC-to-AC direct power conversion system that can generate variable voltage variable frequency output. It is fully regenerative and has sinusoidal input current with unity power factor. MXC is the power conversion system paid widely attention from the viewpoint of environmental harmony. MXC system consists of small input LC filter and nine bidirectional switches. By employing a suitable PWM technique, these switches can control the output voltages and input current. We proposed control method based on two-phase modulation PWM and favorable input current characteristic was confirmed by experimental results. However, a detailed analysis of MXC in the real system was difficult because of complex control method and the voltage error for current commutation. In this paper, the entire system simulation model is created for detailed analysis such as the input current distortion. This model consists of the actual hardware model and the control program model. A detailed analysis concerning the input current distortion and motor drive performances were made through the simulation model.

Two models are formulated that reflect different aspects of satellite and antisatellite (ASAT) operations. Objective functions appropriate to each model are suggested, and allocations of resources that optimize values of these objective functions are determined. The first model, called the cost model, corresponds to the problem of finding the least cost response to a postulated ASAT threat when four options are available. The second model, called the exchange model, corresponds to the problem of finding the strategy that ensures simultaneously the survival of the maximum number of assets and the neutralization of the maximum number of enemy assets, taking into account applicable operational constraints and the adversaryÂ´s efforts to achieve the same goal. The optimizations are carried out with a probabilistic method and applied to the determination of optimal resource allocations in the development and deployment of ballistic missile interceptors

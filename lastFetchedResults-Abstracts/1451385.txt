Modern manufacturing philosophy of just-in-time emphasizes that a job should be completed as close as possible to its due date to avoid inventory cost and loss of customers goodwill. In this paper, the single machine scheduling problem with a common due date, where the objective is to minimize the total earliness and tardiness penalties in the schedule of jobs, is considered. A new genetic algorithm inspired by the philosophy of dynamic programming, where the chromosome and the population lengths are varied from one iteration to another, is proposed.

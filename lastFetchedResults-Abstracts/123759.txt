BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In infertility without sufferring tubal factor, IUI is the choice therapeutic method. Some studies recommended double IUI for every cycle. Since double IUI needs more laboratory materials and more expenses, so in this study it was tried to evaluate pregnancy rate in infertile couples after single and double IUI. METHODS: This clinical trial study was performed on infertile couples referred to Fatemeh Alzahra or Babol Clinic hospital for IUI cycles. Patients divided into two groups. In the first group, 36 hours after HCG injection, IUI was done as a single protocol and in the other group; IUI was done 24 & 72 hours after HCG injection as double protocol. Then data were analyzed by fishers exact test.
FINDINGS: Two hundred and fifteen women participated in our study and their mean age was 26.02±5.5 and the mean (±SD) duration of infertility was 3.73(±2.75) years. In the first group, pregnancy rate was 16.9% and in second group it was 19.6% without any significant difference between two groups. Also, there was no significant difference between groups in pregnancy rate with different etiology of infertility.
CONCLUSION: Some studies recommended that double Di! is more successful than single IUI. But present findings suggest that there is no difference in pregnancy rate between single IUI and double IUI.

This work proposes a new control strategy based on Adaptive Notch Filter applied to a Hybrid Active Var Compensator. The Hybrid Active Var Compensator is composed by a small rate active power filter in series with a capacitor bank. The objective is improving the behavior of the capacitor bank normally used as reactive power compensator. Under nonsinusoidal conditions the correct identification of the amount of reactive power needed is not an easy task. The proposed strategy using Adaptive Notch Filters can correctly identify the reactive power flowing through the distribution system even under nonsinusoidal conditions. The technique doesnÂ´t need any synchronization technique like a PLL. The control strategy is analyzed, simulated and practical results are presented in order to prove the effectiveness of the algorithm.

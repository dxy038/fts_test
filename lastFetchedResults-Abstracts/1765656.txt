The objective of this work was to design hierarchical pore structure scaffolds with potential applications in bone tissue regeneration. For that purpose, a bioceramic material such as biphasic calcium phosphate, which consists of a mixture of hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate, was selected. Multilayer pieces (MLP) with hierarchical pore structure were developed employing a new technique that combines gel casting and adding porogens, using multiple tape-casting methods. Pieces with functionally graded porosity were fabricated using porogens with different sizes. The porogens used were Porlat K85 and Porlat K86 with diameters &lt;150 μm and 150–300 μm, respectively. Two types of sintered tapes, with different porosity, no cracking and enough interconnection size were selected. MLP with hierarchical pore structure were designed by the multiple tape-casting method. Interconnected pores whose sizes increase from interior tapes (1.6–3.6 μm) towards exterior tapes (20–51.5 μm) and interpenetration between tapes were achieved. Delamination or cracking were not observed after heat treatment. The flexural strength of pieces was investigated by the three-point bending test. This new combination of methods offers the possibility of manufacturing scaffolds with interconnected pore sizes ranging from 1.6 to 51.5 μm.

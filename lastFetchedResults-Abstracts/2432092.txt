The objective of this study aims to examine two influential factors, userâ€™s perception of playfulness and quality that are incorporated into technology acceptance model (TAM) of the usage of SkypeOut. A total of 211 SkypeOut users collected via SkypeFind engine, were tested using structural equation model (SEM) based on TAM model. The findings indicated that perceived quality is positively related to perceived ease of use, and perceived ease of use is positively related to perceived usefulness and perceived playfulness. Also, perceived playfulness has a positive influence on attitude. Therefore, SkypeOut needs to be provided with more reliable and entertaining ways of communicating, which are, at the same time, easily accessible and convenient to use.

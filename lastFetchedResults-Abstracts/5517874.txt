This work describes an analog reconfiguration technique for acquisition and processing of analog sensor signals that involves field programmable analog arrays (FPAAs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The main objective is to exploit their natural reconfiguration capabilities that allow the increase of the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) resolution and an adaptive post processing of the digital signal. This work is completed by the demonstration of this technique with an NTC temperature sensor signal, increasing the ADC resolution. The proposed system acquires the analog signal with filtering, amplifications and ADC being performed on the FPAA, while dynamically tuning the analog conditioning on the FPAA; after that, the FPGA processes the digital signal and delivers the final result to the end user, also involving the use of an embedded PicoBlaze.

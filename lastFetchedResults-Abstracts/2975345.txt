Studies a scheduling problem for a pull manufacturing system, with finite inventory/backlog space and constant demand rate. The system is a single machine, multi part-type one, and the control objective is that of minimizing an infinite horizon undiscounted cost in the inventory and backlog level, and demand losses. No set-up times and costs are considered. The analysis is made in the framework of continuous flow approximation. The optimal policy is derived analytically and compared with the solution of an infinite buffer capacity problem

Learning a foreign language, like other fields, undergoes forgetting. Paying attention to forgetting in foreign language writing and speaking abilities is more important since these two realms indicate the learner's competence and performance.
This study aimed to investigate the phenomenon of forgetting of Iranian Language learners (French) at the level of language production. To achieve this objective, descriptive and analytical methods were used for reviewing the related theories of forgetting, memory and data storage. In the field study, forgetting of concrete and abstract words between two sexes and two age groups (25-30, 31- 40) was measured by two different tests. According to the results, forgetting depends on the type of words. On this basis, abstract words are more frequently forgotten. The obtained data demonstrated that age and sex have a significant impact on forgetting words. More precisely, these factors affect forgetting, when words appear in a context. So in the age group of 25-30 years, forgetting of abstract words is significant among men and 1.82% more in comparison with women. While in the age group of 31- 40 years, the forgetting degree of women is 2.5% more.

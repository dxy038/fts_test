This paper presents new results on the objective evaluation of stereoscopic video quality. A balance between the scores provided by classical objective algorithms and the disparity information of the reference video is found. The performance of the proposed technique was verified using statistical metrics (correlation coefficients and root mean square error) that compare the scores provided by the objective algorithms and the subjective results provided by the NAMA3DS1-COSPAD1 stereoscopic video quality database. The obtained results suggest a significant improvement on the performance of the objective algorithms for the proposed technique.

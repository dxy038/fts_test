This paper deals with power factor compensation system design by probabilistic criteria. The compensator is considered as an assembly consisting of switchable units, thus assuming that a single unit is not sufficient to ensure satisfactory power factor correction and/or compliance with harmonic-limiting standards for all the operating conditions of the load. The expected cost of the compensator (including energy costs, utility penalties and installation mortgage) is selected as the objective function for optimum design. An analytical expression of the objective function, based on measurement results statistics, is obtained

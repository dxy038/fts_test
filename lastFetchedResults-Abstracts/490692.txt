Background and Objective: By aging, some functions in the nervous system like spatial
memory are subject to reduction. It is shown that short time physical activity can improve
memory but there is no comprehensive study on the effect of long term exercise in this regard.
So in the present experiment, we tried to clarify the effect of regular long term physical activity
on spatial memory and learning of young and middle aged male Wistar rats.
Materials and Methods: Thirty six 3 months old rats were allocated randomly to 4 equal
groups. Experimental groups were exercised by treadmill 22m/min for one hour 6 days per
week, for 3 and 9 months. By termination of training period, spatial memory of rats was tested
using Morris water maze.
Results: Our results indicated that physical activity increased spatial memory significantly
(P<0.05) in young rats (6 months old) but not in middle age. Nonetheless, spatial memory of
middle aged rats was significantly higher than young ones in both groups (P<0.05).
Conclusion: This study suggests that spatial memory and learning increase via regular
exercise in young rat's. With progression of age up to 12 months of old (middle age) memory
faces a further improvement while regular exercises could not induced positive effect on
learning. Therefore, spatial memory possibly reached to optimal level in middle aged male rats.

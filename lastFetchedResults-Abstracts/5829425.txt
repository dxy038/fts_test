An approach for tracing, representation, and recognition of a handwritten numeral in an offline environment is presented. A 2D spatial representation of a numeral is first transformed into a 3D spatiotemporal representation by identifying the tracing sequence based on a set of heuristic rules acting as transformation operators. Given the dynamic information of the tracing sequence, a multiresolution critical-point segmentation method is proposed to extract local feature points, at varying degrees of scale and coarseness. A neural network architecture, the hierarchically self-organizing learning (HSOL) network (S. Lee, J.C. Pan, 1989), especially for handwritten numeral recognition, is presented. Experimental results based on a bidirectional HSOL network indicated that the method is robust in terms of variations, deformations, and corruption, achieving about 99% recognition rate for the test patterns

Background: Osteoporosis is a chronic disease characterized by a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and corruption of the microarchitectural structure of bone tissue.
Objective: It was investigated whether methylprednisolone had a favorable effect on osteoporotic bone tissue in Oophorectomy induced osteoporotic rats whose endogenous adrenaline levels are suppressed with metyrosine.
Materials and Methods: Bone Mineral Density, number of osteoblast-osteoclast, bone osteocalcin levels and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) measurements were performed. Obtained results were compared with that of alendronate.
Results: Oophorectomy induced osteoporosis was exacerbated by methylprednisolone. Alentronate prevented ovariectomised induced osteoporosis, but it couldn’t prevent methylprednisolone +ovariectomised induced osteoporosis in rats.
Conclusion: Combined treatment with methylprednisolon and metyrosine was the best treatment for preventing osteoporosis but metyrosine alone couldn’t prevent osteoporosis in ovariectomised rats.

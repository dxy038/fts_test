Unlike most other systems in which the emergency core cooling (ECC) water is injected into the cold-legs, the Advanced Power Reactor (APR) 1400 employs a concept of a direct vessel injection (DVI) to reduce the bypass effects of the ECC water via a break during a design basis LOCA. For this, the DVI piping is designed so that the ECC water taken from an in-containment refueling storage tank (IRWST) directly flows into the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) down-comer. The main objective of this paper is to provide the MELCOR 1.8.4 sensitivity analysis results on the evolution of the severe accidents that can be expected during the APR 1400 LOCA and the insights gained from the analysis. For this purpose, the present sensitivity analysis mainly focuses on: (1) the impact of the foregoing engineering features (i.e., DVI and IRWST) in mitigating a severe core degradation and (2) the APR 1400-specific impacts of different break locations and sizes, and an operation of the containment spray systems on the timings of the key thermal-hydraulic responses, the severe degradation of the core, and the evolution of the core materials. No significant accident management strategy that plays a great role in mitigating a further progression of severe accidents has been taken into account in the present analysis. As a result, the present analysis results can be taken as the technical basis for assessing the effectiveness of a potential severe accident management.

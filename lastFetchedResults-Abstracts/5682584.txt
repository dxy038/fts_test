Presents an objective and quantitative study of several thresholding techniques. For this study, three sets of test images to simulate various real situations have been designed. The accuracy of object feature measurement is used to assess the performance. The authors not only provide an insight into these techniques but also show the usefulness of synthetic images and ultimate measurement accuracy in segmentation evaluation and comparison

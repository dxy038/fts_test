The European community lists cocoa among the products associated with major salmonellosis outbreaks in humans. Though cocoa products are not the only ingredients that may introduce Salmonella into chocolate, they have been implicated as the most prominent potential source of some outbreaks. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of Salmonella, Escherichia coli and the level of total coliforms throughout the four different steps of cocoa pre-processing. The presence of Salmonella was detected in only one of the 119 samples analyzed â€“ a sample of stored beans. Contamination by total coliforms and E. coli was highest during drying and storage, with percentages of up to 100% and 89% of positive samples. The environment, including the presence of vectors, intense handling and storage conditions appear to be the main critical points during pre-processing of cocoa contributing to contamination by these enteropathogens.

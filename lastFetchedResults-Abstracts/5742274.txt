This paper presents a scheme for supervisory control of decentralized stand-alone PV systems. The control is designed to maintain the DC bus regulated independently of solar irradiation, battery charge and load demands. In order to achieve this objective we propose an overall power management strategy to control power flows among PV arrays, battery bank, and inverter. Experimental results for a 480VA converter are provided to validate the proposed supervisory system.

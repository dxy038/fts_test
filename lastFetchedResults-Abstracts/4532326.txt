Proper execution of a successful hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) design for transportation applications requires optimal sizing of key mechanical, electrical, and power electronic components. An active program for HEV development is described. The basic objective of an HEV design is to match the performance of a standard automobile while drastically reducing emissions. Constraints imposed while optimizing critical component selection are: vehicle range, acceleration, maximum speed, total emissions, cost, recharging, and driveability. A design example, based on readily available technology, is examined. It is reasonable to expect HEVs with good performance and order-of-magnitude emissions reductions

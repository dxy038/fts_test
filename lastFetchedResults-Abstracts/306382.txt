Objective: To describe trace metal changes in a 74-year-old male patient with mesenteric fibrosis and a small bowel fistula who was maintained on total parenteral nutrition in the hospital and at home.
Methods: Trace elements which included chromium and selenium were monitored over a 14-month period as part of his nutrient follow-up.
Results: Serum chromium reached levels >21-fold the upper reference range, and serum selenium, in contrast, was <0.5 the lower reference range. Plasma aluminum was also measured, and found to be nearly twice the upper reference range, although the patient had normal renal function. We measured the aluminum content of the parenteral nutrients and additives, and found that replacement of calcium gluconate by calcium chloride helped to reduce the aluminum content in the final parenteral solution by 34%. Aluminum and chromium contaminants found in parenteral solutions need to be reduced or removed to avoid toxic accumulation.
Conclusion: This study illustrates the importance of adequately adjusting essential trace elements, and monitoring contaminants in parenteral fluids in an individual on total parenteral nutrition.

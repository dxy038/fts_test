The objective of this research is to develop nonlinear constitutive models for performance evaluation of masonry
members on the basis of continuum model and fixed smeared crack approach. The finite element program called
"WCOMD", which has basically been developed for modeling and analyzing the reinforced concrete, is used as
the basis for modeling and analyzing in this paper. Constitutive laws and yield criteria according to the available
experimental results on masonry panels are improved, so that it would have the capability of modeling nonlinear
anisotropic behavior of masonry. The post-cracking behavior of masonry in direction normal to the crack
(tension softening) is calculated according to crack band theory and in terms of fracture energy and element size
in finite element. Also, the effect of cracking on compression behavior of masonry is considered on the basis of
compression field theory. The validity of behavior models and analysis methods is measured via analyzing
available experimental results in field of masonry panels and masonry walls.

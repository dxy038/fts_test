OBJECTIVE: To identify causes and risk factors of maternal mortality.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Obstetrics and Gynaecology Unit-II, Liaquat University Hospital, Hyderabad â€“ Pakistan, from January 2006 to December 2007.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data were retrieved from hospital record to evaluate the causes and risk factors of maternal mortality in our setup.
RESULTS: The maternal mortality rate was 1122.86/100,000 births (69/6145). The identifiable factors were haemorrhage and sepsis both in 28.98% cases followed by eclampsia in 21.74% cases. Majority (81.16%) of the cases was unbooked. Most (52.17%) women were of more than
35 years age and 56.52% women were grandmultiparous.
CONCLUSION: Obstetrical haemorrhage and sepsis are still major causes of maternal death. Most of these deaths are preventable by providing quality care and by developing effective health care infrastructure.

The objective of this paper is to compare the time specification performance among four state feedback tracking controller design methods and determine which control method delivers better performance for linear MIMO systems. The four controller design methods are Pole Placement method, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), an Eigenvalue Assignment method for shaping the output response and a method based on Moore´s Eigenstructure Assignment for controlling the linearized model of MIMO systems. In the Pole Placement method, some components overshoot, the convergence is slow and does not provide robust solution. LQR assures stability robustness with full state feedback but does not provide the flexibility of assigning eigenvalues and eigenvectors in placing closed loop structure. Eigenvalue Assignment is used to regulate the output response of minimum phase linear multivariable square plants. A method based on Moore´s Eigenstructure Assignment provides nonovershooting and fast response.

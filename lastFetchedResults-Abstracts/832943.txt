In this paper, a bit-array representation method for structural topology optimization using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is implemented. The importance of structural connectivity in a design is further emphasized by considering the total number of connected objects of each individual explicitly in an equality constraint function. To evaluate the constrained objective function, Debâ€™s constraint handling approach is further developed to ensure that feasible individuals are always better than infeasible ones in the population to improve the efficiency of the GA. A violation penalty method is proposed to drive the GA search towards the topologies with higher structural performance, less unusable material and fewer separate objects in the design domain. An identical initialization method is also proposed to improve the GA performance in dealing with problems with long narrow design domains. Numerical results of structural topology optimization problems of minimum weight and minimum compliance designs show the success of this bit-array representation method and suggest that the GA performance can be significantly improved by handling the design connectivity properly.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate individual differences and intra-individual changes of subjective preference of simulated sound field judged by listeners in changing subsequent reverberation timeTsub using a vocal source. A great deal of effort has been made studying subjective preferences by using music or speech. Subjective preference tests were conducted by changing Tsub, which is one of the four orthogonal-objective parameters of sound field.

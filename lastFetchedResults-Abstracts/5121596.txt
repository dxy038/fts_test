The objective of this research is to propose a new data conjugate sub carrier mapping technique that combines ICI self cancellation method using data allocation in space-time-frequency block codes (STFBC) MIMO-OFDM system. It aims to achieve maximum diversity order and to compensate integrated effect of FO for ICI reduction in the system. Using theoretical derivation of the Common Phase Error (CPE), ICI and Carrier to Interference Ratio (CIR), a simulation model is then being used to compare with data conjugate adjacent method. The results show that the ICI contained in the received signals can be effectively reduced using the propose data conjugate method. Thus, the proposed method outperforms the adjacent method by approximately reducing the ICI at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and CIR.

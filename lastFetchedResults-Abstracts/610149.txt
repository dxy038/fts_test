In this paper a new model for optimal investment in advanced manufacturing machines is proposed, using fuzzy linear programming. In the first step decision-makers determine the strategic objectives of the company and their minimum acceptable achievement levels, using fuzzy numbers. Thereafter, feasible alternatives and their degree of influence to the achievement of each objective are concluded in the form of linguistic variables. To construct the model, the degree of influence of each alternative in the achievement of the objectives are considered as technological coefficients, and the minimum level of acceptance of objectives are considered as constraints (right hand side variables). Furthermore, the mutually exclusive alternatives, the interaction between machines and the constraint of limited investment of budget are included in the model. The aim of the model is to determine the number of machines that needs to be purchased in order to maximize the present value of investment. The calculation of net present value is executed based on discount cash flow, inflation rate, interest rate, revenue and costs of each machine on a fuzzy environment. Finally by presenting an empirical illustration, the performance of this model is clarified.

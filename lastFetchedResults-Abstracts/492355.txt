There are diffrent methods for estimating runoff from rainfall in catchments. One of this methods is using hydrological models. Hydrological models allow the simulating rainfall-runoff process in noavailable data watersheds (catchments) with low cost and time. The AWBM model that developed by Walter Boughton, is one of this kinds of models that can estimate runoff from daily or hourly rainfall. Application of the model for daily results is using in water supply and for hourly result is using in flood control. in this model storage capacity is divided into three storage parametes (CI, C2, C3). It can estimate the related partial areas (Al, A2, A3) and simulate the runoff from partial areas using daily rainfall, discharge and evatranspiration with optimizing the parameters.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the variable source area AWBM model in some Fars province catchments. The analysis was carried out using data from selected catchments' namely Kol, Maharloo, Zohre and Mond, in Fars pronince. The daily rainfall, runoff and evatranspiration selected with about 20 years duration. Daily rainfall regionalized with using TPSS method and daily discharge converted to spasial discharge. The correlation cofficient between estimated and observed runoff was evalutated by optimizing the parameters. The results showed that the AWBM model, gives acceptable results and have adequate capability for designing .

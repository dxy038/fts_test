Due to high efficiency, compactness, and less generated noise of permanent magnet synchronous motors, they have received a lot of attention for traction applications in land, sea, and undersea vehicles. In this paper, a new digital deadbeat controller is designed, implemented, and applied to a permanent magnet synchronous machine. The objective of the controller is to achieve a deadbeat dynamic response for the speed of the machine. The analysis of the controller shows that it adjusts the current and voltage of the machine with two and four sampling periods, respectively. A robust simple sensorless method is used to estimate the position and velocity of the rotor. The experimental results of a laboratory prototype is presented, which show the viability of the proposed controller for this machine.

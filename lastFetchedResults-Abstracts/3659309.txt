In this paper, we consider training-based symbol timing synchronization for continuous phase modulation over channels subject to flat, Rayleigh fading. A high signal-to-noise-ratio maximum-likelihood estimator based on a simplified channel correlation model is derived. The main objective is to reduce algorithm complexity to a single-dimensional search on the delay parameter, similar to that of the static-channel (slow fading) estimator. The asymptotic behavior of the algorithm is evaluated, and comparisons are made with the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the problem. Simulation results demonstrate highly improved performance over the conventional, static-channel delay estimator.

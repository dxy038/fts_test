Purpose: The objective of this research is to do a comparative citation analysis of Iranian and Turkish inventor's patents to determine the technological effectiveness of their registered inventions in US Patent and Trademark & European Patent Office.
Methodology: Using citation analysis method, firstly, Iranian and Turkish inventor's patents were retrieved from the US Patent and Trademark & European Patent Office, and then these patents were studied. The gathered data were analyzed using descriptive statistics via Excel.
Findings: Findings show that Iranian and Turkish inventors registered 63 and 619 patents in US Patent and Trademark & European Patent Office from 1988 to 2008 using IR and TR as a suffix represented Iran and Turkey. 69.5 percent of citations were to backward resources of Iranian inventors and 87.4 percent of citations to backward resources of Turkish inventors were patent resource, 30.50 percent of citations to backward resources of Iranian inventors and 12.60 percent of citations to backward resource of Turkish inventors were Non-Patent Resource (NPR), in general. The total number of Turkish inventors' forward citations was 1429 in the period of doing this research and the highest Forward citation of Turkish inventors were 257 citations in subject class B (operation process). In contrast, the total number of Iranian inventors' forward citation was 376 citations. The highest Forward citation of Iranian inventor's was 119 citations in subject class E (stable structures).
Conclusion: The most collaboration among Iranian and Turkish inventors' were 26.98 percent in subject class C (Chemistry) and 16.32 percent in subject class A (human necessities), respectively.

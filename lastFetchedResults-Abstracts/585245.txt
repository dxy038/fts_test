Background: Evaluating the tuberculosis (TB) status of the
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) member countries
relation to goal 6-c of the third millennium, which includes that
TB incidence, prevalence, and death rates should be halved by
2015, compared with their level in 1990.
Methods: In 2009, we have critically reviewed the countriesâ€™
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) reports and extracted the
data from the surveillance system and published and unpublished
data. The main stakeholders, from both governmental and
international organizations in the country have been visited and
interviewed by the research team as part of the data validation
process.
Results: The TB incidence is very heterogeneous among ECO
countries, which differ from 21.7 in Iran to 230.7 per 100,000
in Tajikistan. TB incidence (per 100,000) is more than 100 in six
countries and is from 50 to 100 in two countries and is less than 30
in two countries. Only in two countries the crude death rate (CDR)
is higher than 70%. In seven countries the death rate is higher
than 10 per 100,000. Two countries are among the 20 top world
countries with the highest tuberculosis burden.
Conclusion: There are some signs and signals indicating the bad
condition of an ECO member including: incidence of more than
50 per 100000, CDR of less than 70%, death rate more than 10 per
100,000, and rating two member countries among 20 top countries
with the highest burden in the world. Iran and Turkey could achieve
MDGs by 2015, but if other countries do not prepare urgent
intervention programs, they will not be able to fulfill the goals.

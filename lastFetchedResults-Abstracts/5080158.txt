In several multi-sensor temperature control applications the objective is to regulate the difference between the measurements while leaving wider tolerance to their absolute value. In this short note, the analysis of the uncertainty of the difference between two measurements due to sensor calibration error is analyzed. It is shown how a calibration by comparison method, which can be performed with out requesting expert calibration assistantship, can result in an important uncertainty reduction.

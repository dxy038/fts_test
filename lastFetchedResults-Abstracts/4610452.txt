Hello flood attack has long been a problem in ad-hoc and wireless networks during data routing. Although numerous solutions have been proposed, they all have drawbacks. The main reason is that formal modeling techniques have not been employed to confirm whether the solutions are immune from DoS attacks. We have earlier shown how formal modeling can be utilized efficiently to detect the vulnerabilities of existing routing protocols against DoS attacks. In this paper we propose a new protocol, RAEED (Robust formally Analysed protocol for wirEless sEnsor networks Deployment), which is able to address the problem of Hello flood attacks. Using formal modeling we prove that RAEED avoids these types of attack. Finally computer simulations were carried out to support our findings. RAEED employs an improved bidirectional verification and the key exchange characteristics of the INSENS and the LEAP. RAEED preserves the security and reduces traffic. The improvements in RAEED were the less number of messages exchanged, less percentage of messages lost and reduction in time to complete key setup phase.

This paper presents a new mathematical model for the vehicle routing problem in the context of e-commerce, considering multiple types of products, vehicles, transport conditions and time windows. The main new idea is to assure the compatibility between product type and vehicle in order to satisfy transport conditions required. This problem can be defined as a Load-Specific problem. The main objective is to gain customer satisfaction by providing the right demand on time and on a good stat. To solve this model, new instances are generated and solved using Cplex 12.2.

Efficient radio resource management and Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee are very important aspects in order to provide a good service in LTE Networks. Although the base station performs a smart scheduling scheme for resource allocation, the expected result could be affected due to interference, specially in femtocell scenarios. This article investigates the problem of interference in femtocell networks in LTE. The proposed method achieves inter-cell interference mitigation though a dynamic power self-control performed at each femtocell. In this paper we use the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to obtain the optimum power value which assures a trade-off between Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) and bit-rate efficiency. The main objective of our work is to optimize the sub-bands in order to decrease the interference and maintain the throughput at the same time. The performance evaluation is conducted in terms of throughput, Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) and SINR.

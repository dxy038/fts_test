The main purpose of this study was to study the effect of epistemological beliefs on knowledge sharing behavior and its comparison among graduate students. To achieve this objective, a descriptive- correlation research method was used. 357 graduate students were selected in four groups of Humanities, Science, Technology & Engineering, Agriculture and Natural Resources at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. The required data were gathered through knowledge sharing and epistemological beliefs questionnaires. According to the research findings, the situation of knowledge sharing (willingness, attitude and behavior) is not at a desirable level among graduate students. Also, the study findings showed that from the studentâ€™s viewpoint, knowledge is too simple, clear and depended references. Furthermore, the results of the comparison of the epistemological beliefs and knowledge sharing among graduate students in terms of degree, field of study, gender and year of entry showed that there is no significant difference. Moreover, according to the results of the hierarchical regression analysis, individual beliefs about certainty of knowledge and fixed ability learning can predict sharing more than simplicity of knowledge and quick learning.

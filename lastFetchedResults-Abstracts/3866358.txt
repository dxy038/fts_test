Advanced control strategies and modern consulting provide new challenges for the classical problem of bumpless transfer. It can, for example, be necessary to transfer between an only approximately known existing analog controller and a new digital or adaptive controller without accessing any states. Transfer ought to be bidirectional and not presuppose steady state, so that an immediate back-transfer is possible if the new controller should drive the plant unstable. We present a scheme that meets these requirements. By casting the problem of bidirectional transfer into an associated tracking control problem, systematic analysis and design procedures from control theory can be applied. The associated control problem also has a correspondence to the design of antiwindup controllers. The paper includes laboratory and industrial applications

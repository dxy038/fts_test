The interoperability among databases is of increasing interest. Understanding the real semantics of data is essential in schema integration in fully integrated heterogeneous database systems as well as in the interoperability of federated database systems. It has been pointed out that success in schema integration depends on understanding the semantics of the schema components (for example, attributes, relations, entity sets, relationship sets), and the ability to capture and reason with the semantics. Traditionally, the determination of attribute relationships is an `artcraft workÂ´, which is done manually by database administrators (DBAs). The objective of this paper is to determine attribute relationships semi-automatically

The main objective of this research was to study fuel bed combustion dynamics of a BioGrate boiler with a mechanistic model. First, the fuel specific pyrolysis reaction rates were experimentally determined for the model. Second, the model was validated and finally, it was used to investigate the effects of the primary air flows on drying, pyrolysis and char consumption rates occurring inside the fuel bed. The research results are presented and the role of the dynamic behavior of the reactions on the biomass combustion process discussed.

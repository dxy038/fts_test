The first two parts of this series have developed the analysis of solid rotor machines for both flat and cylindrical models of infinite length. 1,2 The objective of this part is to present a representation of a finite length, flat model so that a correction for end effects may be incorporated in the operational impedance expressions. The correction presented gives a first-order approximation for this effect. The field analysis considering finite length is also of value in calculating air gap and rotor body spatial distributions of field quantities.

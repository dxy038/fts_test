The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of anthracofibrosis and the relationship between bronchial anthracofibrosis (BAF) and tuberculosis during autopsy in the Iranian Legal Medicine Organization (LMO). In this cross-sectional study, 385 subjects who had died from 2007 to 2010 were examined. A questionnaire having information such as the deceased's age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status and occupation was filled out for each subject. Subjects in whom autopsied lungs revealed definite obligation, edema, bronchial stricture and dark pigmentation within mucosa were considered to have anthracofibrosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis was considered with typical granulomatous in bronchial biopsy or smear positive. During the 4-year period, we evaluated 385 cases, 48(12.5%) of whom had BAF. Of these, 60.4% were female. Mean age of subjects with anthracofibrosis was 67.08Â±8.4 yr. Pulmonary tuberculosis was demonstrated in 24 (50%) of cases with BAF. According to bronchi features, the anatomical distribution of BAF in 60.4% cases was multiple. Anthracofibrosis more commonly occurred in right middle lobe bronchus (47.92%). This study revealed a significant correlation between BAF and pulmonary tuberculosis (P=0.001). So, BAF is one of the infrequent symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis. In patients with anthracofibrosis and pulmonary symptoms, TB would be taken into consideration.

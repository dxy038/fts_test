Background: The sperm count and function may be affected by karyotype abnormalities or microdeletion in Y chromosome. These genetic abnormalities can probably transmit to the children.
Objective: In this study, we tried to determine the frequency of karyotype abnormalities and Y chromosome microdeletions in severe oligospermic or azoospermic men who fathered sons by ICSI.
Materials and Methods: This study comprised of fathers who had at least a son with ICSI due to severe oligospermia or azoospermia. General examinations were done and blood sample were obtained for karyotype and Y chromosome studies.
Results: The total of 60 fathers was evaluated along with their 70 sons. The mean duration of infertility was 8.7 years and the sons were 2.4 years in average at the time of examination. The mean age of neonates at the time of delivery was 33 weeks; 42.9% were delivered prematurely; and 40.5% of them were twins. 8.6% of the sons had hypospadiasis and 7.1% had UDT. Most of the side effects were due to prematurity. In total 6 of fathers had karyotype anomaly, meanwhile 4 of their sons had also karyotype anomaly. Only one son had karyotype anomaly without affected father. No case of Y chromosome microdeletion was found in the fathers.
Conclusion: Y chromosome microdeletion is not prevalent in fathers with successful ICSI and it is not necessary to be analyzed before ICSI performance. Karyotype anomaly may transmit to the sons. All together ICSI is reliable and safe. Most of the complications are the result of premature delivery.

The interest in the development towards intelligent microgrids which use renewable energy as primary sources has significantly increased in the last two years. The present paper examines and proposes a new digital control solution for bidirectional DC-DC converters. In order to control the converter in both directions the novel algorithm uses the current that charges and discharges the storage devices. The study treats and solves problems related to the battery charging algorithms and the power flow direction change.

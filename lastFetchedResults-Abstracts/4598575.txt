As the technology of augmented reality (AR) is getting matured, the application of AR to various fields, especially in a creative manner, become an attractive research topic. The objective of this research is to propose a method for a halftone-based hidden marker for AR tracking system under infrared (IR)detection. Our design method is based on the ordered dithering and the characteristic of carbon black under IR. It provides AR system a novel solution for the marker design, which can make the human-computer interface become much more natural. The results show that the AR marker is invisible by human eyes, but appears under IR. It has many potential value-added applications for future AR systems.

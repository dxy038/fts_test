Objective
Systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal hematological nonâ€“mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD) is a distinct entity that was defined by World Health Organization. Systemic mastocytosis with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is frequently seen among SM-AHNMD. However, the pathogenesis or origin of neoplastic mast cells has not been fully elucidated in this category of diseases.
Methods

We examined KIT mutation, chimeric status, and AML1/ETO mRNA concerning mast cells and immature hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow in a patient with systemic mastocytosis with AML1/ETO-positive AML following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Results

Mast cells of the patient displayed KIT D816Y mutation, and were derived from the recipient. In contrast, immature hematopoietic cells as defined by CD34+ CD117+ were derived from the donor, which did not possess detectable KIT D816Y mutation. The ratio of AML1/ETO to 18S rRNA of the mast cells was 7.53, whereas that of immature hematopoietic cells was 1.67.
Conclusions

In a patient with SM-AHNMD who underwent allogeneic HSCT, the major source of the detectable AML1/ETO mRNA of the bone marrow after transplantation was neoplastic mast cells with KIT mutation, which were thought to be derived from CD34+ CD117+ immature leukemic cells of the recipient.

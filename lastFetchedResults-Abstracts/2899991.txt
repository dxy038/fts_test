The paper presents objective and subjective evaluation of AAC audio codec realizations in relation to bit rate and resolution. Chosen audio material was coded and decoded using implementation provided by four different vendors and compared to the original audio clips by using EAQUAL software. Two realizations with highest scores were then compared using subjective A/B/X listening test. The different bitrates of the best evaluated codec were compared using A/B/X listening test as well. Finally, the optimal choices of codec and of bitrate were made both on subjective quality of the codecs and on other important objective parameters such as processor time and memory occupation of ARM architecture realizations.

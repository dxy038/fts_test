In this paper a Multi-objective Honey Bee
Mating Optimization (MOHBMO) technique is applied to
damp power system oscillation by tuning the Power
System Stabilizer (PSS) parameters. Selecting the
parameters of PSS which simultaneously stabilize system
oscillations is converted to a simple optimization problem
which is solved by a HBMO. In the proposed syndicate
tuning technique, two performances indicates as ITAE
and FD are computed for the stability and performance at
each of the given set of operating conditions of the
system simultaneously, which leads to use multi objective
technique. This newly proposed controller is more
efficient because it cope with oscillations and different
operating points. The effectiveness of proposed controller
is tested in two case studies. The first one is single
machine infinite bus system which is compared with
Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) and
robust PSS that is tuned by Genetic Algorithm (GA). The
second case study is the Two Area Four Machine
(TAFM) system of Kundur in comparison with the
SPEA, GA and Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT)
based tuned PSS under different load conditions. Also in
this case the placement of PSSs is presented. Simulation
results show the effectiveness of the proposed PSS to
damp the oscillation of multi-machine system and work
effectively under variable loading and fault conditions.

Objective
We examined the role of selenium (Se) status in psoriasis and its relation to the severity and duration of the disease.
Methods
The study was conducted among 30 patients with psoriasis of less than 10 mo duration (study group 1, sg 1) and 30 with psoriasis of more than 3 y duration (study group 2, sg 2). Control groups (cg) consisted of 30 patients with short periods of skin disorders other than psoriasis and 24 healthy volunteers (cg 1 and cg 2, respectively). Plasma Se concentration and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in plasma and erythrocytes were measured to determine Se status.
Results
Plasma Se (μg/L) levels were 47.11 ± 11.61 in sg 1, 38.69 ± 13.22 in sg 2, 43.53 ± 11.73 in cg 1, and 48.71 ± 9.39 in cg 2; plasma GSH-Px (U/mL) levels, were 0.15 ± 0.04, 0.14 ± 0.04, 0.16 ± 0.04, and 0.18 ± 0.03, respectively; and erythrocyte GSH-Px (U/g of hemoglobin) levels were 13.97 ± 4.27, 13.16 ± 3.85, 14.25 ± 3.84, and 14.35 ± 3.35, respectively. Erythrocyte GSH-Px correlated inversely to severity of psoriasis in sg 2 (r = −0.37, P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Se status is depressed and related to the severity of the disease only in patients with psoriasis lasting more than 3 y.

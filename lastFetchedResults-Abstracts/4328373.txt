To improve the global efficiency of electric vehicle, for a certain driving cycle electric motor can be designed from the view of efficiency map so that the motor can often work within the maximum efficiency area. In this paper, the formulas on loss balance of electric motor are proposed to indicate the location of maximum efficiency area on the efficiency map. These formulas are used in multi-objective optimization procedure to design motor dimensions. Also within limited volume, the impact on efficiency map of different combinations of slot and pole numbers is discussed.

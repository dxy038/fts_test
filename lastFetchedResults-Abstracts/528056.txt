Power consumption and accuracy are main aspects to be taken into account in the movement executed by high performance robots. The first aspect is important from the economical point of view, while the second is requested to satisfy technical specifications. Aiming at increasing the robot performance, a strategy that maximizes the manipulator accuracy and minimizes the mechanical power consumption is considered in this work. The end-effector is constrained to follow a predefined path during the optimal task positioning. The proposed strategy defines a relation between mechanical power and manipulability as a key element of the manipulator analysis, establishing a performance index for a rigid body transformation. This transformation is used to compute the optimal task positioning through the optimization of a multicriteria objective function. Numerical simulations regarding a serial robot manipulator demonstrate the viability of the proposed meth-odology.

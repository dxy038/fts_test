The paper considers optimum frame alignment patterns of given length and Hamming distance. After reviewing previous work, we proceed to specify, with supporting analysis, good patterns for the overlap region. For applications where this criterion is insufficient, an analysis of the search mode is also presented. This leads to a study of the choice of optimum pattern for a system as a whole, where patterns are selected against a new objective measure. By way of example, reference is made to CCITT specifications on frame alignment.

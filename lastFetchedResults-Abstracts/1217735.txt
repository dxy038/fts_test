Background and Objective: Cesarean section is the most common surgeries in women. Hemodynamic changes after cesarean can improve maternal recovery and quick contact between mother and infant delay. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of music therapy on patients' blood pressure and pulse undergoing caesarean section surgery.
Materials and Method: In this experimental study, 60 patients underwent elective caesarean section, in Hakim Jorjani Hospital in Gorgan, Iran enrolled into the study in 2011 by convenience method, and were randomly allocated into two groups (30 in experimental and 30 in control group). Classical music for 15-20 minutes for experimental group was played. Blood pressure changes and pulse time before the intervention, initial surgery, immediately after anesthesia, 15 and 30 minutes after the consciousness and time out recovery were measured and compared for the two groups. The data were analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA and analytical and descriptive statistical tests.  
Results: The findings showed in the two groups, there was a statistical significant difference between the diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.045) and pulse changes (P = 0.036). Therefore, in the intervention group, rate of change were less than the control group. Results from systolic blood pressure changes between the two groups did not show any statistical significant difference (P = 0.610).
Conclusion: Results showed that music therapy in women undergoing cesarean section before entering the operating room could alleviate hemodynamic changes of post surgery, thus it can improve patient recovery and early contact of mothers with their infants. Therefore, this therapeutic method is essential to be considered by physicians, nurses and other healthcare givers.

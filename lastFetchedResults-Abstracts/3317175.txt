The objective of the paper is to define a control framework for freeway traffic in which several vehicle classes are explicitly taken into account. The Model Predictive Control approach has been chosen for defining the proposed regulation scheme, in which both ramp metering and speed limitations are adopted as control actions. In the overall control scheme, the two types of control actions (ramp metering and variable speed limits) are determined for each vehicle class. Some simulative results are reported in the paper showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The objective of this workshop is to discuss about the importance of software engineering methods and techniques for service-oriented systems and, vice versa, about the impact that such kinds of open and natually adaptable systems can have on traditional software engineering. We think that discussing about these aspects within the ICSE community could be very beneficial for the progress of the field.

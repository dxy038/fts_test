Capacitive divider systems for tapping electric power from high voltage transmission lines are known to exhibit certain detrimental problems of stability, sub-resonance harmonic oscillations, and ferroresonance when coupled with non-linear loads. On the other hand, they can improve reactive power flow, power factor and contribute to improved harmonic filtration of the larger power system. This paper, therefore, proposes a controlled power flow conditioner as an essential integral component of a capacitive divider system to control power transfer between the high voltage transmission line, capacitive divider system, and the load. The ultimate objective of this conditioner is to mitigate or minimize the attendant problems associated with coupling the system to the load, and optimize the derivable benefits to the larger network

Background: Gender?based violence is recognized as a major
issue on international human rights agenda. Domestic violence
and abuse can happen to anyone, yet the problem is often
overlooked, excused, or denied. This is especially true when abuse
is psychological, rather than physical.
Methods: A community?based cross?sectional study of 6 months
duration was undertaken with the objective of studying the
proportion and different forms of domestic violence, factors
influencing it, and to study treatment?seeking behavior of these
women. The study participants were married women in the age
group 18â€“45 years residing in an urban slum area of Malwani,
Mumbai. Using stratified random sampling, 274 subjects were
selected. House to house visits were paid and they were interviewed
face to face using a pretested semi?structured questionnaire after
obtaining their informed consent. Rapport was established with
the help of a Medical Social Worker. The questionnaire included
information pertaining to the sociodemographic parameters
and experience of domestic violence in the last 1 year and their
treatment?seeking behavior for the same. Utmost care was taken
to maintain privacy and confidentiality. Analysis was done using
SPSS version 17.
Results: The proportion of domestic violence was 36.9%. The
most common form of violence was verbal in 87 (86.1%) followed
by physical in 64 (63.4%).
Conclusion: A significant association was found between domestic
violence and age, education, spousal alcoholism, and duration of
marriage.

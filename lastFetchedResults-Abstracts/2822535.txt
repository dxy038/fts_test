Thailand is a fast growing economic country due to the increasing energy consumption, and it results in increasing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The objective of this study is to analyze the prospect of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction potential of Thai power sector under business as usual (BAU) and Low Carbon Peak CO<sub>2</sub> (LCP) scenario during 2005-2050 using AIM/Enduse model. Results show that natural gas plays an importance role in 2050 in the BAU, however, natural gas is eliminated from the electricity generation system in 2050 in the LCP scenario. Coal and lignite consumption tends to increase during the study period in the LCP scenario due to the penetration of CCS technology with advanced clean technology in 2020. The CO<sub>2</sub> emission in the BAU will be approximately 321 MtCO<sub>2</sub> in 2050. However, the CO<sub>2</sub> emission will be about 160 MtCO<sub>2</sub> in 2050 in the LCP scenario which can mitigate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions around 55% when compared to the BAU. Finally CO<sub>2</sub> abatement cost is also presented.

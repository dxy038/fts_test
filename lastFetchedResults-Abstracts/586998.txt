Introduction: Traditionally, the central library of any university is the main source of scientific data retrieval for respective faculty members. Exploration of rate and pattern of such usage makes it possible to promote the quantity and quality of library services and increasing the efficacy of faculty members' activities.
Objective: To determine the rate of usage of central library resources among the faculty members in Guilan University of Medical Sciences and their satisfaction in this respect.
Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was carried out on 139 faculty members of Guilan University of Medical Sciences who were selected on a stratified-random sampling manner.
Data were collected using a two–section questionnaire containing items about demographic data and likert-scaled questions proposed to explore the amount of use and satisfaction of central library services. The normality of data was confirmed through Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
Results: The most usage (%61.2) of library resources was related to Persian books and least usage (%0) to the theses. Frequency of Persian journal use and Latin journal use were %52.5 and %27.3, respectively. Also, the most satisfaction was related to books (%37.4) and the least to the electronic resources.
The most common cause of avoidance of library resources usage (%35.5) was using other resources and lack of suitable physical space was the least cause (%0) in this respect.
Conclusions: The frequency of Persian resources (books and Journals) usage shows the need to the adoption of strategies for using Latin resources, as they are assumed to be source of updated data. Also, the faculty members' satisfaction with non-electronic resources and their mild dissatisfaction in this issue shows the need for providing electronic infrastructures for using electronic resources

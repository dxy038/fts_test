
The main objective of this study was to determine the trends of fiber dimension variation along the longitudinal direction of wheat straw as a criteria for papermaking. Zagross wheat straw was collected from the agricultural and natural resources research center, Golestan province .The fiber biometric characteristics including fiber length, fiber diameter, lumen diameter and cell wall thickness in three internodes were determined .Results showed that, the difference in fiber diameter, lumen diameter and cell wall thickness were sttistically significant between three internodes of wheat straw at 99% confident Based on the computed papermaking indices (flexibility ,softness and runkle number), it was predicted that the papers produced from the first and the third internode of wheat straw may have higher tensile,folding and burst strength and the papers produced from the second internode may have higher tear strength.

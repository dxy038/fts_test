This paper investigates the ability of Real Immune Algorithm (RIA) in designing a supplementary controller for Static Var Compensators (SVC) to damp the power system interarea oscillation. For this the parameters of the supplementary controller are determined by RIA using an eigenvalue-based objective function. Also, a modified version of RIA, known as MRIA is used to design the supplementary controller. The numerical results are presented on a 2-area 4-machine system to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Also, to validate the results obtained by RIA and MRIA, Binary Immune Algorithm (BIA) is applied for comparison. To show the effectiveness of the designed controllers, a three phase fault is applied at a bus. The simulation study shows that the designed controller by MRIA performs better than RIA and BIA in finding the solution.

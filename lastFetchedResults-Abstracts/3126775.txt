This paper considers kinesthetic perception as the main performance objective for a scaled teleoperation system, and devises a scheme to optimize it with constraints of position tracking and absolute stability. Analytical criteria for monitoring stability have been derived for position-position, force-position, and four-channel control architectures using LlewellynÂ´s absolute stability criteria. This helps to reduce the optimization complexity and provides an easy and effective design guideline for selecting control gains amongst the range. Optimization results indicate that trade-offs exist among different control architectures. This paper provides guidelines based on application-dependent selection of control scheme.

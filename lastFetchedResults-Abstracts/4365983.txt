A method for the design of quadrantally symmetric 2-D IIR digital filters using sequential semidefinite programming (SDP) is developed. The design problem is solved by formulating the objective function in the SDP framework using a linear approximation of the transfer function. The issue of filter stability is addressed by converting the stability constraint into a set of linear matrix inequalities based on the well-known Lyapunov stability theory

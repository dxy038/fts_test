Ground penetrating radar is applied to detect objectives within the medium; as there are various interferences and noises in the receipt signal, and the reflected wave of the objective tends to be relatively weak so that may be submerged by interferences and noises, in this case, it is difficult against data processing and interpretation for ground penetrating radar. And for this reason, eliminating random noise interference turns into a key technology using ground penetrating radar to identify shallow objective. While gave an detailed introduction on the structure and property of 2-D physical wavelet function, this paper also compared the properties of wavelet function which transforms along with the scale, verified the correctness of the procedures through decomposition and reconstruction of typical signal, carried out de-noising processing through two typical signals, and testified the effectiveness of this method.

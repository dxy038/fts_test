Real time processing is a technical challenge for high precision implementation of space time adaptive processing (STAP) system with tremendous dataflow. Considering the requirements, the design objective is to decrease latency and to increase throughput of system. The compact parallel implementation of STAP system for dual-channel airborne radar is studied in this paper. Different scheduling methods are tested in two designed architectures based on the selected platform called as RLPGS structure and RLSGP structure. The real system demonstrates well on a single processing board, the performance meets the system requirement.

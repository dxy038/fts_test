We present a network initialization algorithm for wireless networks with distributed intelligence. Each node (agent) has only local, incomplete knowledge and it must make local decisions to meet a predefined global objective. Our objective is to use power control to establish a topology based on the relative neighborhood graph which has good overall performance in terms of power usage, low interference, and reliability

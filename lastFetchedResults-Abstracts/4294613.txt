INDOOR POSITIONING SYSTEM is a system in which we can locate the position of an object in an indoor environment utilizing ultrasonic waves generated by narrow directional ultrasonic transmitter. To achieve the objective of position detection, we have designed ultrasonic transmitter and receiver circuits, RF transmitter, and receiver for synchronization purposes. By implementing time of arrival method, we have located the position of an object. It is accomplished by using distances between the multiple receivers and a single transmitter located in a room. RF signal starts the timer and when ultrasonic waves will reach at the receiver end, it will stop the timer and then the extracted signal from the receiver is transmitted to the microcontroller for locating position of an object. The systems using ultrasonic waves have the advantage that it can be built on low cost and has relatively high accuracy to detect the position of an object in an indoor environment.

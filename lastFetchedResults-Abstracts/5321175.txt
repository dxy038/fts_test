An automation system has been developed for the design and analysis of SAW (surface acoustic wave) bidirectional transducers and filters and has been implemented on a personal-computer-class workstation. All dominant SAW acoustic and electrical effects have been modeled for nonreflecting transducers in a modular architecture. These synthesis and analysis tools form the core of the design-automation system. An automation shell used with the design tools forms the basis of a SAW compiler that is capable of noninteractive filter design. The first-generation set of SAW-filter design rules is implemented in a declarative language that provides logical-decision control of the automation system. The highest level of design choices, such as synthesis technique, transducer weighting, and substrate material, has been implemented in the design-rule system. The design-automation system controls the execution and iteratively evaluates options, corrects errors, and decides on an optimum design choice within the set of design rules. The system accepts user input of a frequency-domain specification and noninteractively outputs a filter meeting these specifications. A design automation system example is shown and experimental results using the CAD (computer-aided design) tools are presented

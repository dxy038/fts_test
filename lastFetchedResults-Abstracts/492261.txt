Priming is one of the seed enhancement methods that might be resulted in increased seed performance (germination and emergence) under stress conditions. The objective of this research was to evaluate effect of priming on seed germination under wide range of temperature in cotton. Treatments were combinations of seven temperatures (15 to 45°C by 5°C interval) and two seed treatments (control and primed seeds). Hydro priming method was used; seeds of cotton Siokra324 were moistened in water for 16 h at 25°C. Results indicated that priming affects seed germination components. Primed seeds had more uniform at all temperatures with less time to reach 10 and 90% of maximum germination. Priming affected germination response to temperature; primed seeds germinated at broader range of temperature. Optimal temperature, with lower base temperature and higher ceiling temperature. Optimal temperature was 38°C for control seeds, but was 35-45°C for primed seeds. It can be concluded that priming improves cotton seed germination under a wide range of temperatures.

Recent research has shown that a P300 system can be used while walking without requiring any specific gait-related artifact removal techniques. Also, standard EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) have not been really assessed for lower limb rehabilitation/prosthesis. Therefore, this paper gives a first baseline estimation (for future BCI comparisons) of the subjective and objective performances of a four-state P300 BCI plus a non-control state for lower-limb rehabilitation purposes. To assess usability and workload, the System Usability Scale and the NASA Task Load Index questionnaires were administered to five healthy subjects after performing a real-time treadmill speed control. Results show that the P300 BCI approach could suit fitness and rehabilitation applications, whereas prosthesis control, which suffers from a low reactivity, appears too sensitive for risky and crowded areas.

Deregulation of power system has introduced new objectives and requirements for transmission expansion problem. In this paper, a static transmission expansion methodology is presented using a multi-objective optimization framework. Investment cost, reliability (both adequacy and security), and congestion cost are considered in the optimization as three objectives. To overcome the difficulties in solving the nonconvex and mixed integer nature of the optimization problems, the genetic based NSGA II algorithm is used followed by a fuzzy decision making analysis to obtain the final optimal solution. The planning methodology has been demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus test system to show the feasibility and capabilities of the proposed algorithm. Also, in order to compare the historical expansion plan and the expansion plan developed by the proposed methodology, it was applied to the real life system of northeastern part of Iranian national 400-kV transmission grid.

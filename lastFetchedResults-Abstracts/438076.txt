Background.
Damage to the phrenic nerve, either unilaterally or bilaterally, is a well-documented complication of cardiac operation, but less commonly reported after lung transplantation.
Methods.

A retrospective review of 185 single and sequential single lung transplant procedures was performed at The Toronto Hospital. Objective confirmation (fluoroscopy or ultrasound) of diaphragmatic paralysis was found in 6 patients. Paralysis was unilateral in 5 patients (all were left sided) and bilateral in 1 patient.
Results.

The average length of ventilation was 8.2 ± 9.2 days with an average intensive care unit stay of 11.2 ± 10.6 days. Mean duration in the hospital was 37.5 ± 11.1 days. The average length of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization were compared with all other sequential single transplantations performed from approximately the time of the first documented case of diaphragmatic paralysis. Intensive care unit stay and hospitalization for the other (no diaphragmatic paralysis) transplant recipients were significantly shorter (5.3 ± 2.7 and 29.1 ± 12.9 days, respectively; p < 0.05). One patient required noninvasive ventilatory assistance via bilevel positive airway pressure in the hospital. One other patient used bilevel positive airway pressure in the hospital and overnight for 6 months after discharge. All patients obtained acceptable lung function and were ambulatory upon discharge from the hospital.
Conclusions.

Clinically detectable diaphragmatic paralysis is an infrequent complication of lung transplantation and is associated with longer intensive care unit stay and hospitalization, but is not associated with significant adverse outcomes.

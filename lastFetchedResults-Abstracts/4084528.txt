The power transmission conductor system consists of: the aluminum conductor, the steel-core supporting material, and the splice connector. The splice connector connects the aluminum conductor to form a continuing current transmission line. The splice connector region of a conductor system is more sensitive to material aging during service. This is due to the material discontinuity and the crimped connectorÂ´s forming mechanism. The objective of this project is to develop a protocol to evaluate the integrity of a full tension single-stage splice connector (SSC) assembly operated at high temperature. The project focuses on thermal mechanical testing, thermal cycling simulation and the effective lifetime of the SSC system. The investigation indicates that thermal cycling temperature and frequency, conductor cable tension loading, and the compressive residual stress field within a SSC system have significant impact on SSC integrity and its associated effective lifetime. The developed governing equation and its application to assure the adequate service life of transmission lines are also discussed in the paper.

With the growth of computer usage at all levels in the process industries, the volume of available data has also grown enor-
mously, sometimes to levels that render analysis dicult. Most of this data may be characterized as historical in the sense that it was
not collected on the basis of experiments designed to test speci®c statistical hypotheses. Consequently, the resulting datasets are
likely to contain unexpected features (e.g. outliers from various sources, unsuspected correlations between variables, etc.). This
observation is important for two reasons: ®rst, these data anomalies can completely negate the results obtained by standard analysis
procedures, particularly those based on squared error criteria (a large class that includes many SPC and chemometrics techniques).
Secondly and sometimes more importantly, an understanding of these data anomalies may lead to extremely valuable insights. For
both of these reasons, it is important to approach the analysis of large historical datasets with the initial objective of uncovering and
understanding their gross structure and character. This paper presents a brief survey of some simple procedures that have been
found to be particularly useful at this preliminary stage of analysis.

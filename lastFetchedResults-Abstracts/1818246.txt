The objective of the present work is to propose a model related to the role of hydrogen on the friction mechanism of DLC films. An up-to-date review of the effect of hydrogen on the tribology of DLC films is presented first. Selected experiments performed on two model hydrogenated DLC films are then presented to demonstrate how hydrogen, both as a constituent of the carbonaceous film or as a gaseous species introduced in the surrounding environment during the friction process can influence the intermediate and steady-state friction regimes, in the absence of any oxidating species. For the film with the highest hydrogen content, superlow friction (10−3 range) is reached rapidly in an ultrahigh vacuum. For the film containing the lowest hydrogen content, the combination of a controlled temperature during friction (150°C) with hydrogen diffusion from the bulk of the film towards the sliding activated surfaces of the hydrogen carbon-to-carbon is responsible for an intermediate period with friction in the 10−3 to 10−2 range. Then the steady-state friction coefficient rises up to 0.6, typical for low hydrogenated a-C:H films in vacuum or inert atmospheres. A superlow friction steady-state regime may be controlled over longer periods by introducing a significant pressure of pure hydrogen surrounding the contact during the friction process. Argon at the same pressure does not have any similar lubricating effects. Tribochemistry between hydrogen and the carbonaceous network is thus responsible for the control of the superlow friction regime observed with a-C:H coatings in selected conditions of film composition and atmosphere.

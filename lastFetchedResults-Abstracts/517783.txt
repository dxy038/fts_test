Abstract
Objective
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) manifests as an easy bruising or extravasation of blood from capillaries into skin and mucous membranes. The characteristics of acute ITP in infants have rarely been described. In order to better understand acute ITP in infants, the characteristics of the disease at this age group was investigated.
Material and Methods
The present descriptive, cross-sectional study, variables such as age, sex, clinical presentation, treatment outcome, and the rate of chronicity in 72 infant suspected to ITP on admission were evaluated from 2002 to 2008 at Yazd Shahid Sadoughi Hospital.
Results
Analyzing data showed among 72 cases, 31 were female and 41 were male; aged 15 days to 2 years old. According to the result of bone marrow aspiratation, 66 patients had ITP, 2 had Wiskott Aldrich and 4 patients had Fanconi anemia. Clinical presentations of the patients with ITP were as following: 55 patients (83.3%) had purpura, 27 (40.9%) active mucosal bleeding and 2 (3%) had intra cranial hemorrhage. According to the history of patients; 31 patients (47%) had common cold, 17 (25.8%) were positive for vaccination, 2 (3%) had a history of chickenpox. They all had good response to treatment. There was no significant relationship between sex and disease progression towards the chronic phase (Pvalue: 0.554).
A total of 16 chronic ITP had complete response to treatment (with IVIG and corticosteroids, Anti D, Azathioprine).
Conclusion
ITP in infant is a benign disease and responds well to treatment. Vaccination and viral illnesses play an important role in the etiology of ITP in children.

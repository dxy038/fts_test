Objective
The aim of this study was to describe in detail the laparoscopic treatment of patients with liver hydatid cyst.
Method

Seventy-six consecutive patients with 104 liver hydatid cysts were considered for laparoscopic treatment from October 2000 to October 2005.
Results

A laparoscopic surgical technique was used in all cases. The method involved treatment of the residual pericystic cavity and removal of the contents of the cyst. The operating time (mean ± SD) was 81 ± 9 minutes (range 40–120). Complications were observed in 5 patients (6.58%) after surgery. Sixty-eight patients (89.47%) were followed-up for a mean of 14 months (range 6–38). No recurrence was found in any of the cases. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.6 ± 1.0 days (range 6–15).
Conclusions

This laparoscopic hepatic hydatid surgical technique is a safe and effective method of treatment in selected patients. It can be a useful alternative for treating patients with liver hydatidosis.

Gathering places of towns should have a strong and special identity and be visually more different, recognizable, memorable and vivid from other places. In fact, gathering spaces should be in harmony and unity with other urban spaces of the city in order to make them a memorable and at the same time effective in forming the city's overall identity. Today a main part of citizens' perception of the city and urban spaces, takes place at night. Therefore, the nightlife of the city has become a major concern for the urban planners and managers. A major part of gathering places' identity also depends on their nightscape in the city. One of the most complicated and sensitive parts in designing nightscapes for the city is planning and designing a lighting master plan, an issue that is more important than specialty and knowledge of technical and aesthetic aspects of lighting. This needs a sufficient and precise understanding of the city, its identity and its qualifications which forms its landscape.  
And what West 8, landscape architects has done in Helsinki, more than anything else is emphasizing on the identity of place thorough use of its natural heritage. Use of light in West 8 proposed master plan is completely objective and light is used only in special spaces to make signs and symbols. West 8 work in Helsinki is a complete sample of Light Art.

Scenes of natural areas were used as stimuli to analyze the psychological and physiological responses of subjects while viewing wildland scenes. Attention Restoration Theory [Kaplan, S., 1995. The restorative benefits of nature: toward an integrative framework, J. Environ. Psychol.15, 241–248.] and theorized components of restorative environments were used as an orientation for selection of the visual stimuli. Conducted in Taiwan, the studies recorded the psychophysiological responses of 110 laboratory participants while viewing 12 images that hypothetically represented the Being Away, Extent or Coherence, Fascination, and Compatibility components of restorative environments. Psychological responses were measured using the perceived restorativeness scale and physiological responses were recorded by electromyography (EMG), electrocephalography (EEG), and blood volume pulse (BVP) measurements. Results revealed a large degree of congruency between the psychological measures of restorativeness and the three physiological responses. Improved scores on the perceived restorativeness scale corresponded to increased EMG and EEG readings and lower BVP measurements. These findings provide some objective evidence toward the psychophysiological values; and perhaps benefits, of wildland–wilderness environments. The potential importance of wildland–wilderness environments for the restoration of human well-being is discussed.

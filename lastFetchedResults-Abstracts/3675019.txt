In this letter, we propose a novel acoustic echo suppression (AES) technique based on soft decision in a frequency domain. The proposed approach provides an efficient and unified framework for such procedures as AES gain computation, AES gain modification using soft decision, and estimation of relevant parameters based on the same statistical model assumption of the near-end and far-end signal instead of the conventional strategies requiring the additional residual echo suppression (RES) step. Performances of the proposed AES algorithm are evaluated by objective and subjective tests under various environments, and better results compared with the conventional AES method are obtained.

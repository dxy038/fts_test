Four technology development tasks which were chosen to reduce the technology risks associated with proposed approaches to the Advanced Tracking and Data Relay satellite (ATDRS) are described. The four tasks relate to a triband antenna feed system, a digital beamforming system for the <e1>S</e1>-band multiple-access system (SMA), an SMA phased-array antenna, and a configuration thermal/mechanical analysis task. The objective, approach, and status of each task and spacecraft configuration studies are discussed

Induction motor which has a good use in centrifugal pump and fan drive, possesses the characteristics of slip power being able to be fed back, little converter capability, stepless speed adjustment around synchronous speed, and so on. In order to realize the rotor energy flowing bidirectional and high efficiency, auxiliary windings embedded in stator of induction motor (IFIM) are used to absorb or send slip power. Upon the parameters of the ordinary induction motor of the same power level, IFIM with auxiliary windings is simulated in finite element method analysis software (ANSYS) and the transformer characteristic between the dual windings is proved. The inductances of stator windings obtained by ANSYS resolving with different angle of rotor carry out the fact that the self-inductance and the mutual-inductance is stable, which is important in parameter design.

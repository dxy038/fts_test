Background and objective: An association between the isolated hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been noted in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. The current study describes the frequency of isolated anti-HBc and its possible value as a serologic marker for detection of HBV-DNA in serum samples of HIV infected patients with or without HCV coinfection.

Materials and methods: A total of 92 HIV infected patients were enrolled in this study. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, ALT levels, HIV viral load and CD4 cells count were tested in all subjects. Then we compared 63 subjects with HIV-HCV coinfection with 29 subjects with HIV infection alone regarding isolated anti-HBc. Presence of HBV-DNA was determined by real-time PCR in serum samples of patients with isolated anti-HBc.

Results: Of 63 anti-HCV positive patients, 18 subjects (28.6%) and of 29 anti-HCV negative patients 5 subjects (17.2%) had isolated anti-HBc. HBV-DNA was detectable in 3 out of 18 anti-HCV positive patients with isolated anti-HBc (16.7%) and none of anti-HCV negative patients with isolated anti-HBc.

Conclusion: HIV-HCV coinfected individuals were more likely to have isolated anti-HBc than subjects with HIV alone. Presence of isolated anti-HBc in HIV-HCV infected individuals may reflect occult HBV infection in these patients.

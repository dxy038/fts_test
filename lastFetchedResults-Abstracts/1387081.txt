Ritonavir (RTV) and other protease inhibitors (PIs) used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are associated with elevated serum triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in some patients. A rat strain (Sprague–Dawley or SD) commonly used in toxicology studies is not sensitive to RTV-induced hyperlipidemia, making mechanistic studies and the identification of novel, lipid-neutral PIs challenging. The objective of this study was to identify a rat strain that mirrors human PI-associated hyperlipidemia. RTV was administered at 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days to a panel of 14 rat strains estimated to cover approximately 86% of the known genetic variance in rats. Increased serum TG and cholesterol levels occurred only in two rat strains, including LEW × BN rats. Livers from LEW × BN (sensitive) and SD (resistant) rats were then evaluated using microarrays to investigate differences in the transcriptomic response to RTV.

l genes, including some involved in bile acid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, were differentially regulated between the two strains. In particular, cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), a key enzyme for cholesterol metabolism, was down-regulated in the sensitive and up-regulated in resistant rats. Collectively, these results demonstrate the utility of a genetically diverse rat panel to identify strains with clinical relevance for a particular adverse effect. Furthermore, the genome-wide transcriptomic analysis suggests that RTV-induced hyperlipidemia is at least in part due to changes in hepatic lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. These findings will facilitate the discovery of novel, lipid-neutral HIV PIs and the identification of relevant biomarkers for this adverse event.

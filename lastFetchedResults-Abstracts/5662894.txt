The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) is founded upon commercial Third Generation (3G) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology to provide voice and data services to the warfighter. An important requirement on the system is to adjudicate service access and quality based upon service priority to ensure that critical communications are provided "assured access". MUOS employs 120 levels of priority along with a set of congestion control mechanisms that are invoked as a function of service priority to manage communications resource consumption in the system. A pro-active philosophy is taken that incrementally degrades quality-of-service (QoS) (but still providing compliant QoS) with level of congestion to gracefully throttle resource consumption.

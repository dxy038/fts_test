This paper presents some of the preliminary results generated by the MODIS BRDF and albedo science data product (MOD43B). The operational algorithm relies on a semiempirical kernel-based bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model and multi-date MODIS observations to provide global one kilometer measures of BRDF, albedo (spectral and broadband) and Nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR)

Background & Objective: The purpose of the present study is to trace the scientific status of researchers’ outputs in the field of parasitology as reflected in science citation databases during 1995-2010. 
Methods: In this study, outputs of researchers in the field of parasitology were analyzed using scientometric method. 3781 records were downloaded from the online Web of Science and then were exported to the basic dataset created for the study in a personal computer. For analyzing, data were entered into statistical and scientometric softwares such as Excel and HistCite and Interdisciplinary Research (IDR).
Results: Results show that the average growth rate in outputs of the field of parasitology during 1995-2010 is zero. The highest number of productions is in article format (3190), and in English language (3601). The International Journal for Parasitology has the highest number of articles (2521), the University of Melbourne with 122 articles has the highest number of productions among universities, and USA with 976 articles has the highest number of productions among countries. Gasser R.B. with 59 articles has the most articles among authors and “Parasitology Meets Ecology on its Own Terms” by Margolis et al. with 2041 has the highest number of citations. The most important cluster in parasitology field is Infection Diseases (3514) with the following subjects: Parasitology, Veterinary Sciences, Tropical Medicine, Infection Diseases, Microbiology, Immunology, and Virology.
Conclusion: This study is a guide for researchers, experts and policy makers in the field of parasitology.

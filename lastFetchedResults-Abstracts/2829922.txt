This paper discusses a proposed control strategy based on fuzzy logic for three-phase PWM rectifiers. This technique is called direct control of fuzzy power (DPCF). The objective of this paper is to replace both hysteresis controllers that role for setting the active and reactive power by a single fuzzy controller which adjusts both active and reactive power at the same time. The aim of this work is to eliminate the harmonic currents and therefore reduce the total harmonic distortion of the line current and improve the power factor. This DPCF is tested by simulation studies on a three-phase PWM rectifier.

Background and Aim: Spinal manipulation is a treatment modality in the management of patients with pain in the neck, low back or pelvic disorders. The objective of this research was to determine the effects of sacroiliac joint manipulation on selected electrophysiological parameters including pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and Tibial nerve Hoffmann's reflex (H-reflex) amplitude. 
Materials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study between 2009 and 2010, 20 healthy young female volunteers of Shiraz University Of Medical Sciences participated. Pressure pain threshold was measured from the posterior superior iliac spine and H.reflex recorded from the Tibial nerve of the same side were evaluated before and after sacroiliac joint manipulation. H- reflex for 20 and PPT for 15 minutes were recorded after manipulation.  Data analysis was done by means of SPSS (version 18), repeated measure analysis ,and post-hoc Bonferroni.
Results: Sacroiliac joint manipulation attenuated alpha motor neuronal activity significantly for 20 seconds (Mean±SD, 16±0.16) compared to before the technique (Mean=035±0.15), P=0.005. PPT values reduced in post manipulation versus pre manipulation; although there were statistically no significant differences in PPT based on recursive measuring test.
Conclusion: Sacroiliac joint manipulation procedure produces a transient attenuation of alpha motor neuronal excitability. Probably, applying this technique cannot change pressure pain threshold. Manipulation can have a muscle tone reduction effect.

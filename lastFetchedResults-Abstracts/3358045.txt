International metropolis tourism industry structure optimization is an important problem in practice and theory research in China tourism industry. Based on full consideration of internal and external constraints of international metropolis tourism industry structure optimization, we integrate the input-output model, multi-object programming and linear programming theory to explore and build international metropolis tourism industrial structure multi-objective optimization model under three target situations, and take Shanghai as an example for empirical study. The conclusions show that the model is feasible and the optimization is conducted in certain conditions. The goal of optimization directly determine the structure of the tourism industry, at present the goal of tourism of Shanghai is maximize the tourism economic development and tourism employment, and prefer to tourism employment. Shanghai tourism industry structure has great potential on energy conservation and emissions reduction.

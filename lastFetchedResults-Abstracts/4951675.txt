Integrated feature matching algorithm is proposed for aircraft pose estimation based on image sequence. The algorithm chooses posture ratio and correlation coefficient with good distribution as integrated feature, which fuses shape and statistic information. Matching principle is optimization of integrated objective function, which ensures that the ultimate result is global optimal solution. Correlation coefficient is calculated exactly via location and size registration, and applied flexibly in matching. Simulation results show precision and reliability of the algorithm.

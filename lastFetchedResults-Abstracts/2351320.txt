The objective of the paper is to develop a model for the overall heat transfer coefficient as a function of the load volume, mill speed, and the design of the mill liners and shell, using the energy balances in order to model energy loss form the grinding mill. The energy loss via convection through the mill shell is accounted for by quantifying the overall heat transfer coefficient of the shell.

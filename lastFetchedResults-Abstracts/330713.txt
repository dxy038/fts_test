Objective. This study evaluated IPS Empress ceramic inlays luted with two chemical-cured luting agents, a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji Plus (F)) and a resin composite (RC) (Panavia 21 (P)).

Methods. Seventy-nine ceramic inlays were placed in Class II cavities in 29 patients. At least two inlays were placed in each patient to compare the luting techniques intra-individually. In each patient half of the inlays were luted with F and the other half with P. The inlays were evaluated clinically, according to modified USPHS criteria (van Dijken, 1986), at baseline, after 6 months, and yearly during 5 years.

Results. At 5 years, 71 inlays were evaluated. Two small partial fractures were observed at 3 years (1P, 1F). One inlay showed recurrent root caries at 4 years (P). Four inlays, two in each group showed non-acceptable color match (2P, 2F). Small defects were observed in 4 inlays (2P, 2F). A slight ditching of the cement margins was observed in both luting groups but did not seem to increase during the second half of the evaluation. No significant difference in durability was observed between the two luting agents.

Significance. IPS Empress inlays luted with the chemical-cured RC and the resin-modified glass ionomer cement functioned satisfactory during the 5 years follow-up.

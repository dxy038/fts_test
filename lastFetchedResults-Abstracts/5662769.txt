This poster presents a novel idea of how to provide users with location-based services. The key issues lie in radically simplifying the provision and the utilisation of services.

Our objective is to make it possible for non-technicians to compose these via a Web toolkit without the need for specialized knowledge, and to enable people to use them on their mobile phones in a context-aware manner without any installation effort.

We consider a real-time streaming system where messages created at regular time intervals at a source are encoded for transmission to a receiver over a packet erasure link; the receiver must subsequently decode each message within a given delay from its creation time. We study a bursty erasure model in which all erasure patterns containing erasure bursts of a limited length are admissible. For certain classes of parameter values, we provide code constructions that asymptotically achieve the maximum message size among all codes that allow decoding under all admissible erasure patterns. We also study an i.i.d. erasure model in which each transmitted packet is erased independently with the same probability; the objective is to maximize the decoding probability for a given message size. We derive an upper bound on the decoding probability for any time-invariant code, and show that the gap between this bound and the performance of a family of time-invariant intrasession codes is small in the high reliability regime.

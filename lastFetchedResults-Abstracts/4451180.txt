As one kind of new technology, wireless sensor network has a wide application area such as military, environment monitoring, object tracking, science observing and forecasting. Resource optimization is the important problem in the development of the wireless sensor networks. Analyze the existing algorithms for resource optimization; a network coverage optimization model with the objective function of least nodes in networks is put forward. It ensures the probability of covering the whole area is above 95%. Finally, MATLAB is adopted to realize this coverage algorithm.

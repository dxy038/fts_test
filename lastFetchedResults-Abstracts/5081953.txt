Cooperation between a telecommunications network and customersÂ´ personal computers is becoming a decisive factor for a carrier to maintain or even improve its competence in the world telecommunications market. NTT introduced an advanced intelligent network into service last year. This paper presents a planned framework for Web-based management of it. The framework employs Java and Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) as its core technology. The fundamental design of network and service operations is discussed The central objective of the advanced intelligent network is rapid and economical development of new telecommunications services and the Web-based management framework furthers this aim. Like other telecommunications networks, the network uses the Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) framework. A migration scenario is proposed, in which the interoperation of Java/CORBA-capable management with the current TMN infrastructure is discussed

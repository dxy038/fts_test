This paper presents a newly proposed Novel TANANÂ´s Algorithm (NTA) for solving ELD Problems. The main objective of NTA is to minimize the total fuel cost of the generating units subjected to limits on generator power output, and power loss. The NTA is a simple numerical random search approach based on a parabolic TANAN function. This paper presents an application of NTA to ELD problems for different IEEE standard test systems. The Proposed method is compared with various optimization techniques and the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous optimization methods.

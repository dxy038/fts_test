The objective of this paper is the optimization of shrimp freezing process and evaluation of the influence of phosphate addition on product yield and quality. A systematic experiment was conducted to obtain data on yield and quality after the following process steps: immersion in phosphate solutions, freezing, defrosting, and cooking. The best results were obtained using phosphate and freezing the shrimps (Pleoticus muelleri) with liquid N2. The use of phosphate was efficient in retaining water during thawing and after cooking. These results were confirmed with the diminishing of drip loss during thawing and after cooking, and with the increasing of moisture content after immersion.

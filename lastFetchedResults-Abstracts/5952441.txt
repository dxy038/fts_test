Melt blowing is used as a single-step process for converting polymer resin directly into a nonwoven web of microfiber. The dual slot inset blunt die is often used to yield polymer fibers in the melt blowing process. The objective of this paper is to investigate the fiber diameter of melt blowing nonwovens produced by inset blunt die using an artificial neural network model and statistical model. The fiber diameter of melt blowing nonwoven is mostly influenced by processing parameters. A good correlation between predicted and actual fiber diameter can be predicted by two models. The results show that ANN model is more effective than statistical model, which is an excellent approach for predictors.

Where to dwell has been a question since the beginning of human existence. In this paper we return to this everlasting issue because rapid advances in information technology have created bright new avenues for spatial design. Technology can be the means to create new dwelling spaces. The question is how new technology can lead us to better lives. We propose a spatial hyperlink which integrates information technology with spatial design to create a virtual connection between spaces. The objective is to create a sense of connection for people who live separately, to make it possible for people who live in enclosed spaces to connect with nature, and to connect peopleÂ´s past, present and future territorial identities. Two design cases are presented to demonstrate how spatial hyperlink works. The first case creates a place that connects people who use it at different times. The second case creates a place that connects people to nature.

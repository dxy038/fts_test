Background & Objective: Nowadays pezzer drains have being used widely in open prostatectomy but there are many problems such intractable pain, tissue damage and leak of fluids during drain extraction that have limited its application for nurses and patients. The aim of this study was to designing and manufacturing of a type of feasible pezzer drain without pain during the extraction and side effects.
Material & methods: New drain was registered according to certification number 75407 in invention registry organization of Iran. An adult male albino rabbit (3 kg) was studied. The bladder was exposed surgically after deep anesthesia and the new designed drain passed through the bladder wall and fixed. After recovery the efficacy of designed drain was assessed in two different conditions as without distal end controlling and controlled distal deflation. Heart rate of animal and motor activity was assessed during the pulling out of pezzer drain. ECG by lead I and piezoelectric pulse sensor connected to power lab set up were recorded thoroughly. The results were analyzed by Mat lab software.
Results: The results showed that drain extraction without distal end deflation generate significant heart rates and motor activity. The results of controlled distal end cuff deflation condition showed no significant changes in comparison to before and during extraction.
Conclusion: Based on the obtained results the new designed drain can be used during the urologic surgeries in particular open prostatectomy surgery.

An indoor climate is mainly influenced by factors including heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, building envelope and materials, occupants, furniture, and service life of the building components. These last few years, the usual porous medium provided in wall and flooring constructions have been pointed out as possible passive systems capable of buffering the indoor climate variations in terms of temperature and humidity. The objective for the ongoing project is, therefore, to evaluate the possibility of ensuring an indoor climate within an acceptable range making use of large exposed massive wood surfaces. An experimental study, being performed in four occupied apartments of a multi-storey residential building in Sweden, is described in this paper. A brief analysis of the in situ recordings is also included. The temperature and relative humidity recordings show fairly well-agreement with the ASHRAE recommended values for a good indoor climate excepted during the cold periods revealing low indoor relative humidity. The first results show evidences that a large area of exposed massive wood contributes to buffer the indoor temperature variations. Furthermore, this far it does not shows evidences that a large area of exposed massive wood is able to damp the daily fluctuations in relative humidity.

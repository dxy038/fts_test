First, the kinematic analysis is carried out to the machine and the kinematics equation is obtained. Then, the mathematical model on position error of movable platform of this machine is established in considering the joint gap based on the kinematics equation. According to the mathematical model expression, the position error of movable platform can be calculated when the specific values to the length error of the driving rod and the position error of the joint point are known. The establishment of error model has important theoretical significance to the design as well as the error analysis and compensation of this Parallel Machine Tool.

A method is described to solve a nonlinear parameter optimization problem with several objective functions. The method is applied to find the optimal design of a permanent magnet synchronous generator. The generator is part of a 1.5 MW wind turbine system, and is optimized in order to maximize power output, efficiency and to minimize costs of materials, which means a minimum of magnet material, iron and copper mass. Seven parameters are varied. The generator is calculated by means of the finite difference field calculation program PROFI as a two-dimensional problem, considering nonlinear characteristics of iron and magnet material.

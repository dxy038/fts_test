Coupling and synchronized execution of legacy simulation models is a complex task. Simulation experts need knowledge in the domains of distributed simulation and HLA to conduct such complex simulation projects. This is one reason for insufficient acceptance of distributed simulation in industrial areas. To increase the number of distributed simulation projects in industrial domains, a dedicated access for industrial engineers to this technology is needed. Therefore it is necessary to develop and apply support systems for distributed simulations with user-interfaces that are dedicated to factory planners and operators. The objective of this paper is to discuss the provision of distributed simulation support systems for in industrial applications in more detail.

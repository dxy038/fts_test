An international undergraduate design project is
reviewed in this paper. The International Virtual Design Studio
(IVDS) project is a joint project among Queen’s University, Middle
East Technical University, and Union College. The objective of
IVDS is to provide a collaborative design experience to students
in different international locations. This paper is an overview
of the program and its challenges, as well as a collaboration of
ideas and suggestions collected from the IVDS participants and
IVDS Coordinators through surveys. This paper complements the
previous publication on the IVDS program [1] in which the focus
was on the program from the IVDS Coordinators’ point of view.
These two paper should be beneficial for the organizers of current
and future international student design projects.

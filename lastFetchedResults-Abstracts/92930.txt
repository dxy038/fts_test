The objective of this study was to evaluate trends in reproductive performance in Ohio dairy herds during the 1990s. Stringent criteria for herd inclusion were applied to DHI records to ensure high quality and reliability of the data. The final data set contained 44,425 monthly herd summary records from 1772 herds from years 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1998. Outcomes of interest were calving interval length, calving-to-conception interval, days to first breeding, services per conception and first service conception rate. PROC MIXED in SAS(registered) (version 8.1) was used and the monthly records were treated as repeated measures nested within years and herds. First-order autoregressive covariance structure was used to model the covariance between the repeated measures within herds. The data were analyzed for the entire herd as well as for the first lactation cows separately. During the 1990s reproductive performance declined in Ohio dairy herds. Herd average calving interval lengthened from 13.6 to 14.1 months and calving-to-conception interval increased from 136 to 150 days between 1992 and 1998, respectively. ] Days to first service and number of services increased while first service conception rate declined on a herd level. The reproductive performance of first lactation cows, however, remained constant during this same period. Overall herd reproductive performance was associated with herd size and fat-corrected rolling herd average milk production (FCM). As milk yield increased, first service conception rate decreased and services per conception increased. Larger herds had lower first service conception rate and needed more services per conception, but they started breeding their cows earlier resulting in a slightly shorter calving interval and calving-to-conception interval compared to smaller herds.

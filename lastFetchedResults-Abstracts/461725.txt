The objective of this study is to estimate the burden of tuberculosis (TB) in Serbia in the period 1992-2002 based on incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALY). The average age-adjusted TB incidence rate in the period 1992-2002 was 36.7/100,000 in males and 21.4/100,000 in females. During the period observed, TB incidence levelled of after a long period of decreasing trend during the preceding several decades. The incidence showed slightly increasing tendency in males and decreasing one in females. The average age-adjusted mortality rate was 4.1/100,000 in males and 1.3/100,000 in females. Mortality rates significantly decreased in both males (P = .0001) and females (P  = .0001). The burden of TB (DALY) was 0.70/1000 for males and 0.26/1000 for females. DALY rates significantly decreased in both males (P = .009) and females (P = .008). TB incidence and mortality as well as DALY rates increased with aging.

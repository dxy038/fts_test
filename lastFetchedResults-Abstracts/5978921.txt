A versatile optimization solution combining ant colony algorithm (ACA) with fuzzy control theory (FC) was proposed for the reconfiguration problem of the distribution network in this paper. The algorithm adopted hybrid ants´ behavior to produce diverse original paths, optimization of choice nodes set according to multiple constraints. At the same time, FC was added to ACA´s every generation. By making use of FC´s advantage of whole quick convergence, ACA´s convergence speed was quickened. The feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm are verified by series of simulated results. The simulation results show that the method this paper proposed is feasible and can obtain satisfactory effect. The model of reactive power optimiz ation is established by taking the minimum network loss as the objective. Its validity is verified through arithmetic examples of 58 nodes and a practical area network.

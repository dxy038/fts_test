The growing need to achieve high availability for large integrated chemical process systems demands higher levels of system reliability at the operational stage. In these circumstances, it has become critical to consider the reliability aspects of a system and its components at the design stage. Traditional reliability/availability analysis methods and maintenance optimization frameworks, commonly applied at the design stage, are limited in their application, as in most of these methods the designer is required to specify the process system components, their connectivity and their reliabilities a priori. As a result, these traditional methods do not provide the flexibility to reconfigure a process or select initial reliabilities of equipment in a way that maximizes the inherent plant availability at the design stage. In this paper, we developed an optimization framework by combining the reliability optimization and process synthesis challenges and the combined optimization problem is posed as a mixed integer non-linear programming optimization problem. The proposed optimization framework features an expected profit objective function, which takes into account the trade-off between initial capital investment and the annual operational costs by supporting appropriate estimation of revenues, investment cost, raw material and utilities cost, and maintenance cost as a function of the system and its component availability. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed optimization framework is demonstrated for the synthesis of the hydrodealkylation process (HDA) process.

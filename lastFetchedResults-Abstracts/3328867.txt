Dynamic wireless electrical vehicle (EV) charging is the process of supplying electrically driven vehicles along their driving path with electric energy via a wireless energy transfer system. To increase the range of electric vehicles, a dynamic charging lane is to be installed on a highway. With regard to the amount of power needed, supply of electric energy is a major concern. High-power overhead lines or cables are not regularly available. In many cases, electrified railway lines run in parallel to or cross motorways. Consequently, the railway energy supply system can be used to feed the wireless energy transfer system. However, the design of such a link has to conform to the railway energy supply system as well as to the wireless energy supply system. This paper introduces and discusses concepts for such a link, including also the option of a bidirectional link. A companion paper presents the wireless charging system including its magnetic topology.

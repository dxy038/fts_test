This work proposes and describes the integration of a bidirectional grid interface, capable to simultaneously operate as an active power filter and a battery charger (or a power generator), to the on-board power electronics of an electric vehicle. The integration of additional functions to electric vehicles is a very desirable feature, since it can result on cost reduction (in comparison to the separated implementation of the integrated functions). Simulation results based on a small-scale system provide evidence of the feasibility of the proposed concepts.

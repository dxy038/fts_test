Overlay networking has emerged as an alternative solution to solve many problems related to massive information distribution and processing tasks by providing enhanced services in application layer. For instance, overlay networks can improve data dissemination in P2P file sharing overlays and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) in which delay is considered as a critical performance metric. A viable content distribution model could considerably minimize the completion time. The main objective of this paper is to design a new content distribution model for fast data dissemination in overlay networks with heterogeneous overlay nodes. The proposed content distribution model is a hybrid model that enables fast data dissemination in overlay networks by combining Chunk and Fluid content distribution models.

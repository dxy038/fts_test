Processes and phenomena of reservoirs deeply effect up and downstream environments. Recently, bad taste and odor have causesed much problems for the people of saqez city in kurdestan. The objective of this paper is to present the results of field investigations of the reserroir water quality. Water quality parameters such as temperature (T), dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity {EC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), organic-N, total phosphorus, secchi depth and pH were measured for three consecutive months in the summer of 1379 (July, August and September of 2000). The results, with the help of HEC5-Q model, were used to calibrate and validate the daily simulation of water quality parameters for one year.

Background and objective: It is necessary to identify factors influencing smoking
in order to design effective interventions to reduce this behavior. This study
aimed to determine the predictive factors of smoking among adults of Arak city
based on Transtheoretical model (TTM).
Methods: This analytical- cross sectional study was carried out on 328 smokers
30 years of age and older in the city of Arak in 2014. Samples were selected
randomly from family file numbers of Arak. Data were collected using a valid
and reliable questionnaire including demographic information and questions
related to Transtheoretical structure Model (stages of change, processes of
change, temptation, Pros and Cons of smoking) and were analyzed using oneway
ANOVA, Pearson correlation and linear regression.
Results: Most of the subjects (52.7%) were in the precontemplation stage of
smoking cessation. Linear regression revealed that variables of change stages
(R2 = -0.46, p  >  0.001), temptation (R2 = -0.18, p  >  0.001), hazards of smoking
(R2 = -0.12, p  >  0.001), early age of smoking (R2 = -0.14, p  >  0.006), dramatic
relief process of change (R2 = -0.12, p  >  0.015) and the number of friends who
smoke (R2 = -0.12, p  >  0.048) were the predictor of daily smoking rates. The
model was able to predict 37% of smoking rate variance.
Conclusion: Most subjects were in the precontemplation stage of quitting
smoking and according to predictive factors of smoking it is necessary to plan
an effective educational program for quitting smoking.

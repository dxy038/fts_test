This work presents the results of an exhaustive experimental research carried out at the Technical University of Catalonia with the aim of studying the structural behavior of carbon fiber reinforced plastics when used for strengthening segmental bridges The study based on the ultimate strain of such composite material. Tensile and bond tests were performed on material-scale specimens and structural tests on full-scale segmental beams. The overall objective of this paper is to show the results obtained in this research project as well as to propose the bond test as an alternative for characterization of these new products in order to use them for repair and strengthening of segmental structures.

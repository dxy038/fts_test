The authors report on a scheme for evaluating students involved in team-oriented capstone engineering design projects. This scheme, implemented in BradleyÂ´s Industrial Engineering Department, addresses the problems associated with forming teams, potential interpersonal conflicts within the team, and the difficulty in assigning grades to individuals when the project is a team project. Under the scheme the categories, point values, and weights will vary for different programs. This method of evaluation give the faculty a more objective (and more defensible) approach to team project grading. The faculty involved in each program will have to decide on modifications to this scheme depending on their own requirements

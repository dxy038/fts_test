Eucalyptus species are cultivated in homogeneous plantations in Brazil, mainly to supply wood
for the cellulose and steel industries, which favors the establishment of insect pests. The objective was to
determine the geographical distribution and structure abundance of Lepidoptera defoliators of eucalypt.
Primary pest species of eucalypt of the order Lepidoptera were found in all areas sampled and their populations
were correlated with the age of the eucalypt plants, rainfall, and monthly average temperature. They presented
population peaks between February and July (Três Marias and Niquelândia) and July to November (Monte
Dourado) during periods of lower rainfall. The highest population peaks of these species were recorded when
the eucalypt plants were three to six years old. The area of Guanh?es presented better stability and fewer
possibilities for the occurrence of eucalyptus Lepidoptera primary pests.

The Chord protocol is the best known example of implementation of logarithmic complexity routing for structured peer-to-peer networks. Its routing algorithm, however, does not provide an optimal trade-off between the size of the finger table and the average number of hops to reach destination. Lately, a base-k chord appeared based on the original Chord, the routing perfomence of this system improved highly. In the paper, we presented a bidirectional chord system based on the base-k finger table, showing how to construct an improved finger table through the front and back direction, the aim is to reduce the average number of hops, possibly at the expense of an increased size of the finger table and the update time when a node join. Finally, the experimental result of the routing performance shows that our algorithm´s is more effective than the base-k chord´s.

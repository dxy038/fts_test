The objective of this study is reproduction of physical human actions. The information concerning the human actions are extracted by bilateral teleoperation systems using wearable tendon-driven robots. In the bilateral teleoperation systems, modal transformation is applied to achieve three control goals: position tracking, force feedback, and tension control. The extracted information is provided to the slave robot. To attain the reproduction, a force control scheme is employed. The utility of the proposed method is experimentally verified by applying to a removal operation of a nut.

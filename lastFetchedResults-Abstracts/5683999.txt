In this paper, we present communication protocols that allow a &#8220;learned&#8221; sender and a &#8220;learned&#8221; receiver to communicate on a bidirectional line, compressing files with (static or dynamic) dictionaries initially built independently by the sender and the receiver from those examples of the source output which they have available. We show that this leads to an improvement in compression, paid with a negligible or almost null possibility of communication error

Motivated by the need for systematic control design methods in smart power grids, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Objective Lyapunov-Based nonlinear controller for a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) integrated with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The proposed controller guarantees transient stability of a generator as well as regulation of its terminal voltage during transients and zero real power exhange of the STATCOM/BESS with the grid in steady-state. First, we derive the decoupled real (P) and reactive power (Q) controller using a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and the Backstepping method. By using the derived controller and a proper membership function we derive a Multi-Objective controller that additionally regulates the STATCOM/BESS real current output to zero after the transients. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller against a benchmark controller on the modified IEEE 14 bus system during a critical contingency scenario.

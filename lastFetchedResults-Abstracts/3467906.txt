The use of 900 MHz radio for supervisory control and data acquisition applications was investigated by the Houston Lighting and Power Company (HL&amp;P). Multiple address system applications in the 928/952 MHz band were evaluated. The purpose of this application was to replace leased telephone lines with 928/952 MHz radio channels to achieve lower costs and improved operational reliability. A second application with distribution automation and control pilot test programs on the HL&amp;P distribution system was explored. The purpose was reliable, cost-effective, bidirectional communications at a reasonable bit rate for control and monitoring of distribution feeders and related sectionalizing facilities. A third application of 900 MHz involving real-time monitoring of high-voltage transmission line conductors was investigated. In this instance, the radio provided a safe and reliable path for data collection between power donuts and master controller.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

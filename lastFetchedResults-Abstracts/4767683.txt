However, the process of identifying and choosing customer values is dynamic and full of subjective knowledge because individual worldviews and values are so different. The subjective characters of customer value bring organization managers an uncertain problem situation which the traditional methodology of hard system thinking can not solve. To solve this problematic situation, this paper employs social paradigm of functionalism and interpretivism to analyze the social action of customer value. It indicates that soft system methodology which derived from interpretive paradigm can integrate subjective and objective analysis to deal with identifying and choosing customers values.

Most of us, at some time during our career, will consider the possibility of starting a new company or joining a small, young company. How do we assess the opportunity? We know our decision could profoundly impact our career and our family\Â´s well being. There will never be enough objective facts to fully "justify" our decision. So how do we reach a decision that we are prepared to act upon? I hope to offer some useful perspectives.

A new type of two-stage direct drive piezoelectric servo valve is designed and its control system is presented in this paper. The multilayer piezoelectric actuator is used as the electricity-machine converter in this new servo valve, which gives the electrohydraulic servo system higher precision and an extensive application field. The bidirectional piecewise gearshift integral PID control method proposed in this paper can solve the nonlinear problem of the servo valve and satisfy the demand of the control system. Experiment results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method

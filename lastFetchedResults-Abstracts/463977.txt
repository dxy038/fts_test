Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the contribution of intraoperative radiation therapy in the management of recurrent cervical cancer.
Study design: Twenty-two patients were treated with electron beam intraoperative radiation therapy for recurrent cervical cancers that were confined to the pelvis but were too extensive to be adequately treated by radical surgery alone. All patients underwent extensive surgical dissection for exposure and maximal tumor resection. Doses of intraoperative radiation therapy ranged from 14 to 27.8 Gy (median 22 Gy). Twelve patients received intraoperative radiation therapy to address gross residual disease, and 10 patients were treated for microscopically positive or close surgical margins.
Results: The five-year disease-specific survival and local control rates were 43% and 48%, respectively. There were trends toward better local control and disease-specific survival in patients with microscopic residual disease compared with those with gross residual disease. Seven patients had peripheral neuropathy related to treatment, and four of these cases resolved.
Conclusion: In carefully selected cases intraoperative radiation therapy contributes to radical salvage of patients with recurrent cervical cancer involving the pelvic wall.

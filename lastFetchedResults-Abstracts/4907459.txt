This work proposes a new topology based on the integration of two flyback converters with different polarities, in order to avoid the use of the input diode full-bridge rectifying stage. The design is presented and analyzed, and a design example for a 50W LED lamp is presented, along with some simulation and experimental results, in order to validate the idea. A comparison in terms of efficiency is carried out between the proposed topology and the conventional flyback stage, showing an efficiency enhancement in the proposed converter. However, the most important advantage of the proposed converter is outlined in the final part of the work. In recent lighting applications, the use of micro renewable generators in lighting points makes necessary the use of special electronics to handle the energy flows in the ballast. The present topology is an alternative to standard bidirectional input stages, as it can be used to deliver energy into the power grid.

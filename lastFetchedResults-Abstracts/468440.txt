Objective: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of Burch colposuspension and Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz urethropexy with videourethroscopic control in the correction of stress urinary incontinence in patients with low pressure and hypermobility of the urethra. Study Design: Thirty women were randomly assigned to undergo 1 of the 2 surgical procedures from November 1993 to May 1996 (15 Burch colposuspensions and 15 Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz urethropexies) and were evaluated subjectively and objectively for stress urinary incontinence at 2 and 12 months. Data obtained were analyzed with the Student t test, the Fisher exact test, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: At 1 year of follow-up 15 women in the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz urethropexy group (100%) and 10 women in the Burch colposuspension group (66%) were subjectively considered cured (P = .02, 2-tailed Fisher exact test), and stress test results were negative in 14 women (93%) and 8 women (53%), respectively (P = .017, 2-tailed Fisher exact test). The resumption of spontaneous voiding was attained after 6.5 ± 3.3 days in the Burch colposuspension group and in 20.5 ± 13.4 days in the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz urethropexy group (P< .001, 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test). Conclusion: The high cure rate and low associated morbidity mark the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure with videourethroscopic control as more effective than Burch colposuspension in repairing stress urinary incontinence associated with low pressure and hypermobility of the urethra.

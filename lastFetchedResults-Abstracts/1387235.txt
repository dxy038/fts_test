This paper reports changes in the cattle population and the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the Republic of Korea between 1960 and 2007, and discusses potential factors contributing to the recently observed increase in disease incidence, particularly in beef cattle and deer. Although there have been ongoing refinements to the existing programme, further improvements in current strategies are needed, including surveillance of susceptible animal species, both domestic and wild, and ongoing surveillance of the human population.

In this paper, we propose a novel image interpolation method using Gabor filter. It is significantly important to estimate edge direction accurately for image interpolation. For this, we adopt Gabor filter, which has been popularly used for texture-based feature extraction in object recognition. We exploit the superior point of Gabor filter, which is to detect small edges in texture region. By employing Gabor filter, the proposed method can find edge direction for inconspicuous as well as prominent edge more exactly. Experimental results for various test images demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve higher objective and subjective image quality than conventional edge-oriented methods. Especially our method shows better reconstruction results in texture regions that include small patterns such as forest, hair, fur and so on.

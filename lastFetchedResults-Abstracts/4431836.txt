This paper presents the implementation of Software Residency at a graduation course focused in Software Development and Management in a Software Factory. Software Residency follows the same line of medical residency, at a medicine course. In this case, software residency has the objective to promote experience for students, inside a software development real environment, with well defined quality policies and with the goal to promote the dissemination of software quality, project management and production process concepts. In this course, the student actively participates on a software development project at a standard software factory (located in the university) or at some company previously selected by the university. We will present the qualitative and quantitative results of the experience we had conducting the graduation course focused in Software Development and Management in a Software Factory. The course was taken in 2008 and 2009 at a Brazilian public university. The objective of the course was to provide complementary knowledge to the students in the areas of Information Technology, Software Engineering and Project Management, focusing on software residency inside a software factory environment.

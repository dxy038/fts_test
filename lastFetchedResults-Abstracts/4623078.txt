To establish a accurate finite elements model (FEM) of a laboratorial long-span cable-stayed bridge, which based on Shandong Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge, the measured data has been utilized to updating FEM by the way of interactive Matlab and ANSYS program. To make the updating more meaningful and efficient, a dissectional analysis of model error which may introduce during manufacture has been carried out. The optimal objective function was constituted with both the residuals error of frequency and mode shape. The updating results indicated that when the FEM has huge number of nodes and elements, the analytical frequency can be very close to the measured value after the updating, however, the updating effect of mode shape was not obvious, because it is hard to updating the element one by one, and the measurement error of mode shape is quite large.

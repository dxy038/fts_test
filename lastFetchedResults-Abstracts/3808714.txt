The objective of this program was to compare the electrical performance of oils derived from the two recognized classes of crude stock -- naphthenic and paraffinic. Electric strength, both 60 Hz and impulse, partial discharge data and arc response (50amp arc interruption) of five oils from these above two categories indicate the interchangeability of these oils.

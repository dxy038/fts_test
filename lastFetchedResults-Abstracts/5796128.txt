To improve the low professional competence of newly graduated Chinese college students, this study proposes to set up the social production practice teaching network accompanied with relevant evaluation system. Establishing a social production practice education network can help clarify several terms in Chinese higher education such as experimental teaching, social practice teaching, production practice teaching and education objective. Bad learning habit of Chinese college students arising from the traditional teaching method such as aimless learning, planless learning and forced learning can be eradicated. By doing so, Chinese college students can clarify their objective of learning, prepare their own learning plan and long-term development goal and adopt a positive attitude towards learning. This method is a key to increase the professional competence of Chinese college students and improve the quality of Chinese higher education.

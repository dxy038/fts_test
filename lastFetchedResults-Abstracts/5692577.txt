A special clock test facility is described to evaluate atomic clocks developed for space and ground application. The facility itself is described and the methodologies involved in long-term performance testing, initial qualification testing of spacecraft clocks, and post-acceptance testing of candidate spaceflight clocks to be evaluated in orbit. The objective of long-term testing is to build a performance and reliability database on newly developed clocks to support eventual operational system acceptance. Initial qualification testing for developing clocks is used to guide development under contract and to support in-house design of components, subsystems and experimental atomic clocks. Typical testing procedures and methodologies are discussed

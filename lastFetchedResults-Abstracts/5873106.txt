In todayÂ´s fast moving world, it is a challenge to continuously maintain, improve the quality and efficiency of software systems development. In many software projects, testing is neglected because of time or cost constraint which leads to lack of product quality. Test automation reduces the future maintenance efforts and cost significantly. Automated test suite can run fast and frequently, which is cost-effective for software products with a long maintenance life. It also increases the test coverage with very low cost. The Main objective of the paper is to find out the process for test script design and execution as well as failure analysis of the scripts. In this paper types of failures has been defined as per the defined hybrid framework. Quality of test cases is determined by their ability to uncover as many errors as possible in the web application. After execution, for fail test scripts our method can find out whether the failure is a valid issue or a false positive. There are many types of failures which come under false positive.

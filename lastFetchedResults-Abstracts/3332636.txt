Maintaining power system frequency at constant value is very important for the health of the power generating equipment and the utilization equipment at the customer end. The job of automatic frequency regulation is achieved by governing systems of individual turbine-generators and Automatic Generation Control (AGC) or Load frequency control (LFC) system of the power system. The main objective of this paper is to present a critical literature review and aimed to highlight the various control and structural aspects of AGC used in multi area interconnected power system. Also this paper work reported in the AGC schemes based on power system models and control strategies are reviewed.

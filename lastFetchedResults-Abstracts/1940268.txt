Confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) have suffered considerable transformations since the last decade in Brazil, because of increasing of their production scale. Swine production is following this same trend, and the volume of manure produced and the form that is managed has a direct impact on houses air quality and efficiency of treatment systems. The objective of this work was to study the manure solid–liquid separation efficiency by screening, subject to different screen opening sizes and pit disposal time under tropical climate conditions. An ammoniacal nitrogen producing rate of 24 mg/L per storage day was observed and a decrease in screen separation efficiency in the first eight days of storage, obtained by solid group analysis. The storage time influenced directly the degradation of organic fraction indicated by the chemical oxygen demand increase overtime. The results suggest that the efficiency of solid–liquid separation is increased when carried out with the shortest storage time.

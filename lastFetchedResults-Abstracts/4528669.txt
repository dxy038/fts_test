Motivated by the quality-of-service (QoS) buffer management problem, we consider online scheduling of packets with hard deadlines in a finite capacity queue. At any time, a queue can store at most <i>b</i> isin Z<sup>+</sup> packets. Packets arrive over time. Each packet is associated with a non-negative value and an integer deadline. In each time step, only one packet is allowed to be sent. Our objective is to maximize the total value gained by the packets sent by their deadlines in an online manner. Due to the Internet traffic´s chaotic characteristics, no stochastic assumptions are made on the packet input sequences. This model is called a finite-queue model. We use competitive analysis to measure an online algorithm´s performance versus an unrealizable optimal offline algorithm who constructs the worst possible input based on the knowledge of the online algorithm. For the finite-queue model, we first present a deterministic 3-competitive memoryless online algorithm. Then, we give a randomized (Phi<sup>2</sup> = (1+radic(5)/2)<sup>2</sup> ap 2.618)-competitive memoryless online algorithm. The algorithmic framework and its theoretical analysis include several interesting features. First, our algorithms use (possibly) modified characteristics of packets; these characteristics may not be same as those specified in the input sequence. Second, our analysis method is different from the classical potential function approach. We use a simple charging scheme, which depends on a clever modification (during the course of the algorithm) on the packets in the queue of the optimal offline algorithm. We then prove that a set of invariants holds at the end of each time step. Finally, we analyze the two proposed algorithm in a relaxed model, in which packets have no hard deadlines but an order. We conclude that both algorithms have the same competitive ratios in the relaxed model.

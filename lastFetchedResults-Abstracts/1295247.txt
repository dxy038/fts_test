The slacks-based measure (SBM) of super-efficiency in data envelopment analysis (DEA) developed by Tone [Tone, K., 2002. A slacks-based measure of super-efficiency in data envelopment analysis. European Journal of Operational Research 143, 32â€“41] is a non-radial super-efficiency model compared to the traditional radial super-efficiency DEA models. This note extends the SBM of super-efficiency to the additive (slacks-based) DEA model. Alternative slacks-based objective functions can be used. Unlike the traditional radial super-efficiency DEA, additive (slacks-based) super-efficiency models are always feasible.

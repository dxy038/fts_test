The main objective of any industrial process is to obtain high economic performance with variable costs reduction and product quality assurance. In order to achieve this objective one of the advanced control methods has to be implemented. Some of well known advanced control methods, which are based on the process model, are adaptive control, model predictive control, internal model control, robust control. The purpose of this paper is to present a control application using an internal model control method for controlling a binary distillation column.

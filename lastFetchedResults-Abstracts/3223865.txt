Developing new energy sources taking into account the environmental issues became very important concerns among researchers. On the other hand, a big focus has been placed on solar power and electric vehicles. In this work, autonomous power supply system using solar power and electric vehicles has been studied and considered with a new design based on improving the power electronics control for the electric energy storage system. Since one of the disadvantages of PV systems is fluctuated output depending on the weather, storage systems are strongly recommended. This paper therefore describes a DC -DC converter design, using electric vehicles battery to stabilize the power supply from photovoltaic systems. In addition, experiments have been conducted to evaluate performances of the DC-DC bidirectional converter.

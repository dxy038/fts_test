Summary form only given. Based on the design concept of linear induction motors, an electromagnetic device has been constructed to investigate its applicability for non-contacting steel plate conveyance system application. The system three-dimensional (3D) field distributions and force characteristics will be investigated through magnetic circuit and finite element analysis (FEA). Satisfactory results in the corresponding system directions are provided to verify the suitability of design objective.

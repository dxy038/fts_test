Objective: To ascertain the microbial load and type of organisms on used surgical instruments following standard cleaning, which consisted of the use of a washer sterilizer followed by sonic cleaning.
Design: In this prospective experimental study, used surgical instruments were immersed in Peptamin Tween broth, the broth agitated, and then filtered through a 0.45 Î¼m filter. Quantitative cultures were performed, and all microbes were identified by using standard techniques.
Setting: This study was conducted at a 660-bed university hospital.
Results: The microbial load remaining on used surgical instruments after cleaning was as follows: 36 (72%) instruments 0 to 10 colony-forming units (CFU), 7 (14%) instruments 11 to 100 CFU, and 7 (14%) instruments > 100 CFU. Organisms contaminating the instruments included coagulase-negative staphylococcus (56%) followed by Bacillus (22%) and diphtheroids (14%). No other microbes were isolated from more than 4% of the instruments.
Conclusion: Most used nonlumen surgical instruments contain less than 100 CFU of relatively nonpathogenic microorganisms after cleaning. This suggests that new lowtemperature sterilization technologies are likely to be highly effective in preventing cross-transmission of infection via nonlumen medical instruments

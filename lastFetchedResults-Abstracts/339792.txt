Objective
We investigated whether established graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) could be successfully treated by a second allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) through elimination of first donor–derived lymphocytes responsible for GVHD.
Materials and Methods

In a murine GVHD model of BDF1 (H-2b/d)→B6C3F1(H-2b/k), GVHD mice underwent a second BMT using a graft (1 × 107 bone marrow and 3 × 107 spleen cells) from a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen haploidentically mismatched (to host and also to first donor) mouse strain, B6B10F1(H-2b/s), following low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) 2 to 3 weeks after the first BMT.
Results

Results demonstrated that severe GVHD could be successfully and stably treated by a second allogeneic BMT. For successful treatment of GVHD, rapid achievement of full second–donor T-cell chimerism was required. Furthermore, we showed that mice with GVHD could easily accept MHC haploidentically mismatched second-donor hematopoietic cells even after minimal conditioning (2–4 Gy TBI) because they were in a profoundly immunosuppressed state, and that the mice were relatively resistant to new development of GVHD by second-donor grafts. Furthermore, the timing of the second BMT, the intensity of conditioning treatment (GVHD mice are very sensitive), and donor selection were also found to be important for obtaining successful outcomes. Increased regulatory T cells and reduction of interferon-γ levels may be involved in tolerance induction.
Conclusions

We demonstrated that established GVHD in a murine GVHD model could be successfully treated by a second BMT from a third-party allogeneic donor.

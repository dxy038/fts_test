The objective of the current study was to investigate the protective effect of an aqueous extract of Phyllanthus fraternus (AEPF) against bromobenzene induced mitochondrial dysfunction in rat liver mitochondria. Administration of bromobenzene (10 mmol/kg body wt.) significantly decreased the rate of respiration (with glutamate + malate or succinate as substrates), abolished respiratory control ratio (RCR) and P/O ratios completely. There was a significant increase in the levels of lipid peroxides and protein carbonyls and a significant decrease in the total sulphydryl groups. The activities of antioxidant enzymes like catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were decreased. The levels of antioxidants like reduced and oxidized glutathione were significantly decreased compared to control. Administration of rats with an AEPF (100 mg/kg body wt.) prior to bromobenzene administration showed several beneficial effects like: (i) complete protection on mitochondrial respiration, RCR and P/O ratios (ii) lipid peroxides and protein carbonyl levels were significantly lowered (iii) increased the levels of sulphydryl groups and the activity of antioxidant enzymes and (iv) significant increase in the levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione. Vitamin E was used as positive control and bromobenzene induced mitochondrial dysfunction was protected better with AEPF compared to vitamin E.

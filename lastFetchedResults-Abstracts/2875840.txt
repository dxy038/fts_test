Cellular Automata is significantly applying to image processing operations. This paper describes the application of cellular automata (CA) to various morphological operations such as thinning and thickening of binary images. The description about the use of training of cellular automata for thinning and thickening of binary images is illustrated by this paper. The selection of the best rule set from large search space has been performed on the basis of sequential floating forward search method. The misclassification error between the images obtained by the standard function and the one obtained by cellular automata rule is used as the objective function. The proposed method is also compared with some standard methods.

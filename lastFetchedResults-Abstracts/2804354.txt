This paper investigates gate drive design for high voltage gallium nitride (GaN) high electron-mobility transistors (HEMT) in a cascade structure. High dv/dt and di/dt switching characteristics of GaN device and its influences on high-side gate drive are analyzed on an 8.4kW bidirectional multi-channel buck/boost battery charger operating in critical conduction mode (CRM). Driving candidates for high-side gate drive are reviewed, and digital isolator based driving architecture is proposed with discussion of PCB layout and package parasitics. Experimental results are conducted in each step for concepts validation.

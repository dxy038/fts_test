It is common practice for a reflective film, for reducing solar gain, to be applied to the windows of guardrooms. The Security Equipment Assessment Laboratory has carried out a series of trials using different combinations of solar gain control reflective films and screen printed privacy films. These were applied on both single and secondary double glazed windows. The objective was to identify the optimum combination which would allow a guard to look out while obscuring the internal view from outside. The trials were undertaken with various levels of ambient lighting both inside and outside the guard room. This paper summarises the results obtained. It is anticipated that the conclusions will have applications outside the original remit of Guard Rooms into similar commercial security scenarios

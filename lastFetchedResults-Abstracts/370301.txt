Nanoparticles formulated from biodegradable polymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) are being extensively investigated as non-viral gene delivery systems due to their controlled release characteristics and biocompatibility. PLGA nanoparticles for DNA delivery are mainly formulated by an emulsion-solvent evaporation technique using PVA as a stabilizer generating negatively charged particles and heterogeneous size distribution. The objective of the present study was to formulate cationically modified PLGA nanoparticles with defined size and shape that can efficiently bind DNA. An Emulsion-diffusion-evaporation technique to make cationic nanospheres composed of biodegradable and biocompatible co-polyester PLGA has been developed. PVA-chitosan blend was used to stabilize the PLGA nanospheres. The nanospheres were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), photon-correlation spectroscopy (PCS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Zeta potential and gel electrophoresis studies were also performed to understand the surface properties of nanospheres and their ability to condense negatively charged DNA. The designed nanospheres have a zeta potential of 10 mV at pH 7.4 and size under 200 nm. From the gel electrophoresis studies we found that the charge on the nanospheres is sufficient to efficiently bind the negatively charged DNA electrostatically. These cationic PLGA nanospheres could serve as potential alternatives of the existing negatively charged nanoparticles.

In this paper, multi-objective optimization of sandwich panels with open and prismatic core has been studied. Naming these panels is based on the number of corrugations (n) of the core. The panel is considered as a heat exchanger that is loaded under longitudinal loading simultaneously. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization is used by considering weight and heat transfer index as objective function. Optimization is carried out so that the panel has minimum weight and maximum heat transfer index simultaneously; moreover it will not suffer from yielding and buckling in face and core plates. The results showed that two panels, i.e. n=1 and n=7 are very suitable in one-objective and two-objective optimizations. Also, maximum of heat transfer index obtained by a certain panel is nearly the same in various loadings. Pareto diagrams achieved out of two-objective optimization have two separate areas where in one area weight increase may cause an intense increase in heat transfer index and in another area this index remains almost constant. The diagrams are helpful in selecting suitable panel and its geometric dimensions based on significance of each objective functions. Comparing the results indicate efficiency of particle swarm method in one-objective and two-objective optimization of the panels.

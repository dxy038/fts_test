The use of flexible model for determining optimal cropping pattern in different regions interest researchers. In the present study different types of fuzzy goal models for determining cropping pattern used in Khorasan Razavi province have been tried. Three optimal cropping patterns with different weights in the objective function were estimated. Wheat, barley, corn, sugar beet, cotton and tomato are portion products studied. Research findings showed that among these three types of optimal cropping pattern there is no perceptible difference. There are Wheat, barley, corn and tomatoes in all optimal cropping patterns. Sugar beets and cotton products have been removed from all optimal cropping patterns. Therefore, it is recommended that to prevent the removal of these two products of cropping, real patterns in the future should be taken using promotion and protection of agricultural policies.

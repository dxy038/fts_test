Development of processes for the production of value added products (VAPs), such as biopesticides, microbial inoculants or industrial enzymes through biotransformation of raw or pre-treated wastewater sludge (WWS) has undergone a substantial progress over the last decade. WWS based VAPs are low cost biological alternatives that can compete with chemicals or other cost intensive biological products in the current markets. However, when WWS is used as a raw material for VAPs production, questions still remains on the persistence of organic pollutants within the biotransformed WWS, especially, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and the production of their toxic intermediates. WWS pre-treatment prior to biotransformation as well as the microbial strains used for biotransformation can possibly remove these organic pollutants. The literature findings concerning the impact of WWS pre-treatment and value added products on EDCs removal are reviewed in this paper. The microbial potential to degrade or detoxify EDCs and toxic intermediates concomitant with value-addition is also discussed. The concept of obtaining EDCs free-WWS based VAPs and simultaneously achieving the objective of pollution control is presented.

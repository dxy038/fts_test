This paper deals with on-line estimation and control of a biological wastewater treatment plant process. The objective of the control is to force the residual substrate and the dissolved oxygen to track a given set point despite the disturbances and system parameter uncertainties. The control law is based on a NLGPC embedded with a nonlinear closed loop paradigm. The control approach structure is combined with the Kalman Filter, for the on-line reconstruction of unmeasured biological states and unknown parameters of the bioprocess. The efficiency of both the control and estimation are demonstrated via computer simulations.

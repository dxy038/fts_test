Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis has the ability to invade type II alveolar epithelial cells. As a result, the associations between invasion of alveolar epithelial cells and pathogenesis of lung infection seem strong..

Objectives: The current study aimed to evaluate the presence of M. tuberculosis in patients with lung cancer..

Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on samples collected from 380 patients with lung cancer who referred to two state-run hospitals in Mashhad, Iran. Microscopic and cultural methods were utilized to assess the presence of M. tuberculosis in the patients` specimens..

Results: The subjects included 252 (66.3%) males and 128 (33.7%) females. Based on cultural and microscopic methods, M. tuberculosis infection was observed in twenty six (6.8%) of cases..

Conclusions: Results of the current study showed the high prevalence of M. tuberculosis among the patients with lung cancer; therefore, it seems that continuous surveillance is essential to monitor the M. tuberculosis in the patients with lung cancer.

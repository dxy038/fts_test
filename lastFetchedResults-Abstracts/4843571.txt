In the chemical process, safety guarantee has become the hot issue with common concern. However, in current running-process, monitoring points are massive and the relation among them is complex, which lead to the trouble in guaranteeing the production safety. A new method based on matter-element analysis is put forward to guide the programming of monitoring points, which is composed of matter-element expression, both-interval dependent function establishment, improved weight certainty. Through the actual application in purified terephthalic acid (PTA) solvent system of a chemical plant, cases study and comparison show that the proposed method is significantly better than traditional methods. It is more objective and effective, and provides a more detailed monitoring strategy under the premise of safety production, so that exploits a new way to monitoring management in chemical process.

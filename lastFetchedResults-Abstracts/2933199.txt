Optimal trajectory planning problems are often formulated as constrained variational problems. In general, solutions to variational problems are determined by appropriately discretizing the underlying objective functional and solving the resulting nonlinear programming problem(s) numerically. Determining global minima through these methods is often computationally expensive, and therefore is of limited value when optimal trajectories need to be frequently computed and/or re-computed. In this paper, a realistic class of optimal trajectory planning problems is defined for which the existence of fast numerical solution techniques are demonstrated. To illustrate the practicality of this class of trajectory planning problems and the proposed solution techniques, three optimal trajectory planning problems for spray coating applications are formulated and solved

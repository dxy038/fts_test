The objective of this study is to presume the human psychological condition with the biological signal, and to control the living environment automatically based on the result. In this paper, the influence of living environment on the human body was examined as a fundamental study. It is considered that the indoor living environment typified by light environment has a strong influence on the human body, because modern people live indoors almost all day. The influence of environment light on physiological response was evaluated. Biological reactions stimulated by red, green and blue light were analyzed using an ECG (electrocardiogram), EEG (electroencephalogram) and MEG (magnetoencephalogram). As a result, a significant difference was observed between green and red light in LF/HF obtained from ECG, percentage of alpha wave rate obtained from EEG and amplitude of P300 obtained from MEG. In addition, the possibility was suggested that green light induces a rest state whereas red light induces a concentrated state. Based on the results, the effect of light on the physiological response was discussed toward the construction of automated control system of living environment triggered by biological signal.

Objective
ts diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) are believed to undergo personality changes, which could have implications for how they perceive themselves and are perceived by others. We endeavored to examine the extent to which patients' self-perceptions are congruent with how they are perceived by significant others across five trait domains as demarcated by the well known Five-Factor Model (FFM).
s
O Five-Factor Inventory (NEOFFI) (Costa and McCrae, 1992) was administered to women with MS (n=70) and their spouses or partners. Pearson correlations and general linear models (GLMs) were employed to test for differences between patient self-reports and partner reports of FFM traits.
s
ation analyses revealed good correspondence between patient and partner NEOFFI data in relapsing-remitting MS patients, but not secondary progressive patients. There was no significant correlation among progressive course patients for all NEOFFI domains, except Agreeableness. GLMs revealed significant differences where patients rated themselves higher than their partners rated them in Extraversion and Openness.
sion
discrepancies in the way patients and partners view patient personality are probably multidimensional and may have neurological and/or psychological causes. The direction of the discrepancies are consistent with some prior research suggesting MS, which is a disease affecting both the cerebral white and gray matter, may give rise to lowering in self awareness. Conversely, patients may be finding emotional or personal benefits in their response to the disease unbeknownst to partners.

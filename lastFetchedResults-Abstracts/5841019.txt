Managing computer and network security programs has become an increasingly difficult and challenging job. Dramatic advances in computing and communications technology during the past few years have redirected the focus of data processing from the computing center to the terminals in individual offices and homes. The result is that managers must now monitor security on a more widely dispersed level. These changes are continuing to accelerate, making the security managerÂ´s job increasingly difficult. In this paper a better solution for Information Security management has been proposed by designing PrISM (Preventive Information Security Management). PrISM aims to develop and deploy an indigenous Information Security Management System (ISMS) with intrusion prevention capabilities. The objective is to develop an ISMS with appropriate security assurance controls and risk handling processes. This will provide best protection of critical assets against information warfare attacks. The task has been planned by performing reverse engineering of Open Source Security Information Management (OSSIM) system. A detailed discussion on OSSIM and commercially available software Event Horizon has also been presented.

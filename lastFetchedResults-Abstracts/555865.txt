j Introduction & Objective: Based on the carried out studies, the j prevalence of dental caries in preschool children is high and j ranges from 31.64 to 83.7 percents in Iran. The dmft criterion is not [ able to compute the impact of neighboring teeth on caries status of [a tooth in deciduous teeth. The purpose of this study was to j investigate the above issue in a sample of 3-5 years old children in j Tehran during 2008-2009.
j Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a group of j 400, 3-5 years old children who lived in Tehran and referred to j Pediatric Dentistry Department of the Dentistry Faculty of Tehran ; University of Medical Sciences, Iran, for treatment of their [ deciduous teeth were investigated The demographic variables and [ mouth health cares data were collected by a questionnaire and the [caries status of deciduous teeth were diagnosed by standard ! methods. The caries statuses were considered as spatially [correlated binary data. The auto logistic regression model was [implemented for inspecting the association of a tooth and its [neighboring teeth which consists of two adjacent teeth and the j opponent tooth. The effects of factors were tested using z-score.
[ Results: The fitted model and the computed criteria showed that i there was a strong dependency between caries statuses of a tooth [and its three neighbors (including the two adjacent and the [vertically opponent teeth) (p=0.0001). Also the effect of spatial auto [covariate which is equivalent to the sum of statuses of nearest [ neighbors of a tooth is highly significant. Furthermore, the effects [ of local variables such as jaw and posterior-anterior positions were [ also highly significant (p=0.0001).
[Conclusions: In deciduous teeth, the three nearest neighbors [ have a high effect on a tooth. As a result, the teeth in maxilla and [ posterior locations are decayed sooner than the other ones. These [findings may be considered in preventive programs of health of [ mouth and tooth in children.

The objective of this paper is to analyze the heat transfer characteristics of the linear variable reluctance motor using a thermal resistance model. The proposed model is suitable for rapid thermal performance evaluation in the early stages of motor design. The linear motor under consideration operates with continuous periodic excitation and long-stroke reciprocating motion, allowing modeling simplifications based on rms velocity and symmetry. The accuracy of the thermal resistance model is verified by a finite element analysis

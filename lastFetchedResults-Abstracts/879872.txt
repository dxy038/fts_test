Introduction & Objective: Study of bone quality before treatment is very important. The aims of this study were to assess bone quality with density values obtained by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and to determine the correlations between bone density and primary stability of dental implants.
Materials & Methods: In this experimental in vitro study 32 implants were inserted into fresh  sheep bone. The bone densities of implant recipient sites were determined by CBCT. The maximum insertion torque value of each implant was recorded and stability was measured by Osstell. Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlations among the variables.
Results: The mean density value, insertion torque, and Osstell value were 1481.78?166.614, 74.69?16.33 and 73.78?4.025 N/cm2 respectively. Statistically no significant correlations were found among the variables.
Conclusion: The bone quality evaluated by CBCT showed no correlation with the primary stability of the implants.

In this paper, we show how sociocultural theories inform the design of a course in object-oriented programming. An essential learning objective within this philosophy is the programming processes as such. To move toward this learning goal, the course design incorporates a combination of the so-called person-centered and decentered approaches to apprenticeship learning. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the person-centered approach to apprentice learning has been very successful, while the decentered approach is found to be more problematic when it comes to practice. The reason behind this is discussed.

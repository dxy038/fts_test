In many decision problems, criteria can be expressed as linear polynomial and corresponding optimization problems are multi-objective programs of linear type. Modeling of Gauss elimination technique of inequalities is derived for numerical solution of multi-objective linear programming problem by using concept of bounds. The method is quite useful because the calculations involved are simple and take least time. The method has been illustrated by a numerical example also.

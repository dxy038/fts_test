Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of factor V Leiden, prothrombin, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene mutations in women with adverse pregnancy outcome compared with women who had uneventful pregnancies.
Study design
Between 2003 and 2005, pregnant women with ≥1 unexplained second trimester abortion, ≥1 intrauterine fetal death, severe preeclampsia, or severe intrauterine growth restriction (study subjects) were compared with control subjects (uneventful pregnancy) for the frequency of the mutations.
Results
The cases of 91 patients in each arm were analyzed. Obstetric complications were second trimester abortions (16.5%), intrauterine fetal death (53.8%), preeclampsia (8.8%), and severe intrauterine growth restriction (20.9%). Study subjects were more likely to be older and multiparous compared with control subjects. The 2 groups showed no difference in the incidence of smoking or family history of thrombosis, but study subjects were more likely to have a positive family history of obstetric complications. The prevalence of factor V Leiden (12.1% vs 18.7%; P = .304), prothrombin (7.7% vs 5.5%; P = .765), methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene mutations (53.8% vs 65.9%; P = .130), and >1 mutation (11.0% vs 17.6%; P = .290) was not significantly different between study subjects and control subjects.
Conclusion
Factor V Leiden, prothrombin, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene mutations did not seem to play a significant role in adverse pregnancy outcome in our population.

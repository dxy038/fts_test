The objective of the current investigation is to determine the soft-tissue biocompatibility of sol–gel matrices which can be used to optimize the properties of implantable glucose sensors. The biocompatibility of sol–gel matrices with heparin, dextran sulphate, Nafion®, polyethylene glycol, and polystyrene sulphonate was examined in vitro in simulated body fluid and with cell culture experiments using human dermal fibroblasts. Finally, an in vivo study was performed. Therefore, sol–gel coated polystyrene discs were inserted subcutaneously in the back of rabbits. After 4 and 12 weeks, the implants with surrounding tissue were retrieved and processed histologically. In simulated body fluid, the formation of a granular calcium phosphate precipitate was observed. Cell proliferation on polyethylene glycol, Nafion®, and heparin coated substrates was comparable to control samples and significantly higher than on dextran sulphate and polystyrene sulphate coated substrates. Light microscopic evaluation of the retrieved in vivo samples showed a fair tissue reaction to all materials. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that there were no differences in tissue response to the different sol–gel coatings. In conclusion, sol–gel matrices exhibit a fair biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo. These results will form the basis for further research into the real merits of sol–gel coatings in optimizing the properties of subcutaneously implantable glucose sensors.

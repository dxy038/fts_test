Objective(s): To compare anemia status between pregnant and non-pregnant women living in Gorgan villages.
Material & Methods: This was a descriptive study. For the study purposes, 415 women aged between 18 and 35 from 20 Gorgan villages were entered into the study using cluster and simple sampling method. In all, 48 pregnant and 361 non-pregnant women were compared. After sampling, hematological examinations were carried out by Coulter Counter. Scrum iron and TJBC were determined using spectrometry. In pregnant women serum iron, Ugh and T.S. Tess than 30 mg/di, 11g/dl and 16% respectively, but in non-pregnant women they were considered as anemic if the serum iron, Hgb and T.S. were less than 40 micgldl, 1201 and 16% was regarded as anemia respectively.
Results: In pregnant women, the prevalence of anemia on the hasis of serum, T.S. and Hgb was 24.2%, 42.4% and 18.2% respectively, but in non- pregnant women this was 21.2%, 34.55% and 20.98% respectively. There was no significant difference between two groups (P>0.05). However, there was a significant difference between the number of last deliveries and scrum T.S (P<0.03). The mean of MCV, CMI-f and MCIIC during 2nd stages of pregnancy was less than 1st and 3rd or non- pregnant women.
Conclusion: The results showed although there was no significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant women, anemia is one of the nutritional problems in women in rural Gorgan, so supplementary iron has to be administered during pregnancy period.

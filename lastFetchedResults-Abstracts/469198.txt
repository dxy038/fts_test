Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative pain after the administration of topical bupivacaine during laparoscopic sterilization with Filshie clips.
Study Design
Sixty-three women who underwent laparoscopic tubal sterilization with Filshie clips were assigned randomly to receive topical bupivacaine or placebo. Presence of pain, pain intensity, nausea, vomiting, timing of request for pain medication, and pain medication requirements were assessed postoperatively.
Results
Patient demographics were similar between the 2 groups. Topical bupivacaine decreased the incidence (P = .005) and intensity (P = .028) of postoperative pain at 30 minutes. No differences in incidence or severity of pain were seen at hospital discharge or on postoperative day 1.
Conclusion
Topical bupivacaine that is applied to the fallopian tubes at the time of laparoscopic tubal sterilization with the Filshie clip decreases immediate postoperative pain.

Objective: Tilmicosin (TIL) is a long-acting macrolide antibiotic used to treat cattle for
pathogens that cause bovine respiratory disease. However, overdoses of this medication
have been reported to induce cardiac damage. Our experimental objective was to evaluate
the protective effects of Spirulina platensis (SP) administration against TIL-induced
cardiotoxicity in mice.
Materials and Methods: Our experimental in vivo animal study used 40 male albino mice
that were divided into five groups of eight mice per group. The first group served as a control
group and was injected with saline. The second group received SP at dose of 1000 mg/kg
body weight for five days. The third group received a single dose of TIL (75 mg/kg, subcutaneously).
Groups 4 and 5 were given SP at doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight for five
consecutive days just before administration of TIL at the same dose and regimen used for
group 3.
Results: TIL treated animals showed a significant increase in serum cardiac injury biomarkers
as well as cardiac lipid peroxidation, however they had evidence of an inhibition in antioxidant
biomarkers. SP normalized elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
creatine kinase (CK), and CK-MB. Furthermore, SP reduced TIL-induced lipid peroxidation
and oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner.
Conclusion: Administration of SP minimized the toxic effects of TIL by its free radicalscavenging
and potent antioxidant activity.

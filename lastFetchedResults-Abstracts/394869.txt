In order to establish norms for the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) among young adult women, the questionnaire was administered to a large general population sample of women aged 18–42 yr in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) region of Australia. Normative data were derived for EDE-Q subscales and for the occurrence of specific eating disorder behaviours, for each of five age bands (18–22, 23–27, 28–32, 33–37, 38–42 yr). Mean scores (SDs) for the Restraint, Eating Concern, Weight Concern and Shape Concern subscales for the total sample (n=5,255) were, respectively, 1.30 (1.40), 0.76 (1.06), 1.79 (1.51) and 2.23 (1.65). The mean global score was 1.52 (1.25). The regular occurrence of objective and subjective overeating episodes was reported by 10.6% and 12.7% of participants, respectively. The regular use of self-induced vomiting, laxative misuse, and use of diuretics, was reported by 1.4%, 1.0%, and 0.3%, of participants, respectively, while 2.2% of participants reported regularly using diet pills. “Extreme dietary restraint” and “excessive exercise” were reported by 3.4% and 4.9% of participants, respectively. Both attitudinal and behavioural features of eating disorder psychopathology tended to decrease with increasing age. These data will inform researchers intending to use the EDE-Q in epidemiological studies.

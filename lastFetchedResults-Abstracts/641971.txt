Objective
We investigated whether food restriction offers protection against the toxicity of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and, if so, at what percentage of restriction.
Methods
The effects of food restriction (75% and 50% of food intake) and food restriction followed by CCl4 treatment on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes were studied in female Wistar rats. A single dose of CCl4 (3 mL/kg of body weight, subcutaneous) was administered at the end of the 30-d feeding period.
Results
The magnitude of increase in lipid peroxidation was less after CCl4 treatment in food-restricted animals than in animals fed ad libitum (control), whereas alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase activities in plasma were enhanced due to CCl4 treatment. The magnitude of increase in the marker enzymes was less in food-restricted animals than in control animals. Erythrocytes from food-restricted rats were more resistant to hydrogen peroxideâ€“induced peroxidation than were those from control rats. The activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-S-transferase were higher in food-restricted animals.
Conclusions
The present results suggested that food restriction can minimize drug-related increases in peroxidation and protect the system against drug toxicity, presumably by induction of antioxidant potential.

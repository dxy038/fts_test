A new zooming algorithm suitable for single-sensor imaging devices is introduced. The proposed method is capable of zooming and enlarging data acquired by single sensor cameras operating on the Bayer color filter array (CFA) pattern. The approach allows for operations on noise-free data at the hardware level. Complexity and cost implementation are thus greatly reduced. Based on a color difference model and an adaptive edge-sensing mechanism, the proposed method produces sharp, visually pleasing outputs. At the same time, it yields excellent performance, in terms of both subjective and objective image quality measure.

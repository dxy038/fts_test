Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DST) provides the assessment of the left ventricle deformation parameters strain (St) and strain rate (SR). The objective of this study was to evaluate St and SR under the influence of romifidine in healthy horses and horses affected with heart disease. The study subjects were 45 privately owned horses. Valvular insufficiencies were identified by color Doppler in 21 out of 45 horses. Dimensional changes were identified in 13 of these 21 horses. These dimensional changes included dilatations of the left ventricle (130 ± 8.95 mm) and/or the left atrium (141 ± 4.8 mm). The other 24 horses were without echocardiographic findings and had normal heart dimensions. Based on clinical signs, echo-, and electrocardiographic examinations, 24 horses were categorized as group 1 (healthy), 13 as group 2 (heart disease without dimensional changes), and 8 as group 3 (heart disease with dimensional changes). The radial St and SR were assessed in the left ventricular free wall and the interventricular septum using 2DST. After application of romifidine, a significant reduction of St and the systolic peak of SR were found in all three groups. Group 3 showed the most significant reduction of these parameters (41.5%). The reduction of St and SR under romifidine showed a reduced myocardial function, which is more obvious in horses with cardiac dilatation. It can be assumed that heart disease with myocardial dilatation leads to decreasing myocardial function, which becomes more obvious after romifidine application and of clinical importance in horses with severe heart disease and cardiac dilatation.

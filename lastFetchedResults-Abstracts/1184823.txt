The design of rigid pavements according to AUSTROADS involves assuming a pavement structure then using a number of tables and figures to calculate the two governing design criteria, the flexural fatigue of the concrete base and the erosion of the sub-grade/sub-base. Each of these two criteria needs to be less than 100%. The designer needs to ensure that both criteria are near 100% so that safe and economical designs are achieved. This paper presents a formulation for the problem of optimum rigid road pavement design by defining the objective function, which is the total cost of pavement materials, and all the constraints that influence the design. A genetic algorithm is used to find the optimum design. The results obtained from the genetic algorithm are compared with results obtained from a Newtonâ€“Raphson based optimisation solver. The latter being developed using spreadsheets.

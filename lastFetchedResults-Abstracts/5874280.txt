We propose an application-driven Multiuser resource allocation and packet scheduling concept for wireless video streaming. The downlink transmission of multiple video sequences to multiple users over a shared resource-limited wireless channel however is a tough task. Among the many challenges in this area are the limited available resources, like bandwidth and power, time-varying channel conditions and the different transmission requirements of different video content. This work takes into account the time-varying nature of the wireless channels, as well as the importance of individual video packets, to develop a cross-layer resource allocation and packet scheduling scheme for multiuser video streaming over wireless networks. That accurate channel feedback is not available at the scheduler, the objective of the optimization is to minimize the expected distortion of the received sequence, where the expectation is calculated at the scheduler with respect to the packet loss probability in the channel. The proposed scheme is formulated as a joint optimization over the resource allocation and channel loss protection, in order to minimize the distortion of the received video sequences. Our simulation result show that the proposed scheme performs significantly better than a conventional content independent scheme of video transmission.

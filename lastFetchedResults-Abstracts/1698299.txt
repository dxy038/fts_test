Results obtained with the recently developed double reflection electron emission microscope applied in different imaging modes are presented. The novel illumination system is based on a (100)-oriented single crystalline W wire electron microreflector and an electron gun placed in the back focal plane of the immersion objective. After being elastically reflected from the W tip surface, the primary electrons of energy ranging from 1 to 6 keV are decelerated to the desired impact energy in the range 0 to 200 eV for mirror electron microscopy (MEM), low energy electron emission microscopy (LEEM) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) modes or to 5 keV for the secondary electron imaging mode. Photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM), MEM, LEEM, secondary images of Pd/Si(111) and a set of selected area LEED patterns of the W(100) surface taken at energies ranging from 5 to 40 eV are presented for the first time.

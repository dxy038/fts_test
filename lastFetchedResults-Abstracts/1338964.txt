Postpartum metritis is a common problem in many animal species. In equine medicine, sequelae of postpartum metritis vary from delay in uterine involution to development of systemic acute metritis (SAM), toxemia, and laminitis. Heavy draft mares potentially have higher risk of suffering from SAM than light breed mares. Postpartum fever (PF) mostly appears as a sign of SAM. The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors affecting the incidence of PF in 158 foalings from 62 heavy draft mares by multiple logistic regressions. The objective variable was the incidence of PF, and the explanatory variables were year foaled, month foaled, age of mare, breed of mare (crossbred heavy draft horse vs. Percheron), gestation length, foaling difficulty (easy delivery vs. dystocia), retained fetal membranes, stillbirth, and sex of offspring. Twenty-four out of 158 mares were diagnosed with PF. Stepwise regression analysis showed that breed of dams and foaling difficulty were significant risk factors for PF. Percheron mares had higher risk than crossbred mares (odds ratio: 3.4). Dystocia had higher risk than easy delivery (odds ratio: 3.3). Percheron mares had higher incidence of PF than crossbred mares even in the cases of easy delivery. Risks for damage and contamination of birth canal will be increased especially if the fetal delivery needs assistance. The results of this study suggest that it is necessary to consider the foaling difficulty and the breed of dams for earlier detection of PF in peripartum heavy draft mares.

For the efficient long-range non-destructive health examination of pipes, ultrasonic guided wave NDT has been widely used. The objective of the research presented is to investigate the feasibility of detecting defect in high-pressure pipe using ultrasonic guided wave NDT technology based on magnetostrictive effect. Both theoretical calculation and experimental analysis for one standard pipe are carried out; good match are obtained. Another identical pipe with an artificial fabricated dent defect is inspected using magnetostrictive guided waves at 83 kHz when it bears 5 MPa high-pressure gas. The signals reflected from the dent can be distinguished successfully. The results of the experiment show that the ultrasonic guided wave based on magnetostrictive effect has great potential for inspecting high-pressure pipe.

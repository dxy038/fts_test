Objective To observe the color vision testing and training improves Chinese Medicine inspection diagnosis teaching effectiveness.

Farnsworth-Munsell 100 HUE Test system was used to evaluate the students´ color discrimination ability. After the first test, students receive two-week training. And then Testing Error Score and different tone color vision ability was collected to analysis the students´ color vision ability. Results After training, among all 98 tested students, there are 82 persons´ (84.67%) level of color discrimination ability raised, 12 (12.26%) declined, 4 (4.08%) unchanged. The average TES of students score as good in the first test reduced from 10.55&#177;5.63 to 7.23&#177;8.36, within normal group reduced from 46.51&#177;20.69 to 22.86&#177;22.95, in poor group reduced from 122.13 &#177;26.21 to 46.63&#177;34.43, the difference was statistically significant (p&lt;;0.05). Compared with other 3 groups, red-yellow hue color discrimination ability improvement is most significant (p&lt;;0.05). Conclusion This study provides the teaching of inspection diagnosis an objective assessment and training tools. By using FM100 Hue Test, the ability of medical students´ color discrimination can be effectively improved.

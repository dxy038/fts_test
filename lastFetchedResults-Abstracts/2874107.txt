The prosthesis is the device which replace the missing part or structure, can be inside or outside the human body. The prosthetic alignment is the method to find the optimal prosthetic function and a very important for efficiency and effectiveness delivery of the prostheses. Good alignment can reflex the better of gait pattern, more natural of gait cycle and less energy consumption during locomotion. Coupling is an additional component which uses for increasing the capacity of alignment adjustability. The objective of project is to develop the new coupling design which is easy to do adjustment, light weight, can be used for endoskeleton and exoskeleton prostheses, extensive adjustment and inexpensive price. The aim of the study has been focusing on the design and analyses of stress - strain distribution in new coupling for lower limb prosthesis (CLLP) using finite element method. The component is designed by using SolidWorks program and analyzed by COSMOSWorks program in order to study the stress - strain distribution. The result of the study has shown that the maximum of stress and strain is 22.64 MPa and 5.55 KPa at the screw connection area respectively. Moreover, displacement and deformation on the component is not present. For the result of the range of alignment adjustability, the maximum of anterior/posterior and medial/lateral translation is about 2 centimeters on each direction, 45 degree in medial rotation and 45 degree in lateral rotation. Further study is going to focus on the mechanical testing and clinical trial with the transtibial and transfemoral amputee.

The main objective of this paper is to simplify the implementation of continuous and discontinuous 3-D space vector pulsewidth modulations (SVPWMs). This paper analyzes the relationships, whether in or coordinates, between three-phase voltages and the following elements: the tetrahedron in which the reference vector resides, three adjacent active switching vectors (or three switching states), and their duration times. Based on the analysis, the calculation of the turn-on time of each switch in the actual implementation is simplified, and discontinuous PWM (DPWM) methods in three-leg inverters can be extended to four-leg inverters without the phase angle. In addition, two more DPWM methods that are peculiar to 3-D SVPWM are presented. This simplified algorithm does not use irrational operations or look-up tables, and it alleviates the computation burden of the processor. The simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Objective Relapse prevention is the main goal of maintenance
treatment in schizophrenia. This study aimed to
determine the rate and the socio-demographic and clinical
predictors of relapse in Chinese schizophrenia patients
following treatment of the acute phase of the illness.
Methods In a multi-center, randomized, controlled, longitudinal
study, 404 patients with schizophrenia who were
clinically stabilized following an acute episode were randomly
assigned to either the maintenance (i.e., initial optimal
therapeutic doses continued throughout the study) or the dosereduction
group (i.e., initial optimal therapeutic doses continued
for 4 or 26 weeks followed by a 50% dose reduction
that was maintained until the end of the study). Participants
were interviewed at entry using standardized assessment
instruments, and followed up for 12–26 months.
Results In univariate analyses, relapse was significantly
associated with the membership of the dose-reduction
group, poor medication adherence, and having a diagnosis
of the paranoid type of schizophrenia. In Cox proportionalhazards
regression analysis the membership of the dosereduction
group, poorer medication adherence, more severe
drug-induced side effects and prominent paranoid symptoms
independently predicted a higher risk of relapse.
Conclusion The study confirmed the importance of
maintenance medication in preventing relapse in Chinese
schizophrenia patients underscoring the risk of relapse
associated with lack of treatment adherence, severe side
effects and the patients’ paranoid attitude. Socio-demographic
characteristics were not associated with relapse in
Chinese schizophrenia patients. Potential residual confounding
caused by unmeasured variables should be fully
considered in future studies.

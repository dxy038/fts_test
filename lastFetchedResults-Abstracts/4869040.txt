A LMSS propagation experiment has been carried out in Europe in the framework of ESAÂ´s PROSAT phase II program using the MARECS satellite. Its objective was to analyze the propagation factors required to design the LMSS (land mobile satellite system) planned for Europe. From the statistical analysis of the data collected during the measuring campaigns, which took place in various environments in Spain (in an area where the MARECS elevation angle is 39&#176;), North of France (elevation angle 26&#176;) and Sweden (elevation angle 13&#176;), the authors have reached the following conclusions: shadowing is the main impairment in LMSS propagation, multipath is usually at least 11 dB below the direct signal level, and, the unshadowed direct signal level varies due to the combined effect of antenna pattern irregularities and the movement of the van. After some propagation considerations, the development of a model is described, and some examples of application are shown

Fatiguing exercise substantially decreases muscle glycogen concentration in horses, impairing athletic performance in subsequent exercise bouts. Our objective was to determine the effect of ingestion of starch-rich meals after exercise on whole body glucose kinetics and muscle glycogen replenishment. In a randomized, cross-over study seven horses with exercise-induced muscle glycogen depletion were either not fed for 8 h, fed half of the daily energy requirements (∼15 Mcal DE) as hay, or fed an isocaloric amount of corn 15 min and 4 h after exercise. Starch-rich meals fed after exercise, when compared to feed withholding, resulted in mild to moderate hyperglycemia (5.7 ± 0.3 vs. 4.7 ± 0.3 mM, P &lt; 0.01) and hyperinsulinemia (79.9 ± 9.3 vs. 39.0 ± 1.9 pM, P &lt; 0.001), 3-fold greater whole body glucose kinetics (15.5 ± 1.4 vs. 5.3 ± 0.4 μmol kg−1 min−1, P &lt; 0.05), but these only minimally enhanced muscle glycogen replenishment (171 ± 19 vs. 170 ± 56 and 260 ± 45 vs. 294 ± 29 mmol/kg dry weight immediately and 24 h after exercise, P &gt; 0.05). It is concluded that after substantial exercise-induced muscle glycogen depletion, feeding status only minimally affects net muscle glycogen concentrations after exercise, despite marked differences in soluble carbohydrate ingestion and availability of glucose to skeletal muscle.

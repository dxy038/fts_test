Wireless sensor networks consist of many small nodes with sensing, computation and communication capabilities. Being organized into a network, sensors perform some distributed sensing operation in a target area. Addressing problem focuses on dynamic allocation of addresses to sensor nodes. In this paper, the authors present a short survey of the state-of-the-art addressing techniques for sensor networks that frequently appear in the literature. The authors classify the addressing techniques and describe individual scheme with the specific objective of the scheme. The authors also study the design trade-offs considered by the respective schemes and make a comparison among the techniques.

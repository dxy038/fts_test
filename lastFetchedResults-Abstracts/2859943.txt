The main objective of large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to monitor physical phenomenon of interest in a given Region of Interest using sensors and provide collected data to the sink node. Designing of such WSNs should focus on minimizing nodesÂ´ energy consuming so as to keep the network alive as long as possible. In this paper, we propose to partition this large-scale network (sensor field) into fan-shaped clusters. Then based on this clustering, we design mechanisms including cluster head (CH) selection, cluster re-partition, and routing, to achieve network lifetime maximization.

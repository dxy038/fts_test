As Internet grows exponentially, scalable routers are the next step on the backbone with multiple-plane and multiple-stage (MPMS) switching network to provide QoS guarantees. Until now, most scheduling schemes in switching networks are simply designed to guarantee countable priority services, which are not suitable for the QoS requirements of increasing applications, namely voice (VoIP), video (IPTV) and data. Different from traditional strict-priority based scheduling intensively used in industry, in this paper, we try to discuss a novel issue from the objective of optimal QoS utility scheduling (OQUS). We first provide the graphic model of MPMS switching network, and then construct its OQUS model based on utility functions of multiple QoS parameters for different service levels. We proved the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal solution to the OQUS model in the MPMS switching network. Lastly, we discussed an effective punishing function solution (PFS) to the OQUS model and provided the iteration steps for the optimal solution to the OQUS model in the MPMS switching network.

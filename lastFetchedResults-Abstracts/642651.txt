Abstract
Objective
We compared the tolerance of early (within the first 24 h after admission to the pediatric intensive care unit) and late transpyloric enteral nutrition in critically ill children.
Methods

We performed a prospective observational study including all critically ill children fed using transpyloric enteral nutrition. The clinical characteristics, energy intake, tolerance, and complications of nutritional delivery between the children with early (first 24 h) and late (after 24 h, range 1–43 d) transpyloric enteral nutrition were compared.
Results

Transpyloric nutrition was started within the first 24 h in 202 (38.5%) of the 526 children. There were no differences in the diagnoses, incidence of organ disturbances, doses of vasoactive drugs, or mortality between the two groups. There were no differences in the maximum number of calories delivered or in the duration of the nutrition between children with early and late transpyloric nutrition. The incidence of abdominal distention was lower in the children receiving early transpyloric nutrition (3.5%) than in those receiving nutrition at a later date (7.8%; P < 0.05). Moreover, 6.3% of patients presented diarrhea, with no difference being found between the two groups.
Conclusion

Early transpyloric enteral nutrition is well tolerated in critically ill children and is not associated with an increase in incidence of complications.

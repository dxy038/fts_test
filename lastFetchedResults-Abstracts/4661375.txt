Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools play an essential role in modern microelectronics system design. Such a role becomes even more important as design complexity increases. A comparison between two of the available CAD tool suites is presented along with a detailed description of their features and advantages. OCTTOOLS, and OASIS have been selected as representative public domain tool suites. These suites utilize full-custom and/or the standard-cells semi-custom approaches. The objective of the comparison is to facilitate for proper choice within the tools for the best VLSIC design accomplishments

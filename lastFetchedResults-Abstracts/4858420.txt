This paper presents the enhancement of power quality for a microgrid system at distribution level using Shunt active power filter. The main objective of this paper is to identify a suitable pulse generation technique for obtaining a better compensation capability of shunt active power filter. The compensation capability of the device is mainly depends on the regulation of DC link capacitor voltage. Conventionally fixed hysteresis current control technique has been used. To raise the performance of shunt active power filter, an adaptive hysteresis current control technique has been proposed here. The performance of proposed technique has been verified for different operating condition in the platform of MATLAB/SIMULINK model.

This paper describes the joint research project DABASCO which is supported by the European Community under a cost-shared contract and participated by nine European institutions. The main objective of the project is to provide a generic experimental data base for the development of physical models and correlations for containment thermalhydraulic analysis. The project consists of seven separate-effects experimental programs which deal with new innovative conceptual features, e.g. passive decay heat removal and spray systems. The results of the various stages of the test programs will be assessed by industrial partners in relation to their applicability to reactor conditions.

In this paper, we propose a multiobjective self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm with objective-wise learning strategies (OW-MOSaDE) to solve numerical optimization problems with multiple conflicting objectives. The proposed approach learns suitable crossover parameter values and mutation strategies for each objective separately in a multi-objective optimization problem. The performance of the proposed OW-MOSaDE algorithm is evaluated on a suit of 13 benchmark problems provided for the CEC2009 MOEA Special Session and Competition (http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/epnsugan/) on Performance Assessment of Constrained/Bound Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms.

The objective of this study was to determine concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone (P4) and 17β-estradiol (E2) in sows from a line selected on an index which emphasized ovulation rate (Select) and from a control line. A further classification of the sows in each line was made according to the estimated number of ovulations during an estrous cycle. Sows in the Select line were ranked into a high (HI) or low group (LI) when their estimated number of ovulations were 25 or more and 14 to 15, respectively. Sows of the control line were classified into groups as high (HC) or low (LC) when the estimated values for ovulation rate were 14–15 and 8–9 ovulations, respectively. Blood samples were collected every 12 h during a complete estrous cycle and samples were analyzed for concentrations of FSH and LH. Samples collected every 24 h were assayed for P4 and E2. Mean concentrations of FSH, LH, P4 and E2 did not differ (P&gt;0.10) between lines or between HI and LI or HC and LC groups. Selection of pigs for ovulation rate and embryonal survival did not affect concentrations of FSH, LH, P4 and E2 in sows during the estrous cycle.

The process of breathing liquid requires consideration of several problems not typical in gas respiration. These problems stem from the physical properties of liquid such as density, viscosity, and low diffusivity of gases which increase respiratory work. The objective of this study was to develop and study the feasibility of a demand controlled system for providing mechanical assistance and ameliorating respiratory work during liquid breathing.

In this paper we consider the mixed model assembly line rebalancing problem in the context of seasonal production which is characterized by remarkable changes of products portfolio over seasons. Starting from a given line balancing strategy the goals are to minimize: (1) the total processing time of reassigned tasks (TTRT) to measure rebalancing cost, combining the reassigned tasks quantity and difficulty of these tasks, which is a refinement of minimizing number of reassigned tasks for rebalancing cost measurement proposed by Gamberini et al.; (2) both the sum of differences between the real station time and cycle time, and total differences of modelsÂ´ station time, which have been known as vertical balancing and horizontal balancing for mixed model assembly line balancing problem. A Multi-objective Genetic-algorithm (MOGA) is used to deal with this mixed model rebalancing problem. To test the MOGA, a small instance is tested.

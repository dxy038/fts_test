The simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) is a simple and effective optimization algorithm. It requires only two measurements of the objective function per iteration regardless of the dimension of the objective function. A modified SPSA algorithms is presented in this research. It requires a single measurement of the objective function per iteration. Application of the proposed algorithm are presented as well as some simulation results.

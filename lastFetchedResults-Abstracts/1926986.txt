The objective of this research is to develop a numerical model for the evaluation of the cooling capability of spent fuel pool (SFP) in removing decay heat. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach has been applied to develop a three-dimensional two-phase thermal hydraulic model. To simplify the analysis, the pressure drop of the coolant flowing through the fuel region in the pool is modeled as a porous-medium. The geometry as well as the boundary conditions of SFP of second nuclear power plant in Taiwan has been employed as sample to be analyzed and simulated numerically. The results show that the current configuration has enough cooling capability to meet the licensing regulations under normal operation and most kinds of conditions. In the case of extremely inappropriate layout of spent fuel arrangement, the computed results illustrate that slight local saturation on fuel rods may occur unless external cooling system is supplied.

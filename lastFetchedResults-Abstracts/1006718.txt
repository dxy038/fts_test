The effective utilization of the cryogenic energy associated with LNG vaporization is quite important. In this paper a cascading power cycle with LNG directly expanding consisting of a Rankine cycle with ammoniaâ€“water as working fluid and a power cycle of combustion gas is proposed to recover cryogenic energy of LNG. Energy equilibrium equations and exergy equilibrium equations of each equipment in the cascading power cycle are established. Taken some operating parameters as key parameters, influences of these parameters on thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of the cascading power cycle were analyzed. Optimization of the cascading power cycle with maximum economic benefits as objective function together with optimum variables and constraint conditions was solved. The optimum objective and variables were achieved.

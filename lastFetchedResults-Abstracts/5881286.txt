PIM (Processor-In-Memory) architectures have been proposed in recent years. One major objective of PIM is to reduce the performance gap between the CPU and memory. To exploit the potential benefits of PIM, we designed a statement base parallelizing system-SAGE. In this paper, we extend this system to achieve better performance by devising several comprehensive optimizing techniques, which include IMOP (Intelligent Memory Operation) recognition, tiling for PIM, and a precise mechanism to get load-balanced execution schedule. The experimental results are also presented and discussed

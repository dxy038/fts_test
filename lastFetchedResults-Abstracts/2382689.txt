Environment is a very great and complexity collection which has been created by a process and evolution of live existences and composer elements of ground area, and so affect the human activities and is affected from that. Industrialization and modernization has let lots of heavy elements to entire into the atmosphere. Elements of the atmosphere will locate on the surface of soil and plants as dry or wet deposit, lastly. Heavy metals usage in industry and necessity of some of them, for influence in some physiologic activities for plants and animals, are different directions that more information from them seems important in environment With attention to the fact that plants are capable to absorb some pollutants by using their air organs especially leaves and reserve in themselves, so biomonitoring through plants is a useful way for approximating pollutants. Shiraz city is one of populated cities that involve air pollution. Due to the position of the city between two head Zagros Mountains, high population growth and also increasing pollutant quantity and quality it seems that the pollution problem has the creasing trend in time. The objective of the present study is to estimate the air pollution tensity for some heavy metals as cu, cd and Pb in high traffic points of Shiraz city by using fraxinus and platanus as nonactive biomonitors.

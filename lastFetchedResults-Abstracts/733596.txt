Objective
To compare trends in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, diagnosed diabetes and numbers of visits to office-based physicians for diabetes care.
Research design and methods

Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1995â€“2004) were used to compare trends among adults aged 18 years and older for overweight, obesity and visits made to office-based physicians where diabetes was the primary diagnosis. Estimates for overweight and obesity and office visits were made for each year.
Results

The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased by nearly 24%. The prevalence of diabetes increased by approximately 76%. The numbers of visits to office-based physicians where diabetes was the primary diagnosis have more than doubled. The average age among adults, who were overweight or obese, was 46.9 years compared to 60.1 years for those seeking care for a diabetes-related issue from an office-based physician.
Conclusions

As the prevalence of overweight and obesity increases, the incidence of diabetes will increase along with the demand for treatment of diabetes later in life. It is imperative to promote population-based programs for reducing overweight and obesity at younger ages in order to reduce the morbidity, mortality and economic cost of the disease as the population ages.

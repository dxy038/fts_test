During June and July 2003 the Sources and Origins of Atmospheric Cloud Droplets experiment (SOACED) was carried out on a mountain-top site in central Sweden. The main objective of the experiment was to characterise the microphysical and chemical properties of cloud droplet residuals and interstitial aerosol particles in continental clouds and to understand the processes controlling cloud properties at this location.

titial and residual aerosol size distributions, cloud liquid water content and species- and size-resolved aerosol mass concentrations are the main variables employed to address questions pertaining to the cloud droplet number concentration and scavenging efficiency during a stratocumulus cloud event observed on July 28, 2003. In this cloud event, about 56% of the aerosol mass was associated with organic species, whilst SO4 accounted for 23% and NH4 for 14%. NO3 and Cl made up about 7% of the total mass.

rtitioning of the aerosol particles between cloud droplets and interstitial air has been studied in terms of their microphysical properties. The scavenging efficiency, defined as the fraction of particles activated into cloud elements compared to the total amount of particles, was investigated as a function of size. The scavenging efficiency curves displayed different shapes during the cloud event, from an S-shaped curve, with low scavenging efficiency in the Aitken mode and larger scavenging efficiency in the accumulation mode, to more unusual shapes where Aitken-mode particles were either solely activated or activated in addition to accumulation-mode particles.

tudy suggests that alterations of the aerosol chemical composition occurred during the measurement period, changing the hygroscopic nature of the CCN and decreasing their activation diameter. It is also hypothesized that entrainment of drier air aloft may have introduced inhomogeneities in the supersaturation field and modified the S-shaped scavenging curves.

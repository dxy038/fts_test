A biogas is a modern energy source and is suitable to necessities of the future with the appropriate application of the digestion technology. The project aims at creating and establishing a fair evaluation system, capable to evaluate and compare efficiency of biogas plants by means of energetic, economical, ecological and socio-economic criteria. Thus, characteristic and objective parameters have been defined, which consider the overall production chain of biogas system, from the cultivation of energy crops, to bio conversion (digestion), on to final gas utilization and use of digested sludge. Detailed data has been collected from plants (banana stem), which generate green electricity by means energy crops, manure, and organic waste. The production of biogas by anaerobic digestion of organic waste is a mature expertise that may clear enough benefits to the former. In addition through the utilization of biogas technology banana stem, cattle waste can be properly handled through anaerobic digestion, the generation of natural fertilizers and ultimately lead to an increase in output and income. Anaerobic digestion not only gives renewable energy, but also improves fertilizing qualities of manure and thus is way of manure treatment that offers the possibility for an environmentally friendly manure management.

The authors discuss the problem of estimating the moving parameters of a rigid body from its visual image projected on the focal plane of a camera. In particular, they consider the case where the objective body has a smooth closed surface and no representative point such as a vertex, and where a single camera is available. In order to determine the required parameters, the contour data of the visual image of the object are used. The method is applicable to a nonconvex object as well as a convex object

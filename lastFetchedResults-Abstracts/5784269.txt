In this paper, we propose a framework for joint normalization of spectral and temporal statistics of speech features for robust speech recognition. Current feature normalization approaches normalize the spectral and temporal aspects of feature statistics separately to overcome noise and reverberation. As a result, the interaction between the spectral normalization (e.g. mean and variance normalization, MVN) and temporal normalization (e.g. temporal structure normalization, TSN) is ignored. We propose a joint spectral and temporal normalization (JSTN) framework to simultaneously normalize these two aspects of feature statistics. In JSTN, feature trajectories are filtered by linear filters and the filtersÂ´ coefficients are optimized by maximizing a likelihood-based objective function. Experimental results on Aurora-5 benchmark task show that JSTN consistently out-performs the cascade of MVN and TSN on test data corrupted by both additive noise and reverberation, which validates our proposal. Specifically, JSTN reduces average word error rate by 8-9% relatively over the cascade of MVN and TSN for both artificial and real noisy data.

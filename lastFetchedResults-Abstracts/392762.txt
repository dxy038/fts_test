Objective
To review the diagnosis, management and outcomes of congenital cervical teratomas presenting to a tertiary referral centre.
Methods
Retrospective chart review of three cases presenting within an 18-month period.
Results
Of the three patients in this series, one was diagnosed antenatally. The remaining cases were diagnosed at birth. The antenatally diagnosed patient underwent an EXIT procedure whereby the airway was secured by tracheostomy. This patient subsequently died 30 min after separation from the materno-foetal circulation. Neither of the other two cases had any neonatal respiratory distress, despite having large tumours. Both patients had neonatal surgical excision of the teratomas performed. Both patients had postoperative respiratory distress, requiring intervention. Both patients made a full recovery. No recurrence has been reported.
Conclusion
The antenatal diagnosis of large congenital cervical teratomas allows for planned intervention by experienced personnel. A successful outcome may not be obtained. All patients that undergo surgical excision of these tumours must be closely observed for post-operative respiratory distress, even in the absence of pre-operative symptoms.

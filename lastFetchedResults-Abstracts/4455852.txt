Islanding operation may occur under circumstance of connection of distributed generation (DG) into power grid. Therefore, the paper proposes principle and strategy for island partition and builds multi-objective mathematical model which takes maximum loading capacity in the island and minimum switch motion as target function. In accordance to characters of the model. The paper presents two-step method for solution, which is characterized by simplicity, convenience in use effective solution and acceptable for practical engineering. Correctness and effectiveness of the solution method and the model are testified by analysis and calculation on a practical system.

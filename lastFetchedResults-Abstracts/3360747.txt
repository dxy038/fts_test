This paper describes an integrated power management IC with bidirectional current capability, aimed at compensating differences in output current between series-connected cells in concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems. The integrated 3.6-MHz power stage allows building a small-form-factor converter per cell. A hysteretic current-mode controller regulates the bidirectional converterÂ´s current to equalize neighboring cell voltages. A phase-locked loop controls the inductor current ripple around the average value to stabilize the switching frequency. The use of hysteretic current-mode control with a novel bidirectional senseFET scheme provides inherent current protection and high reliability. The converter can operate from an input voltage as low as 1.8 V and with an inductor current up to &#177;1.5 A, while achieving a system efficiency above 90% for current mismatches between cells up to 60%. Measurement results show that the converter maximizes the output power of series-connected CPV cells with mismatched output currents.

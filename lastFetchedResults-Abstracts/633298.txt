Objective: Diabetes is the most common metabolic disease. One of the most common problems in diabetic patients is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease which induced by hyperlipidemia. Also there has been currently great interest in the potential contribution of oxidative stress in development of diabetes complications. The present study was performed to associate between lipid oxidizability and serum lipid levels in diabetic patients.
Materials and Methods: In this study, 55 diabetic patients in Yazd Diabetes Research Center were chosen. Lipid oxidizability, HbA1c and serum lipid levels were analyzed in patients. Lipids were measured by enzymatic method. HbA1c was estimated by the ion exchange chromatography. The lipid oxidation procedure was performed by addition of CuCl2. The kinetics of conjugated dienes formation was monitored by spectrophotometer and parameters such as ODmax, Lag Time, Vmax and Tmax were analyzed.
Result: In present study, there was no association between lipid oxidizability and serum lipids levels. Also there was no association between lipid oxidizability parameters and HbA1c.
Conclusion: This study showed that high levels of blood lipids such as cholesterol and triglyceride do not have any effect on maximal amount of lipids peroxide products accumulation and maximal rate of oxidation during the lipid oxidation course.

This paper considers the loading problem for flexible manufacturing systems with partially grouped machines, i.e., machines are tooled differently, but multiple machines can be assigned to each operation. Loading is the problem of allocating operations and their associated cutting tools to machines for a given set of parts. As an extension of the existing studies, we consider unrelated machines, i.e., processing time of an operation depends on the speed of the machine where it is allocated. Also, we consider the practical constraints associated with cutting tools: (a) tool life restrictions; and (b) available number of tool copies. An integer linear programming model is suggested for the objective of balancing the workloads assigned to machines. Then, due to the complexity of the problem, we suggest two-stage heuristics in which an initial solution is obtained and then it is improved. The heuristics were tested on some test instances, and the results are reported.

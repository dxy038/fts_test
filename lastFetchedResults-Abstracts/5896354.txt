A family of local segmentation vector filters for color image noise suppression and detail preservation is proposed. Most state-of-the-art filters alleviate impulse noise well but tend to destroy thin lines, edges and fine image details. The proposed filters facilitate local segmentation to preserve image structures and noise suppression. First the K-VMF is developed and used for local segmentation, and then a selection of vector filters is used to reconstruct the current pixel. In addition, once pixels have been marked as being noisy, their values are not used in processing subsequent pixels. The proposed filters also demonstrated acceptable results for both objective and subjective assessments.

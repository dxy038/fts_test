 The science of voice evaluation and assessment has profited from technological advancement and objective measurement of voice parameters has become an integral part of the voice examination, however, subjective voice evaluation remains a vital component of any voice examination. The Towne-Heuer Reading Passage was developed in 1970 to provide a reading sample that would facilitate subjective voice evaluation. The reliability of the passage was established using three judges listening to 15 normal Philadelphia speakers and 15 vocal abuse-misuse clients with verified vocal nodules. The frequency of hard glottal attack (HGA) was determined for the two groups and high interjudge and intrajudge correlation was found. A difference in the frequency of HGA was found between the two groups.

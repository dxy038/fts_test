We propose a design methodology based on data flow analysis for a functionally distributed, multiprocessor database machine. We define a cost model of database processing with the objective cost being response time of a set of query strategies. Heuristic optimization techniques are proposed using the operations of grouping, decomposition, and replication. We apply the new optimization techniques in several realistic multiprocessor environments. The resulting configurations of multiprocessors demonstrate significant performance improvements over more traditional designs.

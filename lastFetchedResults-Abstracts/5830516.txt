In most wireless sensor network applications a large amount of data has been continuously collected for future data query and analysis, so how to store them becomes one important challenge in such wireless sensor networks. Recently a kind of storage node has been introduced as a useful technique to solve the storage challenge, so the placement of storage node becomes an important issue in such wireless sensor networks. This paper addresses the storage node placement problem in the wireless sensor networks organized into a fixed tree rooted at the sink. We propose a new storage node placement algorithm for k storage nodes based on dynamic programming, and the objective of this algorithm is to make wireless sensor network energy balance in each storage node and minimize a kind of performance metric named total energy cost. Some experiments illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of our algorithm.

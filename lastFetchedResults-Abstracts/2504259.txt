Background: During the detorsion of a torsioned ovary, oxidant agents are released and
melatonin as an antioxidant can reduce ischemia. We studied the histopathological
changes after using melatonin on experimental torsioned ovary in cat.
Objective: The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of
Melatonin on histopathological changes in torsion – detorsion injury in cat ovary.
Materials and Methods: An adnexal torsion – detorsion model was created by using 20
adult cats randomly divided equally in to 2 groups of Saline and Melatonin. Ischemia was
induced by iathrogenic 360° clockwise torsion of the cat adnex for 3 hr. Reperfusion
was achieved for 3 hr. Melatonin or saline were injected intra peritoneally (10mg/kg) 30
min before ovarian detorsion in both groups. After 3 hr of ovarian detorsion, ovarian
tissue was removed and fixed in 10% formalin solution, embedded in paraffin and
evaluated for ischemic indices.
Results: Histological examination showed a significant improvement in ovarian
morphology in the melatonin treated cats. Edema and vasoconstriction in saline group
were more severe than Melatonin group (p-value = 0.009). Hemorrhage and leukocyte
infiltration were also more obvious in saline group (p-value 0.0018)
Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that Melatonin administration reduced ovarian
histopathological damage due to oxidative injury associated with torsion.

A long term objective for aircraft manufacturer is the complete integration of antennas in fuselage in order to reduce the aerodynamic drag of aeronautic platforms. Performances of typical BEM/MLFMM solvers may be affected by local mesh refinements needed to connect conformal antenna models on aircraft. BEM fast direct solvers based on H-matrix are a promising solution to overcome these difficulties. We propose in this paper a performance comparison between MLFMM and H-matrix on a realistic case; a GPS system mounted on a typical Single Aisle (SA) fuselage.

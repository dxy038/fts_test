In the water sector, like in many others, there is an urgent need for professional information systems to facilitate information finding and to provide a platform for sharing professional knowledge and build the base for dialogue with adjacent sectors such as that of the environment. IPTRID, an FAO special programme for capacity development in agricultural water management, has developed an Internet-based integrated information platform (WCA infoNET). The goal behind the development of the system is to disseminate best practices and to promote awareness for water conservation and use in agriculture in order to improve decision making on water use policies, practices and programmes, improve the type, amount and quality of information available and reach out to wide range of stakeholders. The specific objective of the "Virtual Center for Agricultural Water" is to contribute to the success of development projects in the area of agricultural water management in francophone developing countries through providing access to information and debates on agricultural water management issues.

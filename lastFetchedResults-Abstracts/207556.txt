In architectural design education, the main objective
is to help students, especially first-year
students, improve their design ideas, creativity,
perception of three dimensions and ways of
expressing them. Thus, as an embedded
concept in architecture, art has been emphasised
here as a design method. In other words,
the necessary help to enable students to think
more freely has been provided by ceramic art.
The concept dealt with in this article is an interdisciplinary
approach to space design as an
experimental method in design education. Just
as fine art students are inspired from the principles
of architecture, clay, as basic material to fine
art students, makes a creative material and
design tool for architecture students. A workshop
was organised in the design courses by the
first author, the instructor, for the first- and thirdyear
architecture students. The second author, a
ceramics artist and lecturer, has participated in
the workshop as a visiting instructor and
contributed with her own studies related to
space, house, building and materials.

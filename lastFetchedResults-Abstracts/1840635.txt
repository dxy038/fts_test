Although the role of p53 as a tumour suppressor in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is unclear, our recent analysis suggests that increased wild-type p53 protein expression is associated with poor outcome. A growing body of evidence also suggests that p53 expression and increased co-expression of MDM2 are linked with poor prognosis in RCC. We have therefore examined whether an MDM2 antagonist; Nutlin-3, might rescue/increase p53 expression and induce growth inhibition or apoptosis in RCC cells that retain wild-type p53. We show that inhibition of p53 suppression by MDM2 in RCC cells promotes growth arrest and p53-dependent senescence â€“ phenotypes known to mediate p53 tumour suppression in vivo. We propose that future investigations of therapeutic strategies for RCC should incorporate MDM2 antagonism as part of strategies aimed at rescuing/augmenting p53 tumour suppressor function.

Objective Despite a high ranking on the
public and political agenda, across Europe and all
over the world there is a surprising shortage of basic
information and evidence on the quantity and quality
of services available for mentally disordered or ill
offenders, the frequency of cases in specialized
forensic facilities or the effectiveness of provided care
in the various countries. Against poor evidence the
rapid European integration and the strive for models
of good practice require valid and reliable international
overviews, sound studies and profound analyses
of this most controversial issue. Aims To
harmonize and give an overview of prevalence and
incidence data of persons in forensic psychiatric care
available from official sources across fifteen European
Union-Member States. Method Data was gathered
and provided by forensic experts from each included
country. Results Total numbers as well as prevalence
and incidence on persons placed or treated under
legal forensic regimes vary remarkably across the EU,
although a tendency of constantly, but slowly rising
rates from 1990 onwards may be concluded from
available time series. However, variation supports the
hypothesis of a variety of unknown influencing factors,
which need to be analysed for each country
separately. Conclusions Common EU-wide patterns
of psychiatric forensic prevalence or incidence rates
can hardly be detected from available administrative
data. Results show the necessity for international
harmonisation of definitions or indicators as a basic
requirement for strongly needed further research in
this crucial field.

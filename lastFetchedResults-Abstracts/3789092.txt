A linear programming model for electric generation planning has been extended to provide the options required for pumped storage hydro planning. Pumped storage hydro is defined by installed capacity and capacity factor. The corresponding four options desirable planning purposes are the capability to 1) specify capacity factor and solve for optimal installed capacity or 2) solve for both optimal installed capacity and capacity factor. The model calculates the total electric planning strategy that minimizes present worth cost, or any other objective specified by the planner subject to the input option and data base. The planner can also perform the primary and secondary objective analysis via a sequential objective feature.

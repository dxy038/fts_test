The paper describes the crosspolar radiation characteristics of dielectric cone feeds. It is shown that they have a potential of much broader bandwidths than the corrugated horns. However, to achieve this potential it is necessary to reduce the crosspolar radiation from the launcher and a novel method of achieving this objective is suggested.

In recent years group-oriented services are one of the primary application classes that are addressed by Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET). To support such services, multicast routing is used. Multicast routing is the simultaneous delivery of data stream to multiple destinations without sending duplicate copies over any one link with the objective of resource optimization. It can significantly improve the performance of these networks, the channel capacity and battery power of which are limited. Due to the high mobility of nodes and highly dynamic topology, performing efficient and robust multicast in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is a challenging task. Thus, there is a need to design stable and reliable multicast routing protocols for MANET to ensure better packet delivery ratio, lower delays and reduced overheads. Most of existing multicast protocols in MANET discover the routing path by flooding message over the whole network, which result in considerable cost for routing discovery and maintenance. Moreover, the reliability of the discovered path cannot be guaranteed, since the stabilities of nodes along such path are unpredictable. The mechanisms proposed in this paper can deliver data packets to larger mobile user groups within MANET in a high efficient way. This paper presented a Scheme based on stable link which consists a process of node selection based on mobility prediction and battery power ratio to construct a more stable route for performing packet transmission, message flooding, routing discovery and maintenance in multicast routing of data in MANET.

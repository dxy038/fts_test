They find this course extremely difficult since it involves a great deal of recondite contents and knowledge points. During over a decade´s teaching practice, the author of this paper has summed up some experience and methods. He suggests the use of the multiple objective teaching. More specifically, the teacher can assign different learning tasks to different students in practice and after-class instruction based on their different capacities and interests, allowing them to give play to their learning and studying potentials.

Background and Objective: Exercise and physical activity are the most impressive factors in consumption of cellular energy sources which may bring about some changes in key peptides that are effective in adjusting and balancing energy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the probable changes of plasma Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Ghrelin concentrations after 8 weeks of exercise with different intensities on fat male rats.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 75 adult male rats about 2 months old selected randomly from a laboratory. The rats fattened via stimulating their appetite with lettuce and other vegetables for a month. Their average weight changed from 240±15 gr to 320±20 gr. Then, they were divided into three groups of control (n=25), exercise group with moderate intensity ((n=25) and exercise group with high intensity (n=25). The training program of the study consisted of running three times in a week on Rodents' treadmill for 8 weeks.
Results: The results showed that after 8 weeks of high intensity exercises, NPY and Ghrelin levels increased significantly (p < 0.05), but moderate intensity exercises did not have meaningful effect on NPY and Ghrelin levels.
Conclusion: The results of this research shows that exercise causes negative balance of energy in rats, increase  their weight and fatten them. To compensate for this negative balance of energy, NPY hormone and Ghrelin levels are increased.

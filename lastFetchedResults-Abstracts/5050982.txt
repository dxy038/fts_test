This article presents a method for optimal tuning of PID controllers by using simulated annealing optimization algorithm and tries to increase speed and decrease errors in PID controller by adding intelligent techniques to the basic algorithm. The objective of this paper is to reduce errors and minimize IAE, ITAE, ISE and ITSE assessment criteria to be able to obtain a unique step response of the system in its best output tuning by PID controller. This system is not limited to a particular process and is applicable for all plants. In this paper, SMT motion system with constant load torque is used as disturbance for execution of PID controller with this proposed method.

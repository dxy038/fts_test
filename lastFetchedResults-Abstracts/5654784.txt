This paper presents the results of a pilot study comparing four different speech waveform coding techniques of varying complexity. Coder transmission rates of 24, 16, and 9.6 Kb/s were used in the experiment. Subjective ratings and objective measurements of quality are obtained and compared. A number of conclusions are drawn concerning the quality and complexity, of different coding techniques. By comparing the objective measurements to the subjective ratings a number of conclusions are also drawn concerning the strengths and weaknesses of various (objective) quality measures of speech waveform coders.

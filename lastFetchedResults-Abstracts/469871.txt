Objective
The object of this study was to compare neonatal outcomes of term uncomplicated pregnancies delivered by scheduled repeat cesarean with outcomes of babies born to mothers intending to deliver vaginally.
Study design
This retrospective cohort study describes neonatal outcomes of term uncomplicated pregnancies. Neonates of mothers intending to deliver vaginally (n = 3134) are compared with neonates born by elective repeat cesarean delivery prior to labor (n = 117).
Results
Neonates born by elective repeat cesarean are more frequently admitted to advanced care nurseries than infants born to mothers intending to deliver vaginally (risk ratio 3.58, 95% confidence interval 3.35-3.58).
Conclusion
The decision to undergo scheduled cesarean delivery appears to negatively impact immediate neonatal outcomes.

The combination of multi-radio nodes in conjunction with a suitably structured mesh architecture has the potential to solve some of the key limitations of present day mesh networks. We propose and evaluate two practical and self-stabilizing channel assignment algorithms for multi-channel dual-radio mesh backhauls. The objective is to find a channel assignment that maximizes network capacity through balancing traffic load and/or co-channel interference on available channels. Through simulations, we show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the capacity of wireless mesh networks.

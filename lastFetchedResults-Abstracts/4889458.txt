The main objective of this paper is to a DC to AC Inverter and power switching system. Our final goal is to achieve a stable output of 110VAC, and be able to self-generate the drive voltage and switching the power supply between the city electrical system and solar power system. Solar power driver circuit which contains the theory, simulation and implementation, the maximum power tracking solar power (MPPT) of the preliminary theoretical analysis, solar energy storage battery charging and discharging control system theory and examples, solar power AC step-up circuit theory and implementation, solar power automatic switching systems simulation and implementation, as well as the harmonic wave problem in order to solve the future problems in parallel connection with the city electrical system. Our goal is to construct a stabled, completed and low cost of solar energy power conversion systems.

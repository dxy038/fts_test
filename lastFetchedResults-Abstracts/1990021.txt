Energy and environmental issues have become pertinent to all industries in the globe because of sustainable development issues. However, the ever increasing demand of customers for quality has led to better surface finish and thus more energy consumption. The energy efficiency of machines tools is generally very low particularly during the discrete part manufacturing. This paper provide a multi-objective predictive model for the minimization of power consumption and surface roughness in machining, using grey relational analysis coupled with principal component analysis and response surface methodology, to obtain the optimum machining parameters. The statistical significance of the proposed predictive model has been tested by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The obtained results indicate that feed is the most significant machining parameter followed by depth of cut and cutting speed to reduce power consumption and surface roughness. The constructed response surface contours can be used by the shop floor people to find and use the best combination of machining parameters for the given situation. The reduction of peak load through optimization will results in lowering the power consumption of the machine tools during non-cutting idling time.

Proposes an adaptation method for a behavior-based locomotion robot. Utilization of a behavior-based controller makes the controller designing process easier and shorter, because the designer can deal with behavior controllers for simple behaviors independently, and after that can coordinate those behavior controllers in order for a robot to achieve the objective complex behavior. Some problems are still remaining. One is how to adjust the total behavior when the target task or environment is changed. We propose the method to adjust the behavior coordinator against some changes. This method adjusts the activation level of each behavior controller for the changes in fewer trials. It is applied to real brachiation robot control. The brachiation robot has a redundant mechanism to locomote from branch to branch like a long-armed ape

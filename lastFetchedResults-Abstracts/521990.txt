Mehrdad Eftekhar, Azizeh A Objective: The objective of this study is to examine Eysenck personality dimensions in cannabis users Method: 100 regular cannabis users were selected and completed Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) which measures Neuroticism (N), Extraversion-Introversion (E-I) and Psychoticism (P) dimensions of Eysenck personality structures Results: The scores of 51% of cannabis users were higher than mean in all dimensions of EPQ. Also the mean score of N and P were higher than the score which Eysenck has reported for Iranian population Conclusions: This research reinforces our call for a public health information campaign about a drug which may young people still see as being risk-free. Psychiatric morbidity and cases of psychotic disorder could be prevented by discouraging cannabis use among vulnerable youths.. Ebrahimi, Hamed Azimi, Arash Vahdat, Hamid Reza Ahmadkhaniha

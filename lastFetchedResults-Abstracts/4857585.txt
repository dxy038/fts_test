The paper proposes an Active Traffic and Congestion Control mechanism in MPLS (MPLS ATCC) and its model, which integrate the characters of MPLS and active networks. MPLS ATCC moves the endpoint congestion control algorithms into the network. The comparison with traditional TCP shows that MPLS ATCC can find and control the congestion in time, reduce the round-trip delay, and edit the ingress traffic. So MPLS ATCC achieves the objective of improving the total throughput and the utility of the buffer

The major objective of this study is to establish guidelines to select the optimum combination of die materials, coatings and lubricants in stamping galvanized AHSS (DP600, TRIP780 and DP980) for automotive structural parts. For this purpose, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and various tribotests, e.g. Twist Compression Test (TCT), Deep Drawing Test (DDT) and Strip Drawing Test (SDT), were used. The results of this study helped to determine the critical interface pressure and temperature that initiate lubricant failure and galling in forming galvanized AHSS for a given die material and coating.

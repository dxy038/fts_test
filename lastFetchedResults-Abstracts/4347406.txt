The article presents the results of simulations based on a linear optimization model of a storage system that calculates the economic benefits of distributed storage devices at the end consumer level by determining the cost optimal charge-discharge-schedule. The primary objective of the storage application is arbitrage accommodation. Particularly, parameters for a li-ion-based and a lead-acid-based storage system are simulated. All parameters of the model are varied and analyzed regarding their impact on the economic benefits. The simulation results quantify these impacts and show that the costs per storage capacity unit (EUR/kWh) and the efficiency degrees of the storage system have the highest impact. Additionally, the price spreads as well as the distribution of the market price curve in relation with the distribution of the consumerÂ´s load curve (demand) influence the achievable benefits significantly. Overall, the model reveals a saving potential of 17% on total cost for the reference case.

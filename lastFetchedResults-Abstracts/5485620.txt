We demonstrated that the dispersion of scanning microscope optics (including a Zeiss 40&#215;/1.2 Apochromat objective) can be compensated by means of chirped mirrors over a bandwidth of 170nm@800nm. The interferometric autocorrelation trace recorded at the focus of the microscope objective with a two-photon diode indicated a pulse duration of &#8810; 12 fs.

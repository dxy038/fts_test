This paper is in a structural optimization of road network under certain conditions of the regional transportation integration. Compare with the whole road network transportation cost, transportation time and accident ratio before transportation integration. Set road network economy benefit maximization as objective function. Making a network optimization model. Achieve the optimize under Integration condition and to evaluate the benefit ratio after road network optimization. Demonstrated with an example led to economic benefits of the regional transportation integration.

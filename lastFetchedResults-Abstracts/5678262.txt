In this paper we design and compare two modern controllers for a MIMO civil aircraft model; first we design state feedback with precompensator controller so the unstable open loop system tracks reference input truly. Then, H-infinity method is utilized to design the controller using appropriate weighting functions. The objective of the controller is to achieve a good performance along with superior robustness. Simulation results show that in terms of transient response, H-infinity is faster than state feedback with precompensator method. Furthermore control energy of the proposed method is less than state feedback with precompensator method. Robustness analysis shows that H-infinity method is more robust than state feedback with precompensator. Hence, H-infinity has superiority over state feedback approach in terms of performance and robustness.

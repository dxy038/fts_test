Since the paradox of "authority and freedom" is one of the most significant challenges in the philosophy of children's literature, the present paper attempts to identify and investigate the techniques of representing "authority and freedom" in Iranian picture-story books. Using analytic method, this study examines six Persian picture-stories to answer the following questions: What techniques are used to represent authority and freedom in Persian picture-stories? Are there any differences between the techniques used in the corpus of the study? Which of the identified techniques improve childrenâ€™s creativity and power of thinking? The results indicate that implicit theme, open plot, objective or performative point of view, polyphony in texts and images, indirect, dynamic and sophisticated characterization, and dominance of images are among the techniques that enhance the thinking ability, decision making, creativity and choices of children.

Abstract
Objective: Even in young people, insulin resistance is associated with physical inactivity and obesity. It has been shown that novel insulin resistance indexes have clinical value. The purpose of present study was to investigate the effect of a period of resistance training on novel insulin resistance indexes in sedentary young obese men.
Methodology: In a semi-experimental study, twenty one sedentary young obese men were randomly placed at two groups: resistance training (n=10, 26.7±3.3 yr, 32.6±2.8 kg/m2) and control (n=11, 27.1±3.1 yr, 32.2±3.3 kg/m2). General characteristics of subjects, serum resistin concentration, and homeostasis model assessment-adiponectin (HOMA-AD), adiponectin-resistin (AR), and (insulin resistance) IRAR indexes were assessed before and after the training. Resistance training protocol consisted of twelve weeks weight training (3 sessions per week, 10 stations, 3 sets 8-12 repetitions in each station, intensity 60-80% of one repetition maximum, rest between sets 1 min and between stations 2 min, duration of main training 65-70 min per each session).
Results: Resistance training decreased serum resistin concentration (P < 0.05), HOMA-AD (P < 0.05), AR (P < 0.05) and IRAR (P < 0.05), while none of mentioned parameters in control group showed any significant changes. The compartion pre-test and post-test means of these indexes between two groups showed significant differences (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Resistance training reduces levels of novel insulin resistance indexes in sedentary young obese men that can have a practical value with regard to prevention against risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases for this population group.

This paper describes an objective model for measuring online games quality of experience (QoE). Most of the existing game quality assessment models take into consideration mainly network impairments, therefore the measured games quality of experience is only correlated with network impairments. In addition to the traditional network-based parameters such as delay, jitter and packet loss, the model described in this paper is using new parameters based on subjective assessment. The aim is to estimate game quality as perceived by an online game player. In order to validate and calibrate the proposed model a subjective game quality assessment is also developed. Two 5-point scales are introduced: a game-quality scale and a game playing-effort scale. The mean average of each scale, termed the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), will indicate the experience of game quality. Reported evaluation results indicate a high level of correlation. This work extends previous work in this area by including end-user knowledge in the proposed metric and demonstrating a high correlation between the obtained measurements and players subjective opinion.

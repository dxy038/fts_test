Objective
This study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the effect of early stage endometrial cancer, age, and obesity on quality of life (QOL).
Study design
Women undergoing surgery for endometrial cancer or an adnexal mass determined at surgery to be benign (controls) were enrolled preoperatively and followed for 6 months.
Results
Seventy-nine women completed the study. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) scores increased significantly in all women; however, significant differences by patient weight and age were obtained. Obesity was associated with decreased physical FACT-G and SF-36 scores. Older women had lower SF-36 physical scores, higher emotional scores, and less change over time.
Conclusion
Women with early endometrial cancer had similar changes in QOL as those who received surgery for benign disease. Obese and elderly women had domain alterations. Given the aging population and rising incidence of obesity, these results emphasize the need for QOL interventions in postoperative gynecologic care of these patients.

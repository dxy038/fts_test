Objective
estigate whether twins still perform below singletons in cognitive ability tests and in national educational attainment examinations in a recent UK cohort of 11-year-olds.

tion-based cohort study, using a validated method of twin extraction.
g
h state schools.
ipants
9 pupils (mean age 11 years) attending English state schools in 2004, representing 93% of local educational authorities.
utcome measures
, quantitative and nonverbal reasoning measured by the Cognitive Abilities Test — Third Edition (CAT3), and educational attainment in English, maths and science from Key Stage 2 national curriculum tests.
s
ingleton differences in cognitive ability were of negligible effect size. Mean performance of twins was 1% of a SD below singletons on general cognitive ability, 3% lower on verbal reasoning, and less than 1% of a SD lower on quantitative and nonverbal reasoning, with and without adjustment for sex. Almost identical proportions of twins and singletons attained the expected standards of educational performance in English (80.4% versus 80.5%, respectively), maths (77.4% versus 77.3%), and science (90.1% versus 88.8%). There were no differences in rates of twins and singletons achieving higher or lower performance levels.
sion
gnitive cost of being a twin reported in previous cohorts of UK children no longer exists in a large, contemporary and population-representative sample.

Objective
The aim of this study was to obtain an overview of the materials and restorative techniques taught for Class I and Class II restorations in primary molars of different European departments for paediatric dentistry and to compare the results to those for North America.
Methods

The forms were sent to the chairmen of the departments of paediatric dentistry or—when included into the department for operative dentistry—to the director of 200 universities in 32 European Countries. The questions concerned the preferred materials and techniques, as well as the indications or contraindications for the use of the different tooth coloured materials.
Results

Forty-three percent of the universities from western European countries (excluding Germany) responded to the survey. A 97% answer rate was obtained from German Schools. Of the other European regions, the response rate varied remarkably (24–54%). Also, opinions on materials used and methods applied were different from country to country. Only in a few regions (Eastern Europe), amalgam remains the filling material of first choice for Class I and II cavities in primary molars, whereas in others, the use has been restricted and tooth coloured materials, especially compomers or resin-modified glass ionomer cements, are being preferred.
Conclusions

Great diversity in teaching was observed not only among the European countries, but also within the countries themselves which makes it difficult to compare the results of our study to the ones obtained from the US.

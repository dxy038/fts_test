This article proposes an architecture based on agents for the collaborative resolution of medical cases. Our objective is to provide a suitable framework for the dynamic acquisition of expert knowledge from different sources. We present a Web-based medical application based in this approach. By means of electronic medical histories, this application offers physicians all the required information to get adequate diagnoses. Multi-agent system technology for the coordination and management tasks of daily medical work is used. These coordination tasks include allocation of tasks to physicians, requests of medical tests, and delivery of results, among others. For agent implementation, a software agent architecture pattern and a Web agent framework are used. We considered an interface design to be used for the integration and combination of different sources of expertise. The knowledge produced in the workgroup processes has been validated and the test and tuning phases have been completed.

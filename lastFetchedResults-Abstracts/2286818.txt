The objective of this paper is to give an overview of properties, synthesis and applications, and to describe the research performed until the present moment. A significant amount of research has been done in this area, including different synthesis techniques, modifications with several chemical compounds as quaternary alkylammonium salts and also biomolecules as enzymes that provide applicability in a variety of fields. The review is particularly focused on bentonite and polymer nanocomposites, an important area of the nanotechnology.

In aerospace applications, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) can be widely used as actuators and sensors. It should be emphasized that the actuators are characterized not only by functionality, integrity, controllability, reliability, efficiency, robustness, vibroacoustic, electromagnetic interference, and other characteristics, but also by their capabilities. Therefore, in some applications, conventional actuators must be used because MEMS actuators, in general, develop low rated torque due to microsize even though the MEMS torque density can be higher compared with conventional actuator technologies. To overcome this drawback, MEMS arrays can be used. The MEMS-based actuators and sensors are uniquely suitable for micro air vehicles. We use MEMS to displace and change the geometry of smart control surfaces. The major objective of the paper is to report fundamental and applied research in modeling, analysis, and design of smart flight surfaces with MEMS-based actuator-sensor arrays controlled by hierarchically distributed systems. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of smart flight surfaces for coordinated longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. It should be emphasized that the active aerodynamic flow control can be achieved in order to reduce the drag

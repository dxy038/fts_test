The risk of maritime traffic is an issue to express the uncertain information. In order to assess the risk of traffic environment at port, the theories and methods of unascertained mathematics were introduced. Considering the unascertained characteristics of traffic environment at port, the weight of risk system coefficients was determined and an unascertained quantitative model was established for evaluation of traffic environment on the basis of the information entropy theory. Then, it gets the corresponding rank and evaluation of the maritime risk, with the help of applying this model in 13 sections of two ports of China. Compared with traditional weight obtained method, the results show that the evaluation is reliable, and this unascertained measure is more propitious to resolve the evaluation of traffic risk in different ports by the same evaluation standard solely on the basis of objective data.

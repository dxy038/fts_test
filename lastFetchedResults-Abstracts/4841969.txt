In this paper, a nonlinear control technique based on the property of flatness is proposed to control the air system of new generation diesel engines. The simulated engine is equipped with variable valve actuation (VVA), variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The control objective is to achieve tracking of suitable references of flat outputs with corresponding intake conditions, which optimize fuel consumption under emission constraints. The proposed controller is designed on a fourth order nonlinear model and implemented by endogenous linearizing dynamic feedback on a full order mean value model. The controller assessed through simulations with a software-in-the-loop (SIL) architecture using dSpace simulator. It exhibits good control performance without zero dynamics and ensures global stability and tracking of flat output references.

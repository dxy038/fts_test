Southern California EdisonÂ´s Electric Vehicle Technical Center (EVTC), in cooperation with industry participants, conducted a test on two advanced battery technologies to evaluate their suitability and life cycle performance in stationary telecom and electric utility substation applications. This test was conducted with the objective of finding ways to increase the utilization of these advanced technology batteries in other market areas in order to help reduce EV battery production costs. The batteries evaluated were the 12 V, 106 Ah (C/3) SAFT Nickel-Metal-Hydride (NiMH) and the 24 V, 80 Ah (C/8) AVESTOR Lithium-Metal-Polymer (LMP).

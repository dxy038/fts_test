Using the recently developed model predictive static programming (MPSP), a suboptimal guidance logic is presented in this paper for formation flying of small satellites. Due to the inherent nature of the problem formulation, MPSP does not require the system dynamics to be linearized. The proposed guidance scheme is valid both for high eccentricity chief satellite orbits as well as large separation distance between chief and deputy satellites. Moreover, since MPSP poses the desired conditions as a set of `hard constraintsÂ´, the final accuracy level achieved is very high. The proposed guidance scheme has been tested successfully for a variety of initial conditions and for a variety of formation commands as well. Comparison with standard Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution (which serves as a guess solution for MPSP) and another nonlinear controller, State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) reveals that MPSP guidance achieves the objective with higher accuracy and with lesser amount of control usage as well.

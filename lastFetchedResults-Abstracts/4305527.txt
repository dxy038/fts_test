We propose an advanced cut-and-paste editing for three-dimensional models. We introduce a new parameterization technique based on constrained B-spline surface/volume fitting. Our cut-and-paste editing is performed on this parameterization. In our method, a parametric volume is generated so that its isoparametric surface fits to the base surface and the volume bounds the detail. Our volume fitting is realized by the optimization of an objective functional with a smoothness factor. We implemented and evaluated our method, and showed that our constrained fitting is effective to edit shapes that may have highly curved areas or handles.

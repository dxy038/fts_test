In this article, we propose a bi-objective model for the pricingqueuing problem under a fuzzy
environment. We consider two objectives: maximizing the profit function and minimizing the waiting
time in queue. Imagine a firm which sells a product in a channel providing after sales services. The sales
price and warranty length affect customer demand. We formulate the demand function as a fuzzy system
considering the sales price and warranty length. The firm optimizes the sales price and warranty length, as
well as waiting time, in the queue of after sales services, to maximize its revenues and minimize waiting
time. To solve the derived model, we develop a hybrid solution method of a fuzzy system and a genetic
algorithm. Finally, the numerical analysis is done to show the reasonable performance of the solution
method and results.

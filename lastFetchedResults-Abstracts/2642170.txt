The objective of this paper is to obtain acoustical behavior of flow around 50째 tailless, 80째/65째 double and 53째 diamond delta wing configurations, using large eddy simulation. Validation of the aerodynamic coefficients is performed using available experimental results, showing good agreements. CFD simulations were performed for 15 degree angles of attack at a Mach number of 0.147 and a Reynolds number of 1.2 million, based on the root chord root chord of the wings (is 360 mm). Acoustic measurements, such as power spectral density, acoustic pressure, sound pressure level, and sound amplitude were taken, using 3 microphones in the wake region of the mentioned wings. The amount of sound pressure level of microphone, which is placed at 1.835 meter from apex of above wings in DK Strouhal number 0 to 1 is, 24 to 69, 10 to 54 and 9 to 44. Hence, for purposes of being silence, aeroacoustics values indicate that diamond delta wing is more preferable than tailless and double delta wing.

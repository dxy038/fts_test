We propose a method for synthetic zooming of tomographic images by applying super resolution technique on reconstructed data via a union of rotated lattices (URL). The proposed method consists of two steps: (i) sinogram data is filtered and backprojected on to two lattices, which are rotated versions of each other and (ii) the samples from the two lattices are interpolated to generate the upsampled image. Square and hexagonal lattices have been investigated for URL. Results of subjective and objective evaluations of the proposed method on analytic phantoms are presented and compared with direct upsampling of data reconstructed on a single square lattice and upsampled image generated by union of low resolution shifted images (USL). The proposed method shows qualitative and quantitative improvement over direct upsampling but when compared with USL, generated upsampled images are of comparable quality.

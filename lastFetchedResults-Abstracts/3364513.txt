In this paper, we propose an optimum transmit structure for spatial modulation (SM), a unique single-stream multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission technique. As a three-dimensional modulation scheme, SM enables a trade-off between the size of the spatial constellation diagram and the size of the signal constellation diagram. Based on this fact, the novel method, named transmission optimized spatial modulation (TOSM), selects the best transmit structure that minimizes the average bit error probability (ABEP). Unlike the traditional antenna selection methods, the proposed method relies on statistical channel state information (CSI) instead of instant CSI, and feedback is only needed for the optimal number of transmit antennas. The overhead for this, however, is negligible. In addition, TOSM has low computational complexity as the optimization problem is solved through a simple closed-form objective function with a single variable. Simulation results show that TOSM significantly improves the performance of SM at various channel correlations. Assuming Rayleigh fading channels, TOSM outperforms the original SM by up to 9 dB. Moreover, we propose a single radio-frequency (RF) chain base station (BS) based on TOSM, which achieves low hardware complexity and high energy efficiency. In comparison with multi-stream MIMO schemes, TOSM offers an energy saving of at least 56% in the continuous transmission mode, and 62% in the discontinuous transmission mode.

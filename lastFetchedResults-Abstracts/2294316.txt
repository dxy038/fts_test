The primary objective of the TanDEM-X mission is the generation of a global high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) with single-pass SAR interferometry. Within the mission, the Earthâ€™s land masses will be mapped at least twice to achieve relative vertical accuracies in the order of two meters. This paper presents an analysis of the mission performance in terms of the relative height error showing first results obtained from TanDEM-X interferometric data. For critical areas characterized by strong volume decorrelation phenomena or mountainous terrain, different approaches to improve the final height error are investigated as well.

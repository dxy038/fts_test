This paper presents a new multi objective
heuristic algorithm for Dynamic Economic Load
Dispatch (DELD) problem soultion with transmission
losses based on new version of the Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) algorithm, which called Multi
Objective PSO (MOPSO) method. The proposed
algorithm is based on multi objective meta-heuristics
technique that evaluates a set of the Pareto solutions
systematically and preserve the diversity of Pareto
optimality by a crowding entropy diversity measure
tactic. The crowding entropy strategy is able to measure
the crowding degree of the solutions more accurately and
efficentlly. The effectivness of the proposed method have
been varified on two 6 and 15 units test systems with
considered various demand for 24 hours. The numrical
results demonstrates the capability of the proposed
MOPSO approach to generate well distributed Pareto
optimal non-dominated solutions of multi-objective
DELD problem. The comparison with the recently
reported results using Brent method reveals the
superiority of the proposed MOPSO approach and
confirms its potential for the solution of dynamic ELD
problem in the real world power systems.

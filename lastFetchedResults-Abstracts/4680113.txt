Thermal power plants play a major role in power production. The impacts of the various pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), Nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) affects the environmental issues. The fuel cost of the generator in an economic dispatch problem can be presented by any order polynomial. The literature review reported that most of the papers consider the single pollutant using the second order polynomial function. The paper formulates the dispatch problem using a cubic function for both fuel cost and emission values. The impacts of various pollutants and price penalty factors such as Max-Max, MinMax, Average, and Common are considered in the multi-objective dispatch problem. The dispatch problem is solved using LagrangeÂ´s method and the simulation results are provided for IEEE 30 bus system. It concludes that Min-Max Price penalty factor provides minimum fuel cost and minimum emission values in comparison to the other price penalty factors.

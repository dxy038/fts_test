The complexity increase and variety of equipments controlled by embedded computers generate the need of a multidisciplinary approach for the process of development of those equipments, involving the areas of software, mechanics, electric and electronic engineering. System engineering uses different techniques to concurrently integrate these different views. In this sense, it is being specified by OMG a modeling language, denominated SysML (System Modeling Language). It intends to include in a single specification an integrated view of the system, one that includes hardware, software and electro-mechanics parts. The objective of this paper is to do an empirical evaluation of the modeling language SysML, in the sense of identifying its capacities and its limitations for the modeling of embedded systems. For that purpose, an electronic fuel injection system developed by Department of Automation and Systems at our university will be used.

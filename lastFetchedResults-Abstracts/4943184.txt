An extended sinusoidal model for speech signal processing is proposed. In this model, the frequencies of the sinusoidal components are constrained to be harmonically related, but their amplitudes are allowed to vary exponentially with time. Algorithms for model parameter estimation are derived. The proposed model shows considerable objective and subjective improvements in speech segments with transitions, especially in speech onsets, compared to the constant-frequency, constant-amplitude harmonic model. Potential application areas include speech synthesis and multimode speech coding

In this work the operation of an industrial semi-batch reactor is optimized. In the reactor a strongly exothermic polymerization
reaction takes place and the objective is to minimize the duration of the batch time. Various operational as well as quality and
safety related constraints have to be met during the batch and at its ®nal time. In particular, a cooling system failure is taken into
account explicitly since the temperature rise in this case must not exceed a corresponding limit. The optimization is based on a
detailed process model derived from ®rst principles. A reduced model is developed for optimization and trajectories for the opera-
tional variables feed ¯owrate and reactor temperature are calculated. The results show that signi®cant reductions of the batch time
are possible and that their extent depend on the formulated safety constraints. For a selected case the obtained optimal trajectories
are veri®ed experimentally in laboratory and production scale.

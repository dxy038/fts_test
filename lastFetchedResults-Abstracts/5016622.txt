Target tracking is a well studied application of wireless sensor networks. An interesting addition to this application is the presence of a mobile guided vehicle that is used to intercept the mobile target. The system provides the current (and sometimes predicted) position of the target to the guided vehicle, so that it can move towards the target. The objective is to reach the target in the shortest possible time. In this paper, two approaches, namely, alpha-beta predicted position based guidance and alpha-beta prediction proportional guidance, have been developed and evaluated for interception efficiency.

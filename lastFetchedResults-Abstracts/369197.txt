The objective of this study was to investigate the efficiency of two treatments for poly( , -lactic acid) (PDLLA) surface modification using silk fibroin, one chemical treatment and one physical treatment: 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (WSC) and entrapment. The properties of control films, WSC-modified and entrapment-treated PDLLA films were investigated by water contact angle measurement and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The water-contact angle measurement indicated the change of hydrophilicity and the ESCA analysis suggested that the modified PDLLA film using silk fibroin became enriched with nitrogen atoms. The biocompatibility of PDLLA film might be altered, which in turn would affect the functions of cells that were seeded on it. Therefore, attachment and proliferation of osteoblasts that were seeded on modified PDLLA films and control films were examined. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT assay and differentiated cell function was assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity. These results suggested that silk fibroin was used to modify PDLLA surface via WSC and that entrapment could improve the interactions between osteoblasts and PDLLA films. The entrapment treatment was more effective than WSC treatment to accomplish the goal of surface modification.

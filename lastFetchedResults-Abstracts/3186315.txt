Test data collection for a failing integrated circuit (IC) can be very expensive and time consuming. Many companies now collect a fix amount of test data regardless of the failure characteristics. As a result, limited data collection could lead to inaccurate diagnosis, while an excessive amount increases the cost not only in terms of unnecessary test data collection but also increased cost for test execution and data-storage. In this work, the objective is to develop a method for predicting the precise amount of test data necessary to produce an accurate diagnosis. By analyzing the failing outputs of an IC during its actual test, the developed method dynamically determines which failing test pattern to terminate testing, producing an amount of test data that is sufficient for an accurate diagnosis analysis. The method leverages several statistical learning techniques, and is evaluated using actual data from a population of failing chips and five standard benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that test-data collection can be reduced by &gt;; 30% (as compared to collecting the full-failure response) while at the same time ensuring &gt;;90% diagnosis accuracy. Prematurely terminating test-data collection at fixed levels (e.g., 100 failing bits) is also shown to negatively impact diagnosis accuracy.

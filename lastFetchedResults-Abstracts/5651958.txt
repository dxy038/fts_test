A crucial challenge in human body tracking is the high degrees of freedom (up to around 40) to be recovered. A method based on multi-objective optimization algorithm is presented here to tackle this problem. In our multi-objective optimization based human body tracking framework, tracking is considered as two functionsÂ´ co-optimization problem where the aim is to optimize the matching functions between the model projection and the image observation. Experiments on 3D human motion tracking demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed tracking method.

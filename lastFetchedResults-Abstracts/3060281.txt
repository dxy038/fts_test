This paper presents two reduced switch count reversible five-phase AC motor drives. The configurations use ten and eight switches, respectively. The drives provide both bidirectional power flow and power factor control. The configurations were conceived to operate without the use of boost inductor filter. The paper presents the analysis and control strategy of the drive systems, including current and PWM voltage controllers. Experimental and simulation results are presented

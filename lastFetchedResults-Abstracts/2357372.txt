The ternary diagram TiO2–FeO*–MgO (FeO* = FeO + MnO) is proposed as a quantitative objective tool for distinguishing between primary magmatic biotites and those that are more or less reequilibrated, or possibly neoformed, by or within a hydrothermal fluid. The limit of the domains of the primary magmatic biotites, the reequilibrated biotites and the neoformed biotites were determined on the basis of optical, paragenetic and chemical criteria.

For a group of linear systems, each under a saturated linear, not necessarily stabilizing, feedback law, we design a switching scheme such that the resulting switched system is locally asymptotically stable at the origin with a large domain of attraction. By expressing each saturated linear feedback in a convex hull of a group of auxiliary linear feedbacks, we formulate and solve the problem of designing such a switching scheme as a constrained optimization problem with the objective of maximizing an estimate of the domain of attraction. Simulation results indicate that the resulting domain of attraction extends well beyond the linear regions of the actuators.

Corporate going-concern opinions are not only useful in predicting bankruptcy but also provide some explanatory power in predicting bankruptcy resolution. The prediction of a firm’s ability to remain a going concern is an important and challenging issue that has served as the impetus for many academic studies over the last few decades. Although intellectual capital (IC) is generally acknowledged as the key factor contributing to a corporation’s ability to remain a going concern, it has not been considered in early prediction models. The objective of this study is to increase the accuracy of going-concern prediction by using a hybrid random forest (RF) and rough set theory (RST) approach, while adopting IC as a predictive variable. The results show that this proposed hybrid approach has the best classification rate and the lowest occurrence of Types I and II errors, and that IC is indeed valuable for going-concern prediction.

Increasing environmental degradation in recent years, have been proposed the investigating relationship between the level of economic activities and Environmental indicators. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of agricultural technologies on carbon emissions in Asian countries by using of panel data method for annual data from 2000-2010.The results show that among all the agricultural technologies indicators, Agricultural Mechanization variable has largest effect and Agricultural irrigated land has least impact on carbon emissions. For Every one percent crease The use of mechanization, carbon emissions rises to 0/19 %.Also for Every one percent crease in land under irrigation carbon emissions rises to 0/01 %. Therefore, In line with the results of this study suggest it should be used machines with High productivity. When the development of agricultural technologies In addition to the goal of increasing production in the agriculture sector, will also be considered the impact the development of agricultural technologies on carbon dioxide emissions.

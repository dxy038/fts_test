Producing good quality products is an important process control objective. However, achieving this
objective can be very difficult in a continuous process, especially when quality measurements are not
available on-line or they have long time delays. In this paper, a control approach using multivariate statistical
models is presented tc achieve this objective. The goal of the control approach is to decrease variations
in product quality wihout real time quality measurements. A PCA model which incorporates time
lagged variables is used, and the control objective is expressed in the score space of this PCA model. A
controller is designed in the model predictive control (MPC) framework, and it is used to control the
equivalent score space repres~ntation of the process. The score predictive model for the MPC algorithm
is built using partial least squares (PLS). The proposed controller can be developed from and implemented
on top of existing PI]) control systems, and it is demonstrated in two case studies, which involve
a binary distillation column c.nd the Tennessee Eastman process.

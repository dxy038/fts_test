One problem in applying intelligent methods to real applications is to validate their expertise. Turing test approaches are useful in validating intelligent systems. Nevertheless, validation burdens experts with a heavy task. A concept called the &#8220;bi-directional, many-sided explanation typed multi-step validation method&#8221;, which enables the sharing of validation tasks among experts, knowledge engineers and computers, is proposed to diminish this load. The principal characteristics of the validation tool are as follows: 1) effective and anonymous bidirectional interactive functions by way of a virtual anonymous ID, which enables the protection of the experts´ social position; 2) a response accelerator that greatly improves the responsiveness of many-sided explanations by providing an experts´ validation server to fetch and store large volumes of information in advance; and 3) a validation process management function that detects delays in busy expert validation processes

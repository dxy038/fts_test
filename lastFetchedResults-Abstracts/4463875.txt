This study presents a new Sag Swell Generator (SSG) topology to generate several power quality problems such as sag, swell and interruption. In this paper, bridge type bidirectional switch based SSG is presented to generate different fault conditions. The main contribution of proposed topology is to provide low-cost and simple solution compared to conventional transformer based SSG topologies. The experimental results show that the proposed SSG is a novel topology for low-cost laboratory applications.

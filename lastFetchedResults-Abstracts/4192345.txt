In this paper, a PV energy source has been connected to a flywheel (FW) for short term energy storage in addition to a battery (BAT) for long term energy storage. The purpose of this system is to serve as a part of a shipboard power system as means to deal with large transient loads. In order to make a robust power system for such loads, we propose a flywheel connected to a dc motor and connect this flywheel system to the common dc bus through a bidirectional dc/dc converter. An agent based control scheme has been applied to this system to make the system more robust against single point failures, reduce the amount of information needed to be transferred, and make it easier to add or remove other sources to the system in the future. We have designed and simulated, and then developed an experimental setup for the proposed system. The simulations and experimentals show that the system is very robust specifically for transient loads.

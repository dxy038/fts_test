Objective
Midazolam is a significant and effective drug for control of a life-threatening
condition, generalized and partial refractory convulsive status epilepticus. The
goal of this study was evaluation of midazolam efficacy for management
of this serious disease and its two side effects, hypotension and respiratory
failure.
Materials & Methods
Our study was done using a quasi experimental method; 22 children with
generalized refractory convuls ive status epilept icus and 13 with partial refractory
convulsive status epilepticus were enrolled for the study. All patients received
O.2mglkgldose as a bolus intravenous midazolam followed by 1-6 meg/kg/min
continuous intravenous midazolam. Following this, terminat ion of seizures as
well as hypotension and respiratory failure were evaluated.
Results
Midazolam ceased stop convulsions in 81.81% (18) patients with generalized
seizures,and in 76.92% (10) patients with partial seizures, showing no significant
difference between these two types of seizures (p=0.52)
Hypotension was induced in 18.18% (4) patientswith generalized seizuresand in
30.70% (4) patients with partial seizures, again difference not significant (p=O.14).
There was respiratory failure in 21.73% (5) patients with generalized seizure and
in 7.69% (I) patients with partial seizure, difference not significant.(p=O.09)
Conclusion
There was no significant difference in efficacy and creation of hypotension and
respiratory failure after continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam between
generalized and partial refractory convulsive status epilepticus

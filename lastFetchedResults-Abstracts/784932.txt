Impaired masticatory function is generally considered to be a contributing factor in the
development of malnutrition (1, 2). Furthermore, the exclusion of essential and high-fibre foods from the
subjects’ diets, due to chewing problems, may induce gastrointestinal disorders (3-5). Objective: The impact of
masticatory function on malnutrition and gastrointestinal symptoms was evaluated. Design, Setting, and
Participants: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in four nursing homes in Berlin, Germany.
119 residents (mean 86, ± 8.0 years, 62-102) took part in the study. Measurements: Dental status, denture quality,
prosthetic condition as well as masticatory ability and gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated by clinical
examination or interview. Nutritional state was determined according to Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA).
Results: The mean Body Mass Index was 24.4, ±4.9 kg/m² (17% < 20 kg/m²). The mean MNA was 22.5, ±4.3,
51.3% below normal. 54.5% of the dentures were poorly fitting. No significant relationships were found between
the MNA and dental parameters except loose fit of dentures. However, there was significantly more food
avoidance among the subjects with stated chewing problems, discomfort with dentures or ill-fitting dentures and
there were significantly more digestive complaints among this group. Conclusions: Impairments of masticatory
function may lead to food avoidance and to a higher incidence of digestive complaints.

The authors discuss research whose objective is to optimize the simulation process required for development of the precision distance measuring equipment (DME/P) critical area guidance material. This material is developed from the analysis of error contour plots, which provide the guidance system errors along the desired approach path due to signal scattering from a surface vehicle. The contour data are generated by executing the microwave landing system (MLS) mathematical model considering an interfering surface vehicle positioned at selected locations on an M&#215;N grid and analyzing the model data as described. Optimal grid spacing is necessary to accurately describe the errors as a function of surface vehicle location while minimizing the simulation time required. A method based on the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform is described to estimate the spatial frequency spectrum of the contour data. Once spectral estimates become available, the optimal grid spacing is obtained using the Nyquist sampling theorem. To further reduce the overall processing time of this task, parallel processing is desired. A technique for parallel implementation on a Symult S-2010 message passing system is presented

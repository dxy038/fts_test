Introduction: Nausea is one of the most important problems after outpatient surgeries. This problem, is not only unpleasant, but could also cause patients to stay longer in the recovery room and hospital. If this is accompanied by vomiting, it will cause aspiration and mortality.
Objective: This study was carried out to compare metoclopramide, droperidol and promethazine for prophylaxis of nausea after outpatient surgeries.
Materials and Methods: Samples were selected from 150 patients (that were divided into three groups of 50), presenting to Family Planning Specialization and Research Center. Inclusion criteria for the study were as follows:
(1) Age 20-30 years (2) Physical status (ps I, II) (3) No co- existing disease that increased nausea and vomiting (4) No administration of drugs that increased nausea and vomiting (5) Weight 60-90 kg (6) Height 9 160-170cm).
For these patients, prophylactic doses of Metoclopramide (0.1- 0.25 mg/kg), Droperidol (0.625-2.5 mg), Promethazine (0.25- 0.5 mg/kg) were administered and then induction and maintenance of anesthesia were conducted in a similar, way.
Results: Incidence of nausea with Metoclopramide was 66%, with Droperidol 20%, and with Promethazine 62% (P<0.05)
Conclusion: Our present study as well as the previous studies have similar results.
It seems that administration of antiemetic drugs not only reduce the incidence of nausea but also the severity of this complication therefore, in case of unavailability of drugs that are more effective to control nausea (Ondansetron and Propofol), administration of prophylactic doses of Droperidol in outpatients surgeries is prefered.

This study proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) of reverse osmosis (RO) networks for seawater desalination. The membrane transport model takes into consideration of the longitudinal variation of the velocity, the pressure, and the concentration in the membrane modules. The RO network with three type energy recovery device options (pressure exchanger (PX), Hydraulic Turbocharger, and turbine) is introduced. Lexicographic optimization (for calculation of a more effective payoff table) and augmented Îµ-constraint method (to avoid inefficient Pareto solutions) are proposed to solve the MOO problem. A fuzzy decision maker is introduced to derive the most efficient solution among Pareto-optimal solutions. Firstly, different energy recovery option studies show that using PX is seen to be the most profitable option. Exergy analysis is used to evaluate the contribution of the equipments in energy degradation. Secondly, the proposed multi-objective framework simultaneously optimizes the total annualized cost (TAC) and energy consumption. With the increases of weighting for the main objective function: TAC, the most efficient solution moves to lower TAC direction. Finally, system recovery rate is added as the third objective function. It is reasonable to stay at the appropriate system recovery rather than to increase up to its limit and generating high energetic losses.

This paper describes optimization of the combustion chamber geometry and
injection timing of a new generation of EF7 engine, where CNG is directly injected to the
combustion chamber, with the aim of providing the best mixture at low and high speeds.
The Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is coupled with the KIVA Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, with grid generation, in order to maximize the 
ammable
mass of the mixture. This would result in better combustion and improved fuel economy.
The optimization variables related to the combustion chamber are seven geometry variables
and injection timing. Through the present optimization, a great improvement in mixture
distribution is achieved. The optimization results show that early injection with a shallow
bowl shape can be advantageous at high speeds, while late injection would result in better
results at low speeds

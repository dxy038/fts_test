
Background and Objective: Skin to skin continuous contact between mother and neonate, induced by the first breastfeeding, is the fourth of the ten steps for successful breastfeeding during one to two hour of birth that lead to express early breastfeeding behaviors. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of two methods of crawl and routine breastfeeding on behavior of breastfeeding during two hours after delivery.
Materials and Methods: This clinical trial study was performed on 60 women in Imam Ali hospital, Zahedan, Iran, during 2009-2011. Participants were selected by purposive sampling and were randomly divided in two groups of crawl and routine breastfeeding. In crawl group, the neonate immediately after birth (before all of interventions) lied on mother's skin between breasts and abdomen for 60 minutes to start breast crawl without helping. In routine group, the neonate only lied on mother's skin between breasts and abdomen for 15 minutes. Then, in both groups the neonate was wrapped and closed to mother to be breastfed under the nurse supervision. During this time, 6 items of breastfeeding early movement and 4 items of successful breastfeeding behavior were evaluated by infant breastfeeding assessment tool (IBFAT) scale; mother's satisfaction of skin contact with neonate was recorded according to numeric scale (0-5). The data were analyzed by SPSS 15, Indepentat t and Mann-Whitney.  
Results: 4 successful breastfeeding behavior items (P  <  0.001), and four breastfeeding early movement items (P  <  0.001) were significantly better in crawl group. Skin sense satisfaction was significantly higher in crawl (4.37 ± 0.62) than routine (1.93 ± 0.85) group.
Conclusion: According to our findings, crawl method was more effective than routine method regarding young mothers' satisfaction, this method can be recommended to promote successful breastfeeding.

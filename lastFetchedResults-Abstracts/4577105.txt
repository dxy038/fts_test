The parameters of the capacitive position sensing circuit for a differentially-driven electrostatic actuator are designed in this paper. Taking the practical requirements into consideration such as SNR requirement, nondistortion and saturation-free conditions, each parameter boundaries and the resultant boundary are determined. In the resultant boundary, the sensitivity function of the charge amplifier output with respect to the displacement is used as an objective function and the parameters producing the highest sensitivity in the obtained boundary are determined. The experimental results are given proving the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure

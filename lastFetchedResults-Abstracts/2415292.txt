Objective
Neonatal seizures are the most common neurological symptoms and often signal
an underlying serious neurologic condition. This study determines the frequency
of neonatal seizure, predisposing factors, and brain computed tomography (CT)
scan findings.
Materials & Methods
In a descriptive cross-sectional study, we evaluated all neonates with seizures
who had been hospitalized in Besat hospital from 2007â€“2012. All data were
gathered with questionnaires and used to compare with statistical tests by SPSS
(ver 16).
Results
141 (4.08%) neonates (M:F; 1:2.2) were diagnosed with neonatal seizures.
From the total number of 3,452 neonatal hospitalization, 78% of neonates with
seizures were less than 10 days old and 60.3% of infants were born from natural
vaginal delivery. As the most common cause, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
in this study was associated with 31.3% (n=44) of neonatal seizures and with the
highest mortality rate (n=6). Among admitted neonates with seizures, the overall
mortality rate was 12.8% (18 cases). A total of 33.3% of patients (47 cases) had
abnormal CT scan reports and 24.8% (35 cases) of patients were not evaluated
with a CT scan. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (47%) and local ischemic
changes (25.5%) were the most common findings in the CT scans of neonates
with seizures.
Conclusion
There was a significant correlation between neonatal seizures and delivery
circumstances (p-value  <  0.05). Therefore, with improvement of obstetric and
delivery circumstances, early detection of predisposing factors and other rare
conditions, and rapid effective treatment of these contributing factors, the rate of
neonatal seizure in this period can be reduced.

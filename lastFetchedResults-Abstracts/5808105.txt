This paper reports on a software test bed, called the Maintenance and modification Planner (IO-MAP) which has been developed for a series of explorative studies on whether and how technology characteristics may improve risk identification in maintenance and modification planning for oil and gas installations in future integrated operation (IO) work practices. Preliminary findings from the first study in the series are also outlined. The objective of IO-MAP is to enhance the quality of planning and, in particular, improve interaction between onshore- and off-shore based personnel in the planning process. Further, IO-MAP is used to study how risk identification can improve by using a digital graphic work surface and a set of agreed symbols and logics to illustrate factors that affect the safe and effective execution of the work tasks undergoing planning. Preliminary findings indicate that such tools have the potential to play an important role in preparing and undertaking the planning process as such as well as serving as the basis for precise communication and discussion of plans that have already been made.

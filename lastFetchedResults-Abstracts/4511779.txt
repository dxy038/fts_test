In the field of multiple robot control and artificial life, group formation of agents, such as aggregation, distribution, lining and so on, is one of the important problems. The objective of this paper is to develop a mechanism of forming such an agent group. In the conventional system, an agent is set to follow predetermined rules such as Boid, or it has only an internal state. Therefore, the group of such the agents is limited to the shape of the group. However, we often form a group such that the shape of the group is almost the same but its characteristic is different, for example, a group that is easy to distribute and a group which is robust to a noise. For making such the group, in this paper, we set two-dimensional inner state in the agent, as well as subjective one-to-one evaluation. Then we investigate the characteristic of the proposed agent system.

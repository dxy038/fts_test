At present, there are more than one million visually-impaired people in Thailand. This project has an objective for carrying out a system which helps and supports them for going shopping and productsÂ´ property comparision by themselves. We developed an application with navigation function and barcode scanner in order to assist people with visual disability to solve the identified problem. From the experimental result for time spending on both navigation and barcode scanning, visually-impaired users spend most of the time on barcode scanning. After being trained how to use the application, the total time spent decreases to 29.94 %.

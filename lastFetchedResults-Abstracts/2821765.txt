The objective of this paper to effectively use the spectrum available to us. As demand for more and more data increases, we have to efficiently use the spectrum because spectrum available to us is in limited quantity. A full algorithm for a distributed dynamic channel allocation has been proposed by using ResMes and dynamic programming. It can be seen that the algorithm is free from any deadlock and also avoids co-channel interference. The algorithm proposed increases the hardware but it is able to reduce the processing time very well. The Quality of Service (QoS) can be improved very well by using the dynamic channel allocation and large percentage of the population can be accommodated with less call dropping and blocking number.

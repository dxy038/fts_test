Increased water demand due to economic growth, irrigation needs, declining precipitation levels and over-abstraction of groundwater are all factors that create fresh water shortage problems in the Aegean Archipelago islands. In order to face pressing needs, water is transported by ships from the mainland or other neighbouring islands at a high cost. The objective of the present work is to analyse the current status of water shortage problem in the Hellenic islands and to provide reliable data concerning the water quantities being imported in the areas of Cyclades and Dodecanese. Furthermore, information concerning the cost of water transport in these areas is given. In parallel, the promising solution of desalination plants powered by renewable energy sources is proposed as a feasible, sustainable and cost-effective method for the water shortage problem of the Hellenic Aegean islands.

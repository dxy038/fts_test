This paper presents the nonlinear control for variable speed wind turbine (WT) where the dynamics of WT is derived from single mass model. The main objective is to maximize the energy capture from the wind and reduce the drive train oscillations. In order to control the WT the generator torque is considered as the control input. This torque depends on the optimal rotor speed derived from the effective wind speed. The effective wind speed is estimated from aerodynamic torque and rotor speed by using modified Newton Rapshon (MNR). The conventional techniques such as aero dynamic torque feed forward (ATF) &amp; Indirect speed control (ISC) which does not depend on the effective wind speed, are unable to track the dynamic aspect of the WT. The other disadvantages of the above conventional methods are more power loss and not robust with respect to disturbances and uncertainties. To overcome these weaknesses nonlinear controllers are found to be more suitable than the conventional controller. In this paper a sliding mode control with integral action i.e. integral sliding mode controller (ISMC) is applied to the WT and a modified Newton Rapshon is used to estimate the effective wind speed. The result shows the significance improvement in proposed controllers compared with existing controllers.

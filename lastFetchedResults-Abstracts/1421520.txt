In this study, the influence of bulges around the dimples rim on the sliding friction and wear behavior was investigated. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of the influence of bulges on the sliding friction and wear at various normal loads and reciprocating speeds. The experimental test results showed that the friction coefficient and wear rate of the dimpled specimen with bulges were lower compared to that of the polished specimen, which may be attributed to the reduced contact area. Also, it was found that both sliding friction and wear behavior strongly depend on the sliding speed and normal load. The mechanisms of friction coefficient reduction and wear resistance enhancement were studied and discussed quantitatively.

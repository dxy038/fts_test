This paper presents an original approach for the optimization of drinking water distribution networks. A multi-scale design of point-to-points networks using the Lagrangian function coupled with the constructal approach is performed. Two tree-shaped networks (T- and Y-) are optimized and compared by taking diameters of pipes and bifurcation angles in the network as selected design variables. The objective is to minimize the total head losses (factor of energy consumption) subject to the overall water residence time (factor of water quality). Y-shaped structures are found better than T-shaped structures.

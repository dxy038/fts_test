Proper collections of human ejaculates are necessary for semen analysis and infertility
treatment purposes. The objective of this study was to assess the seminal characteristics of
ejaculates collected by patients via masturbation and coitus interruptus. Thirty individuals
produced one sample via masturbation and one via incomplete coitus during a 3-days interval.
The semen parameters were compared and analyzed with student t-test and Nemar test. The
results showed that mean values for progressive motility of spermatozoa were increased from
46.81+15.7% to 58.76+13.5% in coitus interruptus and masturbation, respectively (P < 0.01).
Also, the mean values for normal sperm morphology was 54.03+25.1% in coitus interruptus
and 63.36+13.4% in samples collected via masturbation (P < 0.01). In addition, sperm
concentration was significantly improved in ejaculates collected with masturbation (P < 0.05).
Although, insignificant, the concentration of round cells were lower in specimens collected
via masturbation than coitus interruptus. Therefore, via masturbation method, better semen
characteristics were yielded which subsequently may improve the infertility treatment
outcome.

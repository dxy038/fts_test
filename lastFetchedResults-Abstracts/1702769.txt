Anti-minority prejudice is a general anomalous phenomenon in Europe. Several empirical studies have shown that anti-Muslim discrimination is more serious and profound. The Muslim community is the most important minority in Europe. The question is whether racism is the reason for the social discrimination against Muslims in Europe.  In this paper, to explain the areas of discrimination it is divided into: "underlying reasons" and "driving reasons". Anti-Muslim discrimination in Europe is a result of the background of various forms of racism in Europe (as a precedent cultural background) and is the effect of political opportunism (as a new phenomenon). Discrimination required certain objective conditions of existence to be in place. Political opportunism is the stimulus of anti-Muslim discrimination. The political and economic interest of some political groups in Western culture, led to anti-Muslim discrimination in Europe.

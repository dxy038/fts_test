The main objective of this paper is the enhancement of power system stability by optimal tuning and placement of Power System Stabilizer (PSS) using evolutionary algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization - PSO). In this approach, Matlab and DigSILENT are employed and linked together in a genuine automatic data exchange procedure. Consequently, the test system and the controllers are modeled in DigSILENT and the PSO algorithm is implemented in Matlab. For evaluating the particles evolution throughout the searching process, an eigenvalue-based multi-objective function is used. The performance of the proposed PSO based PSS test system in damping power system oscillations is proved through eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulations.

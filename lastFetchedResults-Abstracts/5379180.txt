The main objective of this work is the comparison of a new connection admission control (CAC) algorithm that guarantee an elevated multiplexing level and also a good QoS to real-time multimedia traffic sources mapped over DVB-RCS standard service classes with a well known iterative CAC, mainly designed for the managing of real-time bursty traffic sources. We suppose the use of a multi-spot beam geostationary DVB-RCS satellite system with a regenerative payload. We also suppose to carry IP traffic via DVB/MPEG-2 packets both in return and forward links. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CAC, compared with the previous one, is the same but with very low computational complexity. In particular, the proposed scheme is based on a few elementary sum and product operations and has a linear computational complexity while the reference algorithm presents a quadratic one. Both algorithms guarantee the agreed QoS to real-time bursty connections that are more sensitive to delay jitter but the proposed one can manage also real-time multimedia traffic sources with high interactivity data levels.

Objective. Estimation of appropriate radial clearance of ceramic-on-ceramic total hip prostheses to realize squeeze-film lubrication.

Background. Some clinical results show that severe wear occurs at ceramic-on-ceramic interfaces of total hip prostheses if the design parameters are improper. Appropriate design is required to realize the optimum lubrication of joint prostheses.

Design. Squeeze-film thickness of total hip prostheses with different radial clearances was numerically estimated under the physiological conditions of normal walking.

Methods. The changes in the fluid film thickness between ceramic balls and a ceramic cups with radial clearances of various values from 10 to 80 μm were numerically estimated under the assumption of normal walking conditions by means of elastohydrodynamic squeeze-film lubrication theory including the three-dimensional theory of elasticity.

Results. The minimum film thickness remained over 0.02 μm during a few walking steps with a radial clearance under 20 μm and a head diameter of 28 mm. On the other hand, the fluid film was squeezed out during a few steps when the radial clearance was greater than 30 μm.

Conclusions. Squeeze-film lubrication can be realized in a ceramic-on-ceramic total hip prosthesis if the radial clearance is smaller than 20 μm on a head of 28 mm diameter.

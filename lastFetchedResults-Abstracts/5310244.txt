This paper presents a method of classification-rule discovery based on multiple objective particle swarm technique. The rules are selected at the creation rule process following Pareto dominance concepts and forming unordered classifiers. Initial executions, compared with other algorithms of the literature, show that this approach can be competitive and gives more liberty to choose rules.

A static network synthesis method for transmission expansion planning is presented. The static synthesis problem is formulated as a mixed-integer network flow model that is solved by an implicit enumeration algorithm. This model considers as the objective function the most productive trade-off, i.e. the one resulting in low investment costs and good electrical performance. The load and generation nodal equations are considered in the constraints of the model. The power transmission law of DC load flow is implicit in the optimization model. Results of computational tests are presented, showing the advantage of this method compared with a heuristic procedure. The case studies provide a comparison of computation times and costs of solutions obtained for the Brazilian North-Northeast transmission system

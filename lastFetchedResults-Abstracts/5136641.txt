The food supply system is one of the main elements of the army logistics system. The ultimate objective in a food supply system is to provide the food at the right time and in the right amount at the right place. If this objective is achieved, the morale, the health, and the strength of the soldiers on the battlefield will enormously enhance. The purposes of this study are to test if the existing food supply system of the Turkish army operates properly under the war conditions; to identify the potential problem areas; and establish time standards for different scenarios. We use simulation as the modelling and analysis tool to answer the above questions. The proposed simulation model of the army corps food supply system is built in Arena and the results are analyzed statistically.

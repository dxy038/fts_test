The objective of the following research is to theoretically quantify the enhancement of interphase mass transfer of dissolved non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) compounds from the non-aqueous phase to the aqueous phase and the enhancement of dispersive mass transport from a NAPL zone due to destruction of dissolved NAPL compounds. For relatively slow reaction rates, such as for permanganate and perchloroethene (PCE), local-scale mass transfer enhancement is expected to be small. Dispersive mass transport with reaction from a horizontal NAPL zone can be quantified using equations derived for a mathematically equivalent falling film reactor system. In contrast to local-scale interphase mass transfer, dispersive mass transport from NAPL zones may be significantly increased by reaction. Enhancement factors due to destruction of the NAPL compound(s) are mainly dependent on NAPL solubility and oxidant concentration and to a lesser extent on reaction rate, stoichiometry, and transverse dispersion coefficients. Higher NAPL solubility and/or lower oxidant concentration reduces the maximum expected enhancement factor. Reaction enhancement factors for mass transport from NAPL zones are expected to be in the range of 5â€“50 for permanganate and chlorinated solvents. Theoretical results suggest that assuming instantaneous reaction rates may be appropriate for dispersive mass transport from NAPL zones.

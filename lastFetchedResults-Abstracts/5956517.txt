A life cycle is defined as the description of the distinct phases, through which each product or organism passes during its life. For example, state transition diagrams (STD) describe the dynamic behavior of objects over time, by modeling the lifecycles of the objects in each class. This paper discusses the life cycle pattern by building a life cycle analysis pattern, based on the software stability model. The main objective of this paper is to generate a stable, generic, reusable, clear, concise and easily comprehensible life cycle pattern, using a stable pattern language and the software stability model.

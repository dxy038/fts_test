Communication in wireless network is either central server based or peer-to-peer network based, but in both cases professional experts like network administrators are required to set up and maintain the network. To access services from a server, an internet connection is must, even though the server and client are placed close to each other. These internet plans are very costly. To overcome these issues the paper proposes a spontaneous network based on wireless ad-hoc network where laptops are placed close to each other at a particular place for small period of time to access available services and resources within the network without internet connection and network experts. To implement such network paper proposes an Energy Efficient Self Configure Secure Protocol (EESCSP) which create and manage the spontaneous network. The protocol will be self configured and provide security while joining and accessing the services and resources into the network using trust level establishment mechanism which will be secure. The protocol performs all the tasks efficiently by saving the energy of nodes at the time of joining new node into the network hence Energy Efficient. The main objective of system is to create spontaneous network to integrate services and devices into the same environment, allowing users to access services instantly without any external infrastructure by providing security to the network with energy efficiency.

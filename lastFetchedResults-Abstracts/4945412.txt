An approach to the design of a bidirectional associative memory (BAM) using switched capacitor filter techniques (SC) is presented. Implementation of BAMs in general has so far been restricted to computer simulations, with encouraging results reported by various authors. The discrete time equation that characterized switched-capacitor filter design is shown to be applicable in recalling <e1>m</e1> stored vector pairs, (<e1>A</e1><sub>1</sub>,<e1>B</e1><sub>1</sub>), (<e1>A</e1><sub>2</sub>,<e1>B</e1><sub>2</sub>), . . ., (<e1>A</e1><sub>m</sub>,<e1>B</e1><sub>m</sub>) when all (<e1>A</e1><sub>i</sub><e1>B</e1><sub>i</sub>) are encoded in a correlation matrix <e1>M</e1>. The elements of <e1>M</e1> (and <e1>M</e1><sup>T</sup>) are represented by the values of the capacitors ratios used in the switched-capacitor BAM (SCBAM). The SCBAM, like the normal BAM, is shown to have error correcting properties, making it a good candidate for analog neural network implementations

OBJECTIVE: Low-grade systemic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. C-Reactive Protein (CRP), an acute phase protein produced by hepatocytes, may be associated with diabetes. 
This study aimed to compare serum levels of CRP in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), impaired glucose tolerance test and control subjects. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case control study, 30 women with GDM and 28 women with impaired glucose tolerance, (according to Carpenter and Coustan criteria) were compared with 31 normal pregnant women as control group. Groups were matched for gestational age, age and BMI before pregnancy. At 24-28 weeks of gestation, CRP levels were measured in three groups and compared with each other. 
RESULTS: Our study showed serum CRP level was not significantly different among three groups. The median of serum CRP level in women with GDM, abnormal glucose tolerance test, and normal women was 8.8(7.5), 6.9(8.25) and 11.40(5.8) mg/dL respectively. In GDM patients, there was a significant correlation between CRP and BMI before pregnancy (r=0.467, p=0.033). 
CONCLUSION: We didn't find a significant correlation between maternal serum CRP level and gestational diabetes but our study showed a significant correlation between pre-pregnancy BMI and CRP in gestational diabetic women.

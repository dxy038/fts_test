Today in competitive market, quality of products is an important factor to the survival of organizations. One aspect of quality is reliability of product; hence, it is necessary to improve reliability. There are some ways such as allocation of redundancy and backup components to system for enhancement of system reliability by using available data .Sometimes precise data are not available and fuzzy logic help to perform exact analysis. In many practical situations apart from enhancement of system reliability other goals such as minimizing weight and volume and cost are concerned. These goals are mutually conflicted therefore the problem changes to a multi-objective problem. In this paper a mathematical model is proposed for optimal allocation of number of redundant components at each stage of multi-stage system with structures such as parallel-series, standby and k-out-of-n to maximize system reliability and to minimize system costs subject to volume and weight constraints. Finally based on this model a numerical example surveyed considering component reliability during its life cycle is given. Also cost, volume and failure rate of components are assumed as triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Then model is solved with a meta-heuristic approach, simulated annealing, and the results are obtained. Results indicate that standby system has higher reliability than other structures.

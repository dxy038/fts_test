An enhancement of the coding and decoding strategies of a discrete bidirectional associative memory (BAM) reported by B. Kosko (1987, 1988) is presented. Use of the concept, identified as multiple training, can be guaranteed to achieve recall of a single trained pair under suitable initial conditions of data. In representative computer simulations the concept has been shown to represent an improvement in some instances over the original Kosko strategy for recall of multiple pairs. The use of the concept is illustrated, and theorems underlying the result are presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

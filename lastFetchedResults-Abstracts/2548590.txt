Drivers behavior is one of the most important factors in traffic safety. Understanding of this issue and its effective factors can be helpful to reduce the influences of human factors on traffic accidents. The objective of this study is to apply Manchester driver behavior questionnaire (DBQ) to a group of drivers who have overtaken on twolane rural roads and to analyze their behavior. Also, the relationship between DBQ subscales and overtaking type is investigated.Data collection was performed using field method (observations next to the roads). In order to analyze the data, factor analysis, analysis of variance, and logistic regression were used. Factor analysis led to producing a 4factor structure including errors, lapses, ordinary violations, and aggressive violations. The results showed that increasing in age and driving experiences gave rise to a decrease in violations scores. Moreover, the results demonstrated a relationship between demographic variables, the score of violations, and type of overtaking. In addition, older drivers had low tendency to commit violations. The purpose of the trip was one of the effective factors for drivers&#039; behavior and types of drivers  overtaking maneuver. Drivers who were on business trips committed more violations and errors than others. Among DBQ factors only the violation factor was effective for predicting the type of overtaking.

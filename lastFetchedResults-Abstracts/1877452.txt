s
escriptive, cross-sectional study included 57 patients. Knowledge was measured using the Knowledge of Oral Anticoagulation Tool. Adherence was assessed with a visual analogue scale and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study Adherence Questionnaire.
s
ts poorly understood symptoms relevant to over-anticoagulation and the effects of alcohol and vitamins on oral anticoagulants.

This work addresses informational-based methods for decision-making in Hilbert space, widely known as quantum decision-making, and their application to the control of mobile robot. We consider a mobile robot, whose objective is to find objects in a changing environment. We compare the robot performance under both a classical and a quantum decision making (control) approaches. Both approaches are driven by similar information-theory decision criteria. The robot behavior is physically studied by using an NXT Lego Robot at the CIM lab in Tel Aviv University.

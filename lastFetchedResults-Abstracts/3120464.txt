For multi-objective optimization problems, an improved multi-objective adaptive genetic algorithm based on Pareto front is proposed in this paper. In this algorithm, the non-dominated-set is constructed by the method of exclusion.The evolution population adopts the adaptive-crossover and adaptive-mutation probability, which can adjust the search scope according to solution quality. The experimental results show that this algorithm convergent faster and is able to achieve a broader distribution of the Pareto optimal solution.

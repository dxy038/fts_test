Presents an analysis of band energies and evaluates the effects of aliasing in perfect reconstruction (PR) multirate systems. An objective performance measure called nonaliasing energy ratio (NER) is defined. The merit of the new measure is emphasized with performance comparisons of popular block transforms and 2-band PR-QMF based hierarchical filter banks. It is shown that the new measure complements the widely used energy compaction measure

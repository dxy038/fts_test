Solved differential equations of the power system by Euler method programs, calculated the fluctuation of frequency and voltage resulted by the operation on the network during the restoration period. And continuous power flow method, which based on continuous load increase was used to calculate voltage margin during the network operation steps here. Established objective function, steady-state voltage margins as its variables, combined dynamic simulation programs to check whether there were exceeding limits phenomenon in the dynamic process, to select best order of the line reconnections, providing certain evidence for system restoration. Comparison among results of Simulation on IEEE 14 bus system with 5 generators proved the effectiveness of the method.

Objective:  A lag of many months occurs between journal issue publication and updates to electronic databases. The objective of this literature analysis was to identify and categorize all of the dental materials citations in biomedical journals that were published from July 1995 through December 1995.

Methods: Seventeen primary and 51 secondary journals were searched using their tables of contents to detect and record dental materials publications from July to December of 1995. Those journals that were typically rich in dental materials articles were classified as primary ones. Citations were categorized into 17 topics and divided into subsections. The review excluded case reports, most literature related primarily to dental implants, and most articles on biomedical materials used outside of the field of general dentistry.

Results: The greatest number of citations was related to topics of dentin bonding and resin-based restorative filling materials (composites and glass ionomers). There was no major change in the number of dental materials publications per year reported from 1993 (n=786) to 1995 (n=751).

Significance: This citation list provides a comprehensive resource for use by academicians and researchers to bridge the gap between intial publication and access to electronic searching methods for major databases.

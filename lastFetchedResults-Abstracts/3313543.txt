Opt Bees is an algorithm inspired by the processes of collective decision-making by bee colonies designed with the objective of generating and maintaining diversity, trading off exploitation (diversification) and exploration (intensification) and promoting a multimodal search, so that a broader coverage of promising regions of the search space can be achieved, allowing the determination of locally optimal solutions and/or multiple global optimal solutions. In this paper, the Opt Bees is presented in details and its performance is evaluated, in terms of global search, in all twenty-five minimization problems proposed for the Optimization Competition of Real Parameters of the CEC 2005 Special Session on Real-Parameter Optimization. The results obtained show that Opt Bees is competitive when the goal is just to obtain the best possible solution, without being necessary to determine locally optimal solutions and/or multiple global optimal solutions.

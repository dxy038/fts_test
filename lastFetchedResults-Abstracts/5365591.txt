There has been considerable interest in the development of high-power gyro-amplifiers, stimulated mainly by millimeter wave radar applications. For high performance radar, in addition to output power level, such parameters as gain, efficiency, phase stability, duty cycle, compactness and bandwidth have highly demanding specifications. The investigations of harmonic-multiplying gyro-amplifiers, a new kind of nonlinear relativistic electron device, which have been filed for patent application by H. Guo et al., are driven by the objective of developing coherent millimeter wave sources capable of basically satisfying the demands of advanced radar transmitters.

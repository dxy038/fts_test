BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Origanum Vulgare contains chemical materials, that has anticonvulsant, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-infection and antidiabetic properties, it stimulates central nervous system and production of testosterone hydroxylase. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of intraperitoneal injection of extracts of Origanum Vulgare on gonadotropin and testosterone hormones in male rats.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 60 male Wistar rats with weight approximately 190-120 g, in six groups of 10 animals were studied for 28 days. Groups were included control, positive control (SH) groups receiving 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/kg extract of Origanum Vulgare intraperitoneally. After the last dose, blood samples were taken from all groups and testes were removed from body. Levels of testosterone, LH and FSH were measured and after weighing, histological investigation of the testis was performed and groups were compared together. 
FINDINGS: The results of this study showed no significant difference in testes and body weight. Also the FSH hormone levels did not show significant differences. While hormone levels of LH and testosterone in the group receiving 400 mg/kg OriganumVulgare extract was 52.75 mU/ml and 8.36 ng/ml. Overall, the group receiving 400 mg/kg ethanol extracts of wild Origanum Vulgare had significant difference with control group and other investigated groups in terms of levels of LH and testosterone hormone (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Origanum Vulgare extract can increase testosterone and impact on the concentrations of LH in male rats. Thereby increasing the sperm density causes increase in fertility rate.

In this paper we propose a new methodology for selecting optimum flip angle acquisitions prior to injection of contrast agent, particularly in breast MRI.We have developed a mathematical framework in which the selection of optimum flip angles is partly obtained after minimizing a function that represents the error in the measured T1 before bolus injection. We formulate the problem using a standard MR signal model and perform error analysis assuming that errors in estimating T1 are due to signal noise. The objective minimization function we propose depends explicitly on the noise model for the MR signal and the flip angle. We determine analytically the optimum flip angle that minimizes the error in estimation of T1 values that are characteristic of tumor types. Based on the analysis, we provide an algorithm that is computationally robust, more efficient and more accurate than a recent method for estimating T1 for tumour. The algorithm has been applied to breast MR.

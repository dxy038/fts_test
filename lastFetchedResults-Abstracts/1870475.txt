A patient from the University of Pittsburgh is presented who developed autoimmunity during IL-2 based combination therapy. IL-2 was originally described as a “T cell growth factor” capable of expanding previously activated T cells, enhancing the cytotoxicity of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. High dose Interleukin 2 (HDIL2) is now FDA-approved for therapy of patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, based on its ability to induce durable responses in 5–10% of patients. The antitumor effect of HDIL2 is incompletely understood, but it appears that this regimen alters the balance of immigrant T effector cells in relation to T suppressor cells. It promotes a less immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inducing tumor regression in a subset of patients that is yet to be defined. The antitumor activity of IL-2, as for other agents that promote durable antitumor activity against melanoma such as interferon alpha and anti-CTLA4 antibody, is frequently associated with development of autoimmunity as observed in this patient. We present studies investigating the mechanisms for the therapeutic benefit of HDIL2 in melanoma.

In this paper, multi-objective control of a half-car suspension system is formulated as a mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> synthesis problem and this convex problem is solved using linear matrix inequalities. Then, the control design problem is re-formulated as a non-convex and non-smooth optimization problem with fixed order controllers and solved by using the recently developed HIFOO toolbox. Parametric studies show that tire damping can seriously impact closed-loop performance of actively controlled half-car models.

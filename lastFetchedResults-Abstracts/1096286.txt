Background: Transfer and utilization of research evidence in health promotion have caught great attention in recent years. The objective of this study was to assess the factors affecting knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of researchers in Golestan University of Medical Sciences (Golestan, Iran) regarding research knowledge transfer (KT) in 2010.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, KT-related KAP questionnaire was distributed among 120 researchers. However, only 89 individuals filled out the questionnaires. The questionnaire consisted of 4 knowledge items (score range: 0-4), 14 attitude items (score range: 0-56), and 8 practice items regarding KT. Time allocated to research activities and KT self-assessment score (0-10) were also included. Data was analyzed by linear regression analysis and Spearman's correlation coefficient (r).
Findings: The mean scores of KT-related knowledge and attitude were 1.92 ± 0.97 and 28.70 ± 5.40, respectively. During the past two years, the mean numbers of national and international publications of researchers and their proposals (as the corresponding performer or a colleague) were 4.50 ± 4.97 and 
5.02 ± 4.40, respectively. The mean score of knowledge had significant inverse correlations with age 
(P = 0.01; r = -0.28) and the number of years working as a professional (P = 0.01; r = -0.27). However, the mean score of attitudewas not significantly associated with any of the independent variables (P  >  0.05). The mean score of researchers' self-assessment regarding KT was positively associated with time allocated to research activities (P = 0.01; r = 0.28).
Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that KAP scores of researchers in Golestan University of Medical Sciences were low.

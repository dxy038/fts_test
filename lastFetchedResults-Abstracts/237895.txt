The main objective of this laboratory scale experiment was to study the effect of l-glutamic acid on the growth in media and removal of ammonium from ammonium solution and natural wastewater by Chlorella vulgaris NTM06. It was observed that higher levels (1.0% and 1.5%) of l-glutamic acid compared to control (0% l-glutamic acid) negatively affected growth of C. vulgaris NTM06 and enhanced removal of ammonium from ammonium solution as well as natural wastewater. After 24 h of incubation, 99% of 169.3 mg  –N/l was removed from ammonium solution by 1.5% l-glutamic acid treated C. vulgairs NTM06 cultures; removal in case of control was 70%. In case of natural wastewaters with initial ammonium concentrations of 1550, 775, 310 and 155 mg  –N/l, removal after 48 h of incubation were 60%, 88%, 61% and 55% respectively. Ammonium removals from ammonium solutions of pH 4.0–8.0 were similar, whereas adsorption of ammonium ions on to the surface of dead C. vulgaris NTM06 cells was around 11%. Compared to dark, cultures incubated under the light showed higher initial removal of ammonium, however, after 24 h, differences were not significant. Further research on the role of l-glutamic acid in micro-algal treatment of wastewater and its combination with other approaches such as co-immobilization of micro-algae with other organisms, starvation of micro-algal cells and the use of polymers is recommended.

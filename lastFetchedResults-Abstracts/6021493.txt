The objective of this paper is to build a simple voltage and current controlled modulation techniques for brushless dc motors using PSIM. In electric traction and most other applications, a wide range of speed and torque control of the electric motor is required. The dc machine fulfills these requirements, but the dc machine requires constant maintenance. But the brushless permanent magnet motors do not have brushes and so they require less maintenance only. Brushless dc motors are widely used in applications which require wide range of speed and torque control because of its low inertia, fast response, high reliability and maintenance free. The current controlled technique is based on the generation of quasi-square wave currents using only one controller for the three phases. The current control strategy uses a triangular carrier for the power transistors which is simpler and more accurate than any other options. Its Implementation has been done in PSIM. PSIM is a soft computing technique which has user friendly approach and some basic theories, the corresponding PSIM models for the BLDC can easily can be constructed.

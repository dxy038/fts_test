Introduction & Objective: Anabolic steroids (AS) abuse is spreading increasingly among professionals and amateur athletes taking part in gym halls. Healths educators' awareness of why athletes and gym users take such substances may help them to develop appropriate intervention. In this regard, perceived behavioral control (PBC) is defined as “a person’s estimate of how easy or difficult it will be for him or her to carry out the behavior”, and Self-efficacy (SE) is defined as “people’s beliefs about their capabilities to produce performances that influence events affecting their lives”. Both concepts refer to people's beliefs that they are capable of performing a given behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the role of SE and PBC in predicting AS use among male body builders. 
Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional study, totally three hundred male body builders in Hamadan were randomly selected. The data was gathered using a self-report questionnaire included: demographic characteristics, self-efficacy for not using AS, and PBC for not using AASs. Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess association between SE and PBC with AASs use.
Results: Based on the results, 24.3% (n=73) of athletes reported that they had used AS and 38% of them reported the history of using AS in the past. Logistic regression model showed SE (OR=0.851 P=0.000) and PBC (OR= 0.711 & P=0.000) that indicate association between low PBC and Low SE to use AS. 
Conclusion: High self-efficacy for not using AS and high perceived behavioral control have effective potential to protect adolescents against high risk behaviors. Comprehensive preventative health education programs need to emphasize on psychological factors that mediate and predict adolescents’ and youths' health-related behaviors.

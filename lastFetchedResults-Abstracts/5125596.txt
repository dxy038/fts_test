In this paper, a short-term load prediction (STLP) algorithm for dynamic economic dispatch is presented. This algorithm is based on using a finite autoregressive (AR) time series process in conjunction with a Kalman filter. Its objective is to predict load value with five minute intervals up to one hour into the future, with sufficient accuracy to be used for targeting dynamic economic dispatch

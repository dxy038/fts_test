A new 16-phase interleaved bidirectional dc/dc converter is developed featuring smaller input/output filters, faster dynamic response and lower device stress than conventional designs, for hybrid vehicle applications. The converter is connected between the ultracapacitor (UC) pack and the battery pack in a multisource energy storage system of a hybrid vehicle. Typically, multiphase interleaved converters require a current control loop in each phase to avoid imbalanced current between phases. This increases system cost and control complexity. In this paper, in order to minimize imbalance currents and remove the current control loop in each phase, the converter is designed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The high current ripple associated with DCM operation is then alleviated by interleaving. The design, construction, and testing of an experimental hardware prototype is presented, with the test results included. Finally, a novel soft switch topology for DCM operation is proposed for future research, to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS), or zero-current switching (ZCS) in all transitions.

Abstract

Background & Objective: There is a report about the 2-5% prevalence for septic arthritis by anaerobic bacteria. The relevance between synovitis and intestinal microbial flora has been a hypothesis for ten years. The PCR with sensitivity and specificity 99% for microorganism detection in acute, chronic and relapse forms of septic arthritis is helpful. In this research we aimed to diagnose intestinal anaerobic bacteria which are able to occur in bacteremia or septicemia.
Methods: The amplification of the 16srRNA and narG genes of anaerobic bacteria was carried out by three PCR reactions. Here we used universal primers for their detection.
Results: From 100 patients with septic arthritis, 61% were bacterial arthritis and 18% were infected by anaerobic bacteria.
Conclusion: On the base of nitrate reductase coding, the positive samples were identified as Enterobacter cloacae
and Methylovorus sp. O157   Escherichia coli and Borrelia garinii.

The objective of the paper is to discuss a tool which is proving extremely efficient in partial discharge measurement studies. Though the technique itself is not new, its application to partial discharge studies is. It will be demonstrated in this paper that it has tremendous power and this accounts for its rapid growth as an application in this field. The paper begins with the description of the fundamentals of wavelet analysis, wavelet categories and the properties of the associated wavelet transforms. PD pulses as acquired from detectors composed of different detection circuits are investigated and numerically simulated, and a method on how to select optimally the wavelet corresponding to the representative forms of PD pulse is then presented. Finally, applications of wavelet analysis to partial discharge studies are explored. The paper demonstrates that the wavelet based denoising method proposed in the paper can be employed in separating PD pulses from electrical noise successfully and can be used in pulse propagation studies of partial discharge in distributed impedance plant to provide enhanced information and further infer the original site of the PD pulse

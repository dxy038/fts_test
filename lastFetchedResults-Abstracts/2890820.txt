Each year, the number of stolen vehicle is on the rise. Usually, to prevent theft, a physical type countermeasure is used such as padlock, disk break lock and other more which is a preventive action but it is not enough safe. The objective of this study is to create a controllable system that can display the location of a vehicle using Global position system (GPS) to pin point the location and Global System for Mobile (GSM) as a mean for communicating with the vehicle for ease of finding after a theft attempt. The system is made to test the accuracy of the location that is send to the user when the vehicle is in motion and stationary in the city and suburb. The system is made by combining a micro controller with GPS and GSM, then comparing it with other similar device available in the market like Garmin and a reference website to find the radius of error. The study of proposed device begins by studying IEEE journal about alternative product and the vehicle itself. The hardware and program development is done by research and trial and error as the controller do not interact with both module at the same time, after successfully programming both module, it is combined into a single program with addition of interrupt program. The experiment is done in three set of tests so that the system accuracy can be determine when stationary and in motion on vehicle, output controlling is the test to determine if the controller can be made into anti-theft system. The result of the test concludes that the system can provide standard GPS coordinate when requested via Short Message Service (SMS). The system can also be used to control an actuator.

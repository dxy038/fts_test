In this paper, development of an efficient structural dynamic model updating technique is presented. Proposed technique is developed by combining and utilizing the benefits of multi-stage response surface method and Derringer´s function. Computational efficiency of the proposed technique is achieved by utilizing the benefits of response surface method. The efficiency with which the proposed technique is able to accurately evaluate the updating parameters is increased by using multi-stages of response surface method. Use of Derringer´s function helps in transforming the multi-objective optimization based model updating problem into a single objective type, thereby reducing the complexity level of the problem. It also helps in defining the model updating problem in a detailed and flexible manner. Success of proposed technique is demonstrated by applying it in updating the finite element model of a mechanical six degree-of-freedom spring-mass system.

Mobile devices, increasingly equipped with high capability processors and connected with fast wireless networks, have become a major consumer of multi-media content. Limited battery life on mobile devices makes power saving a critical factor in delivering a good user experience. This paper proposes a power aware streaming system that combines the emerging High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard and the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard. The proposed system uses power aware HEVC encoding technologies and client side power adaptation logic to adaptively control power consumption on the client device. The proposed power aware HEVC streaming system can improve quality of experience by setting full-length video playback as clientÂ´s objective. Demonstration of the proposed power aware HEVC system is available on the ASUS Transformer Xfinity (TF700T) tablet using an ARM processor.

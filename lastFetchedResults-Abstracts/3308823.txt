A main objective of an Information Centric Network (ICN) is to improve the network by placing the knowledge in center of the network design. This vision of the network needs an efficient distributed and decentralized knowledge plane. So, an important amount of knowledge should be disseminated over the supervised network, which remains an open problem. Indeed, the dissemination infrastructure must be able to ensure the transport of all information types including knowledge information, throughout the network, and guarantee its freshness. Another crucial aspect of the problem is related to the network robustness with respect to network failures. In this paper, we propose a new model of knowledge dissemination based on super peers architecture. We formalize the super peer selection problem as a K-medoids clustering task. Furthermore, to handle the dynamicity of the network and especially the changes of the end-user network topology, we improved the selection mechanism by adding an adaptive mechanism based on the Page-Hinkley statistical test. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves performances compared to other current approaches.

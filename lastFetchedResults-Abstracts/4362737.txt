A new approach to the detection of shapes under global deformations is presented. The algorithm is based in the combination of a generalized Hough transform (GHT) and an universal evolutionary global optimizer (UEGO). This method exploits the invariant characteristics to rotation, scale and displacement of the GHT to detect shapes deformed by a global deformation model, and without an initial positioning of the template. The GHT is used as an objective function for the UEGO, an optimizer that is able to find multiple optima with a low computational cost

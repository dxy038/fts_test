Folk medicinal practitioners (Kavirajes) form the first tier of primary health care providers to most of the rural population of Bangladesh. Kavirajes use simple formulations of whole plant or plant parts from medicinal plants for treatment of various ailments. The medicinal plants used by the Kavirajes differ considerably in various areas of Bangladesh. The objective of the present study was to conduct a survey on medicinal plant usage by the Kavirajes of Daulatdia Ghat area in Kushtia district, Bangladesh. Interviews were conducted with the help of a semi-structured questionnaire and the guided field-walk method. Plant specimens as pointed out by the Kavirajes were collected and identified at the Bangladesh National Herbarium at Dhaka. It was observed that the Kavirajes of Daulatdia Ghat area used 49 plants distributed into 38 families for treatment of different ailments. The Fabaceae family contributed 4 plants followed by the Agavaceae family with 3 plants. Leaves and whole plants constituted the major parts used (24.6% each), followed by roots (22.8%) and fruits (7.0%). The Kavirajes treated a number of ailments or disorders. Gastrointestinal disorders were treated with 13 plants; skin disorders were treated with 9 plants; respiratory disorders were treated with 8 plants. Other disorders treated included leucorrhea (5 plants), sexual disorders (7 plants), diabetes (4 plants), rheumatism (5 plants), gall bladder stones (3 plants), fever (3 plants), urinary tract problems (3 plants), and pain (5 plants). The Kavirajes also treated debility, hepatic disorders, infections, poisoning, menstrual problems, heart diseases, typhoid, cuts and wounds, edema, measles, helminthiasis, piles, malaria, obesity, insanity, and ear and eye infections. Taken together, the medicinal plants used by the Kavirajes considerable potential for further scientific studies, which can lead to newer and more efficient drugs.

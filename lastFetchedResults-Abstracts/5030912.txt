Low-carbon ecological agriculture system is a complex dynamic feedback system. Investigation shows that there exists the problem that two sides (breeding farm and farmer household) oppose each other in intensive breeding area. Based on System Dynamic (SD) analysis of DeBang livestock husbandry corporation, such as the growth limited archetype and the vertex weighted causal loop diagram of DeBang eco-economy system, we put forward and promote &#8220;Farmer-centered four-objective-responsibility ecological agriculture mode&#8221; in DeBang breeding area. Based on the method of fundamental rate in-tree models, a simulation and evaluation model is set up to simulate and evaluate the performance effect of these countermeasures. Some innovative techniques are put forward to promote the development of Four-objective-responsibility mode, which achieves prominent economic benefit, ecological benefit and social benefit.

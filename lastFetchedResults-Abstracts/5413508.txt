A two-stage high-frequency link inverter with active clamper, which has galvanic isolation, two-stage power conversion, bidirectional power flow, high efficiency, and high power density, is investigated in this paper. Modulation method and control strategy are developed for this inverter to achieve satisfactory system performance. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed modulation and control strategy.

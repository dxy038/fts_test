
Objective: Tooth loss is a common problem and since current tooth replacement methods
cannot counter balance with biological tooth structures, regenerating natural tooth structures
has become an ideal goal. A challenging problem in tooth regeneration is to find a proper
clinically feasible cell to seed.This study was designed to investigate the odontogenic potential
of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs) for seeding in tooth

regeneration.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental  study, three pregnant Sprague Dawley (SD)
rats were used at the eleventh embryonic day and rat fetuses were removed surgically
using semilunar flap under general anesthesia. The primary mandible was cut using a
stereomicroscope. The epithelial and mesenchymal components were separated and the
dissected oral epithelium was cultured for 3 days. We used flow cytometry analysis to confirm
presence
of
mesenchymal
stem
cells
and
not
hematopoietic
cells
and
to
demonstrate

the
presence of oral epithelium. Bone
marrow mesenchymal stem
cells (BMSCs) and cultured
oral epithelium
were then co-cultured for 14 days. BMSCs cultured alone were used
as
controls. Expression of two odontogenic genes
Pax9
and DMP1
was assessed using
quantitative
reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Results: Expression of two odontogenic genes, Pax9 and DMP1, were detected in BMSCs
co-cultured with oral epithelium but not in the control group.
Conclusion: Expression of Pax9 and DMP1 by human BMSCs in the proximity of odontogenic
epithelium indicates odontogenic potential of these cells.

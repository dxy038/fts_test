This paper analyzes the problem of multi-service transmission in multiuser cooperative networks. The objective is to maximize the best effort (BE) service utility while guaranteing the rate constraint of QoS service. In this paper, we first deduce the optimal power ratio of the source obtained power to total power. Based on this deduction result, the optimal solution of multi-service transmission is investigated. To further reduce the algorithm complexity, a suboptimal resource allocation algorithm is also proposed. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the utility and outage performance of these two algorithms when different value of power ratio is chosen.

This paper describes an experimental investigation of frequency memory in a recirculating amplifier storage device. The objective of the investigation was to determine what mechanism caused injected energy to shift to preferred storage frequencies. Using fast-acting crystal switches, the output energy was selectively viewed, and it was found that the energy in any circulation when viewed separately was of the input frequency. The spectrum photographs which are included in the paper show that the recirculating amplifier when operating with an open loop gain greater than unity does not oscillate at preferred frequencies.

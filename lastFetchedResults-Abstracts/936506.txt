Organic compost has been identified as an alternative to chemical fertilizer to increasing soil fertility and crop production in
sustainable farming. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of halophytic compost which are normally
available in coastal areas on growth parameters in Arachis hypogaea. Halophytic compost along with farmyard manure (FYM) and
phosphate solubilising bacteria (PSB) resulted in production of highest biomass such as plant height, number of compound leaves,
total number of root nodules, fresh and dry weight of root nodules and fresh and dry weight of plant. Various combination of
halophytic composts used in the present study, Suaeda compost+farmyard manure+phosphate solubilising bacteria treatment
showed an enhanced biomass when compared to other halophytic compost and control.

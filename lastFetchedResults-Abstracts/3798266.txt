The objective of any electric utility is to ensure that within a planning horizon, the future load demand is satisfied at a reliable level of performance. A sensitivity-based approach is used to determine the locations of network additions comprising new generation lines and the possibility of a phase-shifter to reinforce a heavily loaded a.c. system. The security of the new system is evaluated using qualitative and quantitative methods with further line additions if necessary. Tests carried out on the IEEE 24-bus reliability system are presented.

The objective of the Robot Work Crew (RWC) project is to investigate key challenges in multi-robot coordination when performing tightly coupled coordination tasks such as transporting and handling of long objects on challenging planetary terrain. In this paper, we focus on tightly coupled coordination of two Mars rovers transporting a long payload. We have developed practical decentralized compliancy control and coordinated comply control algorithms that effectively address compliant control for compliantly coupled multiple mobile robots. Experiments at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, CA of two Mars rovers carry an extended payload over uneven, natural terrain are used to validate and illustrate the approach

The objective of this research is to develop a rapid prototyping of DSP system, allowing design and implementation of real-time DSP algorithms on a single-chip system. The research and development method includes specifications, analysis, design, architecture, implementation, testing, and integration. We use a product-service-value system (PSV-S) approach to develop a computational heavy speech compression algorithm. The program requires 76 MIPS computation and 43 Kword memory, thus fits within a single chip of 100 MIPS TMS320C5409.

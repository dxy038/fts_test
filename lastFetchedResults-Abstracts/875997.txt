This paper studies the dynamics of a system of retarded functional differential equations (i.e.,
RFDEs), which generalize the Hopfield neural network models, the bidirectional associative memory
neural networks, the hybrid network models of the cellular neural network type, and some population
growth model. Sufficient criteria are established for the globally exponential stability and the existence
and uniqueness of pseudo almost periodic solution. The approaches are based on constructing
suitable Lyapunov functionals and the well-known Banach contraction mapping principle. The paper
ends with some applications of the main results to some neural network models and population
growth models and numerical simulations.

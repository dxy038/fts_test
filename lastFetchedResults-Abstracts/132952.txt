Objective: To study different carrier's effect on antibody production against T-2 toxin. Materials and Methods: Three carrier BSA, KLH and poly lysine were utilized, after been succinated and then each was conjugated to the hydroxyl group of T-2 toxin. Ten Balb/c mice were initially injected with 20 micrograms of conjugate containing CFA (Complete Frunds Adjuvant). The mice received booster injections of 20 micrograms of conjugate containing IFA (Incomplete Frunds Adjuvant) every 3 weeks during and after which bleeding was done. The serum was removed and indirect ELISA was carried out. Results; The mice were immunized by BSA-T-2, but their serum recognized the BSA (carrier ) much better than the T-2 (haptan). Conversely regarding KLH-T-2, T-2 (haptan) was recognized better than KLH, BSA and polylysine ,by mice sera. Conclusion: This investigation indicates that KLH carrier is better than BSA for con - jugation because it an adjuvant for immune system and has very sites for conjugation than BSA. Furthermore, KLH-T-2 conjugate elicits immune system response better and antibody titer was higher than BSA-T-2 conjugate.

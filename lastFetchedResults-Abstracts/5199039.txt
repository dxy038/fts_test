Achieving ubiquitous services across telecommunication networks have been an objective for most network and service providers. Several intelligent services are available due to the universal acceptance and implementation of the comprehensive GSM standard. However these services lack context which is the need of the modern times. With the development of computer-based location tracking systems and sensor systems a large amount of contextual information is easily available. This paper proposes the incorporation of context- aware services in the GSM networks. The architecture discussed in the paper explains gathering contextual information and facilitates the discovery, selection and execution of these services on a GSM-enabled mobile device.

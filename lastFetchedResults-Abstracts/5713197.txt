How to meet the QoS of the applications and improve resource utilization is an important problem in virtualized environment. In this paper, we propose a utility based resource allocation policy with QoS constrained in virtualized environment. Firstly, we build a model reflecting the mapping relation between performance metrics and resource allocation through Web server benchmarking experiments. Then, we devise a utility function as objective to optimizing the total utility and achieving a reasonable resource allocation. Finally, based on the model and the requirements of the applications QoS, we present an optimized policy for resource allocation in virtualized system. The simulation results show that the utility-based policy is effective to allocate resource from user perspective while improving the resource utilization.

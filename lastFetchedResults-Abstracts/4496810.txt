In this paper, we examine about the arrangement of the diversity antenna that is composed by the monopole antennas pasted on the monitor back of the PC and the television receiver. Mean Effective Gain (MEG) and Pattern Cross Correlation (PCC) were used as evaluation parameter (Taga, 1990). An antenna enclosed to the monitor is modeled by the wire grid model and the performance of the antenna is analyzed by the method-of-moment (MOM). The best position of the antenna was decided by multi-objective genetic algorithm (Kuwahara, 2005). A simple model based on the simulation results was experimentally manufactured. Evaluation tests were carried out using the fading simulator and validities of the design were confirmed.

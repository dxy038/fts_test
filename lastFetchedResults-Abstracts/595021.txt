Objective: To evaluate the results of augmentative plate fixation for femoral non-union after intramedullary nailing.Material and Methods: This study was conducted in the department of orthopaedic and Trauma Khyber Teaching hospital Peshawar from December 1995 to December 2003.Twenty-three cases of non-union femur shaft fracture after intramedullary nailing was included in the study. Non-union of femur treated with other mode of treatment was excluded. Leaving the intramedullary nail in situ, an augmentative plate fixation was applied to the fracture site to counter the rotational and axial instability. Simultaneous bone grafting was performed in some cases.Results: All these patients started walking with partial weight bearing with crutches at 4 months, and full weight bearing without crutches at 6 months. We obtained bony union within 6 months in all these cases.Conclusion: We have found this method a useful treatment for the nonunion of femoral shaft fracture after intra medullary nailing. The technique is simple and does not require any special instrument. It facilitates an early weight bearing and gives a quick recovery from non-union.


The Structure of Historical Reports is one of the favorite topics of historians and philosophers of the science of history a contrastive analysis of which in the Qar'an and the historical texts of early Islam centuries can pave the way for studying the effect of objective on the structure of historical reports.
The most common method of reviewing the structure of a text including historical reports is to take into account its horizontal structure, vertical structure, and the one that is focused on the meaning. In the horizontal structure, elements such as table of contents, introduction, the main text, and the conclusion are the main points of attention. In the vertical structure, however, words, sentences and clauses attract the most attention. On the other hand, in the meaningâ€“oriented structure, the three elements of the redundance of structure, the repetition of meaning, and the expansion of meaning in full are taken into consideration. In this paper, the structure of historical reports in the Qur'an are compared with selected texts of early Islamic centuries with having several major events of the Prophet's era in Medina in mind. While embarking on a comparison of vertical structure, the authenticity of issue, the linkage, the cohesion, and the chronological observation related to the historical reports have also been compared both in the Qur'an and the selected historical texts. The article ends with the offer that if religious goals and ideals overshadow the humanities including historiography, it will be possible to speak of the necessity of establishing a particular kind of aim-oriented structure in historical reporting alongside the existing structures of the present time.

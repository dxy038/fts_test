In order to solve the problem of state-extend in network multicast, aggregated multicast algorithm was proposed. Based on the existing routing algorithms, this kind of swarm intelligence algorithm (ant colony algorithm) can construct matching between aggregated trees and communication groups in the concurrent multicast groups and consequently improves the communication quality of network Group-tree matching problem in aggregated multicast is a two objective optimal problem with the objective of getting the maximal aggregation degree while using the minimum bandwidth. In order to reduce bandwidth waste, our algorithm will construct minimum aggregated trees to match with the existing communication groups.

The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of several regulatory factors associated with cartilage maturation in horses with early osteochondrosis (OC) compared to normal controls. The hypothesis was that expression levels of Indian hedgehog (Ihh), parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTH-rP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A), and matrix metalloproteinase-13 and -3 (MMP-13, -3) would be increased in OC. Articular cartilage and osteochondral samples were collected from the femoropatellar joints from seven OC and eight normal young (1â€“6 months) horses after euthanasia and snap frozen or suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde. Laser capture microdissection was used to capture cells surrounding cartilage canals and the osteochondral junction. Total RNA was isolated from whole cartilage and laser-captured cells. Equine-specific Ihh, PTH-rP, VEGF, PDGF-A, MMP-13, and MMP-3 mRNA expression levels were evaluated by real-time (RT)-PCR. Spatial tissue protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry.

er-captured samples, there was significantly increased MMP-13 and PDGF-A gene expression in chondrocytes adjacent to cartilage canals and increased PDGF-A gene expression in osteochondral junction chondrocytes of OC-affected foals. In full-thickness cartilage samples, there was significantly increased Ihh, MMP-3, and MMP-13 gene expression in OC samples, while PTH-rP protein expression was significantly higher along the osteochondral junction. The results suggest that pathways involving cartilage maturation and ossification are altered in early OC and may be associated with disease pathogenesis.

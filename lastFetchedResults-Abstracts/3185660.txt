Fundamental congestion control methods of Internet are based on reactive methods. The principle of these algorithms is the closed loop control of control theory, namely they measure parameters of the network and feed some information back to the sender. This feedback determinates the sending rate of competing flows. Currently most methods make use of per-flow feedback. This type of feedback cannot give strict guarantees on fair allocation of network resources inherently. One of the most important design and operational objective of transport protocols is the fair and efficient utilization of network resources. This is the main motivation for performance analysis of transport protocols. This paper presents the newly developed control method called Balancer that is designed to provide fair bandwidth allocation for transport layer data flows. The mechanism is implemented in the SimCast simulation environment. The method is based on the global knowledge of outgoing sending rate of controlled flows. The paper demonstrates the basics of this endpoint based congestion control. We prove the efficiency of the developed method through simulation results.

In allusion to the frame of a light truck, by the iSIGHT for optimization platform and ANSYS for strength and stiffness calculation platform, with frame mass minimum for objective function, the parameters of the optimal thickness of the frame parts is sought and the optimal solution is obtained by using the first-order optimal design method with the premise of the frame strength, bending stiffness, torsional stiffness and low order modal The analytical methods proposed in this paper can effectively solve the optimal design of the frame structure of the light truck frame, and has certain reference significance for the improvement of other similar structures.

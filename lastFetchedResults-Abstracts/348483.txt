Objective
To investigate the occurrence of the spread of the radial sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) among patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) during standard median orthodromic sensory conduction study (SCS) using index finger stimulation.
Methods
We prospectively examined 74 hands in 56 CTS patients. We stimulated the index finger using ring electrodes. SNAPs were recorded at wrist over median and radial nerves.
Results
A spread of radial SNAP was clearly identified over the median nerve despite its small amplitude, in 72/74 hands during stimulation of the base of the index finger. In hands with delayed median SNAP, two peaks were observed; however in hands with absence of genuine median SNAP, only one peak of the spread was noticed. The proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) stimulation still elicited an identifiable spread in 47/74 hands.
Conclusion
This spread phenomenon is a previously undescribed pitfall during the standard median orthodromic SCS, frequently occurring in CTS patients.
Significance
In severe CTS cases, one may make wrong conclusion of normal median sensory latency if unaware of this pitfall.

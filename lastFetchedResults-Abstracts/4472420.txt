This paper addresses the enhancement of the contrast of gray-level digital images while preserving the mean image intensity, thus, providing better viewing consistency and effectiveness. The contrast enhancement is achieved by maximizing the information content carried in the image with a continuous intensity transform function and the mean image intensity is preserved, by using the gamma-correction approach. Since the contrast enhancement and intensity preservation are contradicting, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm is developed to resolve this trade-off. Benchmark images, street senses and skyline images are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach

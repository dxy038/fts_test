Abajeru (Chrysobalanus icaco) is a plant that has hypoglycemic properties and is often used in Brazilian popular medicine. In order to identify the flavoring and hypoglycemic substances present in this plant, this work has an objective for the extraction of the essential oil presented in the leaves of abajeru using the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). The supercritical solvent used is CO2, because of its moderate critical temperature and pressure, atoxicity, low cost and volatility. The experiments were conducted using dried leaves in an apparatus containing a high-pressure pump, a stainless steel extractor of 42 mL of volume and a micrometric valve for sampling. Different operational conditions were tested, varying mainly the temperature (313.15–353.15 K) and the pressure (10.5–20 kPa) in order to investigate the efficiency of the process. The results showed that the best operational condition was at 20 kPa and 353.15 K. To compare the supercritical carbon dioxide results, the essential oil was also extracted by hydrodistillation and soxhlet, using ethanol as solvent. The chromatographic analysis showed that the different technologies studied extracted the same classes of compounds but the SFE obtained the extract with potential hypoglycemic activity with the presence of lupenol.

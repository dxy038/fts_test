We propose an energy efficient JPEG 2000 image transmission system over point-to-point wireless sensor networks. The objective is to minimize the overall processing and transmission energy consumption with the expected end-to-end QoS guarantee, which is achieved by jointly adjusting the source coding schemes, channel coding rates, and transmitter power levels in an optimal way. The advantages of the proposed system lie in three aspects: adaptivity, optimality, and low complexity. Based on the characteristics of the image content, the estimated channel conditions, and the distortion constraint, the proposed low-complexity joint source channel coding and power control algorithm adjusts the coding and transmission strategies adaptively, which can approximate the optimal solution with a tight bound.

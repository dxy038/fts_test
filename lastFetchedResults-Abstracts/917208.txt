Mannosyltransferases play a crucial role in mycobacterial cell-wall biosynthesis and are potential new drug targets for the treatment of tuberculosis. Herein, we describe the synthesis of α-(1 → 2)- and α-(1 → 6)-linked mannopyranosyl disaccharides possessing a 5-azidonaphthlene-1-sulfonamidoethyl group as photoaffinity probes for active-site labeling studies of mannosyltransferases in Mycobacetrium tuberculosis.

To optimize the operation of internal combustion engine (ICE), maximize fuel economy, and minimize emissions, many novel traction schemes have been developed. Among those, an electromechanical converter known as electric variable transmission (EVT) was presented in, which enables a continuously variable transmission (CVT), starter, and generator. It is especially suitable for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) as a series- and parallel-hybrid or a split-power hybrid transmission system. Similar designs could be found in with emphasis on either the design of machine structure and cooling or the analysis of electromagnetic field coupling. However, to successfully use EVT in HEVs, it is necessary to study the vehicle power flows and EVT control method to satisfy vehicle performance and optimize operation of subsystems. Besides, the EVT design specifications, such as rated power, rated torque and rated speed, are also closely related to the vehicle control target and control strategy.The objective of this article is to provide a control strategy for an HEV using an EVT. A global modeling for an EVT equipped HEV is needed to develop control strategy. Energetic macroscopic representation (EMR) is used to model such a complex system. It is a graphical tool (see "Synoptic of EMR") suitable for modeling and control of complex electromechanical systems. Using EMR, the interconnection of subsystems is organized according to the physical causality.

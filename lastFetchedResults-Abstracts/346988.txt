Objective: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a noninvasive indicator of sympathetic and vagal cardiovascular control known to be tightly correlated with sleep stages. Recent studies indicate that HRV in humans is altered by nocturnal exposure to power-frequency (60 Hz) magnetic fields. Given the central origin of autonomic cardiac control, we determined if field exposure in the beta1EEG/MEG frequency range was a more effective stimulus for HRV alteration than 60 Hz fields, and explored the mechanisms involved.
Methods: Healthy young men were exposed (n=9) overnight to an intermittent magnetic field (16 Hz, 28.3 microTesla, Î¼T), or sham exposed (n=9), under blind test conditions in a laboratory exposure facility.
Results: Field exposure was associated (P<0.05) with reduced power in the low band of the HRV frequency spectrum, and with decreases in mean heart rate. Analysis of the timing of the R waves surrounding each on-off transition of the intermittent field revealed no evidence for a direct effect on the cardiac pacemaker.
Conclusions: Magnetic field exposure in the EEG/MEG beta1 frequency range alters HRV via a CNS effect. Phase-resetting experiments rule out a direct effect on the cardiac pacemaker. Biophysical calculations of the intensity of the electric fields induced in brain versus heart under the present exposure conditions are also consistent with and support a central rather than a peripheral site of action.

Background: Environmental stresses and biotic and abiotic elicitors induce secondary metabolites biosynthesis and hypersensitive response in plants through activation of defense mechanisms.
Objective: This study was carried out with the aim of assessing the effects of different drought stress and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) levels on physiological variations, flavonoid and phenolic contents, and antioxidant capacity of Salvia mirzayanii.
Methods: This study was arranged in a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design under research greenhouse of medicinal plants department at Arak University. The first factor was considered as drought stress in 4 levels (25, 50, 75 and 100% of field capacity), and the second factor was designated as foliar spray of MWCNT (functionalized and non- functionalized) at 4 different concentrations (0, 50 and 200 mg/L).
Results: Results showed that drought stress and MWCNT and their interactions significantly affected some studied traits. Leaf relative water content (P < 0.01) and chlorophyll index 
(P < 0.05) was significantly changed under drought stress treatment, however, electrolyte leakage index significantly (P < 0.01) affected under different levels of MWCNT. Furthermore, total phenolics was significantly (P < 0.01) changed under interaction of experimental treatments. The highest and the lowest phenolics content were achieved in functionalized MWCNT exposed plants at 50 and 200 mg/L under 25% of FC, respectively. 
Conclusion: Application of functionalized MWCNT at concentration of 50 mg/L along with moderate drought stress improved physiological traits and antioxidant activity of extract in 
S. mirzayanii plants.

Objective: Our aim is to study first-trimester ductus venosus (DV) velocities in relation to cardiac abnormalities. Study Design: Ultrasound examination was performed in 85 normal fetuses and 45 fetuses with a nuchal translucency (NT) >95th percentile. Pulsatility index for veins (PIV) and velocity during late diastole (a-V) of the DV were measured and compared with the use of multilevel analysis, between fetuses with a heart defect and those without. Results: Compared with 85 normal fetuses, the a-V and PIV of the fetuses with NT>95th percentile and normal hearts were decreased and increased, respectively. The a-V and PIV of 11 fetuses with NT>95th percentile and cardiac defects were decreased and increased compared with the 25 fetuses with normal hearts, irrespective of the karyotype. The most common cardiac malformations were septal defects. Conclusion: Fetuses with NT >95th percentile and cardiac defects show markedly changed DV velocities. Because the type of cardiac defects cannot always explain the hemodynamic changes found in these fetuses, some other mechanisms seem to be involved. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:727-33.)

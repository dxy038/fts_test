Objective
jective of this study was to explore beliefs about medicines, using the Necessity–Concerns Framework, of patients who report adherence, unintentional nonadherence, and intentional nonadherence.

tudy performed a cross-sectional survey of patients starting a new medication for a chronic condition. Self-reported adherence was assessed via telephone interview. The Necessity–Concerns Framework was operationalized using the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire, which assesses beliefs about the necessity of and concerns with taking medications.
s
ional nonadherers, compared to adherers, had lower perceptions of the necessity of their new medication and higher levels of concerns about taking it. Conversely, unintentional nonadherers were not significantly different from adherers. Intentional nonadherers were more likely to rate their concerns as high relative to their need for treatment than both adherers and unintentional nonadherers.
sion
atients start a new medication for a chronic condition, intentional nonadherers hold beliefs significantly different from those of adherers and unintentional nonadherers. These findings have implications for practice in helping clinicians to reduce this type of nonadherence.

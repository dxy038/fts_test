To quickly index and retrieval the image of interest, the content-based image retrieval arose as a promising technique. Some CBIR algorithms based on color features are proposed and this paper also presents the design framework of a CBIR system and a prototype system implemented by author. Some test experiments are conducted on a fire image database with good precision and recall.

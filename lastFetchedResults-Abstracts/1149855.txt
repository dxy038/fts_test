The objective of the study was to build physical models (prototypes) of a product based on finite element (FE) process simulations to aid product engineering in the evaluation of the manufacturing ability of the product. A methodology and two computer programs were developed to translate the FE geometrical information into a geometric representation acceptable by most rapid prototyping (RP) systems. In the case of the ERC/NSM, the prototypes are built with a fused deposition modeling (FDM) machine. This report has been focused in the production of physical models based on the FE simulation results for sheet and billet forming processes. However, the programs can be used with other process simulations as well.

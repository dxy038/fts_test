Some results on the study of algebraic methods for the analysis and design of time-frequency signal processing algorithms are presented. A time-frequency signal is defined as a signal whose spectral characteristics vary with time. Time-frequency signal processing is the mathematical treatment of signals with the objective of extracting relevant information. The processing of time-frequency signals is accomplished through the development of suitable algorithms. Emphasis placed on the analysis, design, and modification of time-frequency algorithms for machine implementation, and on the development of an environment to assist on this implementation. This environment is termed a computational mathematics environment (CME)

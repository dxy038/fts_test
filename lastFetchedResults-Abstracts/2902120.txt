"Recognition of traffic signs" is a mobile application, which is used for recognition of traffic signs. The relevance of this theme is proved with the fact that we don\Â´t have analogs of this program, which will help the drivers to see and recognize traffic signs and enables drivers to remember signs by the way. Also this program will be useful for those people, who want to learn traffic signs just putting the camera of their phones to a sign. The objective of this application is to make the learning process easier.

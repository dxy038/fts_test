BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The association of malignant neoplasms arising in seborrheic keratosis has been previously proved. This study reports two cases of malignant neoplasms arising in seborrheic keratosis. CASES: The first case was a 79-year-old female who presented with a black nodule, recently became larger on her scalp: Histological examination revealed an irritated seborrheic keratosis transformation to a basal cell carcinoma in its periphery, extended the underlying dermis. The second one was a 76-year-old female with an ulcerated nodule arising in a pigmented lesion on her thigh. Histological examination of the nodule revealed squamous cell carcinoma arising in seborrheic keratosis.
CONCLUSION: Both cases presented a rare development of malignant change in seborrheic keratosis. Recent growth, an ulceration or nodule formation are signs of malignant changes and these lesions should be biopsied and examined histologically.

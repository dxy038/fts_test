A comprehensive procedure for the derivation of optimal, full-operating-range zero voltage switching (ZVS) modulation schemes for single-phase, single-stage, bidirectional and isolated dual active bridge (DAB) ac-dc converters is presented. The converter topology consists of a DAB dc-dc converter, receiving a rectified ac line voltage via a synchronous rectifier. The DAB comprises primary and secondary side full bridges, linked by a high-frequency isolation transformer and a series inductor. ZVS modulation schemes previously proposed in the literature are either based on current-based or energy-based ZVS analyses. The procedure outlined in this paper for the calculation of optimal DAB modulation schemes (i.e., combined phase-shift, duty-cycle, and switching frequency modulation) relies on a novel, more accurate, current-dependent charge-based ZVS analysis, taking into account the amount of charge that is required to charge the nonlinear parasitic output capacitances of the switches during commutation. Thereby, the concept of &#8220;commutation inductance(s)&#8221; is shown to be an essential element in achieving full-operating-range ZVS. The proposed methods are applied to a 3.7 kW, bidirectional, and unity power factor electric vehicle battery charger which interfaces a 400 V dc-bus with the 230 Vac, 50-Hz utility grid. Experimental results obtained from a high-power-density, high-efficiency converter prototype are given to validate the theoretical analysis and practical feasibility of the proposed strategy.

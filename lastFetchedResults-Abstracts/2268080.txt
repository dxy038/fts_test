In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, south east of Iran was the place for British and Russian competition. The objective of Russia was to pressure Britain for advancing towards India. On the other hand, the objective of Britain was to create a buffer zone and defensive wall for protection of India. Adjacent establishments of British and Russian consulates in the region were some of the competitive elements, exercised by the both governments, facilitating their corresponding objectives and interests. Through utilization of descriptive- analytical method and library resources and documents, this investigation is administered. The main question is, "What were the purposes and functions of British consulate in Kerman and Sistan?" The findings suggest that the approach of British in south east of Iran was militaristic. The research shows that 80% of staff members of consulate representatives in Kerman and 85% of staff members of consulate representatives in Sistan acquired militaristic legal personalities. In the course of activities of the British consulate in Kerman, the trade balance between Kerman and India-Europe increased from -83/60% in 1906-1907 to 53% in 1912-1913. By the establishment of the consulate in Sistan, the trade balance of the province with India increased to 89%.

Many of the existing analytical models for output buffered switching elements (SE) assume uniform traffic and infinite buffers at each output port of an SE. Moreover, because of simplifying assumptions, the results are not accurate. It is important to develop an accurate analytical model to tailor the design of the network parameters and optimize the network performance by proper dimensioning of the buffers. The objective of this paper is to develop an accurate model for the performance of MINs using finite output buffered SEs, and operating in the presence of nonuniform traffic patterns. It is shown that the proposed analytical model is much accurate than existing models

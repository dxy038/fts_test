The objective of this cross-sectional survey was to determine the prevalence rate of foreign bodies in fore stomachs of
sheep regarding of kind, number, position and penetration of them. By systematic random sampling 435 slaughtered
sheep have selected from slaughter houses of Torbat-e-Heydarieh. The sex and age of the sheep according to dental
formula was recorded. Adhesion between reticulum and other organs, pregnancy condition, rumen and reticulum
foreign bodies, kind and number of foreign bodies and penetration position were recorded. The results were analyzed
statistically by chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests. Statistical analysis showed that 51.3% of animals have no
foreign bodies, 44.4% have non metallic and 0.9% have metallic foreign bodies. 3.4% have even both metallic and
non metallic foreign bodies (92%). There was no significant association between numbers of foreign bodies with
age (p=0.6464), sex (p=0.7325) and pregnancy condition (p=0.7325). It was conducted that pastures are the main
source of sheepâ€™s food in Torbat-e-Heydarieh and also other sites of Iran. High prevalence of foreign bodies in
fore stomachs of sheep (48.7%7) is a result of the drought in several years ago that led to starvation and pica and
subsequently foreign bodies ingestion.

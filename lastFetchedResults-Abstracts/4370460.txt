The objective of this paper is to reinforce studentsÂ´ understanding of sampling through experimentation. The scope of this paper is very narrow, focusing on a single laboratory exercise for learning about sampling, which is a critically important topic for students to comprehend. The digital oscilloscope makes an ideal platform for studying sampling, aliasing, and quantization, because not only does the digital oscilloscope have a built in A/D converter and all the supporting electronics, but it has display capabilities in both the time and frequency domains. Additionally, students obtain a better understanding of test and measurement equipment such as the digital oscilloscope

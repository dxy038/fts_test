A review of the recent developments of LMI-based robust filtering problems is presented, which include robust filtering problems for time-delay systems, stochastic systems, nonlinear systems, as well as multi-objective robust filtering problems. Robust filtering for special systems and conservatism reduction issues are also discussed. Finally, future research directions are pointed out.

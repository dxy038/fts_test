Objective: This study assessed the efficacy and safety of end-to-end anastomosis of the trachea following segmental resection in chronic tracheal stenosis. Methods: End-to-end anastomoses of the trachea were performed in 35 patients with chronic tracheal stenosis; 18 patients with tracheal invasion of thyroid cancer and 17 patients with long-term intubation and blunt injuries of the trachea. Results: All operations were successful, except one whose unilateral recurrent nerve had not been identified in the recurrent thyroid cancer invasion with trachea. Conclusion: This operation provides a one-step cure for the stenosed trachea and can be applied to the resection of less than six tracheal segments.

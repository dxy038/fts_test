So as to meet the demand of real-world cargo transportation problem, the loading weight of vehicles is brought into the objective function of traditional Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which creates the weighted VRP (WVRP). The WVRP Benchmark and Algorithm Management System in this paper, provide a substantial platform for data management, including both WVRP instances and algorithms. Most importantly, the implementation of the system enables the integration of WVRP instances and related algorithms, which can further test the effectiveness of WVRP algorithms and may prove the benefits of WVRP modeling in later research. This paper introduced the structure design and function modules of WVRP Benchmark System, and explained the detailed implement of the system. Specific examples are displayed to prove the system effectiveness. The system provides an instrument and technical support of WVRP research and may in turn be beneficial to WVRPÂ´s future study.

This paper deals with the motion generation approach developed for our omnidirectional mobile robots. Our objective, overall control architecture of the mobile robot, and its motion controller are considered. The key idea and advantages of the proposed motion generation approach are discussed. The approach is implemented and tested on the omnidirectional mobile robot and the experimental results obtained are presented. The operation of the control system is illustrated by a video on the remote control of the robot and the visually-coupled motion of the two robots

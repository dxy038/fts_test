Firstly this article presents a thorough discussion of semantics formalization related issues in model driven engineering (MDE). Then motivated for the purpose of software implementation, and attempts to overcome the shortcomings of incompleteness and context-sensitivity in the existing models, we propose to study formalization of semantics from a cognitive background. Issues under study cover the broad scope of overlap vs. incomplete vs. complete, closed world assumption (CWA) vs. open world assumption (OWA), Y(Yes)/N(No) vs. T(True)/F(False), subjective (SUBJ) vs. objective (OBJ), static vs. dynamic, unconsciousness vs. conscious, human vs. machine aspects, etc. A semantics formalization approach called EID-SCE (Existence Identification Dualism-Semantics Cosmos Explosion) is designed to meet both the theoretical investigation and implementation of the proposed formalization goals. EID-SCE supports the measure/evaluation in a {complete, no overlap} manner whether a given concept or feature is an improvement. Some elementary cases are also shown to demonstrate the feasibility of EID-SCE.

This study centers on multiple-scheme encryption using annotation technology. The objective was to propose a composite encryption framework that combines several encryption specifications. It was assumed that combining several encryption standards can further enhance information security. It divided a message to be encrypted into packets and each packet was coded with a methodology independent of other packets in the same information cluster. No specific consideration was given to the chose and specificity of division of information into packets. The conception attempted using Internet Web pages as a launch pad. A selected Web page was divided into paragraph and sub titles. Each paragraph was coded using one of the encryption standards. Annotation model was applied to code packets. Coding and decoding of the entire page or/and sections of page is achieved via accompanying annotations.

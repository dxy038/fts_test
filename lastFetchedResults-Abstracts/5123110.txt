This paper emphasize on the investigation of small-signal behavior of a Coupled Inductor Bidirectional DC-DC (CI-BDC) converter being controlled by a Voltage Mode Control (VMC) technique. The small-signal model including converter parasitics is derived using the SS averaging technique. This linearised converter modeling makes the design of closed loop controller much easier. The closed loop model has also been developed and simulated using SIMULINK/MATLAB software. The parasitic effects on stability and closed loop regulation have been made extensively. Simulation results of closed loop controlled CI-BDC converter show the good regulation and stability over wide range of load variations. The analyses show that the proper consideration of parasitics is also a very important for controller design.

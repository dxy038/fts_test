The objective of this paper is to describe and assess the application of Controller Area Networks to Direct Load Control programs, extending the CAN applications from industrial sector to residential automation. The proposed system allows the customers to monitor and control automatically their heating and cooling individual loads, maintaining minimum comfort levels and offering a flexible, low-cost and friendly tool-through a graphical user interface environment-in order to active the demand-side participation in the current deregulated electricity markets. Finally, an application example to real residential loads is also presented.

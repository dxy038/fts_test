We assessed the activity of neoadjuvant sunitinib on primary renal tumors in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma as well as the feasibility and safety of subsequent surgical resection.

l of 19 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma deemed unsuitable for initial nephrectomy due to locally advanced disease or extensive metastatic burden were treated with 50 mg sunitinib daily for 4 weeks-on and followed by 2 weeks-off. Tumor response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors every 2 cycles and the rate of conversion to resectable status was estimated.

 patient age was 64 years and initial median radiographic renal tumor size was 10.5 cm. Clinical stage was N+ (10) and M+ (15). No patient experienced a complete response. Partial responses of the primary tumor were noted in 3 patients (16%), 7 (37%) had stable disease, and 9 (47%) had disease progression in the primary tumor. Overall tumor response included 2 patients (11%) with partial response, 7 (37%) with stable disease, and 10 (53%) with disease progression. At a median follow-up of 6 months (range 1–15) 4 patients (21%) had undergone nephrectomy and 5 died of disease progression. No unexpected surgical morbidity was encountered. Viable tumor was present in all 4 specimens. Sunitinib was associated with grade 3–4 toxicity in 7 patients (37%) and treatment was discontinued in 1 due to toxicity.

stration of sunitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma with the primary tumor in place is feasible and can lead to a reduction in tumor burden that can facilitate subsequent surgical resection.

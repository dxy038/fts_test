Today enterprises are increasingly interested in carefully managing, cataloging, and analyzing their information both to insure that it is properly handled and also to make it more useful to their business. Therefore, how to achieve efficient management of large amounts of document objects within certain cost and effort in order to support the business requirements becomes an emerging issue. In order to achieve the goal, a prototype system for object management in private cloud environment is introduced in this paper. The object management system mainly focuses on the functionalities of object manipulations, synchronization among different client devices, and sharing among users. The objective is to extend such sophisticate features and ease the complexities to everyday users and applications.

This paper presents a novel hybrid optimisation algorithm namely HBCSD, which synergises a bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA) and spiral dynamics algorithm (SDA). The main objective of this strategy is to develop an algorithm that is capable to reach a global optimum point at the end of the final solution with a faster convergence speed compared to its predecessor algorithms. The BFA is incorporated into the algorithm to act as a global search or exploration phase. The solutions from the exploration phase then feed into SDA, which acts as a local search or exploitation phase. The proposed algorithm is used in dynamic modelling of two types of flexible systems, namely a flexible robot manipulator and a twin rotor system. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithm outperforms its predecessor algorithms in terms of fitness accuracy, convergence speed, and time-domain and frequency-domain dynamic characterisation of the two flexible systems.

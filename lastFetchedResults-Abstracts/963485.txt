Tuberculosis could involve every organ. CNS involvement occurs in 10â€“15% of patients with
extra pulmonary tuberculosis. This paper presents an unusual case of tuberculoma. A 36- year-old man
was referred to Qaemshahr Razi hospital with decrease in consciousness level and paraparesia. His brain
MRI revealed small and multiple hyperatenuated lesions in pons, hypothalamus and temporal lobes.
Analysis of CSF fluid was consistent with TB meningitis. Anti-TB drugs and prednisolone was started for
the patient. His status improved and his brain MRI involvement resolved by the end of treatment. In an
endemic area, tuberculosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for patients with fever,
decrease in consciousness level and neurological deficit.

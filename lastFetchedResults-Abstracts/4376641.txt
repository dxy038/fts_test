Unidirectional inductive power transfer systems allow loads to consume power, while bidirectional inductive power transfer (BIPT) systems are more suitable for loads requiring two-way power flow such as vehicle to grid applications with electric vehicles. Many attempts have been made to improve the performance of BIPT systems. In a typical BIPT system, the output power is controlled using the pickup converter phase shift angle, while the primary converter regulates the input current. This paper proposes an optimized phase-shift modulation strategy to minimize the coil losses of a series-series compensated BIPT system. In addition, a comprehensive study on the impact of power converters on the overall efficiency of the system is also presented. A closed-loop controller is proposed to optimize the overall efficiency of the BIPT system. Theoretical results are presented in comparison to both simulations and measurements of a 0.5 kW prototype to show the benefits of the proposed concept. Results convincingly demonstrate the applicability of the proposed system offering high efficiency over a wide range of output power.

Network-connected distributed generations is the development trend of future distribution network. It is important to investigate the position and determine the capacity of distributed generations (DG) in the existing distribution network. Considering the balance of power flow and the quality of electric energy supply, a DG mathematical model of position and capacity determining is built. The planning objective is to maximize the size of DG and minimize line losses of distribution system. The case studies have been carried on a 33-node distribution network through genetic algorithm. The simulation results show the proposed DG planning model and genetic algorithm are correct and feasible.

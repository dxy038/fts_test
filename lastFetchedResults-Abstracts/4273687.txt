In this paper, we treat a supply chain where a retailer stocks up from several subcontractors in order to face a market with fixed demand D. The objective is to help actors, in an asymmetric informational context, to reach agreements and establish fair contracts where each actor is remunerated according to his added-value in the chain. To handle the problem, we have chosen the multiagent paradigm. We present two multi-agent models. A first model (M1) where a retailer agent negotiates several combinations (price, quantity) with the different subcontractor agents. Then, we present a second model (M2) where we have a retailer agent negotiating with several subcontractor agents, but we have also a fair agent who tries to provide some fairness guidance in the negotiation process in order to rebalance the negotiation and guide the negotiators to the fairest possible negotiation. Several experimentations have been made to compare results of the two models.

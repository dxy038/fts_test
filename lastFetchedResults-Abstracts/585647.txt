After iron deficiency, zinc deficiency is the major micronutrient deficiency
in developing countries, and staple food fortification is an effective
strategy to prevent and improve it among at-risk-populations. No
action has been taken to reduce zinc deficiency via flour fortification so
far in Iran, and little is known about the influence of zinc fortification
of flour on serum zinc and the iron status, and also about the optimum
and effective amount of zinc compound that is used in food fortification.
The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of consuming
zinc-fortified breads on the zinc and iron status in the blood serum.
In this study, three types of bread were prepared from non-fortified
and fortified flours, with 50 and 100 ppm elemental zinc in the form of
sulfate. Eighty zinc-deficient women aged 19 to 49 years were randomly
assigned to three groups; The volunteers received, daily, (1) a nonfortified
bread, (2) a high-zinc bread, and (3) a low-zinc bread for one
month. Serum zinc and iron were measured by Atomic Absorption
before and after the study. Results showed a significant increase in
serum zinc and iron levels in all groups (p  <  0.001) except in the control
(p  >  0.05). Absorption of zinc and iron in the group that consumed
high-zinc bread was significantly greater than that in the group
that received low-zinc bread (p  <  0.01). It was concluded that fortification
of flour with 50â€“100 ppm zinc was an effective way to achieve
adequate zinc intake and absorption in zinc-deficient people. It also
appeared that consuming zinc-fortified bread improved iron
absorption.

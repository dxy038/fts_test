Objective
Tissue-specific stem cells divide to generate different cell types for the purpose of 
tissue repair in the adult. The aim of this study was to detect the significance of 
neurogenesis in the central nervous system in patients with cerebral palsy (CP).
Materials & Methods
 A search was made in Medline, CINAHL, PubMed, ISI Web of Science and 
Google Scholar from 1995 to February 2011. The outcomes measured in the 
review were classified to origins, proliferation, and migration of new neurons, 
and neurogenesis in CP.
Results
According to the review of articles, neurogenesis persists in specific brain 
regions throughout lifetime and can be enhanced from endogenous progenitor 
cells residing in the subventricular zone by growth factors or neurotrophic 
factors and rehabilitation program.
Conclusion
Most of the studies have been conducted in the laboratory and on animals, 
more work is required at the basic level of stem cell biology, in the development 
of human models, and finally in well-conceived clinical trials.

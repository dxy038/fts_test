In this work ten different polymeric microfiltration membranes of different materials polyethersulfone (PES), cellulose mixed esters (CE), cellulose acetate (CA), polypropylene (PP) and nylon (NY) with different pore diameters and of different commercial companies have been tested for wine clarification. A stirred cell has been used in all the membrane experiments. The objective has been to find the most suitable pore diameter, material and supplier that guarantees a suitable hygienisation and clearness without altering the organoleptic properties for the assayed red 12Â° ordinary wine.

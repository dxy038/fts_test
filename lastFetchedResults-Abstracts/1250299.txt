Several successful applications of optimal control theory (OCT) based on the Pontryaginâ€™s minimum principle have been recorded in literature. These applications were focused on optimizing the operating policy of multi-reservoir systems. In this study, the performance of OCT algorithm in designing multi-reservoir system is investigated. Three deterministic optimization models based on the OCT were developed to design the best storage strategies in a multi-reservoir system to supply water. Multi-objective programming methods were implemented in the three models in order to consider the two non-commensurate objectives of minimizing cost and water deficit. The applications of these models to a multi-reservoir system were compared to an existing dynamic programming model. The result of this study showed that in all cases, the developed OCT models presented sub-optimal solution in designing multi-reservoir systems.

The design of piece-wise maps for code generation in Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DS/SS) systems is a challenging problem. We propose the use of genetic programming (GP) to design maps that can be used for the generation of codes in DS/SS systems. Using appropriate functional operators, we use GP to construct exploitable maps of the interval [0,1]. The search is directed based on a multi-objective genetic programming framework with the two criteria being the average auto-correlation and cross-correlation performance of the maps

 In this method we are having the S3C2240A (ARM9) Board which is ported with Linux in it. And this ARM9 board with Linux will be connected to the Touch Screen device. This ARM9 board intern will be connected to the LAN network (Ethernet). To design this fax machine we are using two Arm controller boards. One Arm board will keep at fax Transmission side and another board will keep at fax receiving side. By using the Ethernet we will send and receive the fax, for that we are using TCP/IP server and TCP/IP client. In this fax machine we have too many options on touch screen of arm like retrieve, sign, send, save etc. By selecting the retrieve option we can see the received text data on touch screen. If we want to transmit text data, we can select send option, then the fax will sent to the destination. On the receiving side, the received fax will be displayed on LCD touch screen. If necessary, we can sign directly on the touch panel by selecting the sign option. If we want to retransmit that signed document, we should active server. In this way bidirectional transmission and reception is possible.

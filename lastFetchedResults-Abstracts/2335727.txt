For long-term mineral trapping of sequestered CO2 in deep saline aquifers, base cations such as Ca2 + and Mg2 + are essential. As a natural analogue study of geologic carbon storage in deep aquifers hosted in sedimentary formations, we examined the hydrochemistry of sulfate-rich (up to 1140 mg/l SO42 −) and moderately high PCO2 (10− 1.1 to 10− 2.4 atm) groundwater in a Cretaceous non-marine sedimentary basin in South Korea with the objective to elucidate water–rock interactions controlling the concentrations and behavior of base cations. Principal component analysis of the acquired hydrochemical data indicated that dissolution of carbonates (calcite and dolomite) and evaporite minerals (halite and gypsum) controls the chemical composition of groundwater, resulting in substantial increases of the concentration s of Ca2 +, Mg2 +, Na+, Cl−, SO42 − and total dissolved solids (TDS) in deep groundwater. Na+ versus Cl− and Ca2 ++ Mg2 + versus HCO3− + SO42 − plots provided evidence for dissolution of halite and gypsum. Progressively increasing δ34S values of dissolved SO42 − (from 15.1 to 19.2‰) with increasing sulfate concentrations indicated gypsum dissolution. Ion–ion plots (esp., Mg2 +/Ca2 +, Ca2 +/SO42 − and Mg2 +/SO42 −) and saturation indices of calcite, dolomite and gypsum suggest that the groundwater chemistry (esp., the concentrations of Ca2 + and Mg2 +) is controlled by dedolomitization driven by gypsum dissolution. Groundwater in the study area does not reach complete equilibrium with respect to calcite and dolomite because of gypsum dissolution, which controls the Mg2 +/Ca2 + ratios of groundwater. Continued calcite precipitation triggered by an excess Ca supply from gypsum dissolution reduces the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in groundwater. The increase of δ13CDIC values from − 11.1 to − 6.5‰ concomitantly with increasing sulfate concentration was explained via geochemical modeling by dedolomitization under the rate constant ratio of about 0.038 between dolomite and calcite. The model results agree well with the observed Mg2 +/Ca2 + ratios and further suggest a potential increase of the void volume in the aquifer through dedolomitization by about 0.72 cm3/l. Based on this analogue, we suggest that dedolomitization in concert with dissolution of gypsum may constitute an important process releasing base cations for mineral trapping of injected CO2 in non-marine clastic sedimentary strata containing carbonates and gypsum in South Korea and elsewhere.

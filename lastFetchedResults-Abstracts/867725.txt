We consider a parallel-machine scheduling problem with a learning effect and the makespan objective.
The impact of the learning effect on job processing times is modelled by the general DeJongâ€™s learning
curve. For this NP-hard problem we propose two exact algorithms: a sequential branch-and-bound
algorithm and a parallel branch-and-bound algorithm. We also present the results of experimental evaluation
of these algorithms on a computational cluster. Finally, we use the exact algorithms to estimate
the performance of two greedy heuristic scheduling algorithms for the problem.

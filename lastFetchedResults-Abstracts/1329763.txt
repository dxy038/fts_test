This paper deals with an inverse technique, based on a multi-objective optimization, for the identification of model parameters defining damage and failure mechanisms in composite materials. The identification process is based on experimental tests of thin-walled cylinders in composite material and finite element analyses. The parameters identified are then used in finite element analysis to predict the dynamic response of subsequently modified energy absorbing structures manufactured for high performance vehicles. Overall assessment shows a good correlation between the experimental and numerical results. The numerical solutions are within 3% of experimental test data and yield noticeable structural performance improvement when evaluating the parameters under static loading.

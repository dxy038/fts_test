In this paper, Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is applied to solve the optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problem. The ORPD problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained single-objective optimization problem where the real power loss and the bus voltage deviations are to be minimized separately. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, it has been tested on IEEE 30 bus system consisting 6 generator and compared other algorithms reported those before in literature. Results show that GSA is more efficient than others for solution of single-objective ORPD problem.

Summary form only given. A finite number of optically anisotropic layers are considered with the objective of determining spectral transmission properties and dispersion relations of photonic band gap crystal structure. In the case of isotropic layered media, the electromagnetic radiation can be divided into two independent (uncoupled) modes. These are TE modes and TM modes. Since they are uncoupled, the matrix method involves the manipulation of 2 X 2 matrices only. In the case of birefringent layered media, the electromagnetic radiation consists of four partial waves. Mode coupling takes place at the interface where an incident plane wave produces waves with different polarization states due to anisotropy of the layers.

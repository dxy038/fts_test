Objective(s): To assess the effects of gynecological risk factors on bone mineral density (BMD) in Iranian perimenopausal women.
Methods: The study population was referred women to the bone densitometry unit of Shariati hospital during 2000-2003 periods. After exclusion of 531 women reporting past or present corticosteroid use, 3209 women formed the final study population. Present HRT users (217 women) had significantly higher lumbar and femoral BMD than non-hormone users and this population excluded from further analyses. Postmenopausal status, late menarche, and late menopause were risk factors for low BMD. Protective factors against low BMD were increased body weight and increased number of pregnancies. In opposition to similar studies, hysterectomy and bilateral oopheroctomy had no significant relationship with decreased BMD.
Results: A significant reverse correlation was found between length of breast-feeding and BMD. In the multiple regression analysis, gynecological variables could account for only 23.5% of the variance in lumbar BMD and 38% of variance of femoral BMD.
Conclusion: We conclude that reproductive history gives rise to some special risk groups, to whom BMD measurements and osteoporosis prevention efforts should be directed. However, it is impossible to predict BMD by gynecological characteristics.

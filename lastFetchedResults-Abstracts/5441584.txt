Stochastic optimisers such as Evolutionary Algorithms outperform random search due to their ability to exploit gradients in the search landscape, formed by the algorithmÂ´s search operators in combination with the objective function. Research into the suitability of algorithmic approaches to problems has been made more tangible by the direct study and characterisation of the underlying fitness landscapes. Authors have devised metrics, such as the autocorrelation length, to help define these landscapes. In this work, we contribute the Predictive Diagnostic Optimisation method, a new local-search-based algorithm which provides knowledge about the search space while it searches for the global optimum of a problem. It is a contribution to a less researched area which may be named Diagnostic Optimisation.

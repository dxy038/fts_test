Background & Objective: Disability-Adjusted life Years (DALY) summarizes the fatal and nonfatal outcomes of
diseases and injuries in one number and gives a quantitative assessment of the health of a population. Estimating
the burden of diseases and injuries in Iran in terms of DALY both nationwide and in 6 'provinces.
Methods: We used slightly modified versions of the methods developed by the World Health Organization for
estimating the burden of premature mortality, disability, and the DALY.
Results: The DALY rate per 100,000 was 21572 and 62% of this was life lost due to premature mortality; the
remaining 38% was due to disability from diseases and injuries. Fifty-eight percent of the total DALYs had been
lost due to non-communicable diseases, 28% due to external causes (injuries), and 14% due to communicable,
maternal/ perinatal and nutritional illnesses. The group of diseases and injuries with the highest burden in moles
waz intentional and unintentional injuries (2.789 million DALYs), while in the female population this position was
held by mental disorders with 1.191 million DALYs. The single most important cause of burden was traffic
accidents in males and ischemic heart disease in females. Disease burden showed considerable variability
between different provinces. Conclusion: The profile of health and disease in Iran has generally shifted from the
predominance of communicable, maternal/perinatal, and nutritional illnesses towards predominance of noncommunicable
diseases and injuries at the national level. These figures on disease burden at population level are
the most objective evidence tha t can be used in policy making and management of health programs, health
research, and resource development within the health sector.

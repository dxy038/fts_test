Abstract  
Introduction: In recent years, the appearance of nervous blindness caused by drinking the herbaceous distillates has created some serious anxieties. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to introduce a sensitive, accurate, inexpensive and easy method for measuring methanol in herbal distillates, based on chromotropic acid method and use the respective  results to determine some herbal distillates methanol content produced by different companies. 
Materials and Methods: In this study, 30 herbaceous distillates (10 different kinds from 3 companies) produced by industrial method were used as samples and all of tests were done by using a new trademark kit for herbal distillates. This new kit was designed and innovated based on valid chromotropic acid method recently patented.
Results: The obtained results showed that all of the examined samples were having different amounts of methanol.
Conclusion: Since the continued production of methanol occurs in life time of plants, the determination of permitted amount of methanol in herbal distillates is necessary. In addition, all of the producers and the supervising centers must control the methanol level in such products

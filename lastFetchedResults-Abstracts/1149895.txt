Turn-milling is a relatively new concept in manufacturing technology, wherein both the workpiece and the tool are given a rotary movement simultaneously. This new technology opens up new ranges of applications in the manufacturing processes. The objective of the present work is to investigate the process of orthogonal turn-milling for the machining of rotationally symmetrical workpieces within the normally available range of speeds and feeds (comparable to those used in turning) to explore its advantages. The emphasis has been laid mainly on the surface-finish of the machined surface achieved and the chip length. The experiments have been conducted for orthogonal turn-milling of brass and mild-steel workpieces using the planning of experimental technique to study the surface-finish achieved. The experiments on turning have been conducted for both the workpiece materials to make a comparative study of the surface-finish and the chip geometry achieved in case of orthogonal turn-milling and turning.

Experimental results show that in orthogonal turn-milling, the surface-finish of the machined surface improves with increase in cutter speed and deteriorates with increase in axial feed rate. The surface-finish achieved by orthogonal turn-milling is about 10 times higher than that achieved by turning. Also, the chips produced in orthogonal turn-milling are very small as compared to the chips produced in turning. Hence, orthogonal turn-milling can be an alternative to turning where high surface-finish and easy chip disposal are desired.

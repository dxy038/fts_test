Intercell interference co-ordination is considered within 3GPP for evolved UTRA (E-UTRA). The objective is to improve coverage and increase cell-edge bitrate. A number of static and dynamic schemes have been suggested. In this study some basic schemes have been evaluated by means of simulations. Also, the impact of link performance and carried services has been investigated. Of the static schemes the simple 1-reuse performs best for wideband services. The bandwidth reduction (in Hz) with other schemes cannot be regained by the link improvement (in bps/Hz) achieved by the interference reduction. The link performance has a significant impact on the co-ordination gain. Static schemes improve the cell-edge bitrate with a single receiver antenna but not with the two receiving antennas expected in E-UTRA. Interference co-ordination will be more efficient for narrowband services since the frequency bandwidth allocated to each cell is then better utilized. For wideband packet data services a dynamic scheme is required to improve compared to a simple 1-reuse.

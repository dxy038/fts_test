Northrop Grumman Space Technology (NGST) is developing an advanced heterogeneous integration (AHI) process to integrate III-V semiconductor chiplets on CMOS wafers under the compound semiconductor materials on silicon (COSMOS) DARPA program. The objective of the program is to have a heterogeneous interconnect pitch and length less than 5 um to enable intimate transistor scale integration. This integration will enable significant improvement in ADC dynamic range and bandwidth.

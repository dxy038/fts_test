The objective is to perform a bifurcation analysis of a modified Beeler-Reuter membrane model for ventricular myocytes for studying the structural stability of attractors. For the integration of the stiff nonlinear differential equation system the hybrid integration algorithm is applied. The time constant &#964;<sub>h</sub> of the inactivation gate h is used as bifurcation parameter. Results are shown in the time domain, in the phase space as well as in a bifurcation diagram

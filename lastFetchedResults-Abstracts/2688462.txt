The objective of the field-reversed configuration heating experiment (FRCHX) is to obtain a better understanding of the fundamental scientific issues associated with high-energy density laboratory plasmas (HEDLPs) in strong, closed-field-line magnetic fields. These issues have relevance to such topics as magneto-inertial fusion, laboratory astrophysical research, and intense radiation sources, among others. To create HEDLP conditions, a field-reversed configuration (FRC) plasma of moderate density is first formed via reversed-field theta pinch. It is then translated into a cylindrical aluminum flux conserver (solid liner), where it is trapped between two magnetic mirrors and then compressed by the magnetically driven implosion of the solid liner. A requirement is that, once the FRC is stopped within the solid liner, the trapped flux inside the FRC must persist while the compression process is completed. With the present liner dimensions and implosion drive bank parameters, the total time required for implosion is ~25 &#956;s. Lifetime measurements of recent FRCHX FRCs indicate that trapped lifetimes following capture are now approaching ~14 &#956;s (and therefore, total lifetimes after formation are now approaching ~19 &#956;s). By separating the mirror and translation coil banks into two so that the mirror fields can be set lower initially, the liner compression can now be initiated 7-9 &#956;s before the FRC is formed. A discussion of FRC lifetime-limiting mechanisms and various experimental approaches to extending the FRC lifetime will be presented.

Two smectite samples having different layer charges were pillared using hydroxy aluminium oligomers at a OH/Al ratio of 2.5 and at pH 4.3 to 4.6. Pillaring was carried out at different conditions such as ageing, temperature and base addition time of the pillaring solution, and also in the presence of nonionic surfactant polyoxyethylene sorbitanmonooleate (Tween-80). The primary objective of preparing at different conditions was to introduce varied quantities of aluminium oligomer between the layers and to study its effect on the properties of the pillared products. A simple method has been followed to estimate the amount of interlayer aluminium. A quantity called pillar density number (PDN) based on the ratio of interlayer Al adsorbed to CEC of the parent clay has been effectively used to evaluate the nature of the resulting pillared product. PDN, for a given clay, was found to correlate well with the sharpness of the d(0001) peaks for the air dried samples. The calculated number of pillars, varied from 3.00 × 1018 to 5.32 × 1018 per meq charge. The present study shows that a higher value of PDN is indicative of better thermal stability. Pillar density number may be conveniently used as a measure of the thermal stability of pillared samples.

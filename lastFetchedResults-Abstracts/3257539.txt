Wave reflection is an important factor that influences pressure wave morphology and becomes more significant with aging, when cardiovascular risk increases. A pressure wave, measured at any location in the arterial tree, can be decomposed into its forward and backward components and depends on the corresponding amplitude and shifting time delays. Fractal dimension (FD) quantifies the time series complexity defined by its geometrical representation. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the arterial pressure and diameter time series in order to assess the relationship between wave reflection and arterial pressure fractal dimension (FD). Methods: Simultaneous aortic pressure and diameter were measured in 14 conscious dogs. A pair of ultrasonic crystals, a pressure microtransducer and a pneumatic cuff occluder were positioned in the upper third of the descending aorta. Results: Total reflection induced by the occlusion maneuver decreased FD concomitant to the aortic stiffening. Conclusion: Arterial pressure fractality is highly dependent on wave reflection.

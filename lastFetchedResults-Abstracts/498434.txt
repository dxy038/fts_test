Important role of high technology firms in economic and social development of countries, on the one hand, and importance of strategy formulation and its relation with internal factors of organization for survival of these firms in current competitive environment, on the other hand, specify the necessity of conducting a research in this field. According to above, main objective of this research is exploring correlations between formulation of strategic planning and internal factors of organization in Iranian high technology firms. So this article tries to specify the correlation and its extent between internal factors of organization (including staff, type of planning, market research and foundations of strategy formulation) and strategic planning in these firms.

The results elicited from questionaries show that formulation of strategic planning in Iranian high technology firms correlates with owning marketing human resources, existence of specified strategies and having market research about future customers. Also the results show although the managers of these firms believe that strategic planning is important, this approach hasn't caused to an action plan for doing this planning. This subject should be analyzed more narrowly in future studies.

Another result elicited from this study is that the managers who have employed personnel with marketing experience are more successful than others in formulating and doing strategic planning. Also it was revealed the firms owning strategic planning do not use the technologic improvement and market contingency simultaneously.

Finally it can be said that this kind of firms because of dependency on advanced technologies have more sensitivities for specifying strategic destinations and paths dominant on the other pillars of organization.

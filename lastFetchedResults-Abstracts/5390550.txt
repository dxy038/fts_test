This paper aims that analysing neural network method in pattern recognition. A neural network is a processing device, whose design was inspired by the design and functioning of human brain and their components. The proposed solutions focus on applying Bidirectional Associative Memory method model for pattern recognition. The primary function of which is to retrieve in a pattern stored in memory, when an incomplete or noisy version of that pattern is presented. An associative memory is a storehouse of associated patterns that are encoded in some form. In auto-association, an input pattern is associated with itself and the states of input and output units coincide. When the storehouse is incited with a given distorted or partial pattern, the associated pattern pair stored in its perfect form is recalled. Pattern recognition techniques are associated a symbolic identity with the image of the pattern. This problem of replication of patterns by machines (computers) involves the machine printed patterns. There is no idle memory containing data and programmed, but each neuron is programmed and continuously active.

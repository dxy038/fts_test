The authors describe a campaign of measurements which took place over a 2300 km path length and a 7 to 20 MHz frequency range. The main objective of the experimental program is to obtain information on the correlation between signal and background intensities in order to develop improved fading allowances for reliability and compatibility determination. A comprehensive study is being made of the amplitude probability distributions of both signal and noise intensities for both within-an-hour and day-to-day variations. The data are also being analysed for the purpose of developing improved above-the-MUF loss allowances for propagation predictions

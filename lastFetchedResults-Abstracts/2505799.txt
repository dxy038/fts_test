<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong><em>Neisseria meningitidis </em>is a leading cause of meningitis and sepsis worldwide. The factor H binding protein (fHBP) is a key virulence factor of <em>Neisseria meningitidis </em>that is able to selectively bind to human factor H, the key regulator of the alternative complement pathway, which it has important implications for meningococcal pathogene- sis and vaccine design. The aims of present research were cloning, expression, purification of fHbp and confirmation of the interaction between serum factor H (fH) and produced factor H binding protein.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>A 820 base pairs <em>fh</em>bp gene fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into expression vector pE- T28a (+) in <em>Bam HI </em>and <em>SalI </em>restriction enzymes sites. Recombinant DNA was expressed in BL21 (DE3) cell. fHBP protein was purified by Ni-NTA agarose resin. Coupling of recombinant protein into CNBr activated Sepharose 4B resin was carried out for application in serum fH protein purification. (fH-fHBP) interaction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and far-western blotting.<br /><strong>Results and Conclusions: </strong>SDS-PAGE results showed a 35 kDa protein band. 150 kDa fH protein was purified by designed Sepharose 4B resin. Far-western blotting confirmed (fH-fHBP) interaction and proper folding of factor H binding protein.</p>

In this paper, a new computer aided conceptual design method based on rhombus thought is proposed. It is designed to imitate human creativity activity. This method attempts to solve the bottleneck problem in intelligent CAD based on the extension theory. The divergence tree method and convergent thought method are described according to the rhombus thought model of products conceptual design. It has been successfully applied to the vacuum cleaner conceptual design. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrated the method is much more accurate, objective and efficient than the traditional one

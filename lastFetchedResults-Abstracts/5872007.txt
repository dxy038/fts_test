Summary form only given. Recently, a novel class of networks called neural-logic networks was proposed by the authorsÂ´ research group to integrate the logical reasoning capability with the concepts and techniques of the conventional neural network approach. The objective of this study is to extend the ideal of the neural-logic network model to incorporate the theory of probability. This model will be able to predict the probability that the matching pattern or the possible set of solutions are correct. This gives the user an indication of the degree of reliability of the conclusion.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Reliability evaluation of a complete electric power system including generation, transmission and distribution facilities is an important objective in overall power system planning and operation. Due to the enormity of the problem, reliability analysis is not usually conducted on a complete power system, and reliability evaluations of generating facilities, transmission systems and of distribution system segments are usually conducted independently. There are many benefits in developing the ability to perform overall system reliability evaluation. The most obvious is the allocation of utility resources to optimise the overall system operation. The paper considers the influence of component outages in all parts of an electric power system to obtain a comprehensive appraisal of the overall system adequacy. Different selection procedures for dropping customer loads in the event of energy deficiencies arising from outages in the composite generation and transmission system are included in the calculation of overall power system adequacy indices

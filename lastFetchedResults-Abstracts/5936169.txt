In the progress towards automatic cancer pre-screening, it is essential to achieve successful image segmentation prior to cancer pre-screening. A medical image segmenter system, which obtains local information from artificial life region labelling and global information using mathematical morphology is described. Also, we describe progress towards an automatic segmentation system that employs objective segmentation measures

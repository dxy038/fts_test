The E-field sensor for subnanosecond fast transient is designed and fabricated. The configuration and the principles are introduced firstly, and for the objective the asymptotic conical antenna and the passive integrator are adopted and optimized with the analytical and numerical method. The primary calibration indicates that the sensor can capture the pulse of o.9 ns rise-time, so it is believed that the performance can be improved further.

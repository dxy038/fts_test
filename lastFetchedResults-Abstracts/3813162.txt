An Er<sup>3+</sup>-doped fibre amplifier circuit is proposed for use at a terminal end of bidirectional optical transmission systems which use wavelengths in the 1.53 &#956;m and l.55 &#956;m bands. A subsidiary Er<sup>3+</sup>-doped fibre to compensate for the gain characteristic difference between these wavelengths allowed nonrepeated bidirectional transmission at 2.488 Gbit/s with a 49 dB power budget margin

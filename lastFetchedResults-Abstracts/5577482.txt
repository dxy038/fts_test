An improved classified image interpolation algorithm is presented. The algorithm obtains high-resolution pixels by filtering with parameters that are optimal for the selected class. By applying the highly flexible neural network model in the proposed algorithms, classified image data is extended into a nonlinear model in each class while enhancing the sharpness and edge characteristic. Meantime the interpolation performance is improved and computer complexity is reduced. Besides emulation, the technology has been applied to the visual presenter with low-resolution image sensor. Results demonstrate that the new algorithm improves substantially the subjective and objective quality of the interpolated images over original interpolation algorithms, and meets the requirements of real time image processing.

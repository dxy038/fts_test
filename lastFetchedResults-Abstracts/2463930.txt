Haze particles exert a significant influence over the thermodynamics and radiation absorption properties of the Titan haze, as well as its complex organic chemistry. Characterization of both the molecular and the submicrometer components of the haze is therefore vital for understanding the global properties of Titan. We have carried out a Titan tholin synthesis experiment and measured the time variation of the infrared spectrum of the product as a thin film developed. Also, to examine the possibility of oxygen contamination, we compared the infrared spectrum of the tholin film with that of a tholin film exposed to dry air and laboratory air. The objective of this study is to understand the chemical processes related to how simple organic molecules are processed into more complex haze particles. The progressive development of features characteristic of amines, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, and nitriles in the experimental mixture is clear. Of particular interest is the formation of aromatic rings after only a few seconds of glow discharge, indicating that these compounds appear to be intermediates between simple haze molecules and microphysical aerosols. The early dominance of aromatic ring structures is accompanied during the later stages of the experiment by the appearance of nitrile and amine compounds. This time-dependent succession of chemical structures provides vital clues to the possible chemical formation pathways of Titan haze aerosols.

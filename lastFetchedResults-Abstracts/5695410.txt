A decomposition for the underlying state space of a linear contractive distributed system is obtained. The objective is to find conditions for strong stability. The decomposition identifies the strongly stable subspace and provides a clear picture of the structure of the state space with regard to strong stability. Based on this decomposition, several conditions for strong stability of the semigroups related to contractive systems are obtained

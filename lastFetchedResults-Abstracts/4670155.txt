In Remote Objective Monitoring of Bio-Signals(ROMOBS) project, an automated near real-time remote health-monitoring device is being developed. The goal of this device is to measure blood flow parameters (systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, etc.), report the measurement results to a medical centre, and get the response back to the outpatient, all in an autonomous fashion. The objective of this paper is to develop a communication protocol that will enable the measurement device to be efficiently and constantly connected to a server the medical staff works on. Steps toward completing this goal include figuring out the network scheme that would effectively do the job, while maintaining low level of complexity and complying with the requirements set by the project. It results in a hybrid Bluetooth/cellular wireless system that emerges as the primary choice of connectivity medium with an application that sits on the Bluetooth- and Java-enabled cell phone as the data carrier. This paper discusses the development progress, the technologies involved, and the creation process of an interactive and user-friendly ROMOBS application.

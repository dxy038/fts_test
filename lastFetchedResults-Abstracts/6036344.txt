This paper deals with the control of a wastewater treatment pilot by catalytic ozonation. In general, catalytic ozonation processes operate with a deliberate ozone overproduction to obtain a treated water which respects the discharge standards. But, in this case, the oxygen consumption is not optimal and the operating costs are important. The objective of this study focuses on the optimization of the catalytic ozonation pilot. An optimal control is proposed to obtain a significant abatement of the pollutant. In this application, the pollutant abatement is represented by the absorbance.

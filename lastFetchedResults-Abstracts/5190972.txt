In order to meet the very high frequency requirements demanded by on-board DC/DC converters for future telecommunication systems, new rectification techniques for PWM topologies are deeply analyzed in this paper. The main objective is to improve the efficiency of the rectification stage and to keep the physical dimensions of the whole converter under established limits. Taking into account this criterion, different solutions are proposed and the most promising ones are physically implemented and measured. The result shows efficiency improvements between 5 and 7 points compared to the classical implementations

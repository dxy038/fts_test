Gram stain is a differential stain which distinguishes bacteria into 2 large groups; Gram-negative and Gram-positive. Similar to other staining methods, Gram stain is purposed to make the morphology and arrangement of cells more visible during investigation. Moreover, the differentiation ability of Gram stain makes it the most essential and valuable microbiological staining procedure available. However, the procedure of Gram stain involves waiting phases and takes reasonable time. The main objective of this research project is to design and construct a low-cost automatic apparatus to perform Gram staining. This work is significant while most hospitals in Indonesia are still performing Gram stain manually and thus, it is not time-, cost- and labor- efficient. Optimistically, the proposed automation device would increase laboratory efficiency while cutting the cost, as well as raising patients throughput and in turn, profit.

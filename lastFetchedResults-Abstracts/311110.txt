Objective. To determine the reliability and validity of a pelvic goniometer designed to measure the pelvic tilt and hip flexion during seated posture.

Background. Assessment of the seated posture requires measurement of the pelvis and hip. Determining accurate pelvic tilt and hip flexion angles during sitting is often difficult using standard techniques. A pelvic goniometer has been designed to measure pelvic tilt and hip flexion angle of persons in a seated posture.

Methods. Validation of the pelvic goniometer was done radiographically. Ten male volunteers sat in three postures––erect, forward or anterior tilt, and posterior tilt. Pelvic tilt and hip angle were recorded using radiographs and the pelvic goniometer. Reliability of pelvic and conventional goniometers was done using seated nondisabled subjects with physical therapists performing measurements.

Results. Validation: the average differences and correlation between the pelvic goniometer and radiographic measures were as follows––pelvic tilt: −4.9°, 0.93; hip angle 1.2°, 0.81. Reliability: average range of hip angle across three measures was about 3° for both goniometers.

Conclusions. The data indicate that the pelvic goniometer has utility in measuring pelvic tilt and hip angle, especially within the seated posture. Because it measures both pelvic tilt and hip angle, the pelvic goniometer has an advantage over conventional goniometers that only measure the latter.

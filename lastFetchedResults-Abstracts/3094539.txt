The increasing demand of networks, over the past decade has led to the need for enormous cost reduction and increasing accessibility of networks. It requires for efficient traffic management in the network and ability to expand as per the need. Various network design problem solutions are based on enumerative and heuristic approach have been defined in the literature. But as the networks expand to a larger extent, these solutions are unable to provide an optimized solution for a multicriteria objective function. A genetic algorithm (GA) based approach has proved to be quite efficient in such scenarios. In this work we have implemented GA on a small network problem consisting of six nodes. Results have been obtained and compared with other branch and bound techniques. It has been shown that this algorithm provides a greater computational efficiency as compared to other algorithms.

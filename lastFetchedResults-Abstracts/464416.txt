OBJECTIVE: We measured the concentrations of plasma P selectin (or GMP-140) and glycocalicin in preeclamptic and eclamptic women. Correlations between these two parameters and blood pressures, platelet counts, or plasma thrombin-antithrombin complex values were evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: By use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays we measured the plasma GMP-140 and glycocalicin levels in normal pregnancies (n = 10) and preeclamptic (n = 10) and eclamptic (n = 20) pregnancies. The glycocalicin index was calculated as follows: (glycocalicin × [250 × 106/ml])/(Individual platelet counts). Correlations between plasma GMP-140, glycocalicin, glycocalicin index values, blood pressures, platelet counts, and plasma thrombin-antithrombin complex values were analyzed. RESULTS: Plasma GMP-140 levels were found to be significantly elevated in preeclamptic (p< 0.0005) and eclamptic cases (p< 0.0001) compared with normotensive controls. Plasma glycocalicin (p = 0.01, 0.007) and glycocalicin index (p = 0.005, 0.002) values were also markedly elevated in preeclamptic and eclamptic patients compared with normal pregnant patients. Significant correlations between platelet counts or plasma thrombin-antithrombin complex levels and their corresponding plasma GMP-140 and glycocalicin and glycocalicin index values have been found in preeclamptic and eclamptic cases. However, blood pressures had correlations with GMP-140, glycocalicin, and glycocalicin index values in eclamptic cases. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated an elevation of plasma GMP-140 and platelet glycocalicin in preeclampsia and eclampsia. This study also reflects the usefulness of glycocalicin as a marker of platelet activation or turnover and endothelial dysfunction in these diseases. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:272-7.)

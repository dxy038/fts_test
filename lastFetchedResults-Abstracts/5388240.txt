KDD was applied to the knowledge mining of mechanical structure symmetry design, and a KDD process was established. The models and relational database tables of structure design knowledge and symmetric samples according with KDD technology were set up, and then the technologies of OLAP and associating analysis were applied to obtain bidirectional mapping relationship between structure symmetries and principles of structure design or rules of structure design, which can direct how the symmetry may be applied to mechanical structure design.

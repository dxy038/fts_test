ADHOCSYS is an IST FP6 STREP project, supported by the European Commission, under the IST strategic objective "broadband for all". The project aims at providing reliable Internet broadband access in rural and mountain regions. This paper, starting from a general description of ADHOCSYS networks, introduces a methodology for multi-hop wireless network reliability assessment. The methodology is then applied to several envisaged ADHOCSYS scenarios. Furthermore, numerical results on network availability prediction are presented and the tradeoffs on achievable availability and redundancy/costs are discussed.

In this paper we present the design of a mobile system for ethanol leak localization in the environment with wireless transmission to a computer. The system is composed of two operating modules: a communication module that transmits and receives information about the localization in a full-duplex wireless manner through a pair of transceivers, and a motion module that has an ultrasonic displacement sensor for detecting obstacles, an electronic compass to estimate the position of the mobile related to the north and a gas chemical sensor for detecting ethanol concentration. The information obtained by the system is transmitted wirelessly to a fixed receiver module with a transceiver. Through an USB interface connected to a computer to localization data is displayed by a Labview program. The objective is to analyze the sensors contribution to the localization of gas leak. Finally results of the characterizations of the sensors are shown so it can be said that we are ready to start to develop a localization algorithm for the mobile.

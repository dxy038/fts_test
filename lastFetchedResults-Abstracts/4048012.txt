In this paper, the design of the fixed-structure robust controllers satisfying multiple H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance criteria is formulated as a non-convex multidimensional constrained optimization problem. An effective differential evolution with level comparison (DELC) is proposed, which applies differential evolution for global searching and employs level comparison for constraint handling. The DELC is general and can be easily and directly applied to many kinds of reduced-order/fixed-structure controller synthesis problems without any conservative assumption about the objective function. Numerical simulations are carried out based on some typical problems, and the comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed DELC algorithm.

This paper presents a method of emulating electrical loads using power electronic converters. The loads include machines such as induction motors and their associated mechanical load and also more complex machine systems such as wind-driven generators. The load emulator is, effectively, a dynamically controllable source or sink which is capable of bidirectional power exchange with either a grid or another power electronic converter system. Using load emulation, the feasibility of connecting a particular machine to a grid under various load conditions can be examined without the need for any electromechanical machinery. This paper considers the case of a power electronic voltage source inverter (VSI) emulating a three-phase induction motor connected to a three-phase ac grid. The VSI is operated in a mode where the current drawn from the ac grid is controlled by closed-loop control. The consistency of the experimental results with the simulation results proves the ability of the emulator and the proposed testing approach.

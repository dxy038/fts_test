The objective of this paper is to introduce a fourth-order cost
function of the displaced frame difference (DFD) capable of estimating
motion even for small regions or blocks. Using higher than second-order
statistics is appropriate in case the image sequence is severely corrupted
by additive Gaussian noise. Some results are presented and compared to
those obtained from the mean kurtosis and the mean square error of the
DFD.

Objective
ess the effect of a fluoride varnish and gel on the erosive wear of primary and permanent teeth.

human primary (n = 30) and permanent (n = 30) enamel specimens were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: APF gel (1.23% F), NaF varnish (2.26% F), and control (no treatment). Fluoride gel was applied for 4 min and fluoride varnish for 24 h. Six daily demineralisation–remineralization cycles of 5 min of immersion in a cola drink (pH 2.3) and 30 min in artificial saliva were conducted during 7 days. All specimens were stored in artificial saliva between and after cycles. Surface Knoop microhardness (%SMHC) readings were performed at baseline, 48 h and 7 days. Data were tested using ANOVA and Tukey's tests (p &lt; 0.05).
s
imary enamel, the mean %SMHC (±SD) after 48 h and 7 days was, respectively: gel (31.0 ± 14.4 and 36.9 ± 7.5), varnish (26.7 ± 9.5 and 38.3 ± 8.7), and control (35.8 ± 8.6 and 45.0 ± 8.6). For permanent enamel, such values were: gel (37.5 ± 7.7 and 27.8 ± 7.5), varnish (31.7 ± 9.6 and 27.4 ± 11.1) and control (48.6 ± 6.4 and 43.1 ± 6.4). In primary enamel, erosion inhibition by fluoride was not significant at 48 h (p = 0.203) and 7 days (p = 0.082). In permanent specimens, both products showed a significant effect (p &lt; 0.001).
sions
luoride varnish and gel were able to inhibit erosive enamel loss but mainly in the permanent experimental groups. Primary and permanent enamel substrates reacted differently to both demineralization by a cola drink and remineralization by fluoridated compounds.

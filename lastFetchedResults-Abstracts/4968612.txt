In order to effectively maintain voltage level and improve voltage stability of power system, it is significantly critical to take both distribution network and loads into consideration to determine reasonable reactive compensation capacity for distribution network. But relatively little research has addressed this power system aspect of the reactive compensation capacity. The objective of this research is to investigate reactive compensation capacity for distribution network within power system framework that considers both distribution network and loads. All such important factors as short circuit capacity (SCC) and impedance of distribution network, load components and load power factor are taken into consideration in this research. The widely applied synthesis load model with distribution network in State Grid of China is introduced in this research to achieve the objective. By simulating and analyzing the effects taken by all the factors on reactive compensation capacity, this research finally proposes several guiding principles for choosing reasonable reactive compensation capacity suitable for power system. The chosen compensation capacity considered with the proposed principles is significantly effective to maintain voltage level and improve voltage stability of power system.

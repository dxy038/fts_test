In a previous publication [M.E. Huerta Garrido, M.D. Pritzker, J. Electroanal. Chem. 594 (2006) 118], we developed a comprehensive model for the analysis of copper electrodeposition from acidic sulphate solutions by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This model was then fit to EIS and steady state current–potential measurements and a statistical analysis of the results carried out. In a subsequent publication [A. Lasia, J. Electroanal. Chem. 605 (2007) 77], Lasia presented some criticisms of our analysis of the system and the experimental data and suggested some corrections that could be made. The objective of the current communication is to respond to Lasia’s comments on our model and parameter-fitting procedure in this previous paper [M.E. Huerta Garrido et al., 2006].

One of the basic questions about ethical propositions is: do ethical propositions represent an objective reality and reveal the existence of real relationship or do they have no real source and they, irrespective of order and recommendation, feeling and taste, agreement and contract, do not talk of reality? Realists believe in the real source of moral principles but non-realists reject the existence of such a source. One of the results obtained from this debate is that realists adopt absolutism of moral principles and non-realists advocate relativism in ethics. This research shows through an analysis-descriptive method that because Allameh Tabatabaei believes in the real source of moral principles, he is considered as a realist philosopher and a moral absolutist.

This paper presents a new objective visual fatigue measurement system by using one remote camera. In captured image, eye and pupil regions are sequentially detected using some image processing methods. Based on the pupil region, pupil size, pupil accommodation speed, blink frequency, and eye closed duration can be determined. Because more frequent blinks and slower pupil accommodation indicate an increased level of visual fatigue, our system can objectively measure visual fatigue. Also, since there is no need to wear any device, inconvenience may be minimized. Experimental results showed the blink detection accuracy was 98.9% and pupil localization error was 1.9%.

Coconut milk is an emulsion which is stabilized by naturally occurring proteins. The main objective of the present work is to explore different methods employing thermal, pH, chilling, enzyme treatments and combination of enzyme treatments followed by chilling and thawing for effective destabilization of the coconut milk emulsion. Stability of emulsion is evaluated by measuring the creaming index and observed for the changes in structure of oil droplets, using phase contrast microscope. Combination of treatments (enzyme treatment at 37 Â°C followed by chilling and thawing) of coconut milk emulsion has resulted in highest yield of 94.5%. Physico-chemical properties and fatty acid compositions are evaluated for coconut oil obtained by combination of treatments and compared with that of commercial coconut oil. It is found that the oil obtained by combination of treatments is low with respect to free fatty acids and peroxide value and high in lauric acid content.

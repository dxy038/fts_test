Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and causa factors of UTI in school-age girls in one of Tehran's suburbs.
Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study all girl students (1216 cases) in an age range of 6-11 years (mean 8.51Â±1.24) were enrolled. Urine samples were collected and assessed through screening methods using a tape test. From all examines, nitrite-positive cases were sent to a laboratory for culture. Laboratory results indicated 14 cases with over 100000 I ml colony count who were advised to receive treatment. Also, to examine the cause factors, the case control students were compared by use of questionnaires.
Results: Statical analyses demonstrate that UTI prevalence was 1.15% which is consistent with previous reports that indicate a 0.9-3 6% prevalence of UTI in among elementary school girls. Also the results showed that cause factors in UTI included improper washing methods after defecation, low daily water consumption, lack of underwear washing, history of dysuria, frequency and flank pain.
Conclusion: Considering the incidence of asymptomatic UTI in children specially school-age girls, and its probable complications, screening with the dipstick method, proper diagnosing and suitable treatment protocols are needed. Also a train student to prevent the UTI is necessary.

The objective of this paper is to numerically predict the modal behaviours of a two-plate steel structure defined with variable parameters and to validate this prediction experimentally. First, the test structure, in which geometrical and material variability has been identified, is studied using a Fuzzy Finite Element Method. This method, named PAEM, allows the fuzzy numerical eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors to be calculated. Second, the test structure is analyzed experimentally to quantify the possible variation of the eigensolutionsâ€™ modal behaviours and to build the experimental fuzzy sets. Finally, the fuzzy numerical quantities are compared with the experimental quantities to highlight the efficiency of our non-deterministic model for predicting the behavioural modifications of the test structure.

A survey was conducted to seek users&#8217; feedback mapping suitable human senses to various types of musical instruments, and ranking the senses according to their importance. Results suggested that touch sensation is considered the most important modality when playing musical instruments. The paper concludes with a discussion on the need to use suitable multi-sensory modalities when designing systems for music learning.

Objective: This study was undertaken to determine physician use of simple office-based tests in the evaluation of women with vulvovaginal symptoms. Study Design: A medical record review of 52 women seeking care at a referral-based vaginitis clinic was performed. The evaluation performed and the care management were recorded for 150 previous physician-provided office visits. Results: A microscopic assessment of vaginal fluid was not performed in 37% of office visits, and 42% of physicians did not perform microscopy as part of any evaluation of vaginitis. Whiff amine tests and measurement of vaginal pH were rarely performed (3% of office visits). Treatment without adequate evaluation of the etiology of the symptoms occurred in 54% of visits in which medication was prescribed. Conclusions: In our study population the evaluation and care provided to women presenting for evaluation of vulvovaginal symptoms were suboptimal. The use of simple inexpensive office-based tests can optimize the assessment of vaginal infections and should be encouraged. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:39-41.)

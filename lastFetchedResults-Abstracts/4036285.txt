The authors contrast two control strategies for direct AC-AC matrix power converters: the Venturini method; and the space vector modulation (SVM) method. Comparison of the relative performances is made with regard to operation under unbalanced/distorted supply voltage, output voltage and input current harmonics and power converter losses. Measured results are given using a power converter for which each bidirectional switch consists of two IGBTs and two diodes in a common collector configuration. The SVM method uses a simpler method to control the input power factor and involves lower switching losses. The Venturini method can compensate input voltage unbalance and/or distortion and gives slightly superior performance in terms of input current and output voltage harmonics

In this paper, a novel loading algorithm consisting of four variants is proposed for a multicarrier transceiver employing multiple antennas configured for spatial diversity. The primary objective of the proposed algorithm is to increase the overall throughput while ensuring the mean bit error rate (BER) is below a specified limit. To achieve this, spatial diversity is employed to improve the subcarrier signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. Simultaneously, (uniform or non-uniform) bit allocation, which is a function of subcarrier SNR, is performed to increase throughput. To reduce power consumption, spatial processing complexity, and hardware costs, antenna subset selection is also performed by the proposed algorithm to choose a set of active transmit/receive antennas. The results show that combining bit allocation with spatial diversity (employing antenna subset selection) can yield substantial throughput increases.

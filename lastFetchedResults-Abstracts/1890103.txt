Background and Objective: Ovarian tumors are among the most frequent pathologic conditions
in gynecologic practice and a frequent cause of hospitalization and surgery. The aim of this study
was to determine histologic distribution of benign operated masses especially functional ovarian
cysts.
Material and Methods: Benign ovarian files of operated patients (2961 cases) in 20 tertiary and
secondary hospitals were reviewed regarding age and histopathology from 1998- 2005. Analysis was
done by SPSS software (version 13).
Results: The most common benign histologies in order of frequency were functional cyst (57%),
serous cystadenoma (13%), dermoid cyst (10%), mucinous cystadenoma (7%) and endometrioma
(6%).
Conclusion: Functional cysts were the most common benign ovarian cyst. Nearly high distribution
of functional cysts in the present study may be an index of need to management improvement and
less surgical decisions in ovarian tumors.

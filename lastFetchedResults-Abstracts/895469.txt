Background: The efficacy of second line chemotherapy for relapsed non small cell lung cancer has been established. In this
study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of maintenance therapy with docetaxel in patients with non-small cell lung
cancer who were stabilized with first line chemotherapy and had good performance status before relapse. The primary
objective was to determine one-year survival and the other objectives were evaluation of adverse effects and time to
progression.
Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients with lung cancer were included in this study. All patients were at stage III and IV,
without distant metastasis or neuropathy. All patients had been treated with platinum based regimen initially and were
responsive or stable with no progression. The patients were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 for a total of 4 cycles repeated
every 3 weeks.
Results: All patients accomplished 4 chemotherapy cycles and a total of 72 cycles were administered. The mean time of
progression free survival (PFS) was 9-10 months and one- year survival (OS) was 94.4% without any significant adverse
effect necessitating medical intervention. The mean survival time of patients was 18 (12-20) months.
Conclusion: Using docetaxel as consolidation chemotherapy in patients with non small cell lung cancer can prolong time to
progression of disease and probably patients' survival without significant adverse effects or negative impact on the quality of
life.

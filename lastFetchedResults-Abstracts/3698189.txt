The objective of this paper is to review the GAMMA &#947; systems which have been implemented at the Graniteville Company. The paper discusses the basic rationale for in-house development of manufacturing systems for the textile industry. The justification process, associated selection criteria for vendor-supplied products, and general system implementation are reviewed. Specific benefits derived from the development of such systems are enumerated in an effort to explain why it may be advantageous for textile companies to develop customized manufacturing systems using existing technical resources. A case study is discussed detailing how such an automation effort can be initiated and enhanced over time to provide real-time production information which is beneficial to a textile company at all levels of management

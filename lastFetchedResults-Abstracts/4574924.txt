Intense geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) can hamper rail traffic by disturbing signaling and train control systems. Objective of this report is to study possible influence of geomagnetic conditions on mid-latitude railway and to perform a statistical study in addition to previous case studies. In this work we analyze 3916 false operations (anomalies) of automatic signaling and train control equipment, occurred in 2004 on the mid-latitude East Siberian Railway (latitudes: 51-56 N; longitudes: 96-114 E). Our results revealed links between geomagnetic disturbances and anomalies in the operation of railway automatics and telemetry.

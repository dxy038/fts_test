We describe the preparation of CoNiMnP-based permanent-magnet material using several sulfate and chloride solutions. We studied eight samples, and all the samples show vertical magnetic anisotropy. Sample8, which was electroplated from a low-concentration chloride solution and under external magnetic field, demonstrates the best magnetic properties with coercivity 2632 Oe, remanence 0.20 T, and maximum magnetic energy 10.185 kJ/m<sup>3</sup>. An array structure can avoid the stress between the electroplated layer and the seed layer. The electroplated Co<sub>0.8</sub>Ni<sub>0.1174</sub>Mn<sub>0.0062</sub>P<sub>0.0762</sub> permanent magnet has potential for bidirectional actuators in micro-electromechanical systems.

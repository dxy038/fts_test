Background and Objective: Balance is defined as the process that maintains the center of gravity within the bodyâ€™s base of support and requires constant adjustments that are provided by muscular activity and joint positioning. The aim of the present study was to determine the best clinical measuring tools of balance in comparison to laboratory tools. 
Subjects and Methods:  In a cross-sectional study, 60 persons (one half in 20-40 and the other in 60-75 year old group) with the ability of standing and walking at least 7 meters and without any chronic diseases were evaluated by Biodex system, Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach Test, Timed Up & Go Test and Lunge Test.
Results: Data analysis was indicative of significant and high correlation between Functional Reach and Biodex System in 20-40 year  old group and between Berg balances Scale and Biodex System in 60-75 years old group (P < 0.001). Also, there was a significant relation between increase in age and decrease in balance capability (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: According to our results, the best clinical measuring tool that could replace the expensive aboratory tools of balance assessment is Functional Reach in young people and Berg Balance Scale for old people.

Objective: Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) has been shown to have a neuroprotective
effect after transplanted in brain and spinal cord injury (SCI). This study was conducted
to determine the possible beneficial results of transplantation of fetal olfactory
mucosa (FOM) that was the source of OECs in the recovery of locomotor function and
in spinal tissue sparing after spinal cord hemisection.
Materials and Methods: Forty-eight adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were spinally
hemisected at the L1 level and were randomized into the three groups of 16 animals.
The first group, immunosuppressed injured animals were received cyclosporine A (CsA)
and FOM graft. The second group was received CsA and fetal respiratory mucosa
(FRM) graft, and the control group; non-immunosuppressed rats were received saline
and gel foam. Locomotor performance was assessed weekly for 8 weeks after lesion,
using locomotive rating scale developed by Basso, Bresnahan and Beattie (BBB). After
behavioral assessment, the spinal cord was examined by a histologist for spinal tissue
sparing.
Results: From weeks 6-8, the functional recovery of the FOM rats significantly increased
in comparison to the FRM, although a significant difference in tissue sparing was not apparent.
From weeks, 2-8 the functional recovery of the FOM and FRM groups as well as
tissue sparing of the FOM group increased significantly compared to the control group.
Conclusion: Thus, the FOM treatment may be effective to promote functional recovery
and partially preserving tissue sparing.

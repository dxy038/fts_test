A dynamic frequency reuse method applicable to uncoordinated and (possibly) dense wireless networks is presented in this paper. The main objective is to protect mobile users located near the cell boundary from detrimental downlink interference originating from neighboring base stations (BSs) without compromising the system spectral efficiency. For this purpose, based on our previous work, a novel dynamic resource assignment method called extended graph based dynamic frequency reuse (eGB-DFR) is developed. The proposed method is designed such that the interference protection does not coincide with an intolerable and unnecessary reduction in the attainable spatial reuse of radio resources. This is achieved by smart defining of two classes of resources depending on their foreseen usage by a BS and assigning them according to the interference environment. The effectiveness of our proposal is corroborated via system-level simulations which reveal that cell-edge capacities are significantly boosted without a sharp decrease in average system throughput.

The atmospheric impacting on optical remote sensing is an important factor causing the visional quality of remote sensing to descend. Scholars try to propose different atmospheric correction models, but these models are either extremely apt to cause great mistakes because of their own assumptions or impracticable because of too many parameters which are relatively difficult to get. After fully considering bidirectional reflection is the basic macroscopical phenomenon taking place on the surface object in nature and the polarized character of light, this paper proposes the new way and method of atmospheric correction depending on the polarized characteristic of light. The basic theory is that when the natural light irradiates to the interface with Brewster angle, the directions of the electric field vector in the reflected beam of light are completely vertical to the incidence interface. And after proving the feasibility of the theory, we propose some imaginations to actually apply this method. The result shows that the correction will not bring heavier burden to the computer and greatly facilitate the users to use the remote sensing images.

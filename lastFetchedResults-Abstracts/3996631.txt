Estimation of joint torque is an important objective in the analyses of human motion. In particular, many applications seek to discern torque during a desired human motion, which is equivalent to solving the inverse dynamics. The computed torque method is a conventional means of calculating inverse dynamics. The obtained torque, however, invariably includes errors resulting from inexact inertial and viscoelastic parameters. This paper presents a method for solving the inverse dynamics of a human arm passively during tracking. To achieve precise human motion tracking, iterative learning control is used for motion generation. Some experiments that target a human arm are executed to validate the proposed method.

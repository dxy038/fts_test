This paper focuses on the synthesis of nonlinear adaptive robust controller with saturated actuator authority for a linear motor drive system, which is subject to parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities such as input disturbances as well. Global stability with limited control efforts is achieved by breaking down the overall uncertainties to state-linearly-dependent uncertainties (such as viscous friction) and bounded nonlinearities (such as Coulomb friction, cogging force, etc.), and dealing with them via different strategies. Furthermore, a guaranteed transient performance and final tracking accuracy can be obtained by incorporating the well-developed adaptive robust control strategy and effective parameter identifier. Asymptotic output tracking is also achieved in the presence of parametric uncertainties only. Meanwhile, in contrast to the existing saturated control structures that are designed based on a set of transformed coordinates, the proposed saturated controller is carried out in the actual system states, which have clear physical meanings. This makes it much easier and less conservative to select the design parameters to meet the dual objective of achieving global stability with limited control efforts for rare emergency cases and the local high-bandwidth control for high performance under normal running conditions. Real-time experimental results are obtained to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed saturated adaptive robust control strategy

Studying against the lower utilization of the resources, deficiency of recombination in current networks, this paper proposes Network cognition and its basic architecture to improve the service abilities. Based on data mining and intelligence information control, the key technologies such as situation awareness, learning strategies, and multi-objective optimization are mainly discussed in details, which aim at networks states, usersÂ´ characters, and electromagnetism environment. On the base of this, the related research works and performance testing of the nodes in network are also presented.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the tubule occluding ability of three commercial available dentifrices (Sensodyne, Emoform and Sorriso) by Scanning Electron Microscopy.

Methods: Fifty cervical areas from buccal and lingual surfaces of sound third human molars were used. Cervical enamel was wet abraded to expose flat dentin surfaces and further polished with diamond pastes. Specimens were randomly divided into five groups (n=10): G1—no brushing; G2—brushing without dentifrice; G3—brushing with Sensodyne; G4—brushing with Emoform; G5—brushing with Sorriso. Brushed specimens were treated for 4 min per day, for 7 days in a toothbrushing machine. Specimens were prepared and observed under SEM for calculation of the percentage of occluded tubules. In addition, slurries of toothpastes were analyzed by X-ray microanalysis. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey test (p<0.05).

Results: Means of occluded tubules in descending order were: G5—98.83±3.31% (a), G4—96.02±5.24% (a), G3—80.12±24.65% (a), G1—37.31±24.22% (b); G2—22.92±15.19% (b). The three tested dentifrices produced increased dentinal occlusion as compared to controls (p<0.05) but equivalent occlusion among each other. Calcium from calcium-carbonate abrasive was identified in all dentifrices.

Conclusions: Results indicated that the use of all dentifrices occluded tubules more than no brushing and brushing without dentifrices groups. Thus, the tested dentifrices seem effective for desensitization by tubule occlusion.

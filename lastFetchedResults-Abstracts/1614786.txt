Background and Aim: Malaria threatens more than half of the world's population in about 100 countries. During the period 1921-1951 malaria was one of the most important public health issues in Iran, no other disease causing as much financial loss and mortality as malaria did. The objective of this study was to investigate malaria epidemiology in Iran during the period 1940- 2006 (65 years), in the hope that the infotmation and experience will be used in the future.
Materials and Methods: This study included a review of the available literature on the suject, as well as a study of health systems, existing records, and analysis of data and information on malaria in Iran. Data were colected from three main sources: national or international electronic sources (26 sources); non-electronic sources, including theses, journal articles, and various documents and reports, as well as data obtained from the national malaria surveillance system (a total of 180); and interviews with five informed and expert individuals. In addition, national documents prepared by the Center for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Medical Education, during the previuos 6 months were made available to, and used by, the research team.
Results: The findings show that, despite several annual fluctuations, the trend of incidence of the disease during the 65-year period, from 1940 to 2006, was a downward trend. The incidence declined from 250-333 per 1000 people in the early 1940's to 0.22 per 1000 people in 2006.
Conclusion: The changes in incidence of malaria show that elimination of malaria is a possible and feasible goal. The experiences achieved in controlling this disease can be utilized for controlling other diseases as well.

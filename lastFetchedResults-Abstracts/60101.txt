Recently, a novel structure called the simplicial cellular neural network (CNN) has been introduced , which permits one to implement any Boolean/Gray-level function of any number of variables. This paper is devoted to explore novel circuit architectures for the implementation of the simplicial CNN based on resonant tunneling diodes. The final objective is to implement a fully programmable CNN in a hardware platform based on nanoelectronic devices.

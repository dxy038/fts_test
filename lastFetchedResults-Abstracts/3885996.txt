3D video quality of experience (QoE) is a multidimensional problem; many factors contribute to the global rating like image quality, depth perception and visual discomfort. Due to this multidimensionality, it is proposed in this paper, that as a complement to assessing the quality degradation due to coding or transmission, the appropriateness of the non-distorted signal should be addressed. One important factor here is the depth information provided by the source sequences. From an application-perspective, the depth-characteristics of source content are of relevance for pre-validating whether the content is suitable for 3D video services. In addition, assessing the interplay between binocular and monocular depth features and depth perception are relevant topics for 3D video perception research. To achieve the evaluation of the suitability of 3D content, this paper describes both a subjective experiment and a new objective indicator to evaluate depth as one of the added values of 3D video.

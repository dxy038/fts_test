There are two essential foci in this study. First, to attempt to determine land use differences, if any, between households in Nigeria, based on their level of urinary schistosomiasis. Second, to ascertain if land use has any effect on schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity in the study area. The objective is to encourage participatory urinary schistosomiasis control in the endemic tropical areas of the world. Research is based on 315 household surveys (201 low- and 114 heavy-urinary schistosomiasis). Descriptive statistics indicate significant mean differences in land use and land use determinants between the two sample categories. A discriminant function strongly discriminates between the two sample groups while multiple regression analysis establishes a causal relationship for land use and land use determinants. The policy implication of the study is disease control through a participatory approach as the disease victims attempt to deal with the negative impact of the disease.

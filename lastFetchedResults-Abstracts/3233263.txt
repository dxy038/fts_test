The main objective of this work is to study the control allocation technique. The context of this technique and the applications made in this framework are presented. An overview of this technique is highlighted and a mathematical formulation is given to show the advantages of the control allocation technique compared to conventional control method of over-actuated systems. An application of this technique was used in a closed-loop system in the case of an electric vehicle in order to control the stability of the yaw rate and to minimize the side slip angle during a turn.

A new method of multi-FACTS components coordinated control based on fuzzy immune co-evolutionary algorithm is proposed, which aimed at the negative interaction of FACTS controllers. The fuzzy mathematics model of the multi-objective optimization is provided using fuzzy set theory. The initial parameter is optimized with the use of co-evolutionary algorithm and immune algorithm. Compared with conventional genetic algorithm, this algorithm obviously reduces the computational time and has better convergence property. Two FACTS controllers - static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) and static synchronous compensator(STATCOM) is coordinated designed based on this strategy. The simulation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

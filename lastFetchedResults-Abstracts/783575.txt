Background The 1994 mental health
policy in Kenya was rooted in the concepts of Primary
Health Care articulated at Alma Ata, and required that
mental health care be decentralized to all levels of the
health care system, and delivered by all cadres of
health staff rather than just mental health specialists.
However, effective implementation of this policy was
likely to be influenced by the degree to which the
training, attitudes and practice of health staff was
consistent with and supportive of the mental health
policy. Objective This article therefore reports a study
conducted in 1997, which examined the training,
attitudes and practice of district level health staff in
relation to mental health care and compared them
with the national mental health policy of 1994.
Method A semi-structured questionnaire was sent to
the medical superintendents of all district hospitals in
Kenya, for distribution to respondents from each
cadre of health staff. A total of 148 health workers
from 28 districts out of 44 eligible districts (63%)
responded. Results District health workers did not
think general health workers ought to manage most
psychiatric patients, even if they were capable of
doing so, preferring a system where these patients
were managed by specialists and were not admitted
into general wards. They also tended to equate mental
illness with psychosis. Conclusion Despite their
training in mental health care and their theoretical
knowledge of the principles of Primary Health Care,
the attitude and mental health care practice of most
health workers were in keeping with a more medical
model of health care, emphasising pharmacological
treatment and expecting psychiatric patients to conform
to the standard Sick Role. This orientation,
being at variance with the orientation of the 1994
mental health policy, may have contributed to difficulties
in implementation of the policy.

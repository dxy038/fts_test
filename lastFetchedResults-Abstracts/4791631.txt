The concept ´ecotourism´ appeared in recent decades. The first formal definition of ecotourrism is credited by Ceballos-Lascurain in 1987, who define ecotourism as ´traveling to relatively undisturbed or uncontaminated natural areas with the specific objective of studying, admiring, and enjoying the scenery and its wild plants and animals, as well as any existing cultural manifestations (both past and present) found in these areas´. After that, many different researchers or organizations carry out a series of researches on this concept and its practice. This paper reviews the development of the theory and practice of ecotourism. After that, the author discusses the Chinese ecotourism thinking and recent development.

In the past 10 years, childhood has become a focal point of concern. Children are viewed as symbolizing an investment in the future of societies around the world. In the past, knowledge about children's views was realized through objective measures or from representative accounts by adults (e.g., parents and teachers) who were thought to know the child best. Current research suggests that most adult representations and interpretations are only attempts to describe something that more or less represents the child's world. The literature suggests that in the past, children have been perceived mainly as objects rather than subjects of research interest. This perhaps reflects the viewpoint held by many that children are unable to comprehend and describe their world and life experiences because of developmental immaturity and/or that there are intrinsic difficulties in researching children. The purpose of this article is to describe how a child's developmental level affects the research process. Specifically discussed are developmental differences in responses to research including psychosocial research methods, assent, and consent with children. Copyright Â© 2000 by W.B. Saunders Company

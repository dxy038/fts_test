We experimentally investigated the 1.25 Gb/s operation of a spectrally sliced amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) injected reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) with 50 GHz channel spacing using an injection current adjustment, dispersion management, and the use of an optical receiver with an optimized decision threshold level. We mitigated the relative intensity noise (RIN) degradation caused by post-filtering through the injection current adjustment, and also alleviated the dispersion-induced RIN degradation with the help of the dispersion management method. Finally, the use of an optical receiver with an optimized decision threshold level eliminated error floors, which were attributed to an unequal noise distribution between the mark level and the space level. We also successfully demonstrated a loop-back wavelength division multiplexing-passive optical network (WDM-PON) with a 100 Gb/s (80 &#215; 1.25 Gb/s) capacity using a spectrally sliced ASE injected RSOA by means of the three aforementioned methods. We also analyzed and examined the transmission impairments, such as the dispersion penalty and back-reflection induced penalty, in a 1.25 Gb/s bidirectional WDM-PON based on an RSOA with 50 GHz channel spacing.

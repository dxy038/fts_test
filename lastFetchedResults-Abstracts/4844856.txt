Historically, a large number of small and cheaper sensors are deployed to form a sensor network. This paper provides rationale behind using an aggregate logical sensor unit (ALSU) as a building block in a Wireless Sensory Information network (WSIN). In this architecture, a single ALSU is composed of many off-the-shelf sensor nodes in the manner similar to the Beowulf cluster concept. The highly capable, cost effective and flexible ALSUs built in this manner from several smaller physical sensor nodes, would enable high computation power and built-in reliability for sensor applications. The objective of this paper is to provide an alternative where energy and computation is not a limiting factor in order to achieve the operational objectives of WSIN applications. This paper highlights critical issues that need to be addressed in developing a framework where each ALSU could have the capability to perform required operations as dictated by an underlying application

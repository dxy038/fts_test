The article introduces how the program soft had been done about the optimized calculation of the transformer´s electromagnetic based on the genetic algorithm, the MATLAB is used in program. The comprehensive efficiency will be the objective function in the optimized program, according to the real fact of constraint, the processing of weighted will do about the objective function; Variables are divided into uniform and non-uniform design variables, Genes for binary (Grey)has encoded, Adaptive strategy has accepted in the operation of the selection and mutation, the search will be done in the breadth and depth domain in the evolution, finally receive the best solution. The MATLAB is used as the developing tool, take advantage in the function of the MATLAB´s data processing, it simplified the program code. In the article the real transformer data has been calculated according the optimized calculation, the result of calculation compare with the real data, the comprehensive efficiency decrease very clearly, so this optimized calculation is useful in the design of transformer.

Objective (s): Women with epilepsy are at high risk of sexual dysfunction, which has a multifactorial etiology. The present study aimed to assess sexual function in women with epilepsy.
Methods: This was cross sectional study. A sample of 100 women with epilepsy referred to selected centers from Tehran and Iran universities of medical sciences were entered the study. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to collect data. The Data were analyzed by t-test and ANOVA.
Results: The mean sexual function score of women with epilepsy was 23.33Â±2.82. A statistically significant difference between the mean scores of sexual function domains and type of epilepsy, type and number of antiepileptic drugs were observed, while between the overall mean scores of sexual function and type of epilepsy (P=0.14), duration of disease (P=0.59), the frequency of seizure (P=0.90), type of antiepileptic drugs (P=0.92) and the number of used antiepileptic drug (P=0.60), we did not find a statistically significant difference.
Conclusion: The findings showed that sexual function of women with epilepsy was relatively good.

Presented is a multi-objective evolutionary network coding algorithm which jointly handles the coding cost and link cost while achieving the target multicast rate in network coding. To this end, a generalised multi-objective fitness function is formulated first. A modified non-dominated sorting scheme is then developed to account for the unequal importance of the two objectives. Lastly, a diversity-preserving crowding method is devised to maintain the diversity of solutions in both the objective and decision spaces. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

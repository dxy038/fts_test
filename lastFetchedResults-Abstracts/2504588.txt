Background: The reproductive system is one of the organs that are affected by lead. Lead can cause loss of libido and fertility in men, and menstrual disturbances and spontaneous abortion in woman.
Objective: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was assessment of dose-response relationship between blood lead level (BLL) and sex hormones levels in lead exposed male workers.
Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirteen male workers enrolled. All workers had at least 6 months of lead exposure and no history of diseases or conditions affecting reproductive system. Blood lead level and hormones levels measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometer and radioimmunoassay method, respectively. 
Results: Average duration of exposure was 15.92±6.95 years. Mean BLL was 41.41µg/dl±16.99. All of the sex hormones values were in normal range. Pearson correlation showed that sex hormones levels had no significant correlation with blood lead level. Also, there was no significant difference in sex hormones levels between workers with BLL  < 40µg/dl and workers whose BLL was  > 40 µg/dl.
Conclusion: This study showed that BLL cannot serve as a predictor of male sex hormonal changes. However, it is not possible to rule out the effect of lead on the reproductive system after long-term exposure.

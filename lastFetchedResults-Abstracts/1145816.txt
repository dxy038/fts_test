This paper addresses the problem of speech intelligibility enhancement by adaptive filtering algorithms employed with subband techniques. The two structures named the forward and backward blind source separation structures are extensively used in the speech enhancement and source separation areas, and largely studied in the literature with convolutive and non-convolutive mixtures. These two structures use two-microphones to generate the convolutive/non-convolutive mixing signal, and provide at the outputs the target and the jammer signal components. In this paper, we focus our interest on the backward structure employed to enhance the speech signal from a convolutive mixture. Furthermore, we propose a subband implementation of this structure to improve its behavior with speech signal. The new proposed subband-Backward BSS (SBBSS) structure allows a very important improvement of the convergence speed of the adaptive filtering algorithms when the subband-number is selected high. In order to improve the robustness of the proposed subband structure, we have adapted then applied a new criterion that combines the System Mismatch and the Mean-Errors criterion minimization. The proposed subband backward structure, when it is combined with this new criterion minimization, allows to enhance the output speech signal by reducing the distortion and the noise components. The performance of the proposed subband backward structure is validated through several objective criteria which are given and described in this paper.

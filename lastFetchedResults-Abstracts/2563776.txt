The most significant impacts on contributing variables which empower employees were as follows: having the time and “freedom of action”(r=0/74 , P < 0.5), “Use skill & talent” (r=0/71 , P < 0.5), “The importance to the opinions of employees in organization”(r=0/70 , P < 0.5), “The importance of teamwork” (r=0/60 , P < 0.5), “Participation in the decision of leaders associated with the task”(r=0/50 , P < 0.5).

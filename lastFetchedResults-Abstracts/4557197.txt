A semi-analytical modulation scheme to operate a single-phase, single-stage dual active bridge (DAB) AC-DC converter under full-operating-range zero voltage switching (ZVS) is proposed. The converter topology consists of a DAB DC-DC converter, receiving a rectified AC line voltage via a synchronous rectifier. ZVS modulation strategies previously proposed in literature are either based on current-based (CB) or energy-based (EB) ZVS analyses. The combined phase-shift, duty-cycle, and switching frequency modulation proposed in this paper relies on a novel, current-dependent charge-based (CDCB) ZVS analysis, taking into account the commutation charge of the (parasitic) switch capacitances as well as the time dependency of the commutation currents. Thereby, commutation inductance is shown to be an essential element in achieving full-operating-range ZVS. Experimental results obtained from a 3.7 kW bidirectional electric vehicle battery charger which interfaces a 400 V DC-bus with the 230 Vac, 50 Hz utility grid are given to validate the analysis and practical feasibility of the proposed strategy.

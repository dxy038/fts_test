Objective(s): To study the association between the frequency of meals and the levels of non-communicable diseases (NCD) risk factors.
Methods: The sample comprised 592 people (275 men, 317 women) aged 19-50 years, selected randomly from the pool of participants in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. Eating patterns were assessed and the number of meals in a day recorded using two-day 24-hour recall questionnaires. We divided the sample into four subgroups: Group 1 comprised subjects taking less than 6 meals per day. Group 2 included those taking 6-7 meals per day, the third had 8-9 meals per day, and Group 4 took more than 9 meals per day. Blood lipids were measured after 12-14 hours of fasting; anthropometric indices and blood pressure were also recorded. Results: The four groups were composed of 190, 135, 185, and 82 individuals respectively. The risk of having high total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol was found to decrease with greater meal frequency. No significant difference was observed in the intake of macronutrients. The intake of fibers was greater in the fourth group (P0.001).
Conclusion: The study shows that increasing meal frequency may decrease the risk of NCDs. Considering the high prevalence of these disorders, changes in eating habits seem necessary. Keywords: Meal frequency, Energy intake, Lipid profile. Lipoproteins, Risk factors

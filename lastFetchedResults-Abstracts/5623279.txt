A differential geometry approach for the design of output feedback pole assignment compensators is presented. In a first step, the output feedback control problem is formulated as an optimization problem for smooth objective functions on Grassmann manifolds, or related spaces. A Jacobi-type numerical algorithm is proposed that achieves minimization along sequences of simple, algebraic geodesics

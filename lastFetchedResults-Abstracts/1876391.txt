Objective
rpose of this study was to determine the effect of a tailored message intervention on heart failure readmission rates, quality of life, and health beliefs in persons with heart failure (HF).

andomized control trial provided a tailored message intervention during hospitalization and 1 week and 1 month after discharge.
tic framework
ganizing framework was the Health Belief Model.
ts
y persons with a primary diagnosis of chronic HF were included in the study.
s
dmission rates and quality of life did not significantly differ between the treatment and control groups. Health beliefs, except for benefits of medications, significantly changed from baseline in the treatment group in directions posited by the Health Belief Model.
sions
ored message intervention changed the beliefs of the person with HF in regard to the benefits and barriers of taking medications, following a sodium-restricted diet, and self-monitoring for signs of fluid overload. Future research is needed to explore the effect of health belief changes on actual self-care behaviors.

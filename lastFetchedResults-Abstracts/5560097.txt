The significance of construction project organization is self evident for it is charged with achieving construction project general objective, so the ordered function of construction project organization and organization variation are the precondition for the success of construction project. However, because of the complexity and special interface relations belong to construction project organization, it is in great difficulty to evaluate the construction project organization. So whether the construction project organization perform well should be estimated qualitatively only, which is hard to grasped and generalized evidently. Based on the Dissipative Structure theory and neglect the impact of organization pattern and interface , the standard that whether the construction project organization perform well should be ascribed to that whether the organization is ordered or not. According to the analysis listed above, the mathematical model based on Dissipative Structure for order definition of construction project organization has been put forward, and some comprehension problems have been clarified about the application of Dissipative Structure theory in order definition of construction project organization.

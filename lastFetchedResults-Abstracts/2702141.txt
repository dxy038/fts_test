In this paper, we consider the issue of data broadcasting in mobile social networks (MSNets). The objective is to broadcast data from a superuser to other users in the network. There are two main challenges under this paradigm, namely 1) how to represent and characterize user mobility in realistic MSNets; 2) given the knowledge of regular usersÂ´ movements, how to design an efficient superuser route to broadcast data actively. We first explore several realistic data sets to reveal both geographic and social regularities of human mobility, and further propose the concepts of geocommunity and geocentrality into MSNet analysis. Then, we employ a semi-Markov process to model user mobility based on the geocommunity structure of the network. Correspondingly, the geocentrality indicating the &#8220;dynamic user density&#8221; of each geocommunity can be derived from the semi-Markov model. Finally, considering the geocentrality information, we provide different route algorithms to cater to the superuser that wants to either minimize total duration or maximize dissemination ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study data broadcasting in a realistic MSNet setting. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that our approach consistently outperforms other existing superuser route design algorithms in terms of dissemination ratio and energy efficiency.

Summary form only given. This workshop is a key part of the ICCBSS transition and will determine the future focus for the conference. The necessity for the transition is a reflection of community\´s recognition that the complexity of the systems and their sizes have grown tremendously, and that, while COTS-based systems are vital in today\´s business, the hardest part of successful COTS-based development often has little to do with the "C" $"commercial" - in "COTS". The workshop will generate a robust discussion about the challenges - whether technological, organizational, or cultural $for constructing, acquiring, deploying, and sustaining software-intensive systems of systems that require interoperation among a wide variety of components or constituent systems. The objective of the workshop is to develop and organize the challenges into areas that are in need of further research and to provide some indications of the directions such research might take. Workshop contributions and results will be published as an SEI-NRC Technical Report

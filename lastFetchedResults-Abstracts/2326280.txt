Both allogenic and autogenic processes may contribute to the formation of sequence stratigraphic surfaces, particularly at the scale of fourth-order and lower rank cycles. This is the case with all surfaces that are associated with transgression, which include the maximum regressive surface, the transgressive ravinement surfaces and the maximum flooding surface, and, under particular circumstances, the subaerial unconformity as well. Not all autogenic processes play a role in the formation of sequence stratigraphic surfaces, but only those that can influence the direction of shoreline shift. Any changes in shoreline trajectory, whether autogenic or allogenic in origin, influence the stratal stacking patterns in the rock record which sequence stratigraphic interpretations are based upon.

scrimination between the allogenic and autogenic processes that may control changes in shoreline trajectory is a matter of interpretation and is tentative at best in many instances. For this reason, the definition and nomenclature of units and bounding surfaces need to be based on the observation of stratal features and stacking patterns rather than the interpretation of the controlling mechanisms. In this light, we extend the concept of ‘sequence’ to include all cycles bounded by recurring surfaces of sequence stratigraphic significance, irrespective of the origin of these surfaces. The updated sequence concept promotes a separation between the objective observation of field criteria and the subsequent interpretation of controlling parameters, and stresses that a sequence stratigraphic unit is defined by its bounding surfaces and not by its interpreted origin. The use of high-frequency sequences eliminates the need to employ the concepts of parasequence or small-scale cycle in high-resolution studies, and simplifies the sequence stratigraphic methodology and the nomenclature.

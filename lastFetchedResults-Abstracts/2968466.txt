Commonly, the design of a walking machine (WM) use to imitate the nature like multilegged creatures, which try to do the best approaching to a spider, a biped, quadruped or any other living animal. Trying to imitate the way that nature has generated animals seems to be more interesting and promising than imitating special results of the natural process of evolution; if we could imitate the motor that generates walking beings, then we may found better solutions, even in the scenarios where life doesnÂ´t exist. In this paper we present an algorithm using evolutionary strategies, to aid in key steps of the design of a walking machine structure. Mathematical models are developed together with objective functions

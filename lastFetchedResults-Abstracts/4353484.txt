This paper presents a model for the selection of optimal assembly sequences for a product in multirobot systems. The objective of the plan is the minimization of the total assembly time (makespan). To meet this objective, the model takes into account the assembly times and resources for each task, the times needed to change tools in the robots, and the delays due to the transportation of intermediate subassemblies between different workstations. The model can be used in different stages of the process planning. The paper includes two algorithmic approaches for solving the scheduling problem: a genetic algorithm intended for the earlier stages, and an A* algorithm for the final ones.

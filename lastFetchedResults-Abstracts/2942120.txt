In this paper a technique for synchronizing hyperchaotic circuits under parameter or initial condition changes is illustrated. Each hyperchaotic circuit is constituted by two coupled Chua´s circuits. Conditions for achieving synchronization are discussed in detail in both the cases of bidirectional and unidirectional coupling Chua´s circuits. Several numerical examples are carried out to show the capability of the suggested approach

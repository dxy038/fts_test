Model-driven engineering (MDE), and its various forms (such as OMGÂ´s MDA: model-driven architecture) is a software development methodology focusing on creating models and abstractions for a specific domain. It aims to increase productivity and avoid traditional SDLC problems by maximizing compatibility between systems, simplifying the process of design, and promoting understanding and communication between stakeholders and developers. Organic computing is a vision for a particular type of system, and considers what is to be delivered (self-management). MDE involves applied research into how to deliver systems. Both have the development of more effective systems as a high level objective, and so can be viewed as complementary.

Objective
Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a highly immunogenic minor component on the outside surface of CNS myelin which is believed to be one of the autoantigens in multiple sclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of anti-MOG IgG antibody levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND) as markers for the different clinical types of multiple sclerosis.
Patients and methods
Consecutive serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were taken from 21 patients with RRMS, 7 patients with PPMS and 19 patients with NIND. The antibody responses to MOG were determined in paired samples of these differrent clinical groups by enzyme-linked immunoassay using a recombinant human MOG protein.
Results
The performed analysis indicated that the differences in levels of anti-MOG IgG antibody in serum and cerebrospinal fluid from the patients with RRMS, PPMS or NIND were not statistically significant.
Conclusion
The assay is not sensitive or specific enough to be used as a differential diagnostic tool for the clinical types of MS, nor for MS itself.

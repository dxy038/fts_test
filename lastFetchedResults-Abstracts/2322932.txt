The main objective and the purpose of this research is to address this important issue. Other objective of the study is to find out the main reason for accepting ES and to provide a benefit evaluation framework using the balanced scorecard framework.

Except of localized definition of ES benefits framework and assessment of the benefits, the findings of present study includes the mixed research methodology with two positivism and interpretativism approaches through two full cycles of action research.

High Definition (HD) content delivery over IP networks has become a reality in the market of entertainment technologies. This paper presents a professional testbed deployed to emulate a real use case of delivering high definition TV material over an IPTV network. The quality of the delivered H.264/AVC encoded video was evaluated by common objective video quality assessment tools in emulated environment subject to impairments. Objective measurements were further validated by subjective tests. Based on the obtained results, guidelines were drawn for the prediction of user perceived quality in loss-prone environments and on the user perception tolerance for viewing impaired HD broadcast IPTV.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tricyclazole is a systemic fungicide, used for eradicating rice blast disease. This substance has replaced Hinozan pesticides and appears to have adversly effects on reproductive tissues and hormone levels. Due to its widespread use in agriculture, the effects of this toxin on testosterone changes and the testicular structure of mice were evaluated in this study.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 30 adult male NMRI mice, weighing 33±3g, were selected and divided to equal three groups: control, experimental 1, and experimental 2groups. The mice in experimental groups 1 and 2 orally recieved 20 and 40 mg/kg of tricyclazole, respectively for two weeks (5 consecutive days per week), while the control group received no toxins. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, the mice were killed with ether and then samples were taken from all groups. After providing testicular tissue sections, different lines of spermatogenic cells, Leydig cells, and the diameter of seminiferous tubules were measured, using a eye piece. Testosterone level was measured via radioimmunoassay, and finally, the obtained data were analyzed.
FINDINGS: Testosterone level was 1.26±0.44 ng/ml in experimental group 1, 1.12±0.46 ng/ml in experimental group 2, and 0.16±0.059 ng/ml in the control group (p < 0.05). The relative weight of the testis, the diameter of seminiferous tubules, the number of Leydig cells, and the number of blood vessels in experimental groups 1 and 2 significantly increased, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the diameter of the lumen area in group 2 (93.94±1.70 mm) showed a significant increase, compared to the control grouop (82.32±1.71 mm) (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that tricyclazole toxin can impair testosterone secretion and the testicular structure, leaving a adversly effect on sperm production system.

The profit-oriented partial disassembly line balancing problem is studied under uncertainty. Disassembly task times are assumed random variables with known probability distributions. An AND/OR graph is used to model the precedence relations among tasks. The goal is to assign the disassembly tasks to workstations while satisfying precedence and cycle time constraints. The objective is to maximize the profit produced by the line. It is calculated as the difference between the positive revenue generated by retrieved parts and the line operation cost considered as negative revenue. The latter includes the workstation operation costs as well as penalty costs caused by the cycle time constraint violations. To deal with uncertainties, a stochastic linear mixed integer formulation is developed.

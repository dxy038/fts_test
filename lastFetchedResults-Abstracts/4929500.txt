Objective: This paper aims to establish an acquisition and analysis method for medical image in the indoor natural light conditions; Method: According to the color characteristics of the medical image and the constancy of supervised color, we make the color codes which are used for a* b* value correction, and gray codes which are used for L* value correction. Then, we carry on topological subdivision to the one-dimensional L* space and the two-dimensional a*b* space respectively. We establish the mapping function ldquodecomposition-projection-restorationrdquo, and ran the linear mapping to the one-dimensional L* space and triangle mapping to the two-dimensional a*b* space. We correct the 198 color blocks in 22 pictures. Result: Compared with the standard value, DeltaL*, DeltaC*, DeltaE decreased significantly (P&lt;0.01), imagepsilas color difference is reduced, color saturation and the value is closer to standard value. Conclusion: TRM(topology resolve-map model) method can significantly adjust the color error of tongue images under the indoor natural light condition and easy to use, and has a good performance of color correction. It is feasible to apply this method to the color correction of the medical images.

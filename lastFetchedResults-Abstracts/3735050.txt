Frequency assignment should be based on minimization of the unwanted interactions between equipment in an environment. An approach to this problem is developed, based on the operations research technique known as dynamic programming. The basic tools required are an interference prediction model that is capable of providing relative values and a means of deciding which objective function is to be evaluated, i.e., which environmental interference measure is to be used. This concept is not presented as a procedure to be followed but as a logical framework to be modified as desired.

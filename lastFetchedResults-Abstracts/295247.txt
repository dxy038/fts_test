Objective: To investigate the effects of ruthenium red on cardiomyocyte and mitochondrial damage during the early stage after severe burn. Methods: Adult Wistar rats were randomized into normal control group (control), burn group (burns) and ruthenium red-treated group (RR) (n=8). Rats in the burn and RR groups were scalded to 30% TBSA III degree, and 30 min later, resuscitated with Ringer’s solution. Ruthenium red was injected into rats of RR group at a dose of 2 mg kg−1, and again 3 h later. Rats were sacrificed at the 6th hour post-scald, myocardial mitochondrial respiratory function and Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]m), serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), myocardial ATP, ADP, AMP and lactate contents were determined. Results: [Ca2+]m in the RR group was significantly lower than that of the burn group. Mitochondrial respiratory control rate (RCR) and ST3 were higher than those of burns, but ST4 was high compared to the control group. Serum CK and LDH of the RR group decreased significantly, and were 65.0 and 45.5% of the burn group, myocardial ATP content in the ruthenium red-treated group increased by 100.4% and lactate level was decreased by 53.5% compared to the burn group. Conclusions: Ruthenium red attenuated myocyte and mitochondrial damage during the early stage after severe burns.

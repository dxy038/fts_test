Two-dimensional ultrasound sector scans of the left ventricle (LV) are commonly used to diagnose cardiac mechanical function. Present quantification procedures of wall motion by this technique entail inaccuracies, mainly due to relatively poor image quality and the absence of a definition of the relative position of the probe and the heart. The poor quality dictates subjective determination of the myocardial edges, while the absence of a position vector increases the errors in the calculations of wall displacement, LV blood volume, and ejection fraction. An improved procedure is proposed here for automatic myocardial border tracking (AMBT) of the endocardial and epicardial edges in a sequence of video images. The procedure includes nonlinear filtering of whole images, debiasing of gray levels, and location-dependent contrast stretching. The AMBT algorithm is based upon tracking movement of a small number of predefined set of points, which are manually defined on the two myocardial borders. Information from one image is used, by utilizing predetermined statistical criteria to iteratively search and detect the border points on the next one. Border contours are reconstructed by Spline interpolation of the border points. The AMBT procedure is tested by comparing processed sequences of cine echocardiographic scan images to manual tracings by an objective observer and to results from previously published data.

Today, high quality image processing is required in security and surveillance systems. These systems must not only track the motions of humans, but they must also, in some situations, measure features such as height and weight. Few methods have been proposed for height surveying. Some studies show that an infrared ray technique can survey the height of a human, but the equipment required is complicated. The objective of this paper is to build a mathematical model and method for height surveying. This human tracking method can mark humans´ size in a picture so that, if we put this picture in a frame of axes, we can calculate the human´s/object´s height or other features. To obtain more accurate height of an object, we need a method to measure more exact results. Combining tracking/detecting methods with a particle filter provides great accuracy for human tracking.

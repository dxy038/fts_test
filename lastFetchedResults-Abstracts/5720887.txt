Using perception in the context of rendering is a wide spread field. It can be used to speed up calculations or create more detailed images by refining important areas. Saliency, as a perception based method, can identify regions of interest, which should contain more detail. But currently no complete mapping of the 2D operators to an 3D equivalent has been defined. We propose a Bidirectional Saliency Weight Distribution Function (in short BSWDF). Using this function to evaluate a surface element the local saliency value can be obtained. The global value can be retrieved by using a splatting algorithm, which combines the individual features based on the distance of the object. As most objects do not change during rendering, e.g. by deformation, a preprocess can create a lookup cache for these values.

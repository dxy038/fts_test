The main objective of the study is to compare the performance of students with and without math learning disorder in Tower of London (TOL) and scale continuous operation (CPT). To achieve this goal, the target population includes students of fourth, fifth and sixth grade with math learning disability were selected from specific learning disabilities School and normal students School in academic years of 1393-94 in Bilesavar. Forty students with math learning disability in the population were selected through simple random sampling. Tools used in this study include: researcher-made questionnaire, Raven's IQ test, Key- Matt math test, continuous performance test and Tower of London scale. This study is a cross sectional and causal-comparative one. Collected data were analyzed using multivariate variance analysis.The results showed that there is a significant difference between two groups of students with mathematics disorders and normal considering Tower of London and scale continuous performance test. This means that students with mathematical problems and normal ones had a significant difference in terms of the ability to plan, solve problems and catch the studentsâ€™ attention. Based on the findings of this research, it can be concluded that the ability to plan, solve problems and catch the attention of students with mathematical problems were weak and it requires further attention on the part of authorities.

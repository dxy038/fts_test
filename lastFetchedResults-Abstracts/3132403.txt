Based on single photons with random polarization angle, a deterministic secure bidirectional quantum communication scheme, which is similar to traditional communication mode, is proposed. In this scheme both checking messages and secret messages are encoded in the single photons rotated random polarization angle by performing a series of independent operations in three-way quantum channel. Security analysis shows that this scheme, in which secret messages are transmitted deterministically in arbitrary direction (bidirection or monodirection) between two legal communicators, is secure against the present Trojan horse attack strategy and the impersonation attack strategy in a low noisy channel.

The objective of this research is to develop a method to hide a secret color image inside a set of meaningful color images. It allows a group of n members to share the secret image such that any t or more members can cooperatively construct the secret color image, but (t-1) or less members cannot. In addition, this technique has some outstanding properties. The embedded image can be 512 colors, and the size can be as big as that of the cover images. On the other hand, prior schemes have a secret weakness that some members may cheat other members to obtain their shares. Our new scheme can withstand the cheating attack. Therefore, the new technique is superior to previous works. Finally, our experimental results will also reveal that the distortion between our stego-image and cover image is inconspicuous.

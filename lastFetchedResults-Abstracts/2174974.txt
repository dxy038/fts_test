Despite the involvement of cytokinins in phosphate (Pi) signaling being highlighted, the physiological processes involved remain unclear. In this study, we have evaluated the effect of cytokinins on different physiological responses using wild type (wt) and two Arabidopsis mutants with altered shoot Pi content (pho1 and pho2). Physiological studies were related with those previously described as cytokinin-regulated: including hypocotyl elongation, root growth, anthocyanin accumulation, senescence and relative gene expression. Generally, pho1 mutants showed decreased sensitivity to cytokinin, whereas pho2 mutants showed increased sensitivity to the hormone. This observation applies to inhibition of hypocotyls and root growth and anthocyanin accumulation. However, this effect was not shown during senescence or in the expression of ARR6 (Arabidopsis response regulator, ARR). Interestingly, Pi content in shoot of pho1 mutants increased to wt levels after treatment with cytokinins. These results suggest that the interaction between phosphate signaling and cytokinin signaling may be bidirectional while the differential behavior in response to cytokinin is discussed further.

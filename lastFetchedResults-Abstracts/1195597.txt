The objective of this study is to investigate the VOC emission and sorption characteristics of adhesive-bonded materials under floor heating condition. The study focuses on adhesive-bonded materials covering a large surface area, such as plywood flooring/epoxy adhesive assembly as an emission-dominated material, and PVC wallpaper/starch-based adhesive/gypsum board assembly as a sorption-dominated material, installed in a residential housing unit equipped with a radiant floor heating system. The numerical analysis based on mass transfer model is used, and the model was validated, by comparing the simulated results with previously published experimental data. Comparative simulation of emission and sorption between the single finishing material and composite material was performed. With respect to VOC emission, the simulation results showed that the epoxy adhesive allowed a stronger emission from the plywood flooring composite, and also the adhesive effect on VOC emission was shown to become significant under floor heating condition. Another simulation on VOC sorption demonstrated that the starch-based adhesive appeared to increase sorption strength and period. Also, it showed that the adhesive may play a role of mass transfer bridge between the finishing material and substrate, allowing a stronger sorption when low-VOC gypsum board was used as a substrate. The presence of adhesive due to the bonding method can affect the emission and sorption of building finishing materials. The impact on indoor air quality when emission- and sorption-dominated adhesive-bonded materials coexist in a floor heated space was also discussed.

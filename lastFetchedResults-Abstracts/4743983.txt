In multi-objective distribution system optimization with conflicting objectives, the non-dominated points obtained from the application of a specific solver represent the compromise solutions presented to the decision-makers to assist their decision. In order to rank the compromise solutions, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used in this paper as the ranking tool. Results from a case study carried out on a classical test network are presented.

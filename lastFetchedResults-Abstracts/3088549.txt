The integrated sugar/ethanol/electricity production has become the new business model - the bioelectricity industry - with a potential to become a ldquomainstreamrdquo energy option in the near future in Brazil. Besides being clean, it is competitive: several hundred MW of bioelectricity plants have already signed long-term electricity supply contracts with the distribution companies. These contracts have been awarded on a competitive basis (public auctions), without any subsidy policy and an agreement with the World Bank to create an ldquoumbrellardquo qualifying procedure of bioelectricity plans for carbon credits - with a later auction of the credits - is already in place. The objective of this work is to discuss the bioelectricity achievements in Brazil.

This paper proposes a scale model approach to clarify radio wave propagation for wireless link design of mobile radio communication systems. The objective of this study is channel impulse response for micro cells in urban areas. To verify reproducibility using the scale model, a one-hundredth scale model of an urban area using concrete blocks is constructed and power delay profiles are measured using the model in the 2 GHz and 10 GHz bands. The measured r.m.s. delay spreads are small values and are approximately 1/5 compared to those for a real environment. The lack of reproducibility of the power delay profile in the scale mode is examined, and the cause is found not to be the scale model itself, but rather the measurement frequency.

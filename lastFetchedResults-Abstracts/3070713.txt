We describe an approach to sensory-motor learning and coordination that draws from psychology rather than neuroscience. The growth of the motor coordination is controlled through sequential lifting of constraints, which is inspired by Jean PiagetÂ´s developmental learning theory. Our objective is the implementation of a flexible learning framework for an embodied hand/eye system which exhibits a prolonged epigenetic developmental process. The results show how staged competence can be shaped by qualitative behavior changes produced by anatomical, computational and maturational constraints.

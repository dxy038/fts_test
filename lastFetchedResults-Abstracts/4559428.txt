Renewable energy resources, such as wind turbines (WT) and photovoltaic cells (PV), can serve as an alternative to fossil fuel-generated electricity. They are being considered as the most promising new energy sources due to their availability and topological advantages in local power generation, but they have a drawback in that electrical output energy is unstable besides the initial and maintenance costs are expensive. This paper presents a novel technique to extract the optimum sizing of hybrid renewable energy generation system (HRES) with storage system via open space particle swarm optimization (OSPSO). The simulation using this technique is shown. The total system cost is the objective function. The technical sizing is a constraint.

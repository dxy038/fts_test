Background: Nutritional problems are common in frail elderly individuals receiving municipal care.
Objective: To evaluate if an additional evening meal could improve total daily food intake, nutritional status, and
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in frail elderly service flat (SF) residents. Design: Out of 122 residents in
two SF complexes, 60 subjects agreed to participate, of which 49 subjects (median 84 (79-90) years, (25th-75th
percentile)) completed the study. For six months 23 residents in one SF complex were served 530 kcal in addition
to their regular meals, i.e. intervention group (I-group). Twenty-six residents in the other SF building were
controls (C-group). Nutritional status, energy and nutrient intake, length of night time fast, cognitive function and
HRQOL was assessed before and after the intervention. Results: At the start, the Mini Nutritional Assessment
classified 27% as malnourished and 63% as at risk for malnutrition, with no difference between the groups. After
six months the median body weight was unchanged in the I-group, +0.6 (-1.7 – +1.6) kg (p=0.72) and the Cgroup
-0.6 (-2.0 – +0.5) kg (p=0.15). Weight change ranged from –13% to +15%. The evening meal improved
the protein and carbohydrate intake (p<0.01) but the energy intake increased by only 180 kcal/day (p=0.15). The
night time fast decreased in the I-group from 15.0 (13.0-16.0) to 13.0 (12.0-14.0) hours (p<0.05). There was no
significant difference in cognitive function or HRQOL between the groups. Conclusion: Nine out of ten frail
elderly SF residents had nutritional problems. Serving an additional evening meal increased the protein and
carbohydrate intake, but the meal had no significant effect on energy intake, body weight or HRQOL. The
variation in outcome within each study group was large.

Methods: Based on the three-step percutaneous penetration model and Fick´s law of diffusion, build a mathematical model, analyze the factors which affect the process of diffusion. Results: By mathematical analysis, we get the drug concentration profiles in the skin layer at different time and the characteristic curves of drug penetration performance. Diffusion and absorption properties of drug under different surface drug concentration and diffusion coefficients are also given. Conclusion: Increasing the diffusion coefficient within a certain range can effectively accelerate the drug diffusion and absorption. Surface drug concentration has a small impact on the diffusion rate, but it can significantly promote the absorption process in subcutaneous tissue. Therefore, appropriately increasing skin diffusion coefficient and surface drug concentration is the main purpose of different enhancing osmosis methods.

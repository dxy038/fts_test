The objective of this study was to prepare dibutylphthalate via esterification reaction in the presence of some solid acidic catalysts. The catalysts were some transition metal polyoxometalates as effective and green catalysts with Keggin; K3[PMo6W6O40], K3[PMo12O40], K4[SiMo12O40], K4[SiW12O40], Na7[PW11O39], Wells-Dawson; K6[P2W18O62],
and Preyssler structures; K14[NaP5W30O110]. In the first step, the above-mentioned
polyoxometalates were prepared, and then characterized. Consequently, the reactivity of
those catalysts have been studied and compared in the preparation of dibutylphtalate. Among
various acidic catalysts which were used, K3[PMo6W6O40] showed the best reactivity and
efficiency compared to the other catalysts.

Objective: The present study aims at discovering the existing relationships between the qualities of school instructional elements with school library status.
Method: A survey using four questionnaires concerning the library situation and quality of school principal, teachers and librarian was carried out. The sample was drawn girls-only high schools from 6th educational district (representing affluent zones) and 15th educational district (representing underprivileged zones) in Metro Tehran. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS statistical software.
Findings: No significant link was established between any of the school principal’s qualities with the status of school library. A significant link was found between the status of school library with librarian’s satisfaction with his/her school library and short term librarianship courses undertaken. A direct, significant link exists between teachers’ teaching style with the state of school of library.

    Under difficult and hard situations in exploiting the meadows by some of pasture engineers which is mostly based on the traditional procedures, one of the most suitable ways in increasing meadow exploitation is to follow the scientific logging through stockmen in meadows in such a way that there won’t be any damage to the basic sources like water and soil. Recently there have been taken some measures to prevent meadows from being damaged and furthermore, retaining the country natural sources such as performing pasture managing designs. The objective of this paper has been to consider performing procedures in pastures planning in western MAZANDARAN (KOJOUR in NOSHAHR & SEHEZAR in TONEKABON) to identify the preventing possible challenges and factors, moreover; finding out whether the pasture users think of how to use them. Besides it must be considered how the economical and social factors could affect meadow exploitation, in fact it’s an irrefutable necessity in pasture management decision making. Collecting data has been done in two forms: library & scope methods (using questionnaires, factitious observations and deep interviews) finally unprocessed data should be analyzed through SPSS.18, software through doing suitable statistical tests like K2, KENDAL TABI & SPEARMAN. The obtained results show that the economical problems has been one of the important challenges while performing correctly the pasture management plans. It means more social problems would cause less correct meadow management plans. Moreover, the other challenges against performing correctly the pastures management would be technical and physical executive problems, so it could be claimed that the plans with less users would be more successful in implementing range management projects, and in meadows with lots of users, the stockmen won’t be so enthusiastic to invest.

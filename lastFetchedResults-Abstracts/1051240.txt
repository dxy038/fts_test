Background and Objective: Social environment affects quality of life and causes physical and psychological disorders in children. Aim of this study was to compare the quality of life in abused and normal children by controlling roles of social anxiety, mood and feeling.

Materials and Methods: The research design was a non-experimental protocol. Participants were 60 children. Using available sampling method, 30 abused children were selected from Center for Treatment of Social and Individual Crisis and a Center of Street Children in Semnan in 2012. They were matched with 30 normal children by age and gender. They completed Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory and Short Mood and Feeling Questionnaire for Children. 

Results: The results for social phobia and quality of life in physical dimension was different between the two groups. By controlling simultaneous changes of children's mood/feeling on emotional and social dimensions, and also, by controlling social anxiety on emotional and school dimensions, difference of quality of life in these dimensions between the two groups were not statistically significant.

In modeling a cold standby redundancy allocation problem (RAP) with imperfect switching
mechanism, deriving a closed form version of a system reliability is too difficult. A
convenient lower-bound on system reliability is proposed and this approximation is widely
used as a part of objective function for a system reliability maximization problem in the
literature. Considering this lower-bound does not necessarily lead to an optimal solution. In
this study by assuming that working time of switching mechanism is exponentially
distributed, exact value of system reliability is derived analytically through applying Markov
process and solving a relevant set of differential-difference equations. The Runge-Kutta
numerical scheme is also employed to verify the accuracy of the results. It is assumed that
component time-to-failure follows an Erlang distribution which is appropriate for most
engineering design problems by giving the possibility of modeling different increasing
hazard functions. A new mathematical model is presented and its performance is evaluated
through solving a well-known example in the literature. Results demonstrate that a higher
level of system reliability is achievable through implementing the proposed model.

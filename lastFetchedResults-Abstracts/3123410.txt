There are two major difficulties in the indefinite multi-objective decision making process: As the information about attributes is indefinite, how to express the indefinite information; as the information has multi-channels, how to fuse the information into synthetic information. The multiple-valued intuitive fuzzy sets is one new mathematical model, this model can process well fuzzy information gained from multi-sources. In this article, firstly conduct the research to the multiple-valued intuitive fuzzy setÂ´s information fusion and construct some methods to fuse the information included in the degree of membership or non-degree of membership of multiple-valued intuitive fuzzy set , then use the isomorphism mind to research indefinite isomerism multi-objective decision making and construct one new algorithm for interval value and indefinite language isomerism multi-objective decision making based on isomorphism information fusion.

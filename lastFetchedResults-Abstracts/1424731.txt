Objective: To examine for a relationship between serum cholesterol and suicidal behavior. Methods: Patients admitted after an overdose (N=120) were compared with controls (N=120) for their serum cholesterol levels. Results: Patients who had overdosed had significantly lower serum cholesterol levels than controls (mean±S.D. 171±31 vs. 196±30 mg/dl, P&lt;0.0001). Conclusion: These results add to a grouping literature reporting that low serum cholesterol is associated with suicidal behavior.

Introduction: This research was conducted to assess the effectiveness of detached mindfulness techniques versus distraction techniques to decrease the craving and the relapse rate in patients with substance dependent disorders.

Materials and Methods: In this multiple baseline experimental study, 6 male substance dependent subjects were selected based on the objective sampling method among clients of Parsian center for substance dependency treatment in 2005 in Mashhad, north-eastern part of Iran. The patients were randomly divided into two groups whom received detached mindfulness techniques or distraction techniques respectively. All subjects completed the relapse prediction scale (RPS) at the baseline, during the treatment (4th session), post-treatment (8th session) and at follow up stage (1.5 months after treatment). Some diagrams and clinical recovery rates were used to compare two different types of interventions.

Results: The results revealed that both methods were effective to decrease craving and relapse rate in substance dependent subjects. The detached mindfulness techniques were more effective than distraction techniques (%62 versus %39).

Conclusion: Detached mindfulness techniques, versus distraction techniques, are probably more effective to reduce craving and relapse rate in substance dependents.

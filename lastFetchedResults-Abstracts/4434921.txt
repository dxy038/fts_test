Design and testing drug delivery systems using biodegradable and biocompatible colloidal carriers made of functionalized gold nanoparticles are the vectors of this project. The systems will be tested in therapy strategies for cancer. The main objective is to develop nanoparticles that increase radiation absorption in diseased areas and minimize damage to normal surrounding tissues. Such enhancement of radiation will benefit cancer patients by decreasing radiation dose and reducing side effects. Secondary objectives include investigating radiosensitizing potential of gold nanoparticles and selecting most efficient system plus combining nanoparticle-enhanced radiotherapy with anti cancer drugs. The project will contribute to advancing promising delivery systems that can be activated remotely by sensitizing them for light/radiation.

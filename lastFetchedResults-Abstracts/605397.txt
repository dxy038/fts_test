Objective(s): To determine the effect comparison of self efficacy(S-E) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) on Theory of Reasoned Action prediction in substance abuse avoidance by path analysis. (By Lisrel software). Therefore PBC and S-E were added to Theory of Reasoned Action. Then It was compared the model fitness and prediction percentage of intention and behavior by Theory of Reasoned Action and the other it's versions.
Methods: Validity and reliability of questionnaires were assessed and data were collected from 433 high school students (15-19 years-sons) on the various components of models. Then it was compared fitness indices and percentage of intention and behavior prediction by path analysis between TRA and other it's developed versions.
Results: The results indicated that fitness indices and percentage of intention and behavior prediction by the Theory of Reasoned Action in substance abuse avoidance were become well by PBC and S-E. This effect had a minimum rate in version with PBC and a maximum rate in version with SE. in addition SE was more effective than PBC in this effectiveness especially on intention prediction rate.
Conclusion: The results of this study indicated PBC and S-E were increased the Reasoned Action Theory effective in substance abuse avoidance.

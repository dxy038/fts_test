In sensor networks, multi-targeting technology is the basis for tracking system, this paper presents an improved tracking algorithm of weighted centroid location which using target may appear in the perceived probability of the region to give different weights to the node, and give a kind of multi-objective classification of thinking, using partition probability function to select the most consistent trajectory of the partition.

A closed loop controller for an existing anti-G suit is proposed. The objective of this controller is to improve the G-tolerance of the pilot by filling the anti-G-suit bladders to the desired pressure in a short time period and with a small overshoot. This controller was added to the MATRIXx-based computer simulation of the cardiovascular system to evaluate its performance for different G-profiles. A comparison with the high-flow valve and the so called Bang-Bang servo valve, and the simulation results showing the effects of time delay between inflation of anti-G-suit bladders are presented. A discrete equivalent of this controller was obtained for implementation on a microprocessor

Objective: Determining the epidemiologic pattern of sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss in hospitalized patients.
Material and Method: Patients to the hospital due to sudden sensorineural hearing loss were evaluated thoroughly (history, physical examination, lab tests, imaging). Those with a certin diagnosis were excluded, and in the unknown etiology group the preferred information was obtained. All patients were treated with prednisone, acyclovir, and low salt diet. Daily audiologic tests were performed.
Results: The peak incidence was the fourth decade, with women being affected more than men. The onset was more common in the early morning and in the fall. The accompanying signs were tinnitus (90%) and vertigo (50%). Hearing loss was profound (>90dB) in 80% of the patients.
Hearing enhancement in 75% of hospitalized patients was negligible (none or less than 20dB), and only in 15% was there a dramatic response (improvement more than 50dB). Conclusion: Hearing enhancement (prognosis) in severely affected patients is not prominent despite using widely accepted therapy.

Satellite formation coordination control was important of reducing the total control fuel cost and keeping the formation safe. If one of the formation satellites was malfunctioned, which loose the orbit maneuver ability, then, the other satellites should transfer to a new position to keep the formation safe. Meanwhile, the malfunctioned satellite can be replaced by a new satellite in the new formation. Based on this background, a leaving-net strategy for the multi-satellites coordination control was presented, and the fuel-equalization and collision avoidance constraints were considered. By optimizing the departure time and objective destination of the leaving satellites, we can make the satellites with more residual fuel consume more fuel and the satellites with less residual fuel consume less fuel during the maneuver process. Simulation results manifested that, the new method can make sure each satellite use equal fuel while the satellites were leaving the original formation, the cost was using more time to get in return space, which can make the satellites join in the new formation with the least fuel cost.

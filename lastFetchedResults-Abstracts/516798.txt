Objective: The relative high speed of experts in problem solving can inflexibly fix them on an early solution in some circumstances and negatively influence their efficiency in subsequent problem solving. The goal of the present study is the comparative evaluation of the effect of mental set on the problem solving of expert and novice students. Method: 48 novice and expert students solved Luchin's water jar problems using a 2*3 (2 levels of expertness*3 levels of mental set) factorial design. Results: Results were obtained using factor analysis of variance and showed the following: 1) expert participants were more affected by mental set and were fixed on the early problem solving, 2) expert participants outperformed novices in solving non-set problems, and 3) non-set students outperformed mentally set participants. Conclusion: In some circumstances, expertise in problem solving may increase the vulnerability to mental set effects, and, therefore, worsen the performance (in comparison with novices).

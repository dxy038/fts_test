This paper is basically extension of my work on glaucoma detection. This can be achieved by various data mining techniques and algorithms such as Association, Classification, Clustering, Fuzzy decision tree etc. The objective of this paper is early detection of glaucoma using cross validation algorithm. We will analyses the symptoms shown by different patients and compute and generalize them to reach a decision. This will help not only patients but doctors also to make it primarily practice to follow for new patients.

A novel system is described for precision indoor location and tracking of personnel inside a building using RF signals exchanged with reference units deployed outside the building without benefit of infrastructure or site survey. Localization in high multipath without multilateration by fusion of unidirectional signals using singular array reconciliation tomography is reviewed. The bidirectional signal fusion approach is introduced with transactional array reconciliation tomography. Underlying theory is developed, and performance evaluated with simulated and experimental data.

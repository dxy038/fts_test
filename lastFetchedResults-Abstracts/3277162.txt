The broad topic of the presented paper consists in the research on novel methods in the field of microwave imaging, in particular the so-called passive microwave / millimeter-wave imaging, which is also referred to radiometric imaging. This study focuses on proximity range applications such as concealed objects detection, human body screening, etc. The aim is to design a low cost and compact fully electronic passive imaging system suitable for short-range 2D imaging applications, and study the necessary devices for the implementation of a complete demonstrator. In this study, a new approach based on the use of a switch sub-matrix strategy has been adapted into a complete antenna system at X band. The main objective of this prototype is to validate this approach experimentally. Image quality is examined by using the interferometric aperture synthesis technique and G-matrix calibration imaging algorithms. The spatial resolution is measured by using a noise source target and is compared with theory.

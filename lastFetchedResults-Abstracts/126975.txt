Background : Salivary alterations in NIDDM patients may result in dental and oral problems.
Objective : To determine salivary alterations in NIDDM patients in comparison with a control group.
Methods : This case- control study was implemented on 30 NIDDM & 25 control subjects. All the subjects were screened for : Fasting blood sugar, salivary flow rate, candida colony number of saliva, salivary PH, and salivary glucose. Moreover, symptoms of xerostomia, taste sensibility and burning of tongue were studied.
Findings: The average amount of salivary glucose in NIDDM patients was found to be 12.35± 7.1 mgldl while in conrtol group it was 8.76±5.8 mg.dl (P=0.048). 15 NIDDM subjects and 3 control subjects found to have condida in their salivas (P= 0.003). Salivary PH and flowrate did not have any statistically significant difference. Oral examination also showed that 16 NIDDM subjects and 4 control subjects suffered from xerostomia (P=0.004). Conclusion : Median salivary glucose level, condida colony count of saliva and xerostomia in NIDDM patients is more, compared with the control group subjects.

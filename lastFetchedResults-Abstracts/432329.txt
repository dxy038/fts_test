Background
Modifications have been made in cardiopulmonary circuit to reduce the inflammatory deleterious effects and cost. We present our experience of one such right heart bypass (RHB) circuit utilizing autologus lung as oxygenator.
Methods
From September 2001 to December 2002, 15 patients underwent congenital heart surgery with this technique. Bypass circuit consisted of a reservoir and a roller pump along with a cardiotomy sucker. The left pulmonary artery and main pulmonary artery were used for arterial return, and venous drainage was achieved with innominate vein cannulation. Inferior vena cava cannulation was performed when needed. Thirteen patients underwent bidirectional Glenn shunt surgery (12 to 24 months, 6 to 10 kg). One patient (26 years old) underwent central shunt with enlargement of confluence and left pulmonary artery. Another patient (18 months old) underwent 1.5 ventricle repair.
Results
There were no hospital deaths. Mean flow achieved on RHB was 0.57 ± 0.3 L/min/m2, central venous pressure was 3.3 ± 1.8 mm Hg (0 to 7 mm Hg), and mean arterial pressure could be maintained satisfactorily in all patients (54 ± 14 mm Hg). Mean RHB time was 54 ± 14 min. Mean central venous pressure was 10.1 ± 2.4 mm Hg after procedure and saturation was similar to that on (RHB 88% ± 8%). The mean amount of drainage was 9.1 ± 4.2 mL/kg per 24 hours. Avoiding an oxygenator and reducing the number of tubings achieved a combined cost savings of 40% for all procedures.
Conclusions
Right heart bypass is a simple, safer, and less expensive alternative to conventional cardiopulmonary bypass. This technique allows effective decompression of superior vena cava, adequate oxygenation, and predicts saturation after Glenn shunt. It can also be applied for central shunts and pulmonary artery reconstructions with cost containment.

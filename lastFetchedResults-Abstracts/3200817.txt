This paper deals with bidirectional AC-DC converter with high power efficiency and high power factor, in which the novel FPGA control strategy is applied. The prototype bidirectional AC-DC converter of the rated power of 2kW is made and tested. As a result, in both forward operation mode and regenerative one, the power efficiency is at 97.0% at the rated output power of 2kW, is over 98.0% at 25% output power of the rated one and maximum one is 98.4% at 0.7kW. The power factor is over 0.99 under the output power condition from 20% to the rated one and over 0.96 under 10% output power condition of the rated one. The transient response time is under half period, when the converter operation is changed from the forward mode to regenerative one.

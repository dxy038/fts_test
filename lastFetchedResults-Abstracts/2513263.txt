Considering that the active companies in the field of oil, gas, petrochemical
and other energies are project-based and also the increase of gas applicants
who have taken policy of replacing the gas instead of other fossil fuels, have
imposed certain condition on organizations and project managers in the gas
company. One of the most important problem in the issue of project
management is project portfolio selection which is defined one of the most
important activities in many organization such as gas organization. In this
study at first the effective indicators on projects are extracted by using the
literature and interviews with the experts of gas industry then the
mathematical robust multi objective Model is Provided by considering the
uncertainty and unreliability in some parameters of model. This model is
solved by using non-dominate sorting genetic algorithm for 20 degree of
risk-taking decision gama ( , C
t ? B
t ? ).At the end for helping in decision making
the TOPSIS technique is used for providing a specific answer in pareto front

Background: The mutant allele of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2*2) was found to be associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) in a Japanese sample, interacting with the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (Apo E4). Objective: In a community Korean population we sought to investigate associations between ALDH2 genotypes and the following outcomes: cognitive impairment, previous cognitive decline, dementia and AD. Method: Six hundred ninety community residents aged 65 or over were assessed for demographic characteristics, drinking behaviour, cognitive function, clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD, physical health status, and genotype (ALDH2 and Apo E). Results: There were no significant associations between the ALDH2*2 and any cognitive outcome, before or after adjustment for alcohol-related characteristics. These findings were consistent both in the non-drinkers and drinkers. Interaction between ALDH2 and Apo E was only found for one outcome (previous cognitive decline) at borderline levels of significance (P=0.058). Conclusion: Overall, these findings in a community population did not support a substantial role for ALDH2 genotype in the aetiology of dementia.

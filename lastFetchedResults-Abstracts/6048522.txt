This paper discusses a distributed control for load frequency of electrical power networks based on iterative gradient methods. The control objective is to minimize the quadratic cost function of load frequency control problem, and we apply the distributed control methodology by using iterative gradient methods to complicated large scale electrical power networks. Iterative gradient methods have good flexibility and they are effective for complicated and time-varying distributed power networks. Several numerical simulation results of distributed power network systems including distributed generations, batteries, and renewable energies in order to show the effectiveness of the load frequency control compared with conventional decentralized control and centralized control.

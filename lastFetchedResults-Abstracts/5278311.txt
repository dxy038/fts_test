This paper deals with the output feedback stabilization problem for the stochastic nonholonomic systems with unknown stochastic disturbances. The objective is to design the almost global asymptotical output feedback controllers in probability for the systems by output feedback. The switching control strategy based on the output measurement of the first subsystem is employed to achieve the asymptotic stabilization. An observer is introduced for states estimates. Thereby, the integrator backstepping technique based on a constructive manipulation is applied to the design of the controller. The output feedback asymptotic stabilization in probability is realized. Also an example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

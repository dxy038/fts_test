This paper expatiates on the basic concept about reverse engineering. It puts forward a new working mode which takes innovation as the core. According to 3D reconstruction of complex product as the goal, it analyzes the working process of reverse engineering. The mode and process constructs CAD solid model of complex product under universal CAD software environment and lays a good foundation for product innovation design based on prototype. This paper points out that feature recognization is the main research content and key link. It decides the working quality and working speed of reverse engineering. It is pointed out in this paper that there is a particular parameter system in reverse engineering. It is composed of original design parameters, objective prototype parameters and reconstruction parameters. After discussing the concepts of all kinds of parameters and analyzing the errors in reverse engineering, it is indicated that the parameters evaluated in reverse engineering today are actually reconstruction parameters. However the original design parameters must be evaluated and the product is manufactured by the original design parameters in most cases in mechanical manufacturing field.

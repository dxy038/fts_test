Consider about the trade-off between cost and accuracy, lots of works investigate into the inertial measurement system (IMS) and global position system (GPS) fusion. However, with the necessary to insure the long-term on-board working precision it results in a complication between the time-consuming and complex calculation in the system design. Therefore timing has become a critical problem in the hardware design. Nowadays more and more applications require not only the accuracy but also the rapid response. So the objective of this paper is to develop a real-time on-board platform of an integrated inertial navigation system (IINS), in virtue of the SoC technology to finalize the velocity and position estimation of vehicle in real-time. This system platform addresses a new way to separate the system design into three modules and applied into a parallel structure, like MIPS. According to the function of data acquisition, auto-alignment process and calibration, this system can adapt the timing consummation and signal frequency between each module.

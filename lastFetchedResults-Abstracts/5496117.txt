In order to improve the deficiency of existing Web service integration methods, this paper proposes an agent-based web service integration model and designs the organization structure and communicating pattern of the multi-agents system in this model. Moreover, a general QoS model is established to realize the predetermined objective under the constraint of the QoS of composite services. Finally, combining the local optimization and the overall optimization, this paper constructs the QoS-based algorithm of selecting Web service integration path and checks out its effectiveness through the experiment.

VMODEX is an interactive visualization tool to support system-level Design Space Exploration (DSE) of MPSoC architectures. It was initially developed to help designers to get insight into the search process of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) that are typically used in the DSE process, and facilitates the analysis of the DSE results. In this paper, we extend VMODEX to help algorithm developers as well. Since there are many different MOEAs to search a design space and there is no conclusive answer regarding which algorithm is the best for a specific problem, finding the best optimization algorithm is a big challenge. However, using VMODEX, algorithm developers can easily evaluate and compare the results of different searching algorithms, for a given problem, with respect to their efficiency and effectiveness, in order to find the best optimization algorithm. Then, the best optimization results are delivered to the designers for analyzing the design space exploration process.

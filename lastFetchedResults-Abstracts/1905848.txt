Objective:
 To investigate association between nosocomial infection, blood products transfusion and microorganisms
responsible in patients who hospitalized at ICU (intensive care unit).
Patients and Methods: 
In this prospective study, 217 patients who were admitted to the ICU of Taleghani Hospital
between August 2010 and August 2011 were included. Nosocomial infections were defined using the contacts for
disease control and development national nosocomial infections surveillance definitions. Overall, site specific
nosocomial infections rates, blood units received, attributable mortality rate and excess length of hospital stay and
other variable were considered.
Results:
 The overall nosocomial infection rate was 24.9% (54 patients). The most common type of nosocomial
infection was respiratory tract infections (6.5%, 14) with an attributable mortality rate of 3.7%. In patients who
received blood products, 26.6% (37) acquired nosocomial infections. Despite the high percentage of blood transfusion
in the hospital, no statistically significant relationship was observed between nosocomial infections and blood product
transfusion.
Conclusion:
 No significance relation was found between NIs and blood transfusion, but was observed between FFP
transfusion and NIs. Itâ€™s emphasized the need for careful disinfection for FFP transfusion in ears that serve
immunosuppressed individual, such as pediatric patients

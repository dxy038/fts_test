&#8226; A sequential/dynamic stochastic scheduler was developed to handle uncertainty and multi-objective for integrated departures and arrivals &#8226; Stochastic scheduler is better than deterministic scheduler with buffers by reducing delay &amp; number of controller interventions &#8226; Large window size is better when the controller intervention is low, and small window size is better when delay is low

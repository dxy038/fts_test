In digital communication system design, the
main objective is to receive data as similar as the data sent
from the transmitter. It is important to analyze the system in
term of probability of error to view the system's
performance. Each modulation technique has different
performance while dealing with signals, which normally are
affected with noise. General explanation for BER is explained
and simulated in this paper. It focuses on comparative
performance analysis of BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK and 16PSK
i.e. Mary PSK system where the value of M=2, 4, 8 and 16.
VHSIC Hardware Description Language (HDL) was used for
committal to writing of the design. The Xilinx ISE 8.1i tool
was used for synthesis of this project. ModelSim PE Student
Edition 10.3c is used for functional simulation and logic
verification of analog waveforms. The BER curves for
different digital modulation techniques which are obtained
after simulation are compared with theoretical curves. All
the BER calculations are done assuming the channel as
AWGN channel.

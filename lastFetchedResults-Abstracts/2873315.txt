The advent of innovative power generation and storage systems introduces new opportunities of cost minimization for the demand response (DR) algorithms in smart grid (SG) technology. Conventional DR algorithms consider unidirectional flow of energy from power grid to the residential building. In this paper, we study an extended model of a smart residential building with hybrid energy system (e.g. connected with traditional electric grid and renewable energy sources) and bidirectional energy trading facility. This model not only allows a user to reduce the energy cost by storing the energy for the future usage, but also permits the user to earn revenue by selling surplus energy to the grid. Furthermore, we discuss an appliance-scheduling algorithm for the extended DR model.

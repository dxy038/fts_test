Background: Nowadays, taking lateral cephalograms in natural head position is recommended however, the radiographic norms vary in different populations. Performance of cephalometric analysis has become much easier and more accurate using computer software. Objective: The aim of present study was to program software for Mesh analysis and constructing two normal Mesh templates for cities of Qazvin and Mashhad.
Methods: This was a descriptive study in which the Mesh analysis software was programmed by means of Microsoft visual C++ based on Windows XP using My-SQL as database. The samples were NHP cephalograms from 11 to 13 years old adolescence with normal occlusion including 37 (21 girls andl6 boys) in the city of Qazvin and 65 (32 girls and 33 boys) in the city of Mashhad. The cephalograms were scanned and 4 Mesh templates constructed for each gender in each of two cities using Moorees method. The dimensions of each of the 34 landmarks of each template were statistically compared with each other by means of t- test in both boys and girls, separately. Findings: Among girls, 38 measures out of 68 (17 width and 21 height) and in boys 20 measures out of 68 (8 width and 12 height) indicated significant statistical differences between two cities. Conclusion: In addition to sex, age, and the dimensions of SN and N-ANS, the ethnical origin of patients should be considered when dentoskeletal analysis of abnormalities is performed.

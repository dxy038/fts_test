Objective: Our purpose was to describe the effect of oral methylprednisolone on the course of refractory hyperemesis gravidarum. Study Design: Patients with intractable hyperemesis gravidarum were candidates for oral methylprednisolone. Forty-eight milligrams per day was given for 3 days followed by a tapering dose over 2 weeks. If vomiting recurred after 2 weeks of therapy or during tapering, the medication was restarted or extended but not longer than 1 month total. Results: Seventeen of 18 patients (94%) were free of vomiting and were able to tolerate a regular diet within 3 days. Seven did not have further symptoms during their pregnancies. Nine vomited during or after tapering, but 7 of these responded to extension or reinstitution of therapy. Four of 6 patients on total parenteral nutrition at the start of therapy had a complete response within 3 days. Conclusions: A short course of oral methylprednisolone appears to be a reasonable therapeutic alternative for intractable hyperemesis. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:1054-8.)

Security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) is commonly used in Independent System Operators (ISO). The operating costs are minimized under the transmission network constraints in SCED. The increasing environment awareness and the implement of Kyoto Protocol are changing the operation of power system. The SCED will be transformed from single objective economic problem to multi-objective problem to combine both economic and emission dispatch. This paper explores the emissions and security constrained economic dispatch (ESCED). Many intelligent swarm-based optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), have been applied for economic dispatch or emission constrained dispatch. A new developed swarm-based intelligent algorithm, Bee algorithm, is utilized for the problem of ESCED. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

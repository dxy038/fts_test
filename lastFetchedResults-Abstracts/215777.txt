Objective:
This study aims at determining the epidemiologic, presenting symptoms, clinical course and electrophysiologic features of childhood Cuillain-Barre Syndrome (CBS) in the East Azarbaijan province over a period of five years.
Materials & Methods:
All the patients, aged< 15 years, referred/admitted to Tabriz Children Hospital with CBS between January 2001 and December 2005 were investigated.
Results:
One hundred and twelve subjects were enrolled during this period. The average annual incidence rate was 2.2I per 100000 population of children aged<15 years (CI 95%: 1.8-2.6); the highest proportion of 29% was observed in winter (P=0.10); mean age (SD) of subjects was 5.1 (3.3) years, while 61.6% were < = 5 years. The male/female ratio was 1.3. Antecedent events were identified in 80 (7I .4%) patients. The most common manifestation was limb weakness; at the peak of the disease course, only 8 (7.I%) patients were able to walk without assistance. Cranial nerve involvement was found in 37.5%. Fifteen percent of
patients had autonomic dysfunction, and 32.2% complained of neuropathic pain. Artificial ventilation was needed in 10.7% of patients, and three patients (2.7%) died due to cardiac arrest. Electrophysiological examination showed the demyelinating type of the disease in 54.5%; axonal type in 35.7% and 9.8% as unclassified or normal pattern. Short time to reach nadir (P=0.008), cranial nerve
involvement (P=0.000),) autonomic involvement (p=0.001), and axonal pattern on electro diagnosis (P=0.043) were found as risk factors for respiratory failure . In follow-up, at the end of one year, 95% of patients could walk without aid.
Conclusion:
The axonal type of CBS is a relatively common form of childhood CBS occurring in East Azerbaijan.

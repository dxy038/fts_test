After an aggregated problem has been solved, it is often desirable to estimate the accuracy loss due to the fact that a simpler problem than the original one has been solved. One way of measuring this loss in accuracy is the difference in objective function values. To get the bounds for this difference, Zipkin (Operations Research 1980;28:406) has assumed, that a simple (knapsack-type) localization of an original optimal solution is known. Since then various extensions of Zipkinâ€™s bound have been proposed, but under the same assumption. A method to compute the bounds for variable aggregation for convex problems, based on general localization of the original solution is proposed. For some classes of the original problem it is shown how to construct the localization. Examples are given to illustrate the main constructions and a small numerical study is presented.

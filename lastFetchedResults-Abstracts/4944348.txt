In this paper, we present a hybrid file system, called N-hybrid (New-form of hybrid) file system, whose main objective is to integrate the strengths of HDD and SSD, to provide a large-scale file system space in a cost-effective way. N-hybrid was designed to take advantage of SSDÂ´s high I/O performance while providing a flexible internal structure to integrate excellent sequential performance of a legacy file system, such as ext2 or xfs. The performance evaluation demonstrates that achieving high I/O performance is possible by combining vast, low-cost HDD storage space with a small portion of SSD. Several experiments were conducted to verify the performance of N-hybrid.

Concerns decentralized adaptive switching control of decentralized LTI systems, using a family of controllers approach. Our objective is to design a high performance controller for a decentralized system, when the uncertainty in the plant model is sufficiently large so that a fixed decentralized controller is ineffective. It will be assumed that a set of previously designed high performance decentralized controllers is available for each input-output agent, and that the decentralized switching controller may &#8220;switch&#8221; from this set

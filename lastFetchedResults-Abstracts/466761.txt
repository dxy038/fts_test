Objective: To determine donor site morbidity associated with harvesting of fascia lata. Study Design: We reviewed medical records and evaluated responses to mailed questionnaires from all patients who underwent fascia lata harvesting during a 54-month period. Data were collected about immediate complications and long-term morbidity related to the donor site. Results: The study comprised 71 patients. Immediate postoperative complications were limited to 1 (1%) hematoma that required drainage, 2 (3%) seromas, and 5 (7%) cases of cellulitis that required oral antibiotics. Questionnaire response rate was 77%, with a mean follow-up of 25 months. Of the responders, 22 (40%) reported mild symptoms, 3 (5%) reported clinically significant symptoms related to the donor leg, and 7 (13%) expressed dissatisfaction because of unacceptable cosmesis (n = 5), leg discomfort (n = 5), or both. Conclusion: There was little immediate postoperative morbidity. Although many patients may be expected to report long-term symptoms related to the donor leg, these symptoms are generally mild, and the incidence of patient dissatisfaction is relatively low.

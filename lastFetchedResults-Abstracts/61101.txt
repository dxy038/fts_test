In this paper, a fuzzy adaptive internal model controller (FAIMC) for open-loop stable plants is presented. The control scheme consists of two parts: a fuzzy dynamic model and a model-based fuzzy controller. A fuzzy dynamic model, which serves as the internal model of the FAIMC is identified online by using the input and output measurement of the plant. Based on the identified fuzzy model, the fuzzy controller is designed to minimize an H2 performance objective. This FAIMC scheme has been successfully applied to control the flow rate in a laboratory-scale process control unit from Bytronic. The experimental results demonstrate that this class of control scheme is appropriate for control of time-varying stable plants with time delay. The control system is also shown to possess satisfactory robust performance.

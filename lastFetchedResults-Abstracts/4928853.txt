As cement operations rely deeply on low voltage electrical motors, the introductions of new technologies which target motor performance have a direct impact on energy management, commissioning time and maintenance costs. Since an intelligent motor control center integrates process control with smart motor devices (e.g., motor protection relays, smart circuit breakers and variable speed drives), it addresses savings and delivers better performance in energy intensive applications. Networking allows for easy monitoring of critical data of each motor or load connected to the intelligent motor control center, enabling precise process control at all times. With this information, plant staff can respond to potential problems proactively. Real-time access to information and records of last faults allow for simplified diagnostics and reduced downtime. However, the intelligent motor control center concept isnÂ´t a new approach. Networked protection relays and smart devices are mature technologies with consolidated industry acceptance and their benefits already well known. The objective of this paper is to explore new possibilities, technologies and trends for intelligent motor control centers and their devices.

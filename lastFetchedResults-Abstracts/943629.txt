Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the albumin in clinical function after acute intracerebral hemorrhage.
Subjects and Methods: The study was a double-blind clinical trial in two group of patient with  hemorrhagic stroke, including those with stroke occurred in the last 24 hours. The first group treated with albumin infusion with total dose of 1 g/Kg body weight for two hours per day and the second group was treated with normal saline with the same dose. The treatment duration was 7 days. Functional outcome of the first day, 8th days and 3 months after treatment were investigated on the basis of NIHSS. By Chi square and T-Test tatistical analyses and evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention in the two groups were studied.
Results: Each arm of study contained 30 patients. Both groups were the similar in age, sex and risk factors. There were not significant difference in mortality rate) P=0.353(, hospitalization duration )P=0.343( and hematoma size before )P=0.596( and after )P=0.483( treatment in two groups. NIHSS of the first day )P=0.474( and after 3 months )P=0.095 following treatment did not show significant differences among both groups. However, the result at the 8th day of treatment showed significant differences (P=0.025). 
Conclusion: The findings of this study confirmed that, intravenous albumin used in the initial days in the patient with hemorrhagic stroke would improve short-term clinical and functional outcome, but this positive effect is diminished in the long-term.

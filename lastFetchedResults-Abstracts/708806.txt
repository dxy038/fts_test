Background and Objective: Chronic hyperlipidemia accompanies various complications in the body. With regard to protective and beneficial effect of carnosine in metabolic disorders, this study was conducted to evaluate its effect on serum lipids and blood pressure in an experimental model of hyperlipidemia in mice. 

Materials and Methods: Mice were divided into five groups, i.e. control, high-dose carnosine-treated control, hyperlipidemic, and two carnosine-treated (125 and 250 mg/kg) hyperlipidemic groups. Carnosine was administered i.p. from 8th week after hyperlipidemia induction for 4 weeks. 

Results: Carnosine did not cause any significant reduction of serum glucose, there was a significant increase in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride in hyperlipidemic group as compared to control (p < 0.05-0.01) and carnosine at a high dose significantly decreased it (p < 0.05). Regarding serum HDL cholesterol, carnosine treatment did not significantly change it. In contrast, hyperlipidemia significantly increased LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.05) and carnosine at a dose of 250 mg/kg significantly lowered it (p < 0.05). In addition, hyperlipidemic mice has a significantly higher systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) and carnosine treatment did not significantly change it.

Conclusion: Administration of carnosine to hyperlipidemic mice does not affect serum glucose level and systolic blood pressure and significantly lowers serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride level.

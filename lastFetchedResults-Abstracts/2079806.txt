The objective of the present study was scale construction and validation for evaluation of professor's
performance. This is a combined study based on the Delphi technique. The population included all professors of
Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences. The population was also related to the questionnaire
implementation for standardization of all students in the Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences. A total of
30 faculty members in Bandar Abbas University of Medical Sciences were selected as elites of the project. For
standardization, 200 students were selected with the random sampling method. In the first step, the 30 experts
who were members of focal groups were asked to design suitable questions or statements. After classification
and removal of similar items, the number of statements reached 393. In the third step, the statements were given
to the executive team for analysis in order to select the best and most complete items. Thus, the number of items
was reduced to 150. In this dimension, each expert selected the best five statements in each index from his/her
viewpoint. The statements that were most frequent in the index were selected. Finally, the total number of
statements reached 26 statements in eight subscales. Based on the results, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was
obtained 0.85 for the total scale, 0.69 for the use of a variety of teaching methods, 0.72 for exercise preparation,
0.76 for establishing a positive classroom atmosphere, 0.65 for expression of problem solving strategies, 0.78
for classroom management techniques, 0.71 for focusing on the course, 0.72 for maintaining appropriate
classroom behaviors suitable for faculty members, and 0.64 for questioning skills. The Root Mean Square Error
of Approximation (RMSEA) was obtained 0.08 which indicates almost perfect fit of the model.

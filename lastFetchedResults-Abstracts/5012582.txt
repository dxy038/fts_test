Our objective is to develop generalized principles for grid operations centers that can be applied to specific domains. We focus on the domain of wireless telecommunications NOCs (WNOCs) as a starting point in this process. To address this problem, we focus specifically on the knowledge requirements for service-based decision support within wireless telecommunications. We use a Mission-Policy-Metrics-Sensor management control feedback model and associated influence diagrams to show how an integrated NOC can be developed from the constituent wireless NOCs (WNOCs). We derive metrics for the various WNOCs, which, in turn, drive data, model, user interface, and agent requirements for a decision environment that can support integrated customer service. By concentrating on a knowledge-based view of WNOCs, we provide a methodology for integrating existing grid-based operations centers.

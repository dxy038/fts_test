This paper presents an algorithm for solving the multi-objective reactive power dispatch problem in a power system. Modal analysis of the system is used for static voltage stability assessment. Loss minimization and maximization of voltage stability margin are taken as the objectives. Generator terminal voltages, reactive power generation of the capacitor banks and tap changing transformer setting are taken as the optimization variables. League championship algorithm (LCA) inspired from the competition of sport teams in a sport league, an algorithm is presented for solving constrained optimization problems. A number of individuals (solutions) as sport teams compete in an artificial league for several weeks (iterations). Based on the league schedule in each week, teams play in pairs and their game outcome is determined in terms of win or loss, given known the playing strength (fitness value) along with the teamsâ€™ intended formations. Modeling an artificial match analysis, each team devises a new formation/ playing strategy (a new solution) for the next week contest and this process is repeated for a number of seasons (stopping condition). In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, it has been tested on IEEE 30 bus system and compared to other algorithms reported those before in literature. Results show that HS is more efficient than others for solution of single-objective ORPD problem.

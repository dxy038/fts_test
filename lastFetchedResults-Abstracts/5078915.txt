The objective of this paper is to combine the antenna downtilt selection with the cell size selection in order to reduce the overall radio frequency (RF) transmission power in the homogeneous High-Speed Packet Downlink (HSDPA) cellular radio access network (RAN). The analysis is based on the concept of small cells deployment. The energy consumption ratio (ECR) and the energy reduction gain (ERG) of the cellular RAN are calculated for different antenna tilts when the cell size is being reduced for a given user density and service area. The results have shown that a suitable antenna tilt and the RF power setting can achieve an overall energy reduction of up to 82.56%. Equally, our results demonstrate that a small cell deployment can considerably reduce the overall energy consumption of a cellular network.

Two-way relaying can considerably improve spectral efficiency in relay-assisted bidirectional communications. However, the benefits and flexible structure of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based two-way relay systems is much less exploited. Moreover, most of existing works have not considered quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for two-way relaying. In this paper, we consider the OFDM-based bidirectional transmission where a pair of users exchange information via the assistance of a decode-and-forward (DF) relay. Each user can communicate with the other via three transmission modes: direct transmission, one-way relaying, and two-way relaying. We jointly optimize the transmission policies, including power allocation, transmission mode selection, and subcarrier assignment in order to maximize the weighted sum rates of the two users with diverse QoS guarantees. This is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. By using the dual method, we efficiently solve the problem in an asymptotically optimal manner. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme can substantially improve system performance compared with conventional schemes. A number of interesting insights are also obtained via comprehensive simulations.

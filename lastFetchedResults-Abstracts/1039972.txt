Material selection is a complex process, since the process includes many criteria, determination of criteria weight and the most important factor is that the selection of appropriate criterion. The last factor indicates that the criterion must be selected in a manner, such that the selection based upon the known material parameters and the requirements of the application. Therefore the material selection can be done using MCDM (Multi Criterion Decision Making) methods. Since the inputs provided by the decision maker in linguistic manner, there is a possible chance of getting incomplete problems. So in order to overcome the problem, the inputs could be provided as fuzzy numbers. Since fuzzy set represents the uncertainty in human perceptions. In this paper, VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje in Serbian, means Multicriteria Optimisation and Compromise Solution) has been used a MCDM tool for the selection of alternate material for instrument panel used in electric car and in order to evaluate this selection process in fuzzy environment, fuzzy based VIKOR is used. In addition to the fuzzy VIKOR method, the environmental impacts are also considered and compared for the four materials. The results achieved in both the assessment, showed that Polypropylene could be an alternate material for the instrument panel. The objective of this study is to develop a rational method to select the best material for an application based upon known material parameters and the requirements of the application.

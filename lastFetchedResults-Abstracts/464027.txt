OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine the efficacy of laser vaporization of the ovarian surface in polycystic ovary disease to reduce repeated ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and thereby improve pregnancy outcome.
STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six infertile patients with polycystic ovary disease who previously had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after stimulation with humam menopausal gonadotropin and who failed to conceive were studied. All patients were treated by potassium titanyl phosphate and neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser and evaluated. Patients not ovulatng spontaneously after vaporization were treated with either clomiphene citrate or human menopausal gonadotropin.
RESULTS: After vaporization spontaneous ovulation was confirmed six patients. For ovulation induction three patients received clomiphene citrate and 17 received human menopausal gonadotropin. Of the patients treated with human menopausal gonadotropin, mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was found in three patients, and the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome decreased significantly. Pregnancy was confirmed in 19 of 26 patients.
CONCLUSION: Laser vaporization is promising for the prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and improving pregnancy outcome in patients with polycystic ovary disease who have previously had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

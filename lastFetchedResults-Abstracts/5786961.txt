Along with shortage of the international energy situation day by day and renewable energy source generating whose cost gradual reduce, the wind power generation already became essential important measure and the way to solve the global energy question. But the wind power generation is one kind of high risk domains, is also one kind of innovative investment behaviors. This article according to the characteristic of the wind power generation, propose the improvement BP neural network assessment method, and establish the multi-objective decision making quality synthetic evaluation model and use the fuzzy theory to carry on quality synthetic evaluation to the wind power generation project reasonably. At the same time, this article in view of wind power generationÂ´s particularity and the uncertainty, propose the practical and feasible management suggeste, thus guarante that the enterprise avoids the risk and obtain the high quota profit.

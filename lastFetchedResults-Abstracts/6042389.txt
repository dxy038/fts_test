The objective of this work is to utilize neural network resources to determine the electrical characteristics of the ground. The data processing of the input and output is done by calculating the field strength of the surface wave, using the Bremmer and Van der Pol equations, to train a neural network simulator. From the results of the measurement of electric field strength of the outskirts of Belem and rural area, using radio stations with medium wave as transmitters, the following values of the ground parameters were found: 1.4 mS/m for conductivity and 15 for relative permittivity

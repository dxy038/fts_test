One of the important stages of spatial planning is determination of required area (demand) for different land use types. In order to achieve that, political and administrative divisions are generally considered as demand units and the area required per unit is calculated using statistical regression methods, socio-economic models or multi-objective programming methods. In this paper, considering political and administrative divisions as well as capabilities and potentials of the study area, homogeneous administrative-environmental units were defined as smaller demand units. After that, the demand for agricultural products calculated using multi-objective programming method that includes two objectives, five constraints and twenty-two variables. The developed model implemented for estimating the demand for agricultural products for part of Isfahan province for the year 1394, using GAMS 23.7 and ArcGIS 10. In order to evaluate the demand unit, homogeneous administrative-environmental units as a type of disaggregated demand unit were compared with two aggregated demand units including rural district and geographical coverage of the population points. The obtained results indicated higher priority of  disaggregated units than aggregated ones and  showed that in order to more accurately determine the demand of land use types, there is a need to use disaggregated demand units with considering capabilities and potentials of the study area.

OBJECTIVE: We examined nutritional issues, assessment, and intervention strategies for patients with cancer.

METHODS: Reviews of practice guidelines and published reports were used to identify nutritional issues and strategies that can benefit patients with cancer.

RESULTS: Assessment tools such as the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment are useful in terms of identifying patients with nutrition issues and guiding intervention. However, quality of life and other measures should also be considered. There is a need for early and ongoing nutrition interventions.

CONCLUSIONS: Encourage patients to try a new food or supplement on days when they are not receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy because it may result in better tolerance. Screen patients to determine their nutritional status. Closely monitor changes in weight, food intake, and symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Refer to a registered dietitian for a complete nutrition assessment and individualized counseling.

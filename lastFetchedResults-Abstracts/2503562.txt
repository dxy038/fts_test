The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of computer assisted instruction (CAI) on creativity, metacognition and academic performance on psychology students of Zarand Azad University in second term of 1391. For this reason of 1500 students, 32 psychology students were randomly selected and divided into two groups upon even and odd of students' numbers. 15 members were placed in traditional education group and the others students were set in Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) group. At first, two groups were asked to take a pretest by using the Torrance creativity questionnaire (1986); after 16 sessions of traditional education and Computer-Assisted training, a post test was taken, too. The final scores of motivation and emotion were used for academic performance examination. The data was then analyzed by using SPSS19. Research findings collected by independent t test to measure academic performance between two groups, and covariance analysis for effectiveness of the creativity components showed that computer assisted instruction had a considerable impact on creativity; although, significant difference wasn't observed in the academic performance of two groups. Moreover, the results showed that both traditional instruction and computer assisted instruction were effective on students' academic performance; while in the traditional teaching method, students had less impact on creativity. Accordingly, the computer assisted instruction method probably was more practical, and student engagement with the subject and allocating sufficient time for learning computer-assisted instruction were more objective. In addition, further studies with larger sample size and examining other related variables were suggested.

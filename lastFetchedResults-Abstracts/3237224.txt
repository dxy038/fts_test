IEEE 802.22 is proposed for reusing the TV channels with cognitive radio technology to build Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRANs). The cellular topology of a WRAN makes the spectrum management easy. However, this topology reduces the network capacity significantly, because in one slot only one user can be allocated with a channel. Therefore, Peer-toPeer WRAN (P2PWRAN) is proposed, in which direct CPE(Consumer Premises Equipment)-to-CPE intra-cell communication is supported. While increasing the network capacity significantly, reducing the total energy consumption is a challenge.The energy efficiency of nodes in the standard for WRAN is difficult to improve, since the transmission distance of nodes to the BS is relatively static. P2PWRAN enables to achieve higher energy efficiency through better possibilities of channel allocation. Channel allocation influences energy consumption and network capacity significantly. Channel allocation also affects the upper layers, for example the routing protocol. Therefore, guaranteeing the network performance and fairness amongst CPEs, while achieving green networks, needs cross-layer design. In this paper, we define the channel allocation problem in P2PWRAN and we recognize it as a Multi-objective Quadratic Programming (MOQP) problem. An Energy-aware Channel Allocation (ECA) algorithm is proposed for exploiting the P2PWRAN paradigm to achieve the lower communication energy consumption and higher network energy efficiency and throughput than simple greedy policies. ECA jointly considers the network layer and Media Access Control (MAC) layer. By controlling the parameters in ECA, the fairness of channel allocation can also be guaranteed.

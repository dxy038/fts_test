In this paper a method based on combining adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) and genetic algorithm (GA) is applied for design and optimization of a circularly polarized microstrip antenna for L<sub>1</sub> frequency band of GPS. In design process, trained ANFISs are used for estimating return loss and axial ratio. In optimization process, a proper objective function is defined and minimized with GA in order to obtain optimum physical parameters. The optimization method is much faster than conventional optimization methods. Both simulation and measurement results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the method.

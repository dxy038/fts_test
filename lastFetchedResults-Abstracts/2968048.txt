The objective of our research is to develop computer based tools to automate the clinical evaluation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). The paper describes a set of solutions to support all the aspects regarding the standard procedures of the diagnosis in neurophysiology. More specifically, the paper focuses on the description of an approach to automate the process carried out by the physician when an EEG register has to be used to obtain a diagnostic of a patient. Two main lines have been established. The first one deals with the development of support tools to aid in the technical aspects of the process: data acquisition, data compression and brain map representation. The second line is focused on the classification and learning of neurophysiological signals. A classical approach has been successfully applied to the problem of brain maturation classification

The main objective of the present paper is to study the condition of ethical
functions of university during the domination of advanced capitalism. The term
advanced capitalism is used to describe economic condition of Western societies
during the recent decades. The main hypothesis of the present paper is that capitalism,
particularly during the past few decades, has left an adverse impact on the
ethical functions of university. By ethical function we mean sublimation of human
being as a spiritual being and also promotion of social justice. The ethical functions
of university have been analyzed from six perspectives, i.e., idealism, liberalism,
Marxism, feminism and racial, existentialism, and postmodernism and finally a
synthetic approach has been proposed. The findings of the present paper show that
during era of advanced capitalism there has been an ethical decline of university
in different respects. The findings of the present paper also indicate that the ethical
decline of university in the era of advanced capitalism has its roots in the following
factors: expansion of class relations and creation of inequality; application of
knowledge as an instrument for the domination of interest groups; expansion of
gender and racial inequality; and finally, ignorance of the sublime and spiritual
aspects of human being and considering him as a thing or a professional workforce
and ultimately alienation.

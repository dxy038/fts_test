Objective (s): The potential adverse effect of satellite jamming, as an environmental factor on people’s health has been a question and a cause of concern in recent years. This article is aimed to shade light on some scientific and practical aspects of the topic. 
Methods: In view of the nature of the question, scientific sources regarding how to investigate causal relationship between an exposure and health damage and related research principles were examined. 
Results: The necessity for safety of the exposures, the type of studies required to answer the question, the principles that should be considered, doing scientifically accepted studies on the subject and existing problems, diversity of potential outcomes, the possibility that some outcomes being neglected, necessity of the exposure, the scope of the exposure, the duration and intensity of the exposure, the age of those who are exposed, and the need to comply with the principles of research ethics concerning exposures and related studies are discussed.
Conclusion: There is need to provide evidence for the "safety" of satellite jamming. Otherwise deciding to continue satellite jamming might have severe adverse effect on people’s health.

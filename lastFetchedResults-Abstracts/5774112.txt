A modular reconfigurable robot system has the advantage to provide an optimal robot configuration for a specific task. With fewer modules and degrees of freedom (DOFs), a modular robot would have a simple configuration, high loading capacity, and low power consumption rate, so that it can perform the task effectively. A weighted sum of the number and types of modules is chosen as the objective function. Two three-legged reconfigurable parallel robot configurations are actually built according to the proposed design procedure.

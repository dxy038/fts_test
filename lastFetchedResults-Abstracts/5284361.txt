The paper introduces Multi-Tiered Tournament Selection. Traditional tournament selection algorithms are appropriate for single objective optimization problems but are too limited for the multi-objective task of evolving complete recognition systems. Recognition systems need to be accurate as well as small to improve generalization performance. Multi-tiered Tournament Selection is shown to improve search for smaller neural network recognition systems

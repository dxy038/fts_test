One of the mostly used enhanced oil recovery methods is the injection of water or gas under
pressure to maintain or reverse the declining pressure in a reservoir. Several parameters should be
optimized in a fluid injection process. The usual optimizing methods evaluate several scenarios to
find the best solution. Since it is required to run the reservoir simulator hundreds of times, the
process is very time consuming and cumbersome. In this study a new intelligent method of
optimization, called “global dynamic harmony search” is used with some modifications in
combination with a commercial reservoir simulator (ECLIPSE®) to determine the optimum solution
for fluid injection problem unknowns. Net present value (NPV) is used as objective function to be
maximized. First a simple homogeneous reservoir model is used for validating the developed
method and then the new optimization method is applied to a real model of one of the Iran oil
reservoirs. Three strategies, including gas injection, water injection, and well placement are
considered. Comparing the values of NPV and field oil efficiency (FOE) of gas injection and water
injection strategies, it is concluded that water injection strategy surpasses its rival. Considering
water injection to be the base case, a well placement optimization is also done and best locations for
water injection wells are proposed. The results show the satisfying performance of the algorithm
regarding its low iterations.

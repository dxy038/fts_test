This study suggests a new stochastic framework based on point estimate method to capture the uncertainty associated with the forecast error of the active and reactive loads and failure rate and repair rate values. The objective functions to be investigated are system interruption frequency index, system average interruption duration index and average energy not supplied. Meanwhile, since the total MW cost is an attractive issue to the power utilities, the active power losses is also considered as an objective function. In order to explore the problem search space globally, a novel self-adaptive modification method based on firefly algorithm is proposed. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are examined on the IEEE 34-bus test system. According to the simulation results, the proposed framework based on capacitor placement problem can improve the reliability of the system effectively.

This paper discusses the method used to measure the torque ripple in a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). This paper covers the design criteria required to measure the torque ripple generated by the motor. The ripple contribution from the controller is eliminated in the proposed measurement procedure. The effect of the coupling stiffness, flywheel inertia and load motor torque pulsation effect are addressed in this paper. In applications where the performance requirements are stringent, accurate torque ripple measurement at rated motor current is an essential objective at the end of the motor production process. Experimental results are included to illustrate the findings

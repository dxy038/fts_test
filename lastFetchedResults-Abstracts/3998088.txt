In this paper, an image interpolation method based on even-odd decomposition (EOD) is proposed. An input signal for interpolation is decomposed to even and odd vectors by EOD. And then different interpolation methods are applied to even and odd vectors, respectively. This paper presents an analysis on the two vectors and new design methods for them. Also, based on the new design method, a signal flow graph of the proposed method is provided and compared with the CCI method in terms of complexity. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct experiments and complexity comparison. The results indicate that the proposed interpolation method does not only outperform the existing method in terms of objective and subjective image quality but also requires less complexity.

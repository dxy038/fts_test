Energy demands are exponentially increasing and are expected to do so in the future. Thus, the challenge is to continue supplying energy to the society in an economically viable way while minimising the impact on the environment. This is one of the main concerns that societies are facing and it was the “leitmotif” of The Energy and Environment Knowledge Week (E2KW 2013) Conference that was held on November 20–22, 2013 at University of Castilla-La Mancha in Toledo, Spain. The event was organized by its Energy and Environment Science and Technology Campus of International Excellence with the objective of integrating cutting-edge research on energy and environmental fields from all different areas of knowledge.

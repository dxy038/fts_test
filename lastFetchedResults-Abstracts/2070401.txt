Background and Objectives: Increasing waste tiers production has made the recycling of this solid waste a critical issue in the world. On the other hand, it seems contamination of groundwater to the petroleum pollutant like gasoline is a great threat to the health of societies in developing countries. The main objective of this study was gasoline removal from aquatic environment by waste tire derived activated carbon.
Materials and Methods: In this study for preparation of activated carbon from waste tires, KOH was used for chemical activation process. We used argon gas to prevent precursor oxidation . We applied N2 gas and BET isotherm for characterization of the prepared activated carbon texture. Isothermal and kinetic models were used for defining gasoline adsorption characteristic to adsorbent, and thermodynamic studies were used to determine the effect of temperature.
Results: Characterization results revealed that SBET and VTOTAL were 111.702m2/g and 0.124cc/g respectively. Langmuir and pseudo-second order models were the best isotherm and kinetic models for prediction of the adsorbent behaviors to adsorb gasoline. The Gibbs free energy changes were negative at all temperatures applied.
Conclusion: Produced activated carbon has desired surface area and adsorptive capacity for gasoline adsorption in aquatic environments and it seems preparation activated carbon from waste tiers is cheap, effective and environment friendly.

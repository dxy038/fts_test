The talk will focus on two aspects - redefining the software engineering to be suitable for a global supply chain optimisation and creating the right talent for meeting this new world paradigm. Adequacy of the current software engineering processes from meeting the global way of doing this is a related aspect. TodayÂ´s frameworks such as ISO/ CMMi are not inclusive. They look at part of the supply chain. And redefining this is key to future success. Predictable quality - defined as meeting business objective without fail will be the future direction. And vendors are only part of this. It is time for the software engineering world to step back and re-look at the way software engineering is been defined now. The ability to mix art and science is the key to create the process that will tap in to the creativity that is not constrained and at the same time have the rigor of a six sigma manufacturing.

Background and Objective: Diabetes mellitus accompanies increased malondialdehyde as a marker of oxidative stress and increased serum level of aspartate and alanine aminotranferase due to tissue damage. Due to antidiabetic effect of hesperetin, this study was done to evaluate its effect on level of these factors in diabetes.

Materials and Methods: Male rats (n = 32) were divided into control, treated control, diabetic, and treated diabetic groups. For induction of diabetes, streptozotocin at a dose of 60 mg/kg (i.p) was injected. Hesperetin was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks one week post-experiment. Serum levels of aspartate and alanine aminotranferase were measured before the study and at the end of the study. In addition, level of malondialdehyde (MDA)' was measured in liver and heart tissues.

Results: A significant increase in serum level of aspartate and alanine aminotranferase (p<0.05-0.01) was observed in diabetic rats and hesperetin treatment significantly reduced only serum level of alanine aminotranferase (p<0.05). In addition, diabetes was followed by increased level of MDA in liver and heart tissues (p<0.01) and hesperetin treatment significantly reduced MDA level in these tissues (p<0.05).

Conclusion: Treatment with hesperetin could attenuate serum level of alanine aminotranferase and oxidative stress in hepatic and cardiac tissues, as indicated by a lower tissue level of MDA.

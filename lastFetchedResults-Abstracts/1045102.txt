This work deals with a closed-loop thermal control problem using a low order model built from experimental data. A metallic plate is heated on one side by a radiative heat source and cooled on the other side by a rack of fans. The heat source is able to move in both directions along the plate. Starting from a steady state corresponding to a nominal configuration of heat power, source position and ventilation level, the objective is to control temperature at 3 chosen points on the rear side when the nominal ventilation level is perturbed. The actuators are the heat source power and its displacements. The originality of this work is threefold: (i) a low order model allows performing state feedback control in real time (Î”t = 2 s) through a Linear Quadratic Gaussian compensator, (ii) the model is identified from experimental data using the Modal Identification Method and (iii) a single heat source with 3 degrees of freedom is used to control temperature at 3 distinct positions. Both thermal regulation and tracking problems have been addressed. The effect of the control time period and the control parameters, have also been investigated. Results show promising future developments involving more actuators and controlled outputs.

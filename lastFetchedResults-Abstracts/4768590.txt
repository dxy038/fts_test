This paper describes a project being launched by the Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA) in collaboration with the Organisation of Energy Planning (OEP) with funds from UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) and GEF (Global Environment Facility) and the Egyptian Government. The overall objective of this project is to assist Egypt in reducing the long-term growth of greenhouse gas emissions from electric power generation and from consumption of nonrenewable fuel resources. In responding to the operating conditions, public and private industry must invest in process modifications and new machinery to remain competitive, with excellent likelihood that their investments will have favourable rates of return based on savings from reduced operating costs. The funding for this project will leverage the new investments in ways that are most beneficial to the global environment

The criteria determining the electric power system (EPS) management efficiency are electricity tariffs, damages due to interruption in power supply of consumers, fixed costs on energy production and variable costs, which characterize primarily the cost of primary energy resources used. The objective is to devise or improve the criteria, algorithms and standards for provision of the maximum efficiency of joint work, enhancement of validity of the EPS reliability solutions in the competitive market conditions on the base of analysis of joint operation of economically independent EPSs. This model is applied for optimization of conditions caused by both an emergency situation in a parallel operating EPS and several coincident emergencies in different parts of the interconnection. This is a valuable property of the model, as it allows elaboration of sufficiently universal strategies practical for any situation. In the considered situations it is also necessary to retain contract power supply from some systems to others. It can be done by fixing in the model the power flow along the corresponding tie lines at the pre-emergency or reduced (depending on the contract terms) level

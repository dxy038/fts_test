We describe a testing framework that can provide online estimates of audio and video call quality on network paths, without requiring either end-user involvement or prior availability of audio/video sequences or network traces. The framework includes a tool that emulates the audio and video traffic of IP calls and employs an extended E-Model to measure the audio quality and VQM to estimate video quality. Additionally, it can emulate network impairments to run experiments in different network conditions. Our experiment results show that the quality measurements acquired using the framework compare well to the most commonly applied industry standard for objective voice and video offline testing-PESQ and PSNR respectively.

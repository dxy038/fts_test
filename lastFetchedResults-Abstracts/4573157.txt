Real-time networks for substations automation systems are based on ICT technologies and they may take great advantages from ultra recent network technological improvements. A careful evaluation of the performance enhancement is required. Due to cost and system complexity, such an analysis can be performed only using a dedicated simulation environment, but the currently available simulation libraries are not focused on lower layers (L1, PHY, and L2 MAC). The main objective of this work is to introduce the architecture of a modular network simulator, with suitable models of L1 and L2 Ethernet layers, for the simulation and co-simulation of substation automation Real-time Ethernet networks. The modular simulator includes interfaces for both co-simulation with FPGA-hardware board and real network, and co-simulation with automation application software (e.g. IEC61850 SCADA system, etc.).

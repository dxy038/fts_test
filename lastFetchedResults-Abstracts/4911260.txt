This demonstration presents a complete system that automatically structures TV streams. The objective is to precisely and automatically determine the start and the end of broadcasted television programs. The extracted programs can then be stored in a database to be used in novel services such as TV-on-demand. The system first detects inter-programs as repeated sequences in the broadcasted stream, and then deduce the boundaries of programs. This demonstration shows results on real TV streams.

For underwater applications and manufacture of AUV Sonar, large areas of piezoelectric materials with very good electromechanical properties are often needed. Although piezoelectric single crystals (typically the compositions PMN-PT or PZN-PT [Jaffe et al., 1971 ] are high-performance materials (high yields), but are difficult to manufacture maintaining homogeneous properties in large areas. To overcome this problem, this article will be conducted with the use of a finite-element code (ATILA) in order to model the electrical comportment of single crystal transducer. The main objective is to consider the evolution of these characteristics when different parameters change, as modification of the thickness or of the material, addition of a fluid domain ... In article, to show the good performance of our approach, we performed an admittance comparison versus all parameter modifications. The results confirm the good fit between our optimized models and experimental results.

Objective
luate how parents and physicians perceive the utility of a comprehensive, electronic previsit screener, and to assess its impact on the visit.
s
d methods design was used. English-speaking parents were recruited from 3 primary care systems (urban MD and rural NY and VT) when they presented for a well-child visit with a child 4 to 10 years of age. Parents completed an electronic previsit screen, which included somatic concerns, health risks, and 4 mental health tools (SCARED5, PHQ-2, SDQ Impact, and PSC-17). Parents completed an exit survey, and a subset were interviewed. All primary care providers (PCPs) were interviewed.
s
l of 120 parents and 16 PCPs participated. The exit surveys showed that nearly 90% of parents agreed or strongly agreed that the screener was easy to use and maintained confidentiality. During interviews, parents noted that the screener helped with recall, validated concerns, reframed issues they thought might not be appropriate for primary care, and raised new questions. PCPs thought that the screener enabled them to normalize sensitive issues, and it permitted them to simultaneously focus and be comprehensive during the visit. Parents and PCPs agreed that the screener helped guide discussion, promoted in-depth exchange, and increased efficiency. Findings were consistent across quantitative and qualitative methods and between parents and PCPs.
sions
rehensive electronic previsit screening tool is an acceptable and practical strategy to facilitate well-child visits. It may help with problem identification as well as with setting agendas, engaging the family, and balancing attention between somatic and psychosocial concerns.

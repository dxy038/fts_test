This paper proposes a human interface to search and draw an image which is in a user´s mind, as a concrete cartoon. In order to realize the human interface, we have made a computer model which searches for an objective image in a user´s psychometrical space. IGA (interactive genetic algorithm) has been applied to searching for the objective image. Furthermore, the fuzzy reasoning has been adopted to assign the fitness in the IGA. The fuzzy reasoning has been executed in the psychometrical space and the fitness has been obtained from the result of the fuzzy reasoning. Therefore, the user´s load has been reduced very much and his sense has been reflected on the fitness assignment process as well.

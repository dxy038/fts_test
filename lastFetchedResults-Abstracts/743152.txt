Objective: To assess the clinical outcome of successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in patients with poor ventricular function. Methods: Analysis of angiographic, echocardiographic and clinical records of patients with severe LV dysfunction who underwent PTCA from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1997 was undertaken. Forty-one patients aged 63±10 years, 36 men, all with significant coronary artery disease and impaired LV function (fractional shortening, FS≤20%) were identified. Patients’ data before and after angioplasty were analyzed. Results: Post PTCA: angiographic success was 95.2%. Major complications occurred in 19.5% and hospital mortality was 2.7%. At 6 months after PTCA:LV fractional shortening (FS) increased from 15.9±3.4% to 19.6±6.6%, P=0.02 and consequently cardiac output from 4.28±0.98 to 5.34±1.77 l/min, P<0.01. Change in at least one class of angina and cardiac functional status was observed in 46% of patients, P<0.001, and this was maintained to the end of the year. After 12 months follow-up: restenosis occurred in 10.8%; mortality was 5.4%; event-free and actuarial survivals were 62.3% and 91.9%, respectively. Conclusions: In patients with severe LV dysfunction, continued symptomatic improvement can be achieved with successful coronary angioplasty. This is associated with significant recovery of LV systolic function and cardiac output. In order to minimize procedure-related complications, careful patient selection should be considered.

In complex forging processes, it is essential to "nd the optimal deformation path and the optimal preform
shape that will lead to the desired "nal shape and service properties. A sensitivity analysis and optimization
for preform billet shape in thermo-mechanical coupled simulation is developed in this work. Non-linear
sensitivity analysis of temperatures, #ow-stresses, strains and strain-rates are presented with respect to
design variables. Both analytical and "nite-di!erence gradients are employed to validate the e!ectiveness
of sensitivity analysis developed in this work. Numerous iterations of coupled thermo-mechanical analysis
are performed to determine an optimum preform shape based on a given criterion of minimizing the
objective function on e!ective strain variance within the "nal forging. The design constraints are imposed
on die under"ll, material scrap, folding defects and temperatures. In addition, a method for material
data processing is given in order to determine the #ow stress and its derivatives. The shape optimization
scheme is demonstrated with the preform designs of an axisymmetric disk and a plane strain problem.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Seizure is an important symptom of epilepsy and many other neurogenic disorders. Despite a variety of current anti-convulsive drugs, research for discovering new drugs with more efficacy and less unsuitable adverse effects has been continued. Herbal medicine has various natural substances and proper context for this type of research. The aim of this study was to survey the anticonvulsant effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of rue (Ruta graveolens) in male mice.
METHODS: In this experimental study anticonvulsant effect of extract evaluated by PTZ induced seizure. Fifty-six NMRI mice in the range of 25-35 gr were divided to 7 groups of 8 mice that included five cases, one positive control group and one negative control group. Case groups have been injected by 100, 300, 500, 800 and 1000 mg/kg of extracts, positive control group 40 ml/kg phenobarbital and negative control group 10 ml/kg normal saline intraperitoneally. All groups were injected by pentylenetetrazole (80mg/kg) intraperitoneally after 45 minutes, and initiation time of myocolonic and tonic-colonic seizures and rate of 24 hours death were measured.
FINDINGS: Consequences of different doses of rue hydro-alcoholic extract increased delay in initiation of myocolonic and tonic-colonic seizures rather than control group dose-dependently and reduced 24 hours seizure-induced mortality (p < 0.05). Delay in myocolonic seizures in doses of 300, 500, 800 and 1000 mg/kg (p < 0.001) and 100 mg/kg (p < 0.01) was significant in comparison with negative control group. Delay in tonic-colonic seizures in dose of 1000 mg/kg (p < 0.001) and doses of 300, 500 and 800 mg/kg (p < 0.05) was significant in comparison with negative control group. 
CONCLUSION: Regarding to our findings, it seems that extract of this herb has decremental effect on PTZ-induced seizure in male adult mice.

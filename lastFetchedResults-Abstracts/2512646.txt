<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To examine association between maternal socio-cultural status, as indicated by maternal Income, education and polygamy with severity of pre–eclampsia.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> This study was carried out in Primary Health Centers in Katsina, Adamawa and Borno States. A total of two groups of subjects were selected for the study, with 50 Subjects in each group. Group A - pregnant non hypertensive women; Group B women with pre-eclampsia. Blood pressure was measured in a sitting position with sphygmomanometer after at least 10 minutes of rest. A semi structured questionnaire was administered to each respondent. P value≤ 0.05 was accepted as significant difference.  <br /><strong>Results:</strong> Systolic and diastolic blood pressure BP was significantly different. (167.60±2.75 and 107.48±8.01 Vs. 116.70±0.98 and 76.80±8.67 in group B Vs. group A respectively, P&lt;0.05).<br />In Socio–cultural background significant correlation exists between pre–eclampsia and age at first marriage (P= 0.01). There also exists a correlation between age and number of marriages (P= 0.05). Age, parity, history of hypertension and number of marriages are negatively and significantly correlated with pre– eclampsia.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This study found that seclusion and polygamy are not risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia.</p>

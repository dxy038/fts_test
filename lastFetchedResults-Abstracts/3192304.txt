Unregulated PEV (Plug-in Electric Vehicle) charging will have great impact on current power grid system especially on the distribution transformer system. In our previous work, a PEV smart charging control strategy was proposed with the objective of minimizing residential distribution transformers loss of life leveraging a transformer thermal model. In this work, we validate and calibrate that transformer thermal model, through some testing campaigns conducted on an off-the-shelf transformer. The novelty of the presented experimental approach consists in measuring the oil temperature simulating the high voltage AC environment inside the transformer by means of a low voltage DC environment. This allows measuring the temperature through thermocouples. To this point, initial experiment tests for the top oil temperature measurement allowed us to validate the top oil thermal model. In the future, winding temperature will be measured and the charging strategy will be validated.

Objective: Pompe disease is a rare neuromuscular genetic disorder and is classified
into two forms of early and late-onset. Over the past two decades, mitochondrial abnormalities
have been recognized as an important contributor to an array of neuromuscular
diseases. We therefore aimed to compare mitochondrial copy number and mitochondrial
displacement-loop sequence variation in infantile and adult Pompe patients.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, the mitochondrial D-loop sequence
was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing to detect possible
variation in 28 Pompe patients (17 infants and 11 adults). Results were compared
with 100 healthy controls and sequences of all individuals were compared with the Cambridge
reference sequence. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mitochondrial DNA copy
number.
Results: Among 59 variants identified, 37(62.71%) were present in the infant group,
14(23.333%) in the adult group and 8(13.333%) in both groups. Mitochondrial copy
number in infant patients was lower than adults (P < 0.05). A significant frequency difference
was seen between the two groups for 12 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).
A novel insertion (317-318 ins CCC) was observed in patients and six SNPs were identified
as neutral variants in controls. There was an inverse association between mitochondrial
copy number and D-loop variant number (r=0.54).
Conclusion: The 317-318 ins CCC was detected as a new mitochondrial variant in
Pompe patients.

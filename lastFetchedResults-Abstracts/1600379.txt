In this paper, multi-item economic production quantity (EPQ) models with selling price dependent demand, infinite production rate, stock dependent unit production and holding costs are considered. Flexibility and reliability consideration are introduced in the production process. The models are developed under two fuzzy environments–one with fuzzy goal and fuzzy restrictions on storage area and the other with unit cost as fuzzy and possibility–necessity restrictions on storage space. The objective goal and constraint goal are defined by membership functions and the presence of fuzzy parameters in the objective function is dealt with fuzzy possibility/necessity measures. The models are formed as maximization problems. The first one—the fuzzy goal programming problem is solved using Fuzzy Additive Goal Programming (FAGP) and Modified Geometric Programming (MGP) methods. The second model with fuzzy possibility/necessity measures is solved by Geometric Programming (GP) method. The models are illustrated through numerical examples. The sensitivity analyses of the profit function due to different measures of possibility and necessity are performed and presented graphically.

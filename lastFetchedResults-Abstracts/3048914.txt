A non-digitized method based on correlation measurement is proposed for tracking multipath frequency hopping (FH) signals. By using the cross correlation of the received signals of two receiving elements and the power at each element in different hops, a nonlinear least square objective function is formulated to estimate the multipath directions. The Gauss-Newton method is applied to track the slowly changing directions. Only the power of the transmitted signal is required as a prior knowledge in the proposed method, and it is easy to implement because of its simple structure. Simulation results show the performance of the method.

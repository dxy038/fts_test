Based on DCMOGADES algorithm, a new channel assignment approach is proposed. The objective is to obtain a channel assignment scheme, which satisfies both the traffic demand requirements and electromagnetic compatibility constraints with a lower bound number of channels. The traffic demand requirements can be satisfied throughout the whole process of iteration, using the genetic-fix crossover and mutation operators we proposed, and effective selection and migration operators are also used. The results obtained by the simulation to some well-known benchmark problems show that our algorithm is a better approach for solving the channel assignment problem.

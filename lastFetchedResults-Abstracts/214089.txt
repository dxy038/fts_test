Objective:
Torticollis is a symptom that can be related to different pathological
mechanisms ranging from simple to life-threatening conditions. Here
we report a child with torticollis caused by a neuroenteric cyst in the
upper cervical region; this is a very rare condition in childhood and
in this case, it was successfully resolved by surgery.
Clinical presentation:
A 2.5 year old boy presented with a 2 month-history of torticollis, he
had developed paraparesia 2 weeks before admission. At examination
he was found to be quadriparetic. Radiographic study of the cervical
spine revealed widening of the cervical canal. Brain and spinal
magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hypointense lesion on the
T1 at the craniovertebral junction having a compressive effect on the
anterior aspect of the brain stem and spinal cord.
Intervention:
The patient underwent surgery. After craniotomy and opening of the
dura, a cystic lesion was seen; clear fluid was aspirated and the cyst
wall was removed.
Conclusion:
Considering the quadriparesis and torticollis, the patient improved
significantly within the first few days after surgery. No relapse of
symptoms occurred during the follow up period. This is the first case
report of a child in whom torticollis was due to a neuroenteric cyst
of the upper cervical intradural region.

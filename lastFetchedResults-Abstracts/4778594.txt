Architectures of avionics networks, such as that of the Airbus A380, currently know important evolutions. This is principally due to the increase in the complexity of the embedded systems, in term of rise in number of integrated functions and their connectivity. The evolution of switched Ethernet technologies allows their implementation as an avionics architecture (AFDX: avionics full duplex switched Ethernet). The problem is then to prove that no frame is lost by the network (no switch queue will overflow) and to evaluate the end-to-end transfer delay through the network. The objective of this paper is to present and shortly compare three methods for the evaluation of end-to-end delays: network calculus, queuing networks simulation and model checking

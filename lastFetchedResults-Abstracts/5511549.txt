In this paper we proposed a topology control algorithm for the single channel wireless mesh network with m directional antennas equipped on each node. The objective of our algorithm is to maximize the traffic delivery ratio from each non-gateway node to gateway nodes, by adjusting the orientations of the directional antennas appropriately. By allowing each antenna connecting to multiple nodes, our proposed algorithm improves traffic delivery ratio by 40%~280%, compared to previous work.

Background: Infected surfaces are a means of transporting infection, especially in health-care centers. Thus an appropriate sterilization method can help controlling hospital infection. In this study the antibacterial effect of Hydrogen peroxide and silver ions composition (H2O2 + Ag+) on growth inhibition of Escherichia Coli as well as Proteus Mirabilis and Klebsiella Pneumonia on a steel surface were tested.
Method: Initially we sterilized each 10-part bacterium, overall 30 steel surfaces using alcohol and fire. Then we contaminated the surfaces with a heavy suspension of aforementioned bacteria and contacted the H2O2+Ag+ solution (concentrations were 30 ppm ad 30 ppb respectively). After each step, bacterial cultures were performed on Eosin Methylen Blue (EMB) agar. Cultures were interpreted using Mc Nemar analysis method in 37O C after 24 h.  
Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant difference before and after performing H2O2+ Ag+ solution (P= 0.008 for E.coli, P=0.014 for Klebsiella, P=0.002 for Proteus). 
Conclusion: Previous studies focused mostly on Hydrogen peroxide vapor disinfection, but here we indicated its effect as a surface disinfectant in the form of solution and composition with silver, a heavy metal with antibacterial property. Our future objective is to evaluate the effect of such disinfectant in hospital and health-care centers that is underway.

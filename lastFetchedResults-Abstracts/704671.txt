In Togo, livestock represent an important part of the national and subsistence economies. The most prevalent zoonoses documented in Toga are brucellosis, tuberculosis, cysticercosis and rabies. The status of other zoonoses such as toxoplasmosis, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis and salmonellosis is not known. A national eradication programme has been instigated to reduce the transmission of rabies. Good relations exist between veterinary and health personnel in the field but this level of interaction is absent at district and national level. This has resulted in information not being transferred between the two disciplines and the lack of a national strategy for the eradication of zoonoses in Togo.

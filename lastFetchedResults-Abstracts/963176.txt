Background and purpose: Depression and social phobia are amongst common psychiatric
disorders. The main objective of this study was to study the relationship between social problem solving
with depression and social phobia among university students.
Materials and methods: In this descriptive correlational study, 403 (245 female and 158 male)
students were selected from Islamic Azad university, Azadshahr branch through stratified random
sampling method. In order to collect the data, we used The Social Problem Solving Inventory-Revised
(Short Form), Beck Depression Inventory, and Social Phobia Inventory. Data were analyzed using SPSS-
13, Pearson's correlation, t-test and ANNOVA.
Results: Data analysis showed significant relationship between social problem solving skills with
social phobia and depression (P < 0.001). Significant differences were found in social phobia and
depression among students with low, medium and high social problem solving skills. The students who
had high ability in solving social problems suffered less from depression and social phobia (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Social problem solving skills can decrease depression and social phobia among
university students. Therefore, teaching these skills could promote the level of mental health of university
students.

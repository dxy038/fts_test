This paper presents novel two-phase multi-objective evolutionary approaches for solving the optimal generation scheduling problem with environmental considerations. Two different multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) based on Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) and Archived Multi-objective Simulated Annealing (AMOSA) are presented in the paper. In the first phase, this approach formulates the hourly optimal generation scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization problem which simultaneously minimizes operation cost and emission, while satisfying constraints such as power balance, spinning reserve and power generation limits. Results of the first phase are compared and SPEA2, which provided better results, is used for the second phase to obtain the optimal schedules for the 24 hours. The minimum up/down time and ramp up/down rate constraints are incorporated in the second phase. A case study for a 10-unit test system is carried out to illustrate the application and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

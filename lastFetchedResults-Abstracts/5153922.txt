Transgenic mouse models are commonly used to investigate bone healing and test new treatments before human trials. The objective of this project was to design and produce a fracture device to overcome previous limitations including a low reproducible transverse fracture rate, two user operation and poor consistency over time from spring use. This was accomplished by using an easily modifiable kinetic energy level, a novel Mouse Positioning System and an electromagnet assembly. The data collected from the validation experiment was used in the development of a constitutive relationship between kinetic energy and fracture type. This design may be useful to researchers as a more efficient solution for creating reproducible transverse fractures in mice.

As the risk profile of patients considered for surgical revascularization worsens, the cumulative benefit of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) over conventional coronary artery bypass grafting, in terms of lower morbidity and reduced healthcare costs, may increase. There is still resistance to the introduction of OPCAB surgery however, its practice is variable and surgical residents are rarely trained in these techniques. This article considers how the learning curve in OPCAB may be negotiated and prospectively monitored to ensure quality control. The evidence suggests that situations in which suitable senior expertise exists, OPCAB surgery can be introduced into surgical practice and safely taught to trainees without detriment to patients. This is achieved by a progressive increase in the complexity of the case mix and careful early supervision. The introduction of OPCAB has coincided with the increasing use of control charts as quality control tools. Performance monitoring provides reassurance that patients are not being put at risk during the introduction of OPCAB; control chart methods can be used prospectively for real time performance monitoring by consultant surgeons and residents alike. These techniques may ultimately be used to determine proficiency and accreditation. Increasing use of parallel training techniques, the development of structured training programs that encompass OPCAB and other new technologies in cardiac surgery, coupled with objective performance monitoring are warranted to meet the needs of a changing patient population.

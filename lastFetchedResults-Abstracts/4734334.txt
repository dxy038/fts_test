The intelligent turret assembly system (itas) was designed to provide a reconfigurable assembly system with a small footprint using modular units that can be fitted with a variety of tools. Due to the many possible tool placements, genetic algorithm was used to generate solutions that would help maximize the utilization of the itas. The implemented genetic algorithm solution uses an array-based chromosome that corresponds to the tool-placement. To evolve the solution, a combination of partially mapped crossover operator and a mutation operator that acts by swapping of genes was used. Due to the difficulty in predicting collision in the system, the objective function was implemented through the simulation of the behaviour of the itas. This is believed to be due to the orthogonality that exists between different assembly processes as well as the time varying nature of the system.

Standby redundancy is a design technique that has been widely adopted to enhance system reliability and achieve fault tolerance in many critical applications. In this paper, we consider a 1-out-of-<italic>N:</italic> G hybrid standby redundant system with unrepairable elements being subject to delayed failure-driven standby mode transfers. Specifically, in the considered system, all the standby elements are initially in a warm standby mode (WSM) but can be transferred to a hot standby mode (HSM) so as to be ready to replace the online operating element when it fails. The WSM to HSM transfer is performed with a fixed time delay after no element resides in HSM either due to the element failure or because the element leaves the HSM to replace the failed online element for operation. A new iterative numerical algorithm is first proposed for evaluating reliability and expected mission cost (relevant to elements&#8217; standby expense, operation expense, as well as mode transfer expense) of the considered hybrid standby system. The algorithm has no restriction on element time-to-failure distribution types. Based on the proposed evaluation algorithm, we further formulate and solve a new optimization problem that finds the optimal delay and optimal sequence of standby elements with the objective to minimize expected mission cost while satisfying a certain level of mission reliability constraint. Examples are presented to demonstrate applications of the proposed methodology.

The 2001/77/CE European Commission Directive sets the target of 22% of gross electricity generation from renewables for the Europe, by 2010. In a scenario of large scale penetration of renewable production from wind and other intermittent resources, it is fundamental that the electric system has appropriate means to compensate the effects of the variability and randomness of the wind, solar and hydro power availability. The paper proposes a novel multi-objective method to optimize the mix of the renewable system maximizing its contribution to the peak load, while minimizing the combined intermittence, at a minimum cost. In such model the contribution of the large-scale demand-side management and demand response technologies are also considered.

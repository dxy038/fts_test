Some nodes which have innate immunity have not been considered by the dynamic equation of traditional SIS type. This paper improved the dynamic equation of risk spreading in the SIS type, and studied epidemic critical threshold of crisis when the risks of corrected SIS type spread in the uniformity network and non-uniform network. Based on the analytical results, a conclusion could be drawn that if the rate of congenital immunity is increased, then epidemic critical threshold is larger, and the virus is more difficult to travel in the network, so the crisis is more difficult to break out. This conclusion is more objective than the conclusions drawn by the scholars in the past.

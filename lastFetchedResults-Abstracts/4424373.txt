This paper addresses the problem of product release planning in iterative product development. We propose a method which combines decision, process, and tool support. The method, which is called SCERP, facilitates the active involvement of stakeholders in the different stages of the planning process. SCERP is flexible in the number of stakeholders involved, in the number of releases, in the number and definition of planning criteria, and in the selection of the best plan out of a set of optimized alternatives. A proof-of-concept of the method is given by a case study of release planning for a tool called Agilefant, which is developed with a process partially based on Scrum. The benefits of the method as demonstrated by the case study are: (i) better decisions by the product manager by relying on more objective information, (ii) more transparency of release decisions, and (iii) efficient tool support accompanying the whole process.

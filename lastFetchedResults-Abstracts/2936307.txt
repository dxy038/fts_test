The objective of this advanced concept, Cockpit Weather Information System (CWIN), is to develop an aeronautical system that delivers real-time graphical weather information with global-coverage to the flight deck of an aircraft via a SATCOM/GPS system. Pilots today have difficulties obtaining weather information in-flight in a timely manner allowing for accurate trend information and weather avoidance. These problems result in incomplete weather situation awareness, difficulty making strategic re-route decisions, and consequently, close encounters with adverse weather. Furthermore, inadequate dissemination capability of fixed weather stations has always been a concern to the US Air Force. Inadequate and unreliable deployable weather equipment often fails to disseminate information quickly and effectively to pilots. Consequently, mission success probability is affected by this deficiency. The CWIN system offers an opportunity to develop a cockpit graphical weather system for in-flight pilot utilization in meeting the demands of todayÂ´s operational requirements

This paper presents the design of a Demand Side Management (DSM) priority ranking. It utilizes sequential ordering and set theory. The priority ranking is formulated in conjunction with three DSM objectives: load shifting, valley filling and peak clipping; aiming at improving the system overall load factor and reducing the customer bill. The priority ranking utilizes parameters representing the individual load and the system overall load profiles. These parameters include energy consumption, peak demand and its associated time of occurrence as well as both load factor and coincident demands with the system overall peak demand. Three applications of load shifting, peak clipping and energy conservation program have been studied and evaluated. These will be done by describing the problem, then presenting the proposed DSM programs. The mathematical formulations representing the objective function and the related constraints compatible with activity circumferences were given. Finally, the impact of implementing such programs was highlighted. These applications were applied for weaving &amp; textiles and ceramica cleopatra group. Three DSM programs were introduced: peak clipping, load shifting and energy conservation techniques.

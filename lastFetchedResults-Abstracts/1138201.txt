This paper presents a global optimization method focused on gear vibration reduction by means of profile modifications. A nonlinear dynamic model is used to study the vibration behavior; such model is validated using data available in literature. The optimization method considers different regimes and torque levels; the objective function can be the static transmission error or the maximum amplitude of the gear vibration in terms of dynamic transmission error. The procedure finds the optimal profile modification that reduces the vibrations over a wide range of operating conditions. In order to reduce the computational cost, a Randomâ€“Simplex optimization algorithm is developed; the optimum reliability is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The approach shows good performances for the computational efficiency as well as the reliability of results. Finally, an application to High Contact Ratio (HCR) gears is presented and an extremely good performance is obtained by combining optimization procedures and HCR properties.

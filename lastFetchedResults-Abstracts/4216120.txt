A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system that allows individuals with severe neuromuscular disorders to communicate and control devices using their brain waves. It has been demonstrated that a non-invasive scalp-recorded ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) based BCI paradigm can be used by a disabled individual for long-term, reliable control of a personal computer. This BCI paradigm allows users to select from a set of symbols presented in a flashing visual matrix by classifying the resulting evoked brain responses. The same BCI paradigm and techniques can be used in a straightforward implementation to generate high-level commands for controlling a robotic manipulator in three dimensions according to user intent. The robot application is envisioned to provide superior dimensional control over alternative BCI techniques, as well as provide a wider variety of practical functions for performing everyday tasks. This paper describes the early stages toward providing disabled individuals a new level of autonomy for performing everyday tasks, hence improving their quality of life. The objective of the initial experiment is to demonstrate that an EEG-based BCI can provide accurate and reliable high-level control of a robotic manipulator. A man-machine interface between the human brain and the robotic manipulator is developed and the early stages of insight into the practicality of a BCI operated assistive manipulation device are explored.

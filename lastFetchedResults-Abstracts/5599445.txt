Due to the characteristics of the DCF model in 802.11 and P2P usersÂ´ requirements of both downloading and uploading, P2P traffic frequently causes congestion in WLAN. However, traditional P2P cache cannot alleviates the congestion caused by P2P traffic in WLAN effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called bidirectional cache for this problem. A bidirectional cache which contains a reverse cache as well as a forward cache can be deployed at the AC of a WLAN. Being a novel design, the reverse cache can cache release the uplink bandwidth resource at each AP can be and the congestion can be alleviated effectively. Meanwhile, the forward cache can still act as the traditional P2P cache to reduce the cross domain traffic. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional P2P cache, our bidirectional cache can shorten the file transfer time of P2P applications by at least 42% and improve the throughput of the other Internet applications by at least 28%.

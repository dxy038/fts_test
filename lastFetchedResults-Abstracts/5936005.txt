This paper is a part of a research project to study the dynamics and control of horizontal axis wind turbines. The main objective of this work is to give contribution to the control problem of horizontal axis wind power plants using neural network. This work presents a new methodology to control wind power plants. It employs an adaptive neural networks self-tuning control system to control medium scale wind turbine system, during different operating conditions. The proposed control system consists of neural networks inverse and forward identifiers, which are used to model the inverse and forward dynamics of the system, respectively, and to adapt neural controller parameters, and reference model that are used to enhance trajectory training, and neural controller which is used to generate control signal to the pitch angle actuator. The proposed control system performed good simulation results, and the latter show that the proposed control system is really a new contribution in the area of control of horizontal axis wind turbine power generation systems

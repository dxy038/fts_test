This paper presents the adaptive video over IP (AViP) approach to transmit video sequences. A rate-selection algorithm based on both delay and loss indication is presented and its performance measured using actual MPEG-2 video sequences, network simulations and objective measures of perceptual quality. The results show that the AViP approach leads to efficient use of available network resources, reactiveness to congestions and TCP-friendliness. Moreover, AViP delivers significantly higher perceptual levels of quality than traditional constant-bit-rate systems operating at the same average level.

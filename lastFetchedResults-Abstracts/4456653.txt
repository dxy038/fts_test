The objective of this paper is to discuss the general development of a computer-aided control system design (CACSD) package in conjunction with various interdisciplinary objectives. In order to meet the needs of a large and diverse community of users using various control theories, a CACSD package should have a contemporary windows interface, have graphical interaction and be easily extendible to include the routines required by current and emerging control theory techniques. The design and implementation of such a software system is approached from an object-oriented (OO) software engineering point-of-view for ease of extension, expansion and maintenance. The evolution of such a CACSD package also involves the development of a DOS windows interface system and graphical interaction with additional emphasis on accurate algorithm structure

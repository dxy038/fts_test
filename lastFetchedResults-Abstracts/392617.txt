Objective: Hybrid cells generated from dendritic cells (DC) and tumor cells provide tumor-associated antigens (TAA) in a polyvalent mode and therefore they have aroused interest in cancer immunotherapy. The present study was designed to investigate the hybrid cell generation and optimize its implementation for a TAA-target treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods: Hybrid cells from mature DC and laryngeal carcinoma cell line UTSCC-19A were generated by electrofusion. Fusion efficiency and viability were determined by flow cytometry, light and fluorescence microscopy analyses. Results: The gradual electrofusion process constituted real human tumor and dendritic cell hybrids characterized by polynuclear cells and double staining as a result of overlay of red (HLA-DR:R-PE) and green (HEA:FITC) fluorescence. Furthermore, analyses have proven viability of fusion results, and factors influencing fusion yield were determined. Conclusion: Physical fusion of mature dendritic cells with laryngeal carcinoma cells provides a dendritic cell based hybrid cell vaccine as a quantitative prerequisite for anti-cancer vaccination. Specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes need to be induced before hybrid cell application in clinical studies.

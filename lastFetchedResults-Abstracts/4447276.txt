In this paper the proper switching of the bidirectional switches found by calculating the duty cycles using Venturini´s method [3] in conjunction by employing Neural network presented. So the need for standard soft switching calculation could be eliminated and the time needed to find modulation matrix using Venturini´s method eliminate. A new modulation matrix using generalizes regression neural network is calculated for the constant output frequency and voltage magnitude. Simulation results using MATLAB Simulink for inductive and resistive loads are produced and presented. Good agreement between the standard simulations results with the new modulation technique shows the validity of this method.

This paper addresses the problem of emergency location-allocation in multi-supplier, multi-affected area, multi-relief and multi-vehicle emergency logistics networks. A multi-objective stochastic programming model, which embeds the chance constraints and scenario planning, is proposed to handle the uncertainty of demand, supply and the availability of path. The optimization focuses on minimizing the expected travel time and the proportion of unmet demands, which represent efficiency and fairness respectively. There are also coverage limits for relief suppliers to cover affected areas. The goal programming approach is proposed to solve the multi-objective problem. In the end, computational results based on objective achievement scale indicate the validity of the model and solution.

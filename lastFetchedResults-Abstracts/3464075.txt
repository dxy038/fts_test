The objective of the present work was to detect and analyze wheezes by means of a highly sensitive time-frequency algorithm. Automatic measurements were compared with clinical auscultation for forced exhalation segments from 1.2 to 0 liters/second (l/s). Sensitivities between 100% and 71%, as a function of flow level related to wheezing segments detection, were achieved. Time-frequency wheeze parameters were measured for the flow range from 1.2 to 0.2 l/s. Wheezes were detected in both analyzed groups; asthmatics (N=16) and control subjects (N=15). Significant differences between groups were found for the mean number of wheezes detected at basal condition (p=0.0003). Frequency parameter differences were also significant (0.0112<pU0003C0.0307U00029. significant="" bandwidth="" U00028p="0.0195)." responseU0002C="" finallyU0002C="" the="" parametersU0002C="" limited="" after="" groups="" applying="" drug="" patient="" changes="" differences="" which="" were="" p="" studied="" a="" for="" all="" between="" also="" each="" in="" found="" of="" these="" bronchodilator="" studying="" wheezes="" parameters="" U00028terbutalineU00029.="" number="" measure="" studied.U0003C="" when="">\n\n\t\t</pU0003C0.0307U00029.>

A novel circuit-topology family of the current-mode AC/AC converter with high-frequency AC link, based on a Flyback converter, is proposed. These circuit topologies, which can transfer one unregulated sinusoidal voltage with high total harmonic distortion (THD) into another regulated constant-frequency sinusoidal voltage with low THD, are composed of input cycloconverter, high-frequency storage transformer, and output cycloconverter. The circuit-topology family includes single four-quadrant power switch mode, push-pull mode, half-bridge mode, and full-bridge mode circuits. The single four-quadrant power switch mode and push-pull mode converters are suitable for low input voltage fields, but the half-bridge mode and full-bridge mode converters are suitable for high input voltage fields. The operational mode, steady principle, and transient voltage feedback control strategy of the kind of converter are investigated. The output characteristic curve, its relation to internal resistance, and the design criteria for the key circuit parameters are given. The theoretical analysis and the test result of the 500 VA 220 V 15% 50 HzAC/220 V 50 HzAC prototype have shown that the converters have advantages such as high-frequency galvanic isolation, simple topology, two-stage power conversion [low frequency alternating current (LFAC)/high frequency alternating current (HFAC)/LFAC], bidirectional power flow, high efficiency, high power density, low THD of the output voltage, strong adaptability to various loads, higher line power factor, low audio noise, etc.

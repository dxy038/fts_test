This paper investigates the problem of traffic scheduling between roadside units (RSUs) in a vehicular delay-tolerant network. A source RSU needs the help of passing-by vehicles to forward its traffic to a destination RSU. Costs are associated with energy consumption and information loss. When a vehicle arrives, the source RSU needs to decide whether to stop, i.e., transmit its traffic to the vehicle, or skip this vehicle and continue to wait for other vehicles. The source RSUÂ´s objective is to achieve the minimal rate of cost. In this paper, we theoretically derive an optimal stopping strategy of the source RSU. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the derived strategy.

A time-domain mathematical model of three-phase three-wire active power filter (APF) current control loop is established based on virtual floating-ground analysis method; the conception of predictive control based on reference-voltage-prediction is proposed, its prediction accuracy is better than the prediction accuracy of reference-current-prediction at the same order. Predictive control equation and its optimal feasible solution with minimum objective function value are deduced. The optimal solutions can be got by simple judgments and computations, which avoids complex co-ordinate transformations and significantly decreases computational complexity. The control performance under the proposed control strategy is analyzed. The proposed control approach can improve current tracking speed and accuracy; and has the characteristics of lower switching frequency, simple computation and easy application. The simulation and experiment results show its validity and feasibility.

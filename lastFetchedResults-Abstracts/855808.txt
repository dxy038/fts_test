Background and objective: Scientific research in every country is the most important factor of growth and prosperity. This study was conducted to find out students' views about research barriers at SSUMS.
Materials and Methods: This cross- sectional study was conducted using 384 students who were selected by multistage random sampling. Data collection tool was a valid and reliable questionnaire with 56 questions in 4 parts: 22 demographic and background questions, 15 items about personal barriers in research (?=0.73) with a 75-15 score range and 19 items in organizational barriers studies (?=0.77) with a 95-19 score range. It was completed in self report. Data was analyzed by SPSS-18 using descriptive statistics and analytical tests such as Pearson correlation, ANOVA, independent T-test and linear regression ( p=0.05).
Results: Mean of personal barriers was 50.96±8.58 (67.94% of the full score), and that of organizational barriers 65.18±11.20 (68.61% of the full score). Personal perceived barriers were more in women (P=0.022). Personal barriers were higher in participants who did not participate in research workshops (P=0.033). Lack of adequate awareness of the principles and statistical methods and lack of adequate motivation had greater weight.
Conclusion: Because of high interest of the students in research activities and due to their ability in this regard, university authorities should pay more attention to this issue.

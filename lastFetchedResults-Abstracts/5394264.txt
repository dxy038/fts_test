The results presented here suggest that there is a correlation between receive coupling and terminal current behavior in a phased array. Therefore, receive coupling can be used to design antenna elements, which will exhibit reduced mutual coupling effects when operated in a phased array. Since only two antenna elements are involved, this is much less computationally intensive than the calculation of the full array response. This property of receive coupling has enabled multi-objective optimization of LWA antenna elements including mutual coupling effects as described in [5].

In this paper, a new network reconfiguration approach is presented in which the voltage balance index is taken for the objective function and the optimal structure of distributed network can be found through the refined genetic algorithm (RGA). In the meantime, by simplifying the distribution network, the length of chromosome is reduced and the efficiency of the algorithm is increased. The calculations show that with this method not only the voltage profile can be improved, but also the aim of reducing the network loss can be obtained. At last, a practical calculation example is given to validate the feasibility of the method.

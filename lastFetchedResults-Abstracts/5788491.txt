In this paper, lookahead control policies and decision rules are proposed to solve the conflicts occurring in the TCPN model given by Meng et al. (1995) for FMS scheduling, assuming that some transitions are controllable. Simulation results show that the proposed approach has consistently better performance, for the objective of minimal flow time of jobs, when compared to simple dispatching rules. It is also obvious that when the job arrival distribution is not uniform, the job entry control becomes very important

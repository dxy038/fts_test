This paper focuses on high-fidelity multichannel audio coding based on an enhanced adaptation of the well-known sinusoidal plus noise model (SNM). Sinusoids cannot be used per se for high-quality audio modeling because they do not represent all the audible information of a recording. The noise part has also to be treated to avoid an artificial sounding resynthesis of the audio signal. Generally, the encoding process needs much higher bitrates for the noise part than the sinusoidal one. Our objective is to encode spot microphone signals using the SNM, by taking advantage of the interchannel similarities to achieve low bitrates. We demonstrate that for a given multichannel audio recording, the noise part for each spot microphone signal (before the mixing stage) can be obtained by using its noise envelope to transform the noise part of just one of the signals (the so-called "reference signal", which is fully encoded).

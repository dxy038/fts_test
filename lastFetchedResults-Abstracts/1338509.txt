Background: The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate whether
the length of pituitary blockage with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists
or the stimulation period influence intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcomes
in patients older than 36 years of age.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 138 couples with maternal
age  > 36 years undergoing ICSI with an antagonist protocol were included. The influences
of stimulation and suppression length on the response to ovarian stimulation and ICSI
outcomes were investigated. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was
performed to assess the predictive value of the stimulation period for achievement of
implantation and pregnancy.
Results: The gonadotrophin stimulation length negatively influenced the implantation
rate (RC: -4.200; p=0.023). The area under ROC curve (AUC) could distinguish between
women with positive and negative implantation (AUC: 0.611; CI: 0.546-0.673)
and pregnancy (AUC: 0.593; CI: 0.528-0.656). The threshold value demonstrated a high
negative predictive value on likelihood of implantation (p=0.0032, 90% sensitivity) and
pregnancy (p=0.0147, 87.1% sensitivity) when patients underwent more than 10 days of
stimulation.
Conclusion: The stimulation period negatively influences the implantation rate in women
older than 36 years. A stimulation interval greater than 10 days is associated with a negative
predictive value for the chance of implantation and pregnancy.

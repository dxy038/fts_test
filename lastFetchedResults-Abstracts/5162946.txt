A squirrel cage induction generator feeds the power to a double-sided pulse width converter system, which feeds power to either an utility grid, or to an autonomous system. The generation system uses three numbers of fuzzy logic controllers. The first fuzzy controller tracks the generator speed with the wind velocity to extract maximum power. The second fuzzy logic controller programs machine fl- ux for light load efficiency improvement. The third fuzzy logic controller provides robust speed control against wind vortex and turbine oscillatory torque.

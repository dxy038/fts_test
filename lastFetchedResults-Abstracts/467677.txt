OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine the cellular localization of inhibin subunits and messenger ribonucleic acid expressions for the inhibin subunits and the serum levels of inhibin A and inhibin B in human ovarian sex cord stromal tumors. STUDY DESIGN: We examined the immunohistochemical localization of the inhibin subunits and the expression of the corresponding messenger ribonucleic acids by Northern blot analysis in a granulosa cell tumor and a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. We also measured serum concentrations of dimeric inhibin A and inhibin B by two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Immunostaining specific for the inhibin α, βA, and βB subunits was observed in the granulosa cell tumor. In the Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor we observed immunostaining specific for the α subunit in Leydig tumor cells and that specific for the βA subunit in Sertoli tumor cells and that specific for the βB subunit in both tumor cells. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of messenger ribonucleic acids for the α, βA, and βB subunits in the granulosa cell tumor and the Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. The serum levels of dimeric inhibin A and inhibin B in patients were elevated preoperatively and decreased progressively after surgery. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that inhibin A and inhibin B are produced by the human sex cord stromal tumors and that inhibins might be the useful markers of the tumors.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:7)

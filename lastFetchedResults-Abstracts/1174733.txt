Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKPO), the topic material, has been extensively applied as an initiator and cross-linker during polymerization, but it has also induced many severe accidents on a global scale. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to deeply understanding the basic characteristics of runaway reactions of MEKPO and mixed with acetone. The innovative objective of an isothermal kinetic evaluation is to determine the basic characteristics of reactive chemicals in order to prevent a serious runaway accident. Therefore, we endeavored to demonstrate the reaction model and kinetic parameters, such as activation energy (Ea), frequency factor (A), and so on, by the thermal activity monitor III (TAM III) under three isothermal conditions of 70, 80, and 90 Â°C, in terms of MEKPO 31 mass% and with acetone 99 mass%. The results showed that MEKPO could liberate a great quantity of heat during exothermic reaction. Moreover, acetone could alleviate the degree of exothermic runaway while being added with MEKPO.

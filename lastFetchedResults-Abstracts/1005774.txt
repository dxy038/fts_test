The main objective of this investigation was to quantitatively determine the ability of a microwave energy to level the moisture content of veneers using infrared thermography system. It is believed that the proper use of RF drying may reduce the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the sheets of plywood veneer as they are dried. Currently, the RF units are used after the drying, for the purpose of distributing the moisture that may be left in the pieces of veneer in some places (wet spot). Microwaving green veneer briefly under low headspace conditions evens out the moisture distribution for both softwood and hardwood, with the effect being more pronounced for softwood. The drying rate is unaffected. If successful, this could lead to significant cost savings for plywood producers.

The objective of this paper is to minimize the cost of a consumer equipped with a PV/Battery who is connected micro grid. The user optimization is achieved thru proper utilization of the battery storage system. There are two main parts in this paper which are discussed. Firstly a price management for reducing the customer bill has been designed. In the price management, the battery storage set point will be determined based on the electricity price signal and the tariff signal in order to have the best decision for having the lowest price. Secondly, after implementing this algorithm on the simulated system in PSCAD, in order to have adaptive price management which can consider any change in the incoming signals, the algorithm has been improved. In simulations, at first, it was assumed that the price and tariff signals are constant signals which are predefined during every day. So the algorithm works based on this fixed signals. But, in fact, sometimes the micro grid may change the price of power because of high demand in an specific period, so a system with smart devices for communicating can receive the new price and tariff signal, so there would be a better decision which as a result can reduce the total cost for the consumer.

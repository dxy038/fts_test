A new zero current soft-switching (ZCS)-pulse width modulation (PWM) bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed in this paper. The proposed bidirectional dc-dc converter is assisted by a single auxiliary switch-applied two-terminal edge-resonant cell, the topology of which is simple and practical as compared to a variety of previously-developed soft-switching PWM cells. The performances of the proposed bidirectional dc-dc converter are demonstrated by experiment using its 2.2 kW-50 kHz prototype circuit, after which the feasibility is evaluated from a practical point of view.

In flow shop scheduling, the objective is to obtain a sequence of jobs which will optimize some well-defined criteria when processed in a
fixed order of machines. In situations that robots are used to transport materials (material handler), breakdown of the machines and robots
have a significant role in the production concern. This paper deals with a new heuristic algorithm for n-jobs, 3 machines, and 2 robots flow
shop scheduling problem considering the breakdown interval of machines and robots simultaneously. This algorithm is based on Johnson
algorithm. A heuristic algorithm is used to minimize total elapsed time, whenever mean weighted production flow time is taken into
consideration. The proposed method is very easy to understand. Also, it provides an important tool for decision-makers. Furthermore, a
numerical illustration is given to clarify the algorithm.

Objective
y is estimated to account for up to 20% of all cancer deaths. Mutations of TP53 are frequently correlated with tumor development and progression. We evaluated the effect of body mass index (BMI) and mutation status of tumor suppressor gene p53 (TP53) on patients with urinary bladder cancer.
als and methods
al samples were used from 75 patients with tumors of the urinary bladder. Mutation status in TP53 exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 was analyzed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of exon-specific PCR products and by sequence analysis. Statistical analysis included Pearson's correlation.
s
ninvasive bladder cancer, the mutation frequency in TP53 was 44.6%, while for invasive bladder cancer the mutation frequency in TP53 was 84.2%. Normal weight, overweight, and patients with obesity had a TP53 mutation frequency of 68.4%, 44.8%, and 25%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05).
sions
utation frequently occurs in higher stages of bladder tumors. Body mass index is not associated with a higher TP53 mutation frequency in our study, but BMI should be included for collecting data of bladder cancer risk profile.

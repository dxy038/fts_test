The end cap of an electromechanical system deforms severely when it is under extreme pressure load condition. To solve the problem, numerical simulation method is used. Finite element modeling is established. Take the minimum compliance of the model as the design objective. An optimized model is put forward by optimizing the structure. The results of calculation indicate that the largest deformation decreases and the stiffness of the whole structure is improved. For the initial phase of the project design, it has a very important significance for improving the design quality, speeding up the design process, and saving materials.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of transvaginal sacrospinous fixation of the vaginal vault as part of the total pelvic reconstructive surgery performed for patients with uterovaginal prolapse and vaginal vault prolapse.
STUDY DESIGN: The hospital and office records of 156 patients undergoing sacrospinous suspension of the vaginal vault between Sept. 14, 1987, and March 22, 1994, were retrospectively reviewed. The preoperative pelvic support defects were compared with the postoperative pelvic support defects. The proportion test for independent samples was used to determine statistical significance.
RESULTS: Eight (5.6%) patients have had recurrence of vaginal vault prolapse, with two of these patients having undergone repeat pelvic reconstructive surgery. Eleven (7.6%) patients have had recurrent anterior segment defects, whereas two (1.4%) patients have had recurrent posterior segment defects.
CONCLUSION: Ninety-four percent of the patients who underwent sacrospinous suspension for uterovaginal prolapse and vaginal vault prolapse have had no persistence or recurrence of vaginal vault prolapse 6 to 83 months after the procedure.

Objective
The aim of this study was to determine bonding properties of two types of fibre-reinforced composite (FRC) posts cemented into root canals of molars. Serrated titanium posts served as reference.
Methods

Prefabricated carbon/graphite FRC posts with cross-linked polymer matrix and individually formed glass FRC posts with interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) polymer matrix were compared. The crowns of extracted third molars were removed and post space (diameter: 1.5 mm) was drilled, etched and bonded. The posts were treated with dimethacrylate adhesive resin, light-polymerized and cemented with a dual-polymerizing composite resin luting cement. After thermocycling (6000Ã—) the samples were cut into discs of thicknesses: 1, 2 and 4 mm (n=12/group). Push-out force was measured by pushing the post from one end. Assessment of failure mode was made under a stereomicroscope (1, adhesive failure between post and cement; 2, cohesive failure of post-system; 3, adhesive failure between cement and dentin).
Results

The push-out force increased with increased height of dentin disc in all groups (ANOVA, p<0.001). In the 4 mm thick dentin discs the individually formed glass FRC posts showed highest push-out force and the difference to that of the titanium posts was significant (ANOVA, p<0.001). The other differences were not statistically significant. None of the individually formed glass FRC posts showed adhesive failures between the post and the cement.
Conclusions

Contrary to the other posts, there were no adhesive (post-cement) failures with the individually formed glass FRC posts, suggesting better interfacial adhesion of cement to these posts.

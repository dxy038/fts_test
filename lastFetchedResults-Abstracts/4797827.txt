This paper contains a mathematical analysis of a theater conflict wargame and describes the framework for assessing the impact of force structure by viewing the construction of a computer model which mirrors the combat attrition processes. The paper describes the Markovian model used to verify and validated the results of simulated force combat by deriving combat transition probabilities, and defines, analyzes, and tests a series of various player strategies. We examine offensive and defensive approaches to determine the optimal player decision processes derived from Markovian analysis. The analysis is further supported by combat simulation along with graphical explanations. The objective remains that of testing combat strategies given alternatives presented under various playing conditions

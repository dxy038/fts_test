Nosocomial infections caused by Acinetobacter bumanii has emerged as a major problem in many hospitals and ICU settings due to its inherent resistance to most of antibiotics. The production of plasmid-mediated ESBLs is one of the most common mechanisms for resistance to Beta-lactam antibiotics among clinical isolates of Acinetobacter bumanii. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of INT 1 and ESBL type VEB-1and PER-2 genes among Acinetobacter bumanii strains isolated from Imam Reza hospital in Tabriz.

Materials and Methods: A total of 100 Acinetobacter bumanii strains isolated from different clinical specimens were identified by standard microbiological methods. Production of ESBL was determined by testing resistance of the isolates against ceftazidime. cefotaxime. ceftriaxone and verified by Double Disk Synergy Test. For genotypic detection of ESBL type. the DNA isolated from the isolates was entered in a PCR reaction with primers specific for INT 1. VEB-1 and PER-2 genes.

Results: Among 100 A. bumanii isolates that screened. 60 isolates were ESBL positive. Genotypic screening revealed that 10 % of the isolates were positive for VEB1. None of the isolates were positive for PER2 type genes. The INT 1 gene was detected in 63.3 % isolates. The results demonstrated the spread of PER-1 and VEB-1 ESBL genotype among A. bumanii isolates that remindes the necessity of special attention to proper use of extended spectrum betalactams.

We analyze the recently proposed serial topology of a wide-band erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) covering both the C- and L-bands and compare it with the parallel configuration of C-band and L-band amplifiers. The analysis is based on an application of a comprehensive large-signal numerical model, which takes into consideration propagation of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) signals, bidirectional pump, and both the downstream and upstream ASE power spectral components. We have found that in the multiwavelength regime the new topology can provide output power of 3 dBm/channel for 32 C-band and 40 L-band, 0.8-nm-spaced signals with reasonable pump powers to the first and the second stage. In comparison with the usual parallel configuration of C-band and L-band EDFAs, this topology saves about 20% of overall pump power, 10% of the necessary length of erbium-doped fiber (EDF) and achieves lower noise figure for L-band signals.

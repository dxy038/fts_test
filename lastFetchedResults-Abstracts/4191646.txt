In a large-scale wavelength switched optical network (WSON), a distributed wavelength assignment (DWA) which does not tightly rely on the frequently disseminated and centralized maintained resource information would be critical to the large-scale WSON. In this paper, we are motivated to provide insights on the DWA of different signaling schemes and find better candidates for bidirectional lightpath operation in WSON. Probabilistic analysis is conducted for the bidirectional DWA performance evaluation. Through comparisons, we find that the bidirectional DWA support in the current standard RSVP-TE per RFC 3473 is inadequate. Especially from long-term view, signaling which can offer efficient resource utilization is strongly required.

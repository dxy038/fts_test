The main characteristic of landscape evolution in the Pyrenees during the 20th century is the increased presence of shrubs in old fields. Revegetation is mainly recorded on medium and low slopes because of land abandonment. The increase in shrubs causes the loss of grazing resources during winter, landscape homogenization and an increase in fire risk. The objective of this paper was to create a scenario for land use change by combining Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Landscape Ecology Analysis (LEA). To improve the present seasonal imbalance in pastoral resources, the scenario proposes to convert shrubland areas to grasslands without an excessive increase in soil erosion or landscape fragmentation. The results obtained indicate that the strategy produces greater landscape diversity and an increase in annual pasture resources (16.7%), which exceeds 60% of total in winter. The effects of landscape fragmentation on biodiversity, fire risk control and the imbalance of pastures are discussed. The scenario would improve extensive livestock farming, which is the most important economic activity in this area and other Mediterranean mountains.

In this paper, we propose the self-describing schemes for interoperable image/video content descriptions, which can accommodate the objective of MPEG-7 standard. The objective of this standard is to enhance content-focused multimedia applications to the maximum. In order to provide full interoperability and flexibility we use the eXtensible Markup Language to express the self-describing schemes. We demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the self-describing scheme

This paper proposes a single-phase reconfigurable battery charger for an electric vehicle (EV) that operates in three different modes: grid-to-vehicle (G2V) mode, in which the traction batteries are charged from the power grid; vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode, in which the traction batteries deliver part of the stored energy back to the power grid; and traction-to-auxiliary (T2A) mode, in which the auxiliary battery is charged from the traction batteries. When connected to the power grid, the battery charger works with a sinusoidal current in the ac side, for both G2V and V2G modes, and regulates the reactive power. When the EV is disconnected from the power grid, the control algorithms are modified, and the full-bridge ac-dc bidirectional converter works as a full-bridge isolated dc-dc converter that is used to charge the auxiliary battery of the EV, avoiding the use of an additional charger to accomplish this task. To assess the behavior of the proposed reconfigurable battery charger under different operation scenarios, a 3.6-kW laboratory prototype has been developed, and experimental results are presented.

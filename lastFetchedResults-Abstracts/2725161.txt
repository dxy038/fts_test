This paper presents a comparative study on different surrogate models for an application to multidimensional optimal design of electromagnetic devices. The surrogate model is combined with a heuristic optimization algorithm, which usually requires a lot of objective function calls. For this, various Kriging surrogate models, including dynamic Kriging (DK) and multiquadric radial basis function with optimal shape parameter, are investigated and discussed. In the DK surrogate model, the optimal combination of the basis functions is obtained using an improved binary particle swarm optimization algorithm.

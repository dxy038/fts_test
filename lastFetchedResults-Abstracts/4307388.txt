A new objective evaluation measure, advanced weighted signal to noise ratio (AWSNR), which reflects human visual characteristics, is proposed. In the measure, subjective observation areas are predicted based on local complexity, local brightness and the human spatial frequency characteristics. From experimental results using 350 pictures, it is found that the correlation coefficient between the MOS (mean opinion score) by 30 testers and the proposed AWSNR becomes 0.91

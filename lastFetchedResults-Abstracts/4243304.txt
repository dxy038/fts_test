In this paper, we proposed a new approach for the anti-sway control of container cranes. The container crane modeled as a hybrid PDE-ODE system with flexible cable. The dynamics of the moving system is derived as a cable with tension caused payload using Hamilton´s principle for the systems. The control objective is to suppress the transverse vibrations of the crane via boundary control. A control law based upon the Lyapunov´s second method is derived. It is revealed that a time-varying control force and a suitable passive damping at the actuator can successfully suppress the transverse vibrations. The exponential stability of the closed loop system is proved. The effectiveness of the control laws proposed is demonstrated via simulations.

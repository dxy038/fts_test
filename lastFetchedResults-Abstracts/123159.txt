The great demand today for medicinal plants, shows the importance of growing and production these plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of chemical fertilizers include Nitrogen and Phosphorus in 4 levels (chemical nutrition system), manure in 3 levels (organic nutrition system), mixture of chemical fertilizers and manure in 4 levels (integrated nutrition system) in comparison with control on soil chemical and physical properties, elemental uptake and seed yield of Ajowan (Carum copticum). This experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications in 2002 at Qazvin Agricultural Research station. The results indicate that organic amendments significantly increased the physico- chemical properties of soil particulary soil organic matter content and available P, N, Ca, Mg, uptake and concentration of nutrient in seed and shoots were significantly affected by treatments, whereas K and Na concentration were the same among the treatments. There was no difference about seed yield between 30 ton/ha of manure and 120 and 80 kg/ha Nitrogen and Phosphorus in respectively. Whereas the highest seed yield was obtained in integrated treatments.

A long term test on a 64 kbit/s digital channel within a 2048 kbit/s IDR circuit, conveying commercial traffic, at Ku-band frequencies was carried out between France and Canada during the period October 1991 through November 1993. The test was conducted on an Atlantic Ocean Region (AOR) INTELSAT satellite positioned at 325.5&#176; east longitude. The objective of the test was to verify that the long term performance of the IDR carrier met the design criteria stated in Rec. ITU-R S.614, Rec. ITU-R S.579, Rec. ITU-T G.821, and IESS-308. The test was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 comprised a basic set-up of a bit-error test set used to evaluate the performance of the 64 kbit/s channel at each end and a printer for recording the results. The second phase comprised a more extensive set of test equipment and was controlled by a workstation which was also used for data storage. The parameters measured in the second phase were: beacon C/No, IDR carrier C/No, demodulator Eb/No, transmitted carrier level, and error performance of the 64 kbit/s digital satellite channel. Detailed analysis of the performance achieved during the test indicates that the performance requirements of Rec. ITU-R S.614, Rec. ITU-R S.579, Rec. ITU-T G.821, and IESS-308 were met in both phases of the test

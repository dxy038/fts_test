Inroduction & Objective: Probiotics are live microorganisms that with the improvement of intestine microbial balance, enforce useful  impacts on the host (human or animal) and are used as food supplements or pharmaceuticals. Today production of Probiotic products are worldwide. Functional charectristics of these microorganisms include: adjustment of immune system, decrease of cholesterol serum, digestive infections, cancer, dermal and food allergies in kids, vesica and ear infections and decrease of chronic and travel diarrhea. Researches have shown that by means of vagus nerves, food can impact on the brain and nervous hormones, so it is probable that with regulation of the action of brain’s different parts, probiotics can impact on the improvement of its function.
Materials and Methods: In this research 40 male vistar rats with the average weight of 150-170 g and approximate age of 4 weeks were chosen for the investigation of the usage of these probiotic’s effects, and were  placed accidentally in 4 groups and were exposed to stress for 4 weeks and treatment with bacterium T4 Daily. 
Results: The usage of probiotic bacterium T4 after 4 weeks has an effect on the decrease of stress in mice in a sensible manner(p < 0.05), in contrast to the groups which hadnot received probiotics.

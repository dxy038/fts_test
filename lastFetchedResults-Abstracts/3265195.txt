To reduce the calculate work of the tradition power tracing method for line loss allocation, a new power flow tracing method, in which the reach ability set theory and the proportional-sharing principle are applied, is presented. The objective of the method is to provide an efficient loss allocation method so that the line losses assigned to each generator could be determined. By hierarchically decomposing the whole process, progressive line loss calculation is performed with faster speed and considerable accuracy. The algorithm is tested on an IEEE-14 power system, the result of which illustrates the applicability and the validity of the method, and shows that the complexity of calculation is reduced with an acceptable deviation.

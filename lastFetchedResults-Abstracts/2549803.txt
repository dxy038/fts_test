Background and Objective: Regarding inefficiency of common drugs used for alleviation of anxiety due to narcotics withdrawal, the present study was evaluated methadone and haloperidol co-drugs therapy on anxiety due to morphine withdrawal.
Materials and Methods: Ninety eight NMRI male mice were divided into acute and chronic experimental groups. Then, each group was divided into 7 subgroups: saline, morphine (control), methadone, haloperidol, methadone+haloperidol, methadone+haloperidol with 2/1 and 1/2 ratio, respectively. Mice were addicted chronically (over 8 days) by receiving escalating doses of morphine and acute (morphine was applied only on 8th day) procedures. Anxiety was induced by naloxone application in addicted mice. Elevated plus-maze and open field tests were used for evaluation of anxiety. 
Results: Obtained data showed that in both chronic and acute groups, treatment with co-drugs methadone and haloperidol could markedly alleviate anxiety signs produced by interruption of morphine consumption. 
Conclusion: We found out that the anxiety as a major sign of morphine withdrawal sign could be diminished by methadone+haloperidol therapy versus drugs alone.

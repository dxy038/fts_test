The main objective of this paper is to quantify the respiratory somatosensory (RSS) responses of normal human subjects to brief pressure loads applied at the mouth during inspiration to characterize the afferent information from respiratory system mechanoreceptors. A 30 electrode array of the complete 36 channels was used to provide enough spatial sampling over the the somatosensory region of the right half of the scalp

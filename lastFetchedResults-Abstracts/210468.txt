Objective: Poisoning represents one of the most common medical emergencies in children.
Epidemiologic surveillance in each area is necessary for prevention planning program. The
purpose of this study was to determine epidemiologic pattern of acute poisoning in Ahwaz
during a 3-year period, from 2001 to 2004.
Subjects and Methods: In this retrospective study, all children who were admitted due to
acute poisoning in Abuzar and Golestan hospitals in Ahwaz during years 200 I to 2004 were
included. Data were collected from medical records.
Results: Of a total of 143 cases with acute poisoning, 59 (41.1%) were female and 84 patients
(58.9%) were male. The age range of poisoned patients was between 40 days up to 12 years
old (mean age 46.8 months). Most (71%) of poisoning occurred in the age group of 1-5 years.
Accidental posoining by child occurred in 77.8 %, in 16% the poisons were given by others
and 6.2 % were due to suicide attempts. The most common ingested materials were
hydrocarbons (16%), alkaloid agents (12.6%), opiates (11.9%), tricyclic antidepressants
(8.4%), anticonvulsants (6.3%), benzodiazepines (7.7%), antihypertensives (3.5%),
antipsychotic (2.8%) and pesticides (4.2%). While multi-drug poisoning occurred in 2.8% of
cases. In 7 % of cases. the implicated poisons were unidentified. Opiates were the most
common agents in below 6 months old. Decreased level of consciousness (67.6%) and
vomiting (5%) were the most common signs. The mean days of admission were 2.6 Â±
1.67day. There was no mortality in this study.
Conclusion: Accidental ingestion was the most common cause of poisoning and 1-5 years old
were the most common affected age group. Public education on safe storage of medicines and
chemicals and use of child-resistant containers is necessary. To decrease the frequency of
opium poisoning parents should be informed about the harms of some herbal agents
containing opiates which are using traditionally for infants and children in this region

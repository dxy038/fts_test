Design optimization, favoring efficiency maximization, is the subject of extended current research in small electric traction motor applications, aiming the increase in efficiency to be achieved without compromising power density. This paper proposes a mixed technique based on a particular multi-objective, population-based optimization methodology, utilizing a strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm variant combined with the finite element method and analytical tools. The resultant motor design has been validated through measurements on a prototype in-wheel permanent magnet motor for a light electric vehicle.

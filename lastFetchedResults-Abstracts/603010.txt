Background and Objective: There are a few studies about wheat flour fortification with powdered Spirulina platensis microalgae to produce industrial cookies. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Spirulina platensis microalgae used in production of traditional Iranian cookies on their nutritional value, color and texture.
Materials and methods: Samples of cookies were prepared using S. pirulina platensis at a level (% w/w) of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5%. The protein, iron and poluunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents of the samples were measured by microkjeldahl, atomic absorption and GC mass chromatography, respectively; the peroxide value in the four samples was also determined. Sensory evaluation (hedonic scale 1? 5) of the samples was made by 14 trained panelists.
Results: The iron, protein and ?-linolenic acid contents of the fortified cookies were higher, and their peroxide value lower, than the respective control values. With regard to sensory evaluation, cookie samples containing 1.0% and 1.5% S. platensis scored highest following the control sample (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: It is possible to produce cookies fortified with1.0-1.5%  S. platensis with desirable nutritional and sensory characterstics.

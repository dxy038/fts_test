In this paper, Plug-in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (PFCEV) is considered with dual power sources including Fuel Cell (FC) and battery Energy Storage. In order to respond to a transient power demand, usually battery energy storage device is combined with fuel cell to create a hybrid system with high energy density of fuel cell and the high power density of super capacitor. In order to simulate the PEV model, dynamic state space models of bidirectional DC-DC converter and grid connected voltage source converter are considered to connect the PFCEV to the main grid.  In order to stabilize the DC-link power and distribute the power between dual energy storage sources in PEV during normal and disturbance conditions on the grid voltage, a fuzzy control strategy has been developed. For fine tuning the parameters of fuzzy logic controller, the PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm has been used. This controller determines the super capacitor and fuel cell powers that should be generated according to the amount of available energy in DC-link. Moreover, a robust sliding mode control strategy for three phase power electronic converter based on the positive and negative symmetrical components is presented to investigate the voltage disturbance ride-through capability

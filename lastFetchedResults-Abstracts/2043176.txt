Purpose: The main objective of this research paper is to develop and test the conceptual model relating to supply chain management (SCM) adoption and execution drivers, identified through studying or reviewing the literature. Offering a scale of measurement that functionalizes constructs in this model, empirically verifies the antecedents that influence the adoption and execution of SCM, and provides help to management to focus on SCM processes and conditions that need to be prioritized to gain success in acceptation and implementation of SCM.
Methodology:  Conceptual model is examined empirically based on data that was collected through a survey of 67 experienced supply chain managers of biggest firms within the Manchester of Asia, Faisalabad. 
Results: Using SEM statistical technique, the hypothesised hierarchical order of three intimate factors is verified: “internal SCM conditions” that influence “joint or external SCM conditions”, which make effect on “SCM related processes”. Organizations which embrace such steps will enjoy the strict and appropriate road for the execution of SCM.
Research implications: These survey results represent the views of biggest firms in a country’s supply chain setting. The findings give a focus for personnel, financial, and management endeavours to increase consolidation within supply chain and improve competitiveness. 
Research contribution: The importance of this paper is that it gives empirical resulting proof of the factors that affect the acceptation and implementation of SCM.
Future Research: The data was of cross-sectional in nature and future studies should consider longitudinal data. Further, research variables are only internal and external conditions, further influencing factors like partners and their dimensions like power and trust can also be included in this model to explore in depth.

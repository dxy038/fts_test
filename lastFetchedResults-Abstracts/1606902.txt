The optimal design of the renewable energy system can significantly improve the economical and technical performance of power supply. In this paper, the technical-economic optimization study of a stand-alone hybrid PV/wind system (HPWS) in Corsica Island is presented.

ore, the primary objective of this study is to estimate the appropriate dimensions of a stand-alone HPWS that guarantee the energy autonomy of a typical remote consumer with the lowest levelised cost of energy (LCE). A secondary aim is to compare the performance and the optimal sizing of two system configurations. Finally, to study the impact of the renewable energy potential quality on the system size, the optimum dimensions of system are defined for five sites in Corsica Island. In this context, a complete sizing model is developed, able to predict the optimum system configuration on the basis of LCE. Accordingly, an integrated energy balance analysis is carried out for the whole time period investigated.

mulation results indicate that the hybrid system is the best option for all the sites considered in this study, yielding lower LCE. Thus, it provides higher system performance than PV or wind systems alone. The choice of the system configuration type affects the state of charge variation profile, especially at low wind potential sites, while the system size and the LCE are significantly influenced. It is shown that the LCE depends largely on the renewable energy potential quality. At high wind potential site, more than 40% of the total production energy is provided by the wind generator, while at low wind potential sites, less than 20% of total production energy is generated by the wind generator.

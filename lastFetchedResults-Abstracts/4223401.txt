In this paper we present a novel approach to add collaborative autonomic management facilities to component-based applications. We introduce an autonomic container having the needed generic functionalities for autonomic management in dynamic environments. The purpose of this container is to discharge the application developer from the burden of the non-functional facilities of management in order to focus merely on the business of the application. We give an architectural description of an applicationÂ´s components, and encapsulate each component in its own autonomic container. Here in, we described the different relationships that could occur between the different containers and how these relationships allow the collaboration of the containers in order to full-fill a global objective.

Objective (s): To evaluate the impact of training programs based on BASNEF model on blood pressure.
Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study that carried out on primary hypertension. The sampling method was multi-stage sampling. In the first stage 20 public health centers were randomly selected and randomly divided in two control and interventional groups. Then in each group based on age and sex 96 patient (n=96) were randomly selected. Data collection tool was a questionnaire. The intervention group received an educational program based on BASNEF model. Data were collected at baseline and 2 months after educational intervention.
Results: There was a significant difference between two groups regarding means of scores of self-care behaviors, subjective norms, and enabling factors after intervention. Also in interventional group mean score of systolic pressure was reduced from 138.9 to 125.4 and diastolic pressure was reduced from 85.15 to 80.57.
Conclusion: The findings showed that training based on BAZNEF model was useful in promotion of preventive behaviors and decreased systolic and diastolic pressure in hypertension.

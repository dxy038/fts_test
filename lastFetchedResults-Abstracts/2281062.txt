The objective of this study was to evaluate ether extract (EE) concentrations, pigments, and wax in forages (n = 14), concentrates (n = 23), and cattle feces (n = 100) using extraction methods recommended by Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC; method 920.39) and American Oil Chemist's Society (AOCS; method Am 5-04). The EE contents were compared by adjusting a linear regression model for each sample type. For the feces and forage samples, the EE contents produced by the AOCS method were greater (P&lt;0.05) compared to those obtained using the AOAC method. No differences between methods were observed in EE content of concentrates (P&gt;0.05). Concentration of vegetable pigments and wax were evaluated by using analysis for variance. Vegetable pigments were lower (P&lt;0.05) in the post-extraction residues using the AOCS method, than the AOAC method, indicating greater participation of vegetable pigments in the EE. No differences were observed between the methods in wax concentration of the post-extraction residues (P&gt;0.05). The quantification method of the EE content that is recommended by AOCS is not suggested for analyses of forage and feces of ruminants because it possibly increases the removal of non-fatty material, mostly pigments, in comparison to the method recommended by AOAC.

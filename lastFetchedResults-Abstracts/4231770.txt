In this paper, the scores of Holland and vocational aptitude assessment test and some other information are used on the models of seeker-to-job satisfaction and job-to-seeker satisfaction to calculate the specific satisfaction scores. Satisfaction models use structural equation model (SEM) to get the importance of each factor weight distribution, and to calculate the satisfaction scores on the basis of the weights. Based on the two models of satisfaction, the system uses multi-objective optimization model to get the best match of job seekers and posts. The related system uses B/S structure, and is based on SQL Server2005, using ASP.net technology to support business users match the n job seekers and m jobs and obtain the optimal solution.

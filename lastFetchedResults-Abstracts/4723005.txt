In this research, the OIVLE (Ontology Inference for Virtual Learning Environments) was designed starting from the FOAF, Daml_time y Knowledge ontologies. OIVLE´s objective is to infer knowledge in virtual learning environments. In order to prove OIVLE´s efficiency, some experiments were conducted on the teaching-learning-process of the Mathematical Calculus course which is taken in the third semester of the Electronics and Telecommunications Program at the Universidad Te&#769;cnica Particular de Loja during the term April-August, 2011 (Mathematical Calculus). The results of the conceptualization of the teaching-learning process obtained by using OIVLE were very encouraging.

In this paper, a joint uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) framework for wireless mobile camera networks over an OFDMA-based infrastructure is proposed. On the UL, this system collects unicast real-time video streams from mobile wireless camera stations (CSs) and forwards them to a control center. On the DL, the aggregated video streams are multicast to multiple mobile stations (MSs) to facilitate monitoring of the same video scenes. A target bit rate is set for each UL video stream, based on an objective function that includes both the quality of experience (QoE) and popularity of video contents as key criteria. A QoE-driven scheduling and resource allocation policy at the MAC/PHY layers, and a real-time scalable video layer adaptation algorithm in the APP layer are proposed. On the DL, a previously published opportunistic layered multicasting scheduling algorithm is applied. Simulation results demonstrate that this proposed novel architecture can significantly enhance both the spectral efficiency and the QoE of users in both UL and DL directions.

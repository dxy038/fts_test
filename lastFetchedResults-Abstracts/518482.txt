Background and objective: Although several researches have focused one the impact of dislipidemia in HCV chronic infection, few studies have been done regarding this issue in asymptomatic HBV carriers. We aimed to 1) assess the prevalence of dislipidemia , and 2) investigate the associated demographic and clinical factors with dislipidemia, in asymptomatic HBV carriers referring to TBTO (Tehran blood transfusion organization) during 1996-2003

Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, 1030 charts for asymptomatic HBV carriers from referees to TBTO were reviewed. Demographic data, medical history, risk factors of blood born infections, and lipid measures were registred. Hypercholestrolemia (> 200ml/dl) hypertriglyceridemia (>150ml/dl), any dislipidemia and mixed dislipidemia was determined.

Results: Prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, any dislipidemia and mixed dislipidemia were 34.8%, 32.9%, 52.9% and 14.8%. Age, marital status and history of diabetes were significantly correlated with hypercholestrolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in male and female were 35.1% and 25.6%, respectively, with a significant difference (p=0.007). Hypertriglyceridemia or any dislipidemia were more prevalent in that birth in Capital in comparison to other cities.

Conclusion: The prevalence of dislipidemia in asymptomatic HBV carriers seems a little higher in comparison to previously published reports in healthy population in Iran. The pattern lipid disorders seem to be similar to those in general population. Further studies are recommended to compare the lipid profile in HBV carriers and general population and also investigating the impact of lipid profile on HBV outcome is recommended.

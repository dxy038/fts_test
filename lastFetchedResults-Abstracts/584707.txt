       Meta-heuristic algorithms as new methods are used in optimization. In this study, the genetic algorithm as a meta-heuristic method was used in irrigation scheduling. Optimization was conducted on the three major crops in the Ghazvin plain, including wheat, barley, and maize, in order to optimize the distribution of the limited available water. The crop evapotranspiration for each major production area was calculated at, respectively, 494.2, 421.3 and 826.6 mm by the Penman-Monteith equation. Then, by using genetic algorithm and determining the variables used in optimization, and formulating the objective function model, the water use efficiency was optimized. Optimization of irrigation scheduling was performed under two conditions of deficit and full irrigation Using the proposed optimization and considering the coefficients of sensitivity to deficit irrigation at different growth stages, the amount of evapotranspiration for wheat, barley and maize, was calculated at, respectively, 442.3, 392.5 and 622.6 mm. Optimum water use efficiency for these three plants was, respectively, 0.93, 0.94 and 1.05. Also, the results showed that different amounts of water can be saved by applying the optimal deficit irrigation to the major crops in this production region and that, with proper planning and management of available water, the expected irrigation network efficiency can be achieved.

The objective of this paper is proposing a general peer-to-peer model based-on social network to illustrate the effect of sub communities in the system. The whole system is divided into several communities based on the contents of the peers and each one is divided into several sub communities. A computer based model is created and social network parameters are calculated in order to show the efficiency of the model. The result confirms that a large community with many highly connected nodes can be substituted with many sub communities with normal nodes.

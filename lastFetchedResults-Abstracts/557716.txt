This study was conducted to determine the best drip irrigation method for pepper cultivation with the objective of water saving and obtaining maximum yield. The study was done during two years. Experimental design was randomized complete blocks design (RCBD) in split plot with four replications. Three different drip irrigation methods; drip irrigation with in-line emitter tubes, drip irrigation (tape), and drip irrigation with porous pipes as main plot and three different amount of water (50, 75 & 100% water requirement) were as sub-plot. The result in the first year showed that the effect of irrigation levels on the characteristics of plant except yield was no significant (?  <  0.01), but the effect of irrigation methods on water use efficiency was significant (?  <  0.05) .In the second year the effect of irrigation levels and irrigation methods on yield was significant (?  <  0.05), but the effects of combination irrigation levels and methods on yield was not significant. The result in two years showed that the pepper is a sensitive plant to water deficit. The drip irrigation (tape) and 100% water requirement treatment had the highest yield and water use efficiency. The result also showed that the porous pipes had no good efficiency. According to the results, the best option for pepper is drip irrigation (tape) with using 100% water requirement.

Dynamical Optimization problem of electromechanical coupling system refers to mathematics, electrics and other cross subject. It gathers mechanism, electrics, hydraulic pressure, automation and computer technology, and is representative multi-input, multi-output, non-linearity, tight coupling, uncertain system. Furthermore, because objective function is the solution of dynamics equations in electromechanical coupling system dynamics differential equations, expression of objective function of mechanical system design parameter or control system parameter are unable to be obtained. Optimal policy based on gradient is disabled in optimization of electromechanical system. In this paper, electromechanical coupling system, numerical controlled two-dimension workbench&#8217;s differential equations have been deduced by Lagrange&#8212;Maxwell equation based on energy that include mechanism, servomotor and controller. Secondly, differential equations have been solved with a robust method &#8212; Newmark method efficiently. At last, control parameters of speed loop and displacement loop have been optimized with complex genetic algorithm of continuous solution space. The results of computer simulation show the optimal control of mechanism velocity, displacement and torque of the servomotor. Optimization problem for dynamics of electromechanical coupling system has preferable solution, as well as this method is in possession of wide potential application in design of mechanotronics equipments.

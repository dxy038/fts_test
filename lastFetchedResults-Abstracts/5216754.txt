An investigation on mixing real-time and non-real-time services in UTRA is presented. The main objective of this work is to observe and understand how service characteristics of bit-rate, mean connection duration, required E<sub>b</sub>/I<sub>0</sub> and delay tolerance, influence the performance of radio resource management (RRM) in supporting mixed real-time and non-real-time services

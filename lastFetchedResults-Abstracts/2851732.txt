In order to study uncertainty and intermittent characteristics of wind power and wave power, this paper proposes an integrated wind- and wave-power generation system fed to a power grid or connected with an isolated load using a DC micro grid. The studied integrated system consists of a wind-power generator, a wave-power generator, a bidirectional DC/DC converter, and a grid-tied inverter. An energy-storage device is connected to the DC side of the proposed DC micro grid through a bi-directional DC/DC converter. Both wind-and wave-power generation systems are modeled and simulated using the written program based on MATLAB/Simulink. Steady-state and dynamic responses of the studied system under various operating conditions are carried out. To examine the fundamental operating characteristics of the proposed integrated system, a laboratory-scale platform is also established. The experimental results reveal that the studied integrated system can maintain stable operation to supply power under different operating conditions using the proposed DC micro grid.

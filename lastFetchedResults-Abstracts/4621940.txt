The paper proposes that collaborative assembly is a process of on-line editing, modifying and managing products assembly information tree and converting it into graphics, analyzes the features of collaborative assembly system, points out the objective of collaborative design and brings forward the multi-level collaborative resolution and gives mode chart of layered collaboration. It brings forward a group of custom protocols including assembly operation subject protocol for realizing collaborative assembly activity, as well as the mixed construction mode of collaborative assembly system. At last, it implements assembly to specific product on the self-developed integrated network platform covering modeling, assembly and emulation, from which the result indicates that the layered collaborative resolution and mixed development mode presented in this paper are advantageous to collaborative assembly in distributed areas.

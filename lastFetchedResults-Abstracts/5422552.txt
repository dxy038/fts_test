The large phase angle allowance design method of multi-objective optimal control system and a first class new type non-linear controller are presented. Optimizing the liner optimal system by means of these results, a multi-objective optimal system with performance better than linear optimal system can by obtained. In this paper, an example of radar servo system designed with large phase angle allowance multi-objective optimal design method is given. The performance checked by computer simulation shows that the performance of multi-objective optimal system is better than that of linear optimal system. The design method is simple and easy, universal and suitable for engineering design

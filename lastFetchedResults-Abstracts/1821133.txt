Objective
ntify the age- and sex-related changes in the rat condylar cartilage and subchondral bone.
s
s were obtained at the ages of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 months. For each sex, the temporomandibular joints tissue blocks from four rats were subjected to histological assessment of cartilage thickness and subchondral bone architecture; for the remaining three rats, the mandibular condyles were delivered for gross measurement and evaluation of the mineralization and architecture properties of the subchondral bone by means of micro-CT.
s
decrease of cartilage thickness but increase of subchondral bone density occurred respectively from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4 months old in female and 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 months old in male (P &lt; 0.05), whereas rapid changes of subchondral bone architecture occurred from 3 to 4 months old in both sexes (P &lt; 0.05). The significant enlargement of condyle size occurred at 4 or 5 months old in female but at 5 or 6 months in male (P &lt; 0.05).
sion
tudy demonstrated that the rapid developmental changes of rat condylar cartilage and subchondral bone primarily occurred before 4 months of age, resulting in thinner cartilage but larger and thicker subchondral bone, and they were followed by rapid growth in condylar size. Sex differences were identified that the endochondral ossification of fibrocartilage and formation of subchondral bone were faster in female than in male rats, leading to the earlier enlargement of condyle in female than in male.

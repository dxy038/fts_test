This paper deals with current control in switched reluctance motors with an objective of maximizing torque generation. First, the structure of a hybrid controller is recalled. This controller, which is a combination of an on-off and a PI controller, is efficient for controlling SRMs using square wave current pulses. Next, advantages and drawbacks of this controller with high current dynamics are detailed. Finally, an enhanced structure of this controller overcoming these drawbacks is presented. The advantages of the new controller are detailed and validated by simulation.

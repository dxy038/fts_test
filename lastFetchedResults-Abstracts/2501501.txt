Objective: Although key roles for dietary vitamin E (VITE) and fatty acid (FA) in fertility
have been confirmed, limited data are available on the effects of VITE alone, or a constant
level of VITE supplemented by dietary omega-6 and omega-3 FAs in combination on male
reproduction. Consequently in this paper, the effects of VITE, sunflower oil, fish oil and
their combination on rat sperm were investigated.
Materials and Methods: We divided 50 mature male Wistar rats into 5 groups (n=10) in
a experimental completely randomized design for eight weeks: i. Control (CTR): standard
diet; ii. Vitamin E diet (VITE): 2 times greater than recommendations; iii. Sunflower
oil group (n-6) [gavaged with 0.5 ml/day/rat sunflower oil+VITE diet]; iv. Fish oil group
(n-3): [gavaged with 0.5 ml/day/rat fish oil+VITE diet] and v. n-3+n-6 group [gavaged
with 0.3 ml fish oil/day/rat+0.2 ml sunflower oil/day/rat+VITE diet]. The sperm parameters
were measured by computer assisted semen analyzer (CASA). All data were
analyzed with SPSS software.
Results: Feed intake decreased in groups which were administered sunflower oil
compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). The groups which received only VITE or
fish oil+VITE had a significantly higher concentration of sperm compared with the n-
6+n-3 and CTR group (P < 0.05). VITE and n-3 showed significant improved progressive
motility compared to the CTR group, whereas the n-6 and n-6+n-3 groups were
in the middle (P < 0.05). The highest sperm kinematic parameters were observed in
the VITE only group. There was no strong correlation between sperm parameters and
blood lipid profiles.
Conclusion: Dietary VITE and fish oil+VITE can improve sperm quality. Our findings can
be a focus for improvements in sperm quantity and motility in fertile animals using only
dietary VITE.

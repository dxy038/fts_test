Monitoring message workflow transmission is a very challenging problem, especially in pervasive environments, mainly because of the wide range of unexpected events (e.g. Human and material resources unavailability) and context changes (e.g. Source and target localizations) that may occur at run-time. In this paper, we propose an information system and services orchestration framework enabling intelligent message routing policy adaptation. Our objective is to build a reliable routing strategy that can autonomously and intelligently adapt its own behavior and decisions according to source and target context changes as well as to controlled message status (e.g. Exceeded deadlines for message reception). We present a solution that emphasizes some cutting-edge characteristics that we believe are crucial for enhancing the quality of message communication, such as intelligence, controllability, scalability, adaptivity and personalization. The routing decisions can be adapted at different levels of decision-making such as message itinerary, delay for message treatment, etc., by means of advanced AI methods that we detail for some of the most sensitive self-adaptive services.

Purpose
The objective of this study was to describe the radiological and clinical features of gefitinib-induced pneumonitis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Materials and methods
Five patients who suffered dyspnea after gefitinib treatment were selected. Chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) findings, along with clinical course, were evaluated.
Results
Patients complained of subacute dyspnea and hypoxia. Three patients improved after discontinuation of gefitinib, while remaining two showed no response. Unilateral or bilateral ground glass opacity was observed on chest radiographs and CT.
Conclusion
Radiological findings of gefitinib-induced pneumonitis were nonspecific, but radiologists should be aware of this adverse reaction, which can appear during the treatment in NSCLC patients.

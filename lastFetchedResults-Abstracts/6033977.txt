Anti Air Warfare (AAW) is a complex problem because of highly uncertain battlefield and fast engagement tempo. With decision support system in support of decision making process, the quantified AAW result can benefit commander´s decision. Objective of this paper is to develop an analytical simulation model based upon logical engagement process that can calculate asset´s AAW performance in the defending air target scenario. Case study as with FFG-7 against single inbound missile analysis reveals the result that FFG-7 has 0.957 successful defenses. The limitation of this model is that it is not able to deal with a larger scope of engagement scenario such as the coordinated AAW operations.

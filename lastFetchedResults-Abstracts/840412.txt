The objective of this study was to analyze the association of somatic cell score (SCS) with milk, fat and protein yields across parities. Records of production traits and somatic cell counts (SCC) from first, second and third parity that were collected by the Animal Breeding Center of Iran from 1993 to 2010 were used. All animals were grouped into six classes according to SCC and production traits were evaluated in these SCC classes. To obtain an approximate normal distribution, SCC records were transformed on the base of Loge to somatic cell score (LSCS, the lactation mean of the natural log of test-day somatic cell count). A single trait animal model that LSCS was fitted as covariate was used to assess relations of SCS with produc-tion traits in fist, second and third parities. Effect of SCS on production traits in all of parities was negative and significant (P < 0.05). Ranges of depressing effects on milk, fat and protein production were 107.78-220.41, 2.32-7.08 and 2.1-5.2 kg per 1 unit increase in SCS.

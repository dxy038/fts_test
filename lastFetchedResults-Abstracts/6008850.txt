The object of this paper is to present a model of intelligent and mutant autonomous agents (J. Sallatin, 1997), dedicated to the computer-assisted maintenance. We will approach in this paper only the autonomous side of their behaviour. Conceived to manage an information expert system called CONRAD (communication network request adaptator device), they have the role of dealing with the dynamics of decision of intervention, according to the interventions to be achieved and by taking account of the gradual changes of the behaviours of the managers with respect to tasks similar but carried out in environments as eternal transformation (ageing of the machines, risks of the availability of human and material, political resources change, the needs for production etc). In this context, we will be interested in particular in the cybernetic behaviour of the agents, equipped for the circumstance with relational intelligence and behavioural manipulator, having for objective to create associations of strong agents by the power of the group and consequently exceeding the specific failures to each agent. These agents will bear the name of ConRaider

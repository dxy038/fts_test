A major objective in the design of vehicle propulsion systems is to maximise the power to weight ratio and hence performance, in particular, acceleration. With increasing concern for the environment, a requirement for energy efficiency and pollution abatement is being overlaid on performance targets, often leading to conflicting objectives. Here, the author describes how with modern developments in electric vehicle technology, such conflicts can be resolved through the optimal design of the primary power source and energy storage facility

This paper describes a touch-based PDA interface for mobile robot teleoperation and the objective user evaluation results. The interface is composed of three screens; the vision-only screen, the sensor-only screen, and the vision with sensory overlay screen. The vision-only screen provides the robotÂ´s camera image. The sensor-only screen provides the ultrasonic and laser range finder sensory information. The vision with sensory overlay screen provides the image and the sensory information in concert. A user evaluation was conducted. Thirty-novice users drove a mobile robot using the interface. Participants completed three tasks, one with each screen. The purpose of this paper is to present the user evaluation results related to the collected objective data.

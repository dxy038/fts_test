Voronoi cells and the notion of natural neighbours are used to develop a  nite di erence method for
the di usion operator on arbitrary unstructured grids. Natural neighbours are based on the Voronoi
diagram, which partitions space into closest-point regions. The Sibson and the Laplace (non-Sibsonian)
interpolants which are based on natural neighbours have shown promise within a Galerkin framework
for the solution of partial di erential equations. In this paper, we focus on the Laplace interpolant with
a two-fold objective:  rst, to unify the previous developments related to the Laplace interpolant and
to indicate its ties to some well-known numerical methods; and secondly to propose a Voronoi cell
 nite di erence scheme for the di usion operator on arbitrary unstructured grids. A conservation law in
integral form is discretized on Voronoi cells to derive a  nite di erence scheme for the di usion operator
on irregular grids. The proposed scheme can also be viewed as a point collocation technique. A detailed
study on consistency is conducted, and the satisfaction of the discrete maximum principle (stability) is
established. Owing to symmetry of the Laplace weight, a symmetric positive-de nite sti ness matrix
is realized which permits the use of e cient linear solvers. On a regular (rectangular or hexagonal)
grid, the di erence scheme reduces to the classical  nite di erence method. Numerical examples for
the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and
convergence of the  nite di erence scheme

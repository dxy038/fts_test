In this paper, a novel multiobjective optimization method based on a genetic-fuzzy algorithm (GFA) is proposed. The new GFA method is used for optimal design of a switched reluctance motor (SRM) with two objective functions: high efficiency and low torque ripple. The results of the optimal design for an 8/6, four-phase, 4 kW, 250 V, 1500 r.p.m. SRM show improvement in both efficiency and torque ripple of the motor

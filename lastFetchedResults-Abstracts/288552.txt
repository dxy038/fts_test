A rare case of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) causing unilateral thickening of meninges, is described here. The 50 year old male is presented with hemicranial headache and unilateral multiple cranial nerve involvement without any long tract signs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan including enhanced studies showed a hemicranial thickening of the meninges. Biopsy of the meninges revealed tuberculosis. The patient improved gradually on antitubercular treatment (ATT). Follow-up at 6 months revealed significant improvement in neurological status. Though tuberculous involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is very common in India, hemicranial meningeal involvement has never been reported.

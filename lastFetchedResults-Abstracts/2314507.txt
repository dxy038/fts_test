The main objective of the present study is to further our understanding of the influence of ambient temperature, freezing water conductivity and nature of applied voltage on the surface flashover of ice. Flashover tests were carried out using two metallic hemispherical capped rods 12 mm in diameter, separated by an ice surface. The distance between the electrodes was 18 mm. Ice surface flashover voltage was determined under alternating, DC-positive and DC-negative voltages using a method based on 50% withstand voltage. The results obtained show that flashover voltage on ice surfaces decreases with an increase in ambient temperature and freezing water conductivity. Moreover, flashover voltage depends on the nature of the applied voltage.

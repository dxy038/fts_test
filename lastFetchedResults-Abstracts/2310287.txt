The objective of this research was to describe the mechanical behavior of soil under the action of a tillage tool, with the purpose of finding a relation between the tool geometry and the resultant soil structure. The problem was solved using fundamental principles of soil mechanics and force equilibrium analysis. As a result, a mathematical model was developed which describes three stress zones within the cut soil volume: shear failure, tension failure, and no internal failure. The model was programmed into a computer to generate maps of normal and shear stresses to visualize the three failure zones. The model was tested by cutting soil with flat tillage tools in a laboratory soil bin, and it proved to provide reliable predictions of the pattern of soil shear and tension failure.

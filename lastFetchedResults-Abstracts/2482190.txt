Objective: Previous suicide interventional studies are controversial in their results. The present study
compared brief intervention and contact (BIC), with treatment as usual (TAU) in their influence on the repetition
of suicide attempts 6-month after the index suicide attempt.
Methods: Adults who had attempted suicide were assigned two groups randomly: 311 in the TAU and 321 in
the BIC. The brief intervention and contact contained a brief one-hour psycho-educational session combined
with follow-up contacts by phone calls or visits after discharge. We used Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA, and
Chi-Square for analysis of variables.
Results: The brief intervention and contact did not significantly reduce the repeated suicide attempts, but the
patients' need to get support increased significantly (alpha value = 63.67, p < 0.001) compared to the treatment as
usual group. Also, the brief intervention and contact group patients tried to get support from outpatient/inpatient
services, relatives, friends or by telephone contact to a significantly larger extent (alpha value = 69.2, p < 0.001)
compared to the treatment as usual group.
Conclusion: brief intervention and contact seems to have an effect on the patients' attitude towards seeking
support from outpatient/inpatient services, relatives and friends.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the dietary and anthropometric profiles of the Brazilian amputee soccer players during the training period before the world soccer amputee championship, according to their positional roles in the game.
Methods

Fifteen male athletes participated in the study. Data on height, weight, skinfold thickness, and circumferences were collected to assess nutritional status. Dietary intake was obtained by using 6-d dietary records, analyzed by a Nutrition Support Program for total energy intake, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals. One-way analysis of variance was used to identify differences in groups (P < 0.05).
Results

Midfield players were heavier than the others, and this difference may have been caused by a large quantity of subcutaneous fat. Dietary data showed a low carbohydrate intake and high protein and fat intakes. No athlete met the recommendations for vitamin E, and forward players did not meet recommendations for calcium.
Conclusion

Amputee athletes need an individualized nutritional orientation and the lack of information about disabled sports and athletes highlights the need for more studies in this area.

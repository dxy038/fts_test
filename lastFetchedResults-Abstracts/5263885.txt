An integrated CMOS 60 GHz phased-array antenna module supporting symmetrical 32 TX/RX elements for wireless docking is described. Bidirectional architecture with shared blocks, mm-wave TR switch design with less than 1dB TX loss, and a full built in self test (BIST) circuits with 5deg and +/-1dB measurement accuracy of phase and power are presented. The RFIC size is 29mm<sup>2</sup>, consuming 1.2W/0.85W at TX and RX with a 29dBm EIRP at -19dB EVM and 10dB NF.

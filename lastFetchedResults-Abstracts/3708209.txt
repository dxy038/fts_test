Tracing watermarking has been recently proposed as a technique to provide a blind measure of the quality of service of the communication link, focusing on multimedia communication scenarios. 3G communication scenarios, where each customer transmits both voice and MPEG-4 video sequences in real time, have been considered. Typical video-phone call consists of close shots of speakers, framing their face in the foreground. For such particular application, a novel colour space (YST) is adopted to minimise the perceptual distortions on face coding introduced by watermarking. In the YST space, the luminance component (Y) is the same as in conventional YUV space, whereas the vectors S and T lie within the chrominance (UV) plane. The S (skin) component is a linear combination of U and V obtained as the ´average´ chrominance estimated from an assorted set human faces to achieve a reasonable generalisation. The third component, T, is defined as orthogonal to the YS plane. The results show the benefits obtained in digital watermarking by the new representation against the conventional approach. In fact, the sensitivity of the YST representation outperforms the conventional one in terms of objective (mean square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio) and subjective (video-quality metrics) indicators.

This paper proposes the demonstration of a comprehensive novel acquisition infrastructure based on standard 10G Ethernet interface technology. This infrastructure is suitable for digital cinematography as well as HD production workflows and comprises camera, mobile solid state recorder and monitor all connected through a 10G Ethernet based network. Optical Ethernet technology enables bidirectional, high speed, long distance networking at affordable cost as conventional IT equipment - such as switches - are fully supported. Interface and file formats enable versatile metadata support and provide a back channel to the camera for control purposes. Advances in solid state storage capacity in combination with interface performance eliminate any need for costly and quality compromising compression.

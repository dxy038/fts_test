Functional capacity assessment is carried out to measure the functional limitations of a subject. While the clinical assessment can be validated against various standards, quantifying the assessment and achieving an objective, repeatable, and reliable score in the clinical assessment is a challenge. Current methods are subjective. The Progressive Iso inertial Lifting Evaluation (PILE) is a lifting test developed for functional capacity assessment. The primary aim of this study is to improve reliability and repeatability of PILE through objective measurement of patientÂ´s performance. This is achieved by recording and analysing the movement of a patient by a motion capture system based on a network array of inertial wireless sensors. Various analyses conducted on the data indicate that the captured data provides adequate information to objectively determine the failure of the subject to maintain correct posture and to identify the onset of muscle fatigue within the PILE assessment.

Air traffic flow management (ATFM) is a service established with the objective of contributing to safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic. The ATFM is divided into three phases. (1) The strategic phase takes place between 18 month and seven days prior to the day of operation and includes research, planning and coordination activities. The output of this phase is the capacity plan for the following year. (2) The pre-tactical phase is applied during 6 days prior to the days of operation and consists of planning and coordination activities. The output is the ATFM daily plan. (3) The tactical phase is applied on the day of the operation. This phase updates the daily plan according to the actual traffic and capacity. The management of the traffic is achieved through slot allocation.

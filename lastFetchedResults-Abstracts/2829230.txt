Electrical energy generating (fuel cell) or energy storage device (such as battery and ultra-capacitor) are commonly used to provide the propulsion energy required in vehicles. Design of these energy generating and storing components in terms of efficiency, lifetime, cost, size, weight, and also fuel economy is highly important. In this paper the number of fuel cells, batteries, and ultra-capacitors in a fuel-cell electric vehicle are optimized. In the optimization method, the power converter and components mass and cost are considered as optimization parameters. In order to achieve this, an objective function is written based on the above-mentioned parameters. Simulation results verify the optimal design. Finally, for better understanding the results are compared with previous related works.

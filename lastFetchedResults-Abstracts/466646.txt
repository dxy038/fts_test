Objective: Circulating adrenomedullin is increased in pregnancy, and placental and fetal membranes participate significantly in its secretion. Recent studies have suggested a potential role for this peptide in the regulation of fetoplacental circulation and placental hormonal secretion. Because adrenomedullin acts also as a uterorelaxant in rats, this study was designed to investigate whether fetoplacental adrenomedullin production changes with human labor, either at term or preterm. Study Design: Eighty pregnant women grouped according to gestational age and presence of labor were studied. Adrenomedullin concentrations in plasma, amniotic fluid, and placental tissue extracts were measured by means of radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemistry. In addition, the ability of amnion and chorion-decidua to secrete adrenomedullin was investigated in vitro. Results: Adrenomedullin concentrations in amniotic fluid were higher in preterm labor, whereas no differences were found in adrenomedullin expression or concentrations in tissues or in maternal and fetal plasma between vaginal delivery or elective cesarean section, both at term and preterm. During term labor (8 patients), maternal plasma adrenomedullin concentration decreased with advancing cervical dilatation, being 173 pg/mL at the beginning of the active stage of labor and 57 pg/mL at the time of delivery. Adrenomedullin concentration in the medium of amnion- and chorion-deciduaâ€“cultured cells was higher after vaginal delivery. Conclusion: These results suggest that a decrease in adrenomedullin production is not involved in the onset of labor in human subjects but rather that it may play a role other than that of a myometrial relaxant in human parturition.

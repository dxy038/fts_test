The objective of this paper is to experimentally study the deformation behavior of the alloys of polycarbonate (PC) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) at elevated temperatures and high strain rates. Four kinds of PC/ABS alloys with the ratio of PC to ABS being 80:20, 60:40, 50:50 and 40:60 and three different strain rates 8.0 × 102 s−1, 2.7 × 103 s−1 and 1.0 × 104 s−1 are considered. The Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) experiments are carried out at 293 K and 343 K, respectively. The curves of engineering stress and engineering strain and true stress and true strain are obtained for the PC/ABS alloys at different temperatures and different strain rates, respectively. The effects of temperature, strain rate and the fraction of ABS on the deformation behavior of PC/ABS alloys are discussed in details, and then a temperature and strain rate-dependent phenomenological constitutive model for PC/ABS alloys is developed.

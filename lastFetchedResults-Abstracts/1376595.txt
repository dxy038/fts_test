Background and Objective: There is an inevitable relationship between nurses' health and their lifestyle. Therefore, we intended to determin nursesâ€™ lifestyle and its' relationship with some personal- professional characteristics. 
Material and Methods: This descriptive-analytical investigation was conducted on 391 nurses selected via multi-stage random sampling in the Hospitals affiliated to Golestan University of medical sciences. The data was collected by a nurses lifestyle questionnaire having 6 subscales (internal consistency ?=0.87 and stability r= 0.897). The data  was analyzed by SPSS16 soft ware using independent t test, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests( p < 0.05).
Results: Of 391 , 20.2% were  male and 79.2% female, and 85.4% have worked  in rotation shift.  The nurses (36.3 %) working experience was 6-10 years. The majority (78.1%) had optimal lifestyle. The highest score belonged to competency subscale (92.17%) and the lowest to personal life management subscale (64.82%). There was a significant relationship between a number of lifestyle subscales and some personal-professional characteristics such as nurse position, 
Employing condition, work shift, overtime, night shift and holiday shifts (p? 0.05).
Conclusion: There is a relationship between nurses' lifestyle and some of the personal-professional status.  Given that some professional conditions can decrease the personal life management and the role management of healthy lifestyle, we recommend that managers should be careful about working programs to provide healthy lifestyle.

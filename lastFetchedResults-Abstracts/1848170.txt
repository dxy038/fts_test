Objective
tudy investigates the use of contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted, water-selective spectralâ€“spatial 3D gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetization transfer (3DSSMT) for detecting breast cancer in patients with intraparenchymal silicone.
sion
selective 3DSSMT provides superior fat and silicone suppression in patients with free silicone as compared with conventional fat saturation. It enables direct, high-quality, high-spatial-resolution, T1-weighted breast MRI of contrast enhancement without the need for subtraction processing and aids diagnosis of cancer in the breast with free silicone.

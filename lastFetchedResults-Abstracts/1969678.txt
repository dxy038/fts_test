The objective of this work was to conduct an activity-guided isolation of antibacterial compounds from Rabdosia serra. The ethanol extracts of R. serra leaf and stem were partitioned sequentially into petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, butanol and water fractions, respectively. The ethanol extract of leaf evidenced broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacterial, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. The ethyl acetate fractions of leaf and stem exhibited strong inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria, and were then purified further. On the basis of antibacterial assay-guided purification, three phenolic compounds (rosmarinic acid, methyl rosmarinate and pedalitin) and four C-20 oxygenated ent-kauranes (effusanin E, lasiodin, rabdosichuanin D and a new compound namely effusanin F) were obtained, whose contents were determined by HPLC analysis. The broth microdilution method confirmed the important inhibition potential of C-20 oxygenated ent-kauranes with low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Effusanin E, lasiodin and effusanin F could be useful for the development of new antibacterial agents.

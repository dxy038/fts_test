The third generation (3G) wireless networks are characterized by connectivity in anytime, anywhere, enhanced data services, and higher data rates to mobile users. It is an important and to be worthy of research issue which elucidates that how to provide mobile users for roaming among different access technology networks through seamless handoff mechanism. IPv6 plays an important role in wireless access networks. To integrate with heterogeneous wireless networks, adopting IP backbone is the best solution. Moreover, it supports that the mobile users roam seamlessly by mobile IP technology. The major objective of this paper is to propose an integrated architecture for UMTS network and IEEE 802.11 WLAN. We also propose a mobile IPv6 based seamless handoff strategy for heterogeneous wireless networks to provide mobility management between UMTS and IEEE 802.11 WLAN for the mobile users.

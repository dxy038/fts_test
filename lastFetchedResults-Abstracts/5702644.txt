Digital Human Model (DHM) plays an important role in the design field. And how to make a static DHM into a dynamic model would be a critical issue for the application. Anthropometric landmarks are easily visualized by showing the landmark locations on the body. It is a natural extension to create 3D illustrations of the landmarks by placing then on 3D computer generated bodies. Our goal was to create a 3D anthropometric glossary to allow non-professionals a simple way of introducing anthropometric concepts. In addition the anthropometry standards community can use these 3D illustrations to facilitate communications among their members. The main objective of this study was to build up the DHM models, and use the new biomorphic tool to simulate the postures of the real people. Sixty-two individuals were measured 31 female and 31 male. Fours scanning models were obtained to be the standard models. It uses the biomorphic tool to simulate the postures, and then compare the simulated postures with the standard models. Results show that sitting postures need to change three joints of the lower body, so it will increase the distance error with the standard posture. And the distance error with non-landmarks is larger than the posture with landmarks. But from the all the simulated shapes by the biomorphic tool almost fit the standard scanning postures. The biomorphic simulation still shows the similar postures to fit the real body, and try to simulate the real postures with the different products. It will help the application of digital human model for the product design.

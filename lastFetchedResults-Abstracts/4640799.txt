This paper introduces a spectral analysis techniques made from TDD and FDD which are present on the IEEE 802.16 and used by WiMAX in the uplink-downlink bidirectional channels. The simulation model considered in the arrival queue services, the FIFO concept and the simulations were performed considering five applications (Streaming, Download, Web, Email and Small-Transaction) for downlink and uplink. The number of channels on the Base Station varied from 4 to 60, with a throughput of 600 kbps, where the considered efficiency parameter was the minimum number of channels required for each channel pattern. The simulations were performed in three different scenarios for different traffic profiles for downlink and uplink, and the analyzes of the performance, taken as a measure of the efficiency arrival rate and waiting time before the userÂ´s typical applications used in-band technology licensed WiMAX, which follows this pattern. The made analysis allowed identifying, given these traffic conditions, which technique is better recommended. It was further observed that in the data traffic asymmetric, the TDD technique was more efficient, and it was noticed an idleness spectrum in the FDD technique.

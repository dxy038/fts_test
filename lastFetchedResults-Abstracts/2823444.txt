Along with innovative expert technologies that are emerging, the smart grid stands out as an ideal vision for future power systems. In recent years, various studies have highlighted the smart grids in different initiatives, either in the area of network automation or in services aimed at consumers. Pilot projects have been also developed in various countries with different economic and political status, whose main objective is to create a set of sustainable and reliable networks, as well as find energy solutions that meet future needs. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the prospects that smart grids are being developed internationally. Finally, future directions involving smart grid are outlined and conclusions about its current status are compiled.

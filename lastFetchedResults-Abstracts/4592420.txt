The adequate occupation of the computing resources can influence, in a decisive way, the global performance of the system. Therefore, in order to achieve a high performance, it is mandatory to know all the computing resources involved and their respective occupation level in a certain moment. With the objective of improving the system performance, the paper presents the OpenTella model to update the information related to the occupation of resources and the respective analysis of this occupation so that the migration of processes among computers of a same cluster can be completed. With the objective of increasing the scale level in the system and decreasing the number of messages among the computers, this peer-to-peer protocol defines sub-nets, which are clusters that make up a more comprehensive cluster. Thus, groups are defined to interchange information and update the occupation of resources, in order to minimize the communication and to achieve a calculation to balance the load and meet the system needs, resulting in the migration of processes.

The objective of this primarily tutorial item is to describe a general model for the observable data and the appropriate data processing involved in sensing rigid target fields with coherent radars. Any number of radars may be involved, and the scene and each radar may be in any kind of motion-with no restrictions on motion through resolution cells during the coherent processing time of the radars. The motions are assumed to be known. To some extent motion parameters can be estimated from the radar data, e.g., by adaptive parameter adjustments in the data processing; however, this subject is beyond the scope of this discussion. In large measure, the analysis in this item highlights the central conceptual result obtained by J.L. Walker as described in [1] -a major work in radar theory.

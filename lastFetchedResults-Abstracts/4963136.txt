In this research we discussed some reliability allocation methods and reliability optimization in high concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) system design. First, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was applied to look for the representative and adequate effort function in a logic and objective way. Then, a revised effort minimization algorithm was conducted to calculate the promoted reliability of the constituent components of a system under minimum effort demand. An example from the literature was demonstrated and the result shows that the effort function is more objective and the combine process with the revised effort minimization algorithm is available. The feasibilities among the components of a system can be fitted accordingly. Besides, the solving procedure under the request of reaching a systempsilas reliability goal can be processed entirely and effectively. The derived algorithm is also suitable for complex reliability models.

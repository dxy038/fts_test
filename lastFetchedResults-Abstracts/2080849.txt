Objectives
 matrix metalloproteinases are implicated in the pathogenesis of caries and contribute to collagen degradation in resinâ€“dentin interfaces. The objective was to determine if collagen degradation may be modulated by an excess of zinc or zinc chelators.
s
lized and phosphoric acid demineralized human dentin specimens were tested. Chlorhexidine digluconate, doxycycline or ZnCl2 were added to the media. In half of the groups, active exogenous metalloproteinase-2 was incorporated into the solution. C-terminal telopeptide determinations (radioimmunoassay) were performed after 24 h, 1 and 3 weeks.
s
en degradation was prominent in demineralized dentin. Doxycycline fully blocked dentin proteolysis. Chlorhexidine digluconate reduced the degradation at the 24-h period. Zinc in excess strongly inhibits hydrolysis of collagen and its effect was maintained for 3 weeks.
sions
n excess reduces MMP-mediated collagen degradation. The hypothesis that binding of zinc to collagen results in protection of sensitive cleavage sites of metalloproteinases requires further validation.

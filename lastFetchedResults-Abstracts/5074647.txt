This paper focuses on viewpoint planning for 3D active object recognition. The objective is to design a planning policy into a Q-learning framework with a limited number of samples. Most existing stochastic techniques are therefore inapplicable. We propose to use Kriging and bayesian Optimization coupled with Q-learning to obtain a computationally-efficient viewpoint-planning design, under a restrictive sampling budget. Experimental results on a representative database, including a comparison with classical approaches, show promising results for this strategy.

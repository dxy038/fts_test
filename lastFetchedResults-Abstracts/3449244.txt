The main objective of this work is to develop an on-board microprocessor-based device to detect faults in reciprocating combustion engines. This paper discusses two methods of analysis that have been utilized for fault detection. The first method requires the computation of the Fourier transform, while the second is based on the autocorrelation function. Both the methods provide encouraging results for the few cases that have been studied so far.

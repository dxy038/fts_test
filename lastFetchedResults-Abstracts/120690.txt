Euler–Euler simulations of the gas–liquid flow in a square cross-sectioned bubble column with LES (two sub-grid scale models) and the k–ε
model are presented. The sub-grid scale modeling is based on the Smagorinsky kernel in both its original form and the dynamic procedure of
Germano. The attempt has been made to assess the performance of these two sub-grid scale models. The Smagorinsky model with model constant
Cs = 0.12 performs quite well, and gives results almost identical to those given by the dynamic procedure of Germano. The SGS models are modified
to account for bubble induced turbulence (Sato model) and it is observed that it does not change the results much. Predictions are also compared
with the available experimental data. All the non-drag forces (turbulent dispersion force (only for RANS), virtual mass force, lift force) and drag
force were incorporated in the model. An extended k–ε turbulence model has been used with extra source terms introduced to account for the
interaction between the bubbles and the liquid. Though both LES models showed agreement in predictions, the Germano model still can be used
to have estimates of Cs value which are not known a priori. Moreover, if objective is to understand the steady and time averaged features, RANS
can also perform well.

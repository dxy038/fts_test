The study was carried out to survey the effects of Atriplex canescens on soil physiochemical characteristics in Aghzi Gang region of Zarand-Saveh. Considering the research objective, samples were taken from 8 areas in which were planted with A. canescens and 8 no planted (control) areas. Because of dense accumulation of Atriplex shrubs, quadrate area was determined 6*8 m2Quadrates were placed upon randomized-systematic method. Within quadrates, in addition to vegetation variables estimation, soil samples were taken, too. In A. canescens planted areas, soil samples were collected from two depths (0-20, 20-40 cm) under shrubs and opening, while in control areas, samples were taken from 0-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-80 cm layers. Measured soil characteristics included texture, pH, EC, lime, organic matter, potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus. The results show that in plantation areas with A. canescens, soil properties such as amount of potassium, phosphorous, nitrogen, pH, and EC show an increase at depth of 0-20 cm and with increasing depth, plantation effects decreased. In total, plantation effects of A. canescens on soil properties in the study region were evaluated positive.

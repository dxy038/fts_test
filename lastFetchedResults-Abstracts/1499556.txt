As a simple and practical bioclimatic design methodology, solar chimneys are receiving considerable attention for reducing heat gain and inducing natural cooling or heating in both commercial and residential buildings because of their potential benefits in terms of operational cost, energy requirement and carbon dioxide emission. In practical civil buildings, solar chimneys can be installed on the walls and roofs. For the purpose of improving natural ventilation performance and achieving better indoor thermal comfort, solar chimneys are always applied in the form of integrated configurations. Solar chimneys can also be used to combine with natural cooling systems so as to enhance the cooling effect inside buildings. Besides, active solar systems may be utilized to enhance the ventilation performance of solar chimneys. In this paper, the main configurations and the integrated renewable energy systems based on solar chimneys were summarized. Then the suggestions were given. Generally, solar chimney technology has been regarded as an effective and economical design method in low carbon buildings. As for the integrated energy systems based upon solar chimneys, it is still necessary to carry out more experimental investigations to acquire objective data for the system design. Besides, it is suggested to further study the optimization and control strategy of such integrated systems in different climates.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of condensate of food waste (CFW) on nutrient removal in a pilot-scale vertical submerged membrane bioreactor (VSMBR) treating municipal wastewater having total-chemical oxygen demand to total-nitrogen ratio (T-COD/T-N) of 5.5. In this reactor, the average removal efficiencies of T-COD, T-N, and T-P (total-phosphorus) were 96%, 74%, and 78%, respectively at 8-h hydraulic retention time (HRT), 60-day sludge retention time (SRT), and internal recycle rate of 400%. As the CFW was supplemented with 0.86% of the influent flow rate, the T-N and T-P removal efficiencies increased to 81% and 91%, respectively. Accordingly, in batch tests, it was concluded that the supply of CFW improved enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) activity of microorganisms resulting in improvement of nutrient removal efficiency. Under this condition, several kinds of poly-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) were detected inside the cells.

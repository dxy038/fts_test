Studies show that there are significant differences in parity and fertility level in women among the Kurd and Turk populations. The main objective of this paper is to quantify the impact of proximate determinants of fertility of the Kurd and Turk women in Orumieh district using Bongaarts decomposition method. The data for this study is drawn from a survey on ethnicity and fertility which was conducted in Orumieh district in 2007. It covered 768 households and 739 of at least once-married women identified in the households, who were interviewed. A combination of sampling techniques, including cluster and systematic random sampling, was employed. The data gathering technique was that of the structured interview.
Results show that ethnic groups have experienced different levels but similar trends in fertility during 15 years prior to the survey. Despite the reduction in fertility, Kurdish women had higher fertility than those of the Turk during five years that preceded the survey. The application of Bongaarts decomposition method showed differences in the relative fertility inhibiting impact of proximate determinants between ethnic groups. Using contraception and post partum infecundity, respectively, had more share in explaining the difference between the observed fertility (TFR) and total fecundity (TF) of the Turk women while post partum infecundity and using contraception were two factors for their Kurdish counterpart. The result of this study indicates that the analysis of proximate determinates of fertility is necessary to reach an  understanding on the ethnic fertility differentials.

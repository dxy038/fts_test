Solar irradiance and temperature affect the performance of systems using photovoltaic generator. In the same way, it is essential to insure good performances of the installation so that its profitability wonÂ´t be reduced. The objective of this work consists in diagnosing the panels faults and in certain cases in locating the faults using a model, the temperatures, the luminous flow, the speed of the wind, as well as the currents and the tensions. The development of software fault detection on a real installation is performed under the Matlab/Simulink environment.

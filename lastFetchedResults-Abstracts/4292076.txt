Permanently increasing specific loads and rotation velocities of the collector electric machines aggravate the problem of their commutation stability that results in toughening requirements on the mechanical state of collector and brush units. Therefore, both the enterprises-producers of the collector electric machines and the organizations using them run into problem of objective estimation of the collectors profile under dynamic conditions of their operation. Purposeful execution of the construction and the procedure of the collectors manufacturing as well as the control of the behavior of collector and brush units at all stages of technological process of the electric machines manufacturing and during their exploitation is impossible without this problem solving. To solve the problems of experimental and profilometric investigations of collector and brush units the diagnostic system was developed.

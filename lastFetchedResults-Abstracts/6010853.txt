In order to improve precision of the filter´s parameters and performance indexes, meet the real-time requirements, an evolvable hardware structure and design method for an analogue evolvable transconductance filter was presented. Genetic operations, multi-objective fitness functions and migration strategy to multi-objective parallel genetic algorithm was improved. Evolutionary efficiency of the algorithm was improved. Optimization design of the filter was realized by improved multi-objective parallel genetic algorithm. In the course of design of the state variable transconductance filter with high Q value, the in system programmability programmable analog circuits was used, and structure of the four-order bandpass state variable transconductance filter was built by cascade method, which was able to meet performance requests in its stop band, passband, transition band, and the filter´s practicality had been simulated and verified. Values of evolutionary parameters are in line with theoretical values exceedingly, and simulation results are satisfying.

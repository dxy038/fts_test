The transactional cognitive vulnerability to stress
model Hankin & Abramson (Psychological Bulletin,
127:773â€“796, 2001) extends the traditional diathesis-stress
model by proposing that the relationships among cognitions,
depressive symptoms, and stressors are dynamic and bidirectional.
In this study three different pathways among these
variables were assessed simultaneously: (1) cognitive vulnerabilities
and stressors as predictors of depressive symptoms
(vulnerability model), (2) depressive symptoms and
cognitive vulnerabilities as predictors of stressors (stress
generation model), and (3) depressive symptoms and stressors
as predictors of cognitive vulnerabilities (consequence
model). A fully cross-lagged design panel was employed
with 1,187 adolescents (545 girls and 642 boys, Mean Age0
13.42 years) who were assessed at two time points separated
by 6 months. They completed measures of cognitive vulnerabilities
(maladaptive schema domains and negative inferential
style), stressors, and depressive symptoms. Inferential
style and schemas of the disconnection and rejection domain
predicted prospective increases in depressive symptoms.
Initial levels of depressive symptoms and most cognitive
vulnerabilities predicted greater stress generation. Initial
levels of stressors and depressive symptoms predicted an
increase in negative inferential style and maladaptive schema
domains over time. These bidirectional relationships
were mostly similar for boys and girls, although there were
a few gender differences. The findings support a transactional
model with reciprocal relationships among stress,
depressive symptoms, and cognitive vulnerabilities.
Transactional implications for depression interventions
among adolescents are discussed.

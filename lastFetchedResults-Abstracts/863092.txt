Simulation-based surrogate models have been used for a variety of applications in
automotive industry. In this paper, based on the FEM analysis, both of the response surface
model (RSM) and Kriging model are used to optimize an ADI upper control arm, where the
weight of the upper control arm is considered as the design objective, and the maximum
allowable von Mises stress the constraint objective. The initial FEM analysis shows the
stress distribution and maximum stress on the upper control arm under a very severe
loading condition. And, by virtue of the result of FEM analyses, fifty simulations with six
design variables are performed for RSM and Kriging model to construct the approximation
of the weight and maximum stress to obtain the optimum result. The optimized results
obtained by using RSM and KRG are confirmed by a verified FEM analysis. In addition, a
fatigue analysis is carried out to verify the durability the final design.

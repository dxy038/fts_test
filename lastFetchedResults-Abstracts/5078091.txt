The objective is to compare the electrical feeding of conveyor belts in material handling stockyards in low and medium voltage, finding the relations between power, distance and feeding voltage. Several programs and data bases were developed in order to calculate electrical materials and cost. Cost comparison between different technical solutions in low and medium voltages will guide us to the optimal selection of the voltage level, depending on power of each electrical load and distance to the electrical substation.

In this paper, we present and analyze efficient frame synchronization and frequency offset compensation scheme with ternary sequences for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in Rayleigh fading channels. Frame synchronization is an essential procedure for normal operation of the OFDM system because of sensitivity to synchronization errors. And when there are frequency offsets in OFDM frame, the loss of orthogonality occurs and the interference problem among several subcarriers is introduced. These fact leads to the requirement for joint implementation of the frame synchronization and frequency offset compensation. In order to enhance the frame synchronization and frequency offset compensation performances, we add a ternary sequence to OFDM signals in the time domain. The power level of the ternary sequence to be added needs to be low enough in order not to affect a normal operation of the OFDM system. The objective can be achieved successfully based on the correlation characteristics of the ternary sequence.

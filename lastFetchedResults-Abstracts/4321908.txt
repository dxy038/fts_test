The objective of robot calibration is to identify all parameters in a robot model so that the model represents the true robot. Each model has its own set of parameters. The authors prove that regardless of the kinematic model chosen, there are a maximum number of parameters that must be determined, implying that model accuracy cannot be improved by adding parameters. In addition, the authors demonstrate how to model any manipulator so that a minimum size Jacobian is used, thus reducing the computation required for calibration

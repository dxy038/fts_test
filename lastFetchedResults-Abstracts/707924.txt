The objective of this study was to assess if 10 right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound (US) examinations could be used as a minimum standard for training. This was a retrospective review of patients with suspected gallbladder pathology who underwent resident-performed RUQ US before operative or department of radiology evaluation. Two hundred twenty-four patients were examined using resident-performed RUQ US followed by gold standard evaluations. One hundred seventy-eight patients were evaluated by 13 residents who met the “minimum training” standard of 10 prior examinations. The results of resident-performed RUQ US for gallstones and/or cholecystitis are shown subsequently. Previous suggestions that 10 examinations could be used as a minimum standard for training in focused abdominal sonography for trauma examinations cannot be used for RUQ US. The ACEP 2001 guidelines for 25 examinations are more consistent with the learning curve suggested by our data.

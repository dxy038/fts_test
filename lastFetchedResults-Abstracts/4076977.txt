A direct instantaneous force control with improved efficiency for the linear switched reluctance actuator (LSRA) is proposed in this paper. Four-quadrant operation is investigated for application in the active suspension system. Force ripple minimization is considered as the primary objective due to the direct impact on passenger ride comfort. An adaptive force distribution function based on the instantaneous force feedback is proposed to achieve a ripple-free system. The choice of switching parameters for improved operation efficiency is examined. The optimal switching positions are online adjusted with respect to the force demand. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

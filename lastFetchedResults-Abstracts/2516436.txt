Background and Objective: Hippocampus is a part of limbic system and has an important role in memory and learning. Menopause causes failure in the memory and learning in women. Different medicines have been used to improve memory in menopausal women. Nowadays, Herbal medicines due to their fewer side effects are used in treatment of various diseases. Cinnamon is one of these herbal medicines that claimed to improve sexual potential and memory. The aim of the present study was to evaluate Cinnamon hydroalcoholic extract effect on hippocampal histology following ovariectomy (experimental menopause).
Subjects and Methods: 17 adult female mice(30Â±5g) were divided into 3 groups as control, sham(ovariectomized) and treatment. Cinnamon hydroalcoholic extract(200mg/kg) was administrated every other day for 20 days IP. 24 hours after last administration, animals were euthanized, their brain were isolated immediately and were floated in fixative solution. Tissue sections of brain were prepared and stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin(H&E) and studied by light microscopy. 
Results: Ovariectomy increased degenerated cells in CA1 and DG regions of hippocampus significantly(P < 0.05). Treatment with cinnamon prevented these changes and cellular degeneration decreased significantly in comparison with ovariectomized group(P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Cinnamon decreased histological changes following ovariectomy (experimental menopause) in mice hippocampus and it may be a suitable medicine to improve memory and learning in menopausal women.

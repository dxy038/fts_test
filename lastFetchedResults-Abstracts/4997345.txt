The aim of this paper is to develop a fuzzy group programming decision-making method to effectively assess manufacturing cloud. Evidential reasoning approach is applied to aggregate group fuzzy information source provided by organizing group of manufacturing cloud and an agreement result of collaborative decision then can be concluded. Multiple constraints and multiple objective optimization models are constructed for maximization of consumer satisfaction degree, minimization of manufacturing cost and manufacturing service implementation difficulty. Strength pareto evolutionary algorithm is adopted to acquire pareto solutions set. Fuzzy optimal selection method is employed to choose the most feasible solution from pareto solutions set. Finally, a living example related to the manufacturing work of air separation equipment is given to validate the approach we proposed.

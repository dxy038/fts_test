It is required that a high-quality electronic ballasts (EB) for fluorescent lamps should not only have excellent performance, but also have a high reliability. This paper takes the typical circuit structure of electronic ballasts as the subject, establishes its simulation model with Pspice circuit, and makes parameter optimization design of multiple objective function for its input harmonic content, power factor and coefficient of wave peak, which has further enhanced the reliability of the system while keeping the good performance targets.

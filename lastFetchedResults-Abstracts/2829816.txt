This work presents the first advanced level CanSat developed by the University of Brasilia, the LAICAnSat-1. The main objective is to design, build and launch an experimental high altitude balloon CanSat withmeteorology and remote sensing applications. Both the scientific need for a self retrievable radiosonde, with precise and high quality sensors, and a high altitude low-cost remote sensing experimental platform inspired the team on the concept of LAICAnSat-1. This platform has a broad sensor suite that provides information about temperature, pressure, humidity and UV light level. It also has a modular design, based on stacks, allowing other sensors to be easily embedded to the main module. The remote sensing sensor is a small high performance camera, constantly imaging the Earth surface. Those images can be used for several applications, including emergency and quick solutions for monitoring the Amazon forest, Pantanal, and other important biomes, supporting and complementing research projects on remote areas. The control system has four sensors to determine the payload attitude and position. Furthermore, this platform could potentially be exploited by the industry, representing a safe and inexpensive way to test components and circuits in high altitudes, as for instance to certify Commercial Off-The-Shelf electronic components with respect to their behavior under low temperature and pressure. The LAICAnSat-1 represents a preliminary step in the development of complex aerospace projects and is also an important first experience for engineering students.

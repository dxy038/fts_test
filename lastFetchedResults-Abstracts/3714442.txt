In this paper, &#8220;Martini,&#8221; a network interface controller chip for our original network called RHiNET is described. Martini is designed to provide high-bandwidth and low-latency communication with small overhead. To obtain high performance communication, protected user-level zero-copy RDMA communication functions are completely implemented by a hardwired logic. Also, to reduce the communication latency efficiently, we have proposed PIO-based communication mechanisms called &#8220;On-the-fly (OTF)&#8221; and have implemented them on Martini. The evaluation results show that Martini connected to a 64bit/66MHz PCI-bus achieves 470MByte/s maximum bidirectional bandwidth and 1.74 &#956;sec minimum latency on host-to-host memory copying.

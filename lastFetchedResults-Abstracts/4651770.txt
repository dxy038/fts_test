The veracity of land evaluation is tightly related to the reasonable weights of land evaluation factors. A new method is proposed for determining land evaluation factors by combining the subjective and objective weights based on rough sets mining theory in this paper. Objective weight is obtained based on the rough sets theory. On the basis of the experience knowledge and practical applications, decision-makers can choose appropriate experiential factor to adjust the proportion between the subjective and the objective weights in order to get more reasonable and effective weights.

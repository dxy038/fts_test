Background: Thymus caramanicus is an aromatic and perennial plant of Lamiaceae family, which distributes in different areas of Iran. 
Objective: In this study, botanical traits and oil content/chemical composition of Thymus carmanicus Jalas ecotypes are evaluated in natural habitats of Iran.
Methods: Ecotypes of Th. carmanicus were collected from Kerman (Sirch and Rayen), Yazd, Esfahan and Shahrud. In addition, the geographical origins and the botanical traits of ecotypes were recorded. Oils were extracted by hydrodistillation method for 3h and its constituents determined by GC and GC-MS.
Results: The essential oils content (w/w%) of the Kerman-Rayen, Kerman-Sirch, Yazd, Shahrud and Esfahan ecotypes were 2.5%, 1.9%, 2.0%, 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively. 34, 36, 37, 38 and 33 components were identified and quantified in oil samples of Kerman-Rayen, Kerman-Sirch, Yazd, Shahrud and Esfahan ecotypes, representing 98.7, 98.9, 96.9, 92.3 and 98.2% of these oils, respectively. The ranges of major constituents were as follow: carvacrol (42.0 – 80.7%), thymol (4.1 – 11.8%), ?-cymene (2.5 – 12.8%), ?- terpinene (3.7–7.3%). and borneol (3.1–8.3%). The carvacrol was the main compound in all ecotypes.
Conclusion: Th. carmanicus contains the high content of essential oil and phenolic components including carvacrol and thymol, which can be used in pharmaceutical industries.

Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of parenting education on improvement of reading
and writing disabilities in children.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial was done on primary school students with reading and writing
disabilities and their mothers. The subjects were divided into three groups with 26 members in each group. The
first group (mothersâ€™ education group) received 6 one-hour new educational sessions. The second group
(standard group) received 12-15 standard educational sessions for learning disability, and the third group (control
group) which consisted of students with learning disability did not receive any treatments. Research instruments
included reading and writing tests, and demographic questionnaire. The three groups were evaluated via pretest
and posttests at baseline and after one and three months of educational interventions. Data were analyzed using
the chi-square, t-test, and repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).
Results: The mean reading speed had the most progression in the mothers' education group. Comparison
among reading speed, reading accuracy, and spelling scores has been statistically significant (F 2, 6 = 90.64;
p  <  0.001) but the mean of these scores has been insignificant among the three groups (F 2, 67 = 0.583;
p  >  0.05). The mean reading accuracy, mostly increased after 3-month interventions in the mothers group. The
control group had the lowest mean reading accuracy scores.
Conclusion: Parenting education in mothers had a positive effect on the treatment of children with reading
and writing disabilities.

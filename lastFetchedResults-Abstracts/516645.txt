Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Rosmary) is one of the essential oil containing
plants from Lamiaceae family. Rosemary is a native of the Mediterranean region of Europe
and the Near East. It has been used as a food spice and as a medicine since ancient times.
Today rosemary is cultivatedin nearly all countries as a medicinal and ornamental plant.
Objective: There are some reports about the effect of environmental conditions and genetic
on rosemary essential oil. The goal of this work was to investigate the seasonal variation on
rosemary essential oil composition.
Methods: Aerial parts of plants were dried after collection from Evin, Tehran. Essential
oils were obtained by using a Clevengertype apparatus for 90 min and analyzed by GC and
GC-MS.
Results: Rosemary essential oil showed 52 compounds, where 31 of those were similar in
different seasons. α-Pinene, Limonene, Camphene, Camphor, 1, 8-Cineol and Bornyl acetate
were major components of rosemary oil. The content of 1, 8-Cineol was the highest in
September (14.15%). The elevated levels of α-Pinene and Limonen were observed in
February (28.28% and 17.29% respectively).At least in various seasons from spring to
winter constituent of α-Pinene (18.5%, 24.7%, 20% and 28.3 %), Limonene (11%, 6.1%,
8.6% and 17.3%), Camphene (7.5%, 8.3%, 7.3% and 8.1%) and Camphor (7.4%, 13.4%,
8.3% and 4.7%) were compared respectively.
Conclusion: Except α-Pinene, Limonene, 1, 8-Cineol and Bornyl acetate, most of these
components did not affected by seasonal change. Some of these essential oils components
converted to others, thus their concentrations decreased in summer but their amounts were
at the highest levels in winter.

Objective To examine the associations
between life satisfaction, loneliness, general health and
depression among 172 medical students in Malaysia.
Method Participants completed a questionnaire battery,
which included the 12-item General Health
Questionnaire, Beckâ€™s Depression Inventory, the Revised
UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Satisfaction With
Life Scale. Results Life satisfaction was negatively and
significantly correlated with suicidal attitudes, loneliness
and depression; and positively with health, which
was negatively and significantly correlated with
depression and loneliness. Self-concept was negatively
correlated with loneliness and depression, depression
was positively and significantly correlated with loneliness.
Mediational analyses showed that the effects of
loneliness and life dissatisfaction on depression were
fully mediated by health. Conclusion Even though less
satisfied, and particularly lonelier, individuals are
more likely to report higher levels of depression, this
is only the case because both higher loneliness and life
dissatisfaction are associated with poorer health.
These results are discussed in terms of their implications
for the diagnosis and treatment of mental health
disorders in developing nations.

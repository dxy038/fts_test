The main objective of developing an image-watermarking technique is to satisfy both imperceptibility and robustness requirements. To achieve this objective, a hybrid image-watermarking scheme based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed in this paper. In our approach, the watermark is not embedded directly on the wavelet coefficients but rather than on the elements of singular values of the cover imageÂ´s DWT subbands. Experimental results are provided to illustrate that the proposed approach is able to withstand a variety of image-processing attacks.

Bi-objective optimization of the availability allocation problem in a series–parallel system with repairable components is aimed in this paper. The two objectives of the problem are the availability of the system and the total cost of the system. Regarding the previous studies in series–parallel systems, the main contribution of this study is to expand the redundancy allocation problems to systems that have repairable components. Therefore, the considered systems in this paper are the systems that have repairable components in their configurations and subsystems. Due to the complexity of the model, a meta-heuristic method called as non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is applied to find Pareto front. After finding the Pareto front, a procedure is used to select the best solution from the Pareto front.

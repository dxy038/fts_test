Background: Occupational exposure to excessive level of copper results in many adverse
health effects.
Objective: To measure pulmonary function, oxidative stress, and extent of DNA damage in
workers of a copper processing industry.
Methods: 30 men working in a copper processing industry and 30 men matched for age and
socioeconomic status (comparison group) were included in this study. Pulmonary function test
parameters were measured for all participants. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), ferric reducing
ability of plasma (FRAP), glutathione (GSH) content in RBCs and 8-OHdG were assayed by
ELISA. Extent of DNA damage in leucocytes was assayed by comet assay.
Results: Pulmonary function parameters, FVC, FEV1, PEFR, and MVV measured in workers
were significantly (p<0.05) lower than those observed in the comparison group. Compared
to the comparison group, MDA was significantly (p=0.002) increased in studied workers; TAOC
(p=0.017), and GSH (p=0.020) were significantly lower in workers than the comparison
group. There was significant DNA damage in leucocytes in workers compared to the comparison
group (difference in olive tail moment p<0.001). PEFR, FEF25-75%, and MEF50% were negatively
correlated with MDA.
Conclusion: The observed DNA damage would be due to increased oxidative stress resulting
from excessive exposure to copper.

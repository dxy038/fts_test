Most image segmentation algorithms in the past are based on optimizing an objective function that aims to achieve the similarity between several low-level features to build a partition of the image into homogeneous regions. In the present paper, we propose to incorporate the relevance (selection) of the grouping features to enforce the segmentation toward the capturing of objects of interest. The relevance of the features is determined through a set of positive and negative examples of a specific object defined a priori by the user. The calculation of the relevance of the features is performed by maximizing an objective function defined on the mixture likelihoods of the positive and negative object examples sets. The incorporation of the features relevance in the object segmentation is formulated through an energy functional which is minimized by using level set active contours. We show the efficiency of the approach on several examples of object of interest segmentation and tracking where the features relevance is used.

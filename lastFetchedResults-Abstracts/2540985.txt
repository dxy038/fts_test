Abstract
Aim: The main objective of the study was to consider the impact of 12 weeks high intensity interval training on plasma Adiponectin, Leptin and insulin resistance in 20-35 years old obese males with non-alcoholic fatty liver.
Method: In this study researchers used of thirty eight participants with means of age 28.5±6.2 yrs, weight 95.4±11.8 kg and height 178.6±14.7 cm were randomly divided  into two groups including experimental (N=18) and control (N=20) groups. The experimental group performed high intensity interval training for 36 sessions and 3 days per week. Intensity of training in the first session was determined with 90% of peak power output in subjects and 115% of peak power output in last session. The protocol training was 10 sets of 60 seconds repetitions of pedaling a bicycle ergometer with 60 seconds rest to 15% peak power output during exercise. Once normal distribution of collected data has been analyzed by K-S test, the pre and post mean difference significant has been analyzed by using t-paired test (p?0.05). 
Results: After 12 weeks high intensity interval training in obese males with fatty liver, the results have shown a significant decrease in Leptin level, and a significant decrease in Insulin resistance level (p < 0.05). However, the Adiponectin level had shown a significant increase between pre-test and post-test (p?0.05).
Conclusion: : Finally, the results have shown that12 weeks high intensity interval training in obese males with fatty liver could change Adiponectin, Leptin and Insulin resistance levels. Also, any decrease in body mass index and weight, resulted in disorder improvement.

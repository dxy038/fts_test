This method confirms the processing sequence of products by calculating the cumulative length of idle time on the machine. The method arranges product with shorter idle time firstly by comparing the cumulative length of idle time which is produced after products are processed. The objective is to short the whole scheduling idle time. The experiment shows that the method proposed can improve the utilization factor and short the total processing time probably.

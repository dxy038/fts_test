In this paper, we present an integrated system approach based on game theory for automotive electrical power and energy management systems. We apply this approach to a case study fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV) by using the Simulink-based simulator ADVISOR. The case study fuel cell vehicle is rated at 80 kW peak and 25 kW average propulsion power, and consists of a fuel cell stack, a battery pack, an ultra capacitor, and two 35 kW induction motors. In this control strategy, the game ´players´ are the individual power sources, and the ´strategies´ of players are their alternating states. The objective of the players is to maximize their payoff, where the payoff is a function of the powertrain efficiency and vehicle performance. Simulation results indicate that the optimal power and energy management strategy can improve both fuel economy and performance.

Multilevel converters have emerged as the state of the art high power conversion for applications in reversible power flow. Electric power could be tapped from or injected to the grid regardless of the discrepancies in voltage levels, frequency, phase number and different modes of operation of the grid and the system. This paper presents an overview of different topologies of multilevel converters and modulation strategies with a verification of back-to-back neutral point converter for bidirectional power flow application.

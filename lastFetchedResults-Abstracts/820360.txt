With the objective of defining the role of individual differences factors influencing individuals' tendency for argument, this research examined the epistemological beliefs, need for cognition and extroversion in predicting argumentativeness. Two hundred and twenty nine students (107 males and 122 females) were randomly selected and answered Epistemological Beliefs Inventory (Shraw, Bendixen & Dunkle ,2002), Argumentation Scale (Infante & Rancer, 1982), Need for Cognition Scale (Cacioppo, Petty & Kao, 1992) and Extroversion Subscale from Neo-Five Factors Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1984). Results demonstrated that extroversion, need for cognition and quick learning from epistemological beliefs were predictive of argumentativeness. The results and their implications were also discussed based on the theoretical framework.

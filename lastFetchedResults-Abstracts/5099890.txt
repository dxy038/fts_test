OBJECTIVE In regenerative medicine, one major issue is how to mobilize stem cells into circulation. The present study is to investigate whether Parathyroid hormone (PTH) can efficiently mobilize bone marrow-derived progenitor cells into circulation and analyze the effects of PTH on serum levels of cytokines. METHODS PTH was administrated intraperitoneally by 80&#956;g/kg body weight once daily. After one week, peripheral blood hematology, serum levels of cytokines, progenitor cells and CD34 positive cells in circulation were studied. RESULTS After one week PTH treatment, leukocytes showed significantly increased compared to the control group mice. There was no significant change of erythrocytes, and platelets after PTH treatment. Serum levels of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and stroma-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) showed no significant change after PTH treatment. A significant increase of circulating granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM), erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) and multi-potential granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte progenitors (CFU-GEMM) in PTH-treatment mice were found. The subpopulations of CD34+ in peripheral blood were significantly increased after PTH treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the mobilizing effect of PTH.

Objective
cterium moorei is a Gram positive bacterium that has been specifically associated with halitosis. The aim of this study was to characterize volatile sulfur compound (VSC) production by S. moorei.
s
rei was either grown or incubated in the presence of various supplements prior to determining VSC production with a Halimeter sulfide monitor. The effect of exogenous proteases or glycosidase inhibitors on VSC production by S. moorei was examined.
s
st showed that S. moorei can convert cysteine into hydrogen sulfide. The capacity of S. moorei to produce VSCs from serum, saliva, and mucin was dependent on the presence of an exogenous source of proteases such as pancreatic trypsin or Porphyromonas gingivalis gingipains. VSC production from mucin was inhibited by the presence of a β-galactosidase inhibitor, thus suggesting that deglycosylation of mucin by S. moorei is critical for VSC production.
sion
udy suggests that S. moorei can be a major source of malodorous compounds in halitosis by producing VSCs through a process involving the β-galactosidase activity of the bacterium and an exogenous source of proteases.

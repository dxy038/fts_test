The objective of this letter is to propose an alternative modal representation of a nontransposed three-phase transmission line with a vertical symmetry plane by using two transformation matrices. Initially, ClarkeÂ´s matrix is used to separate the line into components alpha,beta, and zero. Because alpha and zero components are not exact modes, they can be considered as being a two-phase line that will be decomposed in its exact modes by using a 2times2 modal transformation matrix. This letter will describe the characteristics of the two-phase line before mentioned. This modal representation is applied to decouple a nontransposed three-phase transmission line with a vertical symmetry plane whose nominal voltage is 440kV

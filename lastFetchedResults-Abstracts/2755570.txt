During the last year eco-friendly driving and the development of new driver assistance systems that support eco-friendly driving are increasingly becoming important. One main objective of research in this area is finding ways of motivating drivers to behave ecologically beneficially in a sustainable way and identifying how these motives can be generated, for example, through in-vehicle assistance or information systems. One aim of the following study was to develop a matrix of the most important eco-friendly driving motives, moderating and influencing factors (e.g. trip purpose, annual mileage). Another objective was analysis of the influence of different driver characteristics on relevant motives and to deduce first hints for development of applications for generating these motives. The results of the questionnaire study demonstrate that three main motives `time´, `environment/consumption´ and `possibilities to change´ are selectively important and distinctive for various driver groups. The results therefore imply that different strategies and applications or systems might be necessary to change the driver behaviour and to convince them that the `eco-system´ will be beneficial for them. Furthermore, the results describe ideas of what kind of assistance or information systems the drivers would prefer as a support system. This information can help in the design of future eco-driving support systems.

Background: It has been reported that strenuous acute exercise induces the oxidative stress in active muscles and organism. However, exercise-induced oxidative stress may reduce by supplementation with antioxidants.
Objective: The present study was conducted to determine the effects of short-term ginseng supplementation on malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in young athletes after exhaustive aerobic exercise.
Methods: Twenty young male boxers athletes in semi-experimental study randomly were divided into two placebo and supplement groups. Subjects in supplement group consumed 2gr of ginseng capsules daily for one week, whiles other group received the same amount of placebo (2gr of dextrose). After seven days of supplementation all subjects of both groups underwent in an exhaustive aerobic exercise test that performed on treadmill. Venous blood samples were collected in four phases; 1) before supplementation 2) immediately before of exercise 3) immediately after and 4) 24 h after exercise. 
Results: The results of this research indicated that the range change of MDA significantly higher in placebo versus to ginseng group at immediately and 24 hours after aerobic exercise (P=0.001). Moreover, SOD enzyme activity significantly increase in supplement group compared to the placebo group after exhaustive exercise (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: In general it can be said that short-term ginseng supplementation inhabits aerobic exercise- induced oxidative stress by decreasing the levels of MDA and increasing of SOD activity as an antioxidant enzyme in young athletes, and therefore it can be prevent of free radicals damaging effects.

In this paper, an adaptive steady-state particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to search the optimal PID controller gains for mold level control of the continuous steel casting. An adaptive mutation strategy and global best position steady-state updating are integrated to the standard PSO to ensure the search balance of the exploration and exploitation. In the adaptive steady-state PSObased PID model-free control system for continuous steel casting, the three PID control grains are required to form a particle vector and the sum of the squared error is defined as the objective function. Simulation results testify that the adaptive steady-state PSObased PID model-free controller can perform well in the molten level control of the continuous steel casting.

Nowadays there are many sun-protection cosmetics incorporating chemical and/or physical UV filters as active ingredients and there are no official methods to determine these kinds of compounds in sunscreen cosmetics. The objective of this work is to estimate TiO2 concentration, without sample preparation, employing a portable energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), aiming to estimate the sun protection factor (SPF) due to the physical barrier in sunscreen composition, and also identify the metals present in the samples. A portable EDXRF system was used for the analysis of fifteen commercial samples. It was also prepared three formulations estimated in FPS-30 using TiO2 at 5%. Quantification was performed using calibration curves with standards from 1 to 30%. The physical barrier contribution in the SPF, associated to Ti concentration, was determined for all samples. The presence of some elements, like K, Zn, Br and Sr was detected in the sunscreen, identifying chemical elements that were not cited in the formulations. Three commercial samples were analyzed for total SPF determination and the result shows that the measured value is 10% lower than the nominal one.

We evaluated three non-invasive method, thermography, laser Doppler imaging and near infrared multi-spectral imaging to quantitatively assess parameters of vascularity in KaposiÂ´s sarcoma. The KS lesion generally has increased temperature, blood velocity and blood deoxy-hemoglobin. There is a strong correlation between temperature and blood velocity (R= 81, p&lt;0.001). After treatment with experimental drug (liposomal doxorubicin and interleukin-12), temperature, blood velocity, blood volume and deoxy-hemoglobin of the lesions are reduced from the baseline at week 18. The techniques are objective, easy to perform, and appear to be very sensitive in assessing improvement in the lesions upon administration of therapy

When a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for power distribution network reconfiguration, it is important to improve coding and decoding techniques based on the characteristics of distribution networks in order to enhance the algorithmÂ´s efficiency. A loop coding technique is presented; it can efficiently reduce the length of a chromosome by taking out the branches (breakers) that are not included in any loops from the branches included in the chromosome. A new decoding technique is also proposed; it can be used efficiently to solve the objective function. A test computation is presented; it proves these techniques are efficient and practicable, and they can be used in power distribution network reconfigurations.

Background and Objective: Down’s syndrome, as the most common chromosomal disorder, is associated with several psychomotor and sensory disorders that can affect the nutritional status of patients. The aim of this study was to determine the nutritional and anthropometric status and taste and smell sensitivity of children with Down syndrome in Ahvaz.

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was done on 58 children with Down syndrome in exceptional and welfare centers of Ahvaz in 2011. Demographic, anthropometric and dietary data were collected by questionnaires, with interviewing with parents. Taste and smell sensitivity was assessed using the Short Sensory Profile questionnaire. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS17.0 software and p < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results: Based on the growth charts for children with Down syndrome, 37.9% and 34.4% of children were above the 75th percentile, respectively in terms of weight to age ratio and BMI. Extracellular water to total body water was significantly higher in girls than boys. Dietary intake of fat was higher than its recommended values and the mean of taste and smell sensitivity score was 13.5±2.0.

Conclusion: More than a third of children were obese according to weight/age and BMI. Eating more high- fat and high-calorie foods and higher sensitivity of them to taste and smell stimuli can be effective in their obesity. In this regard, the need to provide nutritional education to parents and correct dietary pattern is recommended.

Vibration analysis is the main conditions monitoring techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis. This technique has its unique advantages and disadvantages associated with the monitoring and fault diagnosis of machinery. When this technique is conducted independently, only a portion of machine faults are typically diagnosed. However, practical experience has shown that this technique in a machine condition monitoring program provides useful reliable information, bringing significant cost benefits to industry. The objective of this research is to investigate the correlation between vibration analysis and fault diagnosis. This was achieved by vibration analysis and investigating different operating conditions of an experimental electromotor. The electromotor was initially run under normal operating conditions as a comparative test. A series of tests were then conducted corresponding to different operating condition. Our varieties were speed of electromotor at three levels, respectively 500, 1000 and 1500 rpm. We did three faults in our electromotor; there were misalignment, looseness and bad bearing. We coupled our electromotor to the variable blade fan and applied several load on that by changing the number of blade of fan. We have chosen 2, 6 and 10 blades fan to apply three different loads on our electromotor. Vibration data was regularly collected. Numerical data produced by vibration analysis were compared with vibration spectra in normal condition of healthy machine, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the vibration condition monitoring technique. The results from this paper have given more understanding on the dependent roles of vibration analysis in predicting and diagnosing machine faults.

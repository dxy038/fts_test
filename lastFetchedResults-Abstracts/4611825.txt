This research presents an intrusion detection system t (IDS) with honeypot over distributed networks. The main objective is compare measuring the effectiveness of attacks between IDS and IDS with honeypot by unicast IP address attack and multicast IP address attack. These attack forms generating by NESSUS is a attack program via wire network and wireless network consists of Snort is a program that is used to detect intrusion and Honeyd to simulate a honeypot computer, which is installed on the system practical for Linux with a number of more 2 points (Sensor) to detect each program will be sent to the primary database for the analysis of experimental results. From this project will allow administrators to monitor and protect their networks more efficient organization.

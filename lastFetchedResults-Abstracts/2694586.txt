In this paper, a bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed for the automotive engine/battery hybrid power generators. The two-stage bidirectional converter employing a fixed-frequency series loaded resonant converter is designed to be capable of operating under zero-current-switching turn-on and turn-off regardless of voltage and load variation, and hence its magnetic components and EMI filters can be optimized. Also, a new autonomous and seamless bidirectional voltage control method that combines two individual controllers for low-voltage side control and high-voltage side control by introducing a variable current limiter is proposed to provide uninterrupted power to critical ac loads and reduce the size of the dc bus capacitor and the transition time. Experimental results from a 5-kW prototype are provided to validate the proposed concept.

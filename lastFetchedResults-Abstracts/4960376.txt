Uses the Energy Saving System Based on Bidirectional 3-Level DC-DC Converter with Super Capacitor as a platform to research different topology of Bidirectional 3-Level DC-DC Converter, analyze their structural features, deduce the relationship between input parameters and output parameters, and then select a circuit topology according to comparison result in this paper. The control strategy of 3-Level DC-DC Converter should be proposed to ensure the voltage sharing of the input divided capacitors in converter, while the optimal designing method of main circuit parameters is also needed to increase efficiency and power density. Create the mathematical model of the system and design the control system. Set up the prototype of three-level converters and test the system performance. Prove the validity of the formulations and affectivity of control strategy.

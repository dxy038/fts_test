The objective of this study was to determine the effect of oral losartan on the degree of mitral regurgitation (MR). The regurgitant volume and effective regurgitant orifice were quantified using 3 methods (flow convergence, quantitative Doppler, and quantitative 2-dimensional echocardiography) in 32 patients (26 men, mean age 67 ± 14 years) with MR, both at baseline and 4 hours after losartan (50 mg orally). Twenty-eight patients were also reevaluated after 1 month of continued treatment with losartan (50 mg/day). With treatment, systolic blood pressure decreased from 143 ± 16 to 130 ± 18 mm Hg and left ventricular end-systolic wall stress from 173 ± 46 to 156 ± 44 g/cm2 (both p &lt;0.001). With treatment, regurgitant volume decreased (from 77 ± 28 to 64 ± 26 ml, −18 ± 10%; p &lt;0.001) in direct relation to the effective regurgitant orifice change (from 43 ± 16 to 37 ± 15 mm2, −17 ± 10%; p &lt;0.001) but without significant change in regurgitant gradient or duration. Wide individual variability in response was observed unrelated to the magnitude of blood pressure changes. Larger reduction in regurgitant volume was observed in patients with a marked decrease in wall stress (r = 0.47, p = 0.01) and higher baseline end-diastolic volume index (r = −0.38, p = 0.03) and regurgitant volume (r = −0.45, p = 0.01). Acute improvements were sustained and unchanged at 1 month (all p &gt;0.15). Treatment of MR using the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan produces a significant and sustained decrease in the degree of MR, with decreases in regurgitant volume and effective regurgitant orifice. However, the changes are of modest and variable magnitude.

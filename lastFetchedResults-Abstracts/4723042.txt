Underwater acoustic channel is one of the most challenging channel for data transmission due to its long multipath delay and Doppler expansion. In this paper, Soft-Input Soft-Output Bidirectional DFE is extended to multilevel modulations and applied in underwater acoustic communication. The performances of both exact and Low-complexity implemented Soft Bidirectional DFE are evaluated at low SNR by simulation and pool experiment. Experimental results show that data rate of 12 kbit/s could be readily achieved without error.

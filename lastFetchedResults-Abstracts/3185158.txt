The conflict between energy consumption and battery capacity has become more significant in modern mobile terminals that support various functions in addition to traditional voice. It is of great importance to extend battery lifespan and at the same time to guarantee the required quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the battery lifespan of a mobile terminal and the data traffic on the terminal that has a delay constraint. Specifically, an uplink with periodical traffic arrival and Rayleigh fading channel is considered. An optimization problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the transmission rate while at the same time ensuring the required delay guarantee, so that the battery lifespan can be maximized. Numerical results under different configurations are presented and discussed.

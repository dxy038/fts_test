In this study, the tractive rolling contact problem between a rigid cylinder and a graded coating is investigated. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the stiffness ratio, the coefficient of friction and the coating thickness on the surface contact tractions, the surface in-plane stress, the stick zone length and the creep ratio parameter that may have a bearing on the fatigue life of the component. Assuming that the shear modulus varies exponentially through the thickness of the coating, the governing integral equations associated with the rolling contact problem are constructed. Furthermore, it is supposed that the contact patch is controlled by a central stick zone accompanied by two slip zones. The conventional Goodman approximation is employed in order to decouple the governing singular integral equations. Finally, the numerical solution of the integral equations is obtained by applying the Gaussâ€“Chebyshev integration method.

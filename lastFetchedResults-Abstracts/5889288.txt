High cost of noise barrier is usually caused by improper design parameters. As an important factor of design, the effective length of traffic flow is studied. Based on the finite length of traffic flow, an optimized design method of noise barrier used in reducing noise emission from traffic vehicles is presented, in which cost of noise barrier is chosen as objective function, the requirement of noise reduction as acoustic constraints, and design parameters are considered comprehensively. After compared with current design methods, the advantages of the new method in shortening the length of noise barrier and improvement in economic cost are verified, and its results are instructive to the selection of the design parameters.

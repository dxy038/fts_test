In this paper, a color analysis post-processing deblocking filter is proposed to reduce the blocking effects. This proposed algorithm is suitable for the current block-based video standards without any modification. The proposed algorithm uses Sobel operator and Wavelet Transform to accurately detect the blocking effects at 4times4 or 8times8 blocking boundaries automatically. In the filtering stage, the proposed algorithm provides some filter modes to eliminate the blocking effects at different color regions according to the human color vision and color psychology analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better subjective and objective quality for H.264/AVC reconstructed video sequences compared with several previous methods.

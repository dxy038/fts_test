In some applications, contacts between two devices are the first cause of dysfunctions. The aim of this paper is to transfer contactless power energy to add new functions to a tool (e.g., drill machine). A bidirectional communication is also needed. This is realized with an ironless high-frequency transformer for both power and information transmission. Different coil geometries have been studied to reduce mutual inductance between power and information coils. This new solution enables to build low-cost and smart energy transfer systems including communication.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the least painful circumcision method. STUDY DESIGN: The infants were circumcised with either the Mogen or the Gomco procedure and were given a sweetened pacifier or a pacifier dipped in water. All infants had a eutectic mixture of local anesthetic cream applied before circumcision. The duration of the crying and grimacing were measured. RESULTS: The Gomco procedure took 1.9 times longer to complete. Infants who were circumcised with the Mogen procedure cried and grimaced far less than infants who were circumcised with the Gomco procedure (P = .0001). Sucrose on a pacifier was far more analgesic than water on a pacifier for infants in the Gomco group. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these and other findings on pain prevention and amelioration, we recommend that a local anesthetic be administered in advance of circumcision and that the Mogen procedure be used, unless contraindicated. We also recommend that infants be given a sweetened pacifier before, during, and after circumcision if the Gomco method is used. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:564-8.)

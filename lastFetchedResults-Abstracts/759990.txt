The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the versatility of electron beam-physical vapor
deposition (EB-PVD) technology in engineering new materials with controlled
microstructure and microchemistry in the form of coatings. EB-PVD technology is being
explored in forming net-shaped components for many applications including space,
turbine, optical, biomedical and auto industry. Coatings are often applied on components
to extend their performance and life under severe environmental conditions including
thermal, corrosion, wear, and oxidation. In addition, coatings have been used in designing
and developing sensors. Performance and properties of the coatings depend upon its
composition, microstructure and deposition condition. This paper presents recent results of
various materials including ceramic, metallic, and functionally graded coatings produced
by EB-PVD. Simultaneous co-evaporation of multiple ingots of different compositions in the
high energy EB-PVD chamber has brought considerable interest in the architecture of
functional graded coatings, nano-laminated coatings and designing of new structural
materials that could not be produced economically by conventional methods. In addition,
high evaporation and condensate rate allowed fabricating precision net-shaped
components with nanograined microstructure for various applications. This paper will also
present the results of various metallic and ceramic coatings including chromium, titanium
carbide (TiC), hafnium carbide (HfC), tantalum carbide (TaC), hafnium nitride (HfN),
titanium-boron-carbonitride (TiBCN), and partially yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), and
HfO2-based TBC coatings deposited by EB-PVD for various applications.  C 2005 Springer

When synchronous motors are subjected to voltage sags at their terminals, the accurate calculation of the motor transient performance depends on the saturation conditions of their main flux paths. In this paper, a computer model for saturated synchronous motors has been developed using the synchronous machine voltage and flux linkage differential equations considering the saturation. The effect of the main flux saturation both in the direct and quadrature axes and of the cross-magnetizing phenomenon (the magnetic coupling between the direct and quadrature axes) on the determination of the transient performance of synchronous motors due to the voltage sag at the terminals is the main objective of this paper

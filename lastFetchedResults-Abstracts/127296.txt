The basic concept of this paper is to establish systematization of performance assessment. To improving a methodology for integrated model on performance assessment of irrigation systems is subjected to uncertainty of natural events and vagueness or fuzziness of management characteristics objectives. It is important to consider the objective of irrigation system as a service to be provided for farmers. The main issue of performance assessment is to provide indicators, based on subjective judgments of management environment. Initial indicators and fuzzy rule are defined as a physical and institutional condition of system and inter relation of indicators respectively.
In this model level of water users and irrigation water supply agency is distinguished, linguistic-expression indicators are defined, all indicators are fuzzified, Mamdani fuzzy system is implied, these foresaid is enabled the model to assess each fuzziness condition, and assessment of irrigation management transfer and upgrading management. Results indicated that measured performance indicators for a given design or intended value can be subjected to significant rule that could describe the interrelationship between different parameters of performance. The effects of various types of fuzziness and the assessment of irrigation performance for irrigation water delivery are investigated. Management performance measures from water users and irrigation water supply agency judgments in the pilot were 39% and 58% respectively, adequacy indicator from water users and irrigation water supply agency judgments were 38% and 82% respectively, these two measures shows that unfavorites physical and natural condition is not the main problem of the system. But difference between actual water users needs, and insufficient plan of water delivery, is the main problem of the system.

For solving power system nonlinear and multi-objective control problems, a variable structure robust control design was presented for a static VAR compensator (SVC). The controller for the nonlinear system was designed using variable structure control theory, robust control theory and direct feedback linearization technique. Firstly, the nonlinear model of a single-machine infinite-bus system including SVC with uncertainties was analyzed. Then based on the method for constructing sliding mode hyperplane with the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation of normal system, a variable structure robust control algorithm was carried out. The proposed controller can improve power angle stability of power system and ensure local voltage quality. The control law has simple structure, strong robustness, and easy to realize. Finally, the simulation results verify the validity of the proposed approach.

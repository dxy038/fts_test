Objective
Indigestible dextrin (IDex) and diacylglycerol (DG) are food components with physiologic effects on lipid metabolism. Because simultaneous intake of dietary components with similar physiologic functions may produce a beneficial decrease in risk factors for lifestyle-related diseases, we investigated the physiologic effects of simultaneous IDex and DG intake.
Methods

Five-week-old male Wistar rats were fed a cholesterol-containing diet with IDex and DG (separately and combined) for 28 d.
Results

IDex significantly decreased serum triacylglycerol concentration and increased the length of small intestinal villi, whereas DG produced significant decreases in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and significant increases in liver cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations.
Conclusions

IDex intake characteristically decreased serum triacylglycerol concentrations, although no additive or synergistic interaction between DG and IDex was observed. These results indicate that simultaneous intake of food components with similar physiologic functions do not necessarily produce additive or synergistic physiologic benefits.

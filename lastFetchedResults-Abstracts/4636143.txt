The main objective of this paper is to present a drum level control prototype, paying special attention to its conceptualization and its possibilities for the theoretical-practical training. Emphasis is placed on the role of the control, industrial instrumentation, and automation issues applied to this prototype. Considerations over the control issues applied to the process are explained in detail. Extensive experimental results are also described. Some comments related to industrial practice are offered in this context.

For a class of methods using minimax optimisation for design contering, a new objective function is proposed which gives improved performance. Then, a simplified approximate method of the same class is developed, using the new objective function and using a Taylor-series expansion to estimate the worst-case network response. Examples based on practical networks are given, which demonstrate that good results can be obtained using the algorithm described.

Background and Objective: Mercuric chloride (HgC12) is a white cristaline toxic poweder which is absorbed through gastero intentinal tract and skin, and excreted from kidney. Chronic poisoning with mercuric chloride causes sensorial and mobile disorders, behavioral and mental disorders. Mercuric chloride is teratogen for embryonic organs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of HgC12 on embryo's ventricles and spinal canal as a part of nervous system.
Materials and Methods: In this study 24 female Sprague Dawley rats after scieng vaginal plague that considered at day zero of gestation were divided into four groups: One control group that injected normal saline solution and three experimental groups that injected mercuric chloride 2mg/kg (ip) in 8th, 9th and 10th days of gestation. Emboryos were removed from uterus on day 15th and tissue process was done and measured and analyzed with LSD and Duncan tests.
Results: Ventricular and spinal cord diameters and coroidal brancbes in experimental groups were decreased significantly compared to control group (p<0.05). In addition the spinal canal diameter in control group was significantly (p<0.001) more than experimental groups. The number of coroidal branches were significantly decreased (p<0.001) in experimental groups compare to control group.
Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that HgC12 has toxic effect on nervous system including, decrease in ventricular and spinal cord diameters, and the number of coroidal branches.

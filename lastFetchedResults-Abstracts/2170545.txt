Cyanogenic glycosides, which release cyanide, are present in several plant species of high importance for animal production, such as cassava and sorghum. Several human neurological diseases have been associated with chronic cyanide exposure. On the other hand, these effects in ruminants are almost unknown. Thus, the objective of the present study was to determine the long-term lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by daily administration of potassium cyanide (KCN) to goats. Thirty-four male goats were divided into five groups, respectively treated orally with 0 (control), 0.3, 0.6, 1.2 or 3.0 mg KCN/kg/day for 5 months. At the end of the experiment, the whole CNS of each animal was collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry for apoptotic markers (BAX, BCl2 and CPP32) and for glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP; vimentin). The results showed the presence of spheroids in the pons, medulla oblongata, and ventral horn of the spinal cord, gliosis and spongiosis in medulla oblongata, gliosis in the pons, and damaged Purkinje cells in the cerebellum from goats that received the higher cyanide dose. In goats from the 1.2 mg KCN/kg group we observed congestion and hemorrhage in the cerebellum, and spheroids in the spinal cord. Gliosis was confirmed by GFAP protein expression. Immunohistochemistry for apoptotic markers and typical apoptotic morphology suggested apoptosis did not participate in the pathogenesis of the observed lesions. Thus, chronic cyanide exposure can promote neurophatological lesions also in goats, and this species can be a useful ruminant model to study the neurotoxic effects of long-term cyanide exposure.

Objective: To analyze whether the EEG changes observed during figure and word categorization are compatible with either the dual, the common amodal, or the alternative model (modality-specific codes for words and pictures, where meaning is represented for both in a higher-order amodal system) for semantic knowledge.
Methods: EEG was recorded during word and figure categorization of animals or non-animals in a group of 28 children 8â€“10 years old. Computation of EEG sources in the frequency domain using variable resolution electrical tomography (VARETA) and their statistical evaluation by statistical parametric mapping were carried out.
Results: At all frequencies, there were significant changes between EEG segments prior to the presentation of the stimuli and EEG segments recorded after the stimuli. Post-segments showed more power from 1.56 to 7.02 Hz, and less power than pre-segments from 8 to 12.48 Hz. EEG changes were only observed in the word task at: 3.9 (left occipital), 4.68, 5.46, and 6.24 Hz (temporo-occipital regions). These changes may be associated with visual encoding of words. Frequencies 7.8 and 17.94 Hz increased in prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and anterior temporal regions only during figure categorization. The prefrontal region may be related to object working memory. Thus, these frequencies might be related to figure codification. No significant differences between tasks were observed at 3.12 and 7.02 Hz in very wide brain areas (all lobes except occipital), suggesting that the amodal semantic system storage could be the model compatible with figure and word categorization.
Conclusions: Thus, our results support the modified amodal semantic hypothesis, which advocates that the meanings of both kinds of stimuli are represented in a conceptual memory that receives input from the logogen and iconogen systems.

Topology optimization has been carried out mainly with structured quadrilateral finite elements. However,
triangular elements facilitate mesh generation especially for problems having complex geometries
that often appear in practical industrial problems. The use of triangular elements, especially low-order
triangular elements, causes a serious numerical trouble that is equivalent to the rectangular checkerboard
pattern formation. The objective of this investigation is to develop a triangular checkerboard-freeing
method that directly restricts the design space. To this end, we use the multiscale design space that
is mapped from the standard single-scale density space. To facilitate the mapping, we employ the
triangular mesh subdivision and propose a bi-orthogonal wavelet transform suitable for a triangulated
domain. For checkerboard-free designs, a shrinkage method based on the wavelet frame appropriate for
triangular mesh is proposed. Typical benchmark problems and a simplified roof-reinforcing problem
in an automobile body are considered to check the effectiveness of the proposed method

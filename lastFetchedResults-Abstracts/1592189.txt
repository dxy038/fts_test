Objective: In radiation treatment, the irradiation which is effective enough to control the
tumors far exceeds normal-tissues tolerance. Thus to avoid such unfavourable outcomes,
some methods sensitizing the tumor cells to radiation are used. Iododeoxyuridine (IUdR)
is a halogenated thymidine analogue that known to be effective as a radiosensitizer in human
cancer therapy. Improving the potential efficacy of radiation therapy after combining
to hyperthermia depends on the magnitude of the differential sensitization of the hyperthermic
effects or on the differential cytotoxicity of the radiation effects on the tumor cells.
In this study, we evaluated the combined effects of IUdR, hyperthermia and gamma rays
of 60Co on human glioblastoma spheroids culture.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study,the cultured spheroids with 100?m diameter
were treated by 1 ?M IUdR, 43?C hyperthermia for an hour and 2 Gy gamma rays,
respectively. The DNA damages induced in cells were compared using alkaline comet
assay method, and dosimetry was then performed by TLD-100. Comet scores were calculated
as mean Â± standard error of mean (SEM) using one-way ANOVA.
Results:Comparison of DNA damages induced by IUdR and hyperthermia + gamma treatment
showed 2.67- and 1.92-fold enhancement, respectively, as compared to the damages
induced by radiation alone or radiation combined IUdR. Dosimetry results showed
the accurate dose delivered to cells.
Conclusion: Analysis of the comet tail moments of spheroids showed that the radiation
treatments combined with hyperthermia and IUdR caused significant radiosensitization
when compared to related results of irradiation alone or of irradiation with IUdR. These results
suggest a potential clinical advantage of combining radiation with hyperthermia and
indicate effectiveness of hyperthermia treatment in inducing cytotoxicity of tumor cells.

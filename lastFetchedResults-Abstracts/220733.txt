We propose an algorithm for deinterlacing of interlaced
video sequences. It successively builds approximations to the deinterlaced
sequence by weighting various interpolation methods. A particular example
given here uses four interpolation methods, weighted according
to the errors each one introduces. Due to weighting, it is an adaptive
algorithm. It is also time-recursive, since motion-compensated part uses
the previously interpolated frame. Furthermore, bidirectional motion
estimation and compensation allow for better performance in case of scene
changes and covering/uncovering of objects. Experiments are run both
on “real-world” and computer generated sequences. Finally, subjective
testing is performed to evaluate the quality of the algorithm.

Objective: To investigate into the standard acquisition environment and objective identification method of infantile finger veinlet to realize infantile finger veinlet image objective, digital acquisition. Methods: Based on the traditional theory and method of traditional Chinese medicine pediatric diagnosis, we use image sensor to capture infantile finger veinlet image, and use Digital Signal Processor to analyse and process the image, combining reasonable structure design of image sampling device, to realize the digital acquisition of infantile finger veinlet image. Results: This design results follow the high speed, low cost and other preponderant characteristics, the time of image acquisition is short, the correct recognition rate is high. Conclusion: To realize the standard acquisition and automatic identification of infantile finger veinlet, to overcome the insufficient of no objective quantitative standard of inspection at the traditional Chinese medicine department of pediatrics, enhance the standardization and the accuracy of TCM clinical information acquisition, improve the scientificalness of diagnosis of syndrome differentiation.

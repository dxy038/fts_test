Solar energy production via photovoltaic (PV) cells has witnessed over 500% growth in cumulative installed capacity between 2006-2010 [1]. With this significant investment, there is a financial need to maximize the systemÂ´s power output, which can be achieved via a solar tracking system. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new, highly compact, integrated sensor consisting of 9 photo-diodes arranged in a 3&#215;3 grid with 4 light windows in a 2&#215;2 grid. The design allows simultaneous dual-axis solar tracking to take place with a single solid state sensor. Field-of-Views of &#177;58&#176; azimuth and &#177;52&#176; elevation and sensor calibrated errors of &#177;1&#176; and &#177;0.3&#176; in the azimuth and elevation direction, respectively, were obtained.

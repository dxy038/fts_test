Objective: In the present study, ‎we investigated the attitude of ‎psychiatrists who graduated in ‎‎2002-2009 towards Objective ‎Structured Clinical Examination ‎‎(OSCE) and conventional clinical ‎interview examination (Individual ‎Patient Assessment)‎‏.‏
Method: We studied 134 ‎psychiatrists graduated; half of ‎whom were examined with ‎conventional clinical interview ‎and the others with OSCE. A ‎questionnaire was prepared by a ‎specialist workgroup to assess ‎the participants’ attitude towards ‎the exams. The questionnaire ‎was initially examined in a pilot ‎study. The findings of the ‎questionnaire were used to ‎assess the graduates’ attitude ‎towards each examination, as ‎well as to compare the ‎examinations‏.‏
Results: The OSCE group ‎indicated a significantly more ‎positive attitude compared to the ‎conventional group (p = 0.03). ‎Furthermore, the OSCE group ‎believed the role of theoretical ‎knowledge (p = 0.01) and pre-test ‎practice (p = 0.03) to be ‎significantly greater for success ‎compared to the other group‏.‏
The structure of OSCE was ‎reported to be superior to ‎conventional examination in ‎terms of fairness and ‎homogeneity (p = 0.004). First ‎participation in exam (p = 0.04) ‎and ultimate success in the exam ‎‎(p = 0.009) were predictors of ‎graduates’ attitude‏.‏
Conclusion: Based on ‎examinees ’attitudes, OSCE may ‎be a more appropriate choice for ‎graduation examinations of ‎psychiatry compared to the ‎conventional clinical interview ‎examination.‎

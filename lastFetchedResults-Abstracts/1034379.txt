The choice of materials takes on strategic importance in design aimed at harmonising the performance characteristics and eco-compatibility of products in line with the Life-Cycle Design approach. The objective of the present study is the development of a systematic method which introduces environmental considerations in the selection of the materials used in components, meeting functional and performance requirements while minimising the environmental impact associated with the product's entire life-cycle. The proposed selection procedure elaborates data on the conventional and environmental properties of materials and processes, relates this data to the required performance of product components, and calculates the values assumed by functions which quantify the environmental impact over the whole life-cycle and the cost resulting from the choice of materials. As shown in the case study presented, the results can then be evaluated using multi-objective analysis techniques.

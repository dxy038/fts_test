Objective
The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of full-length cadaveric fascia lata (CFL) sling on quality-of-life outcomes.
Study design
Patients were 102 women (aged 29 to 87 years) who underwent the sling procedure for stress incontinence associated with intrinsic sphincter deficiency. They were followed up at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months with the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7), Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6), and a patient satisfaction questionnaire.
Results
Mean IIQ score declined from 55.1 before surgery to 11.0 at 12 months (P<.001). Mean UDI score declined from 67.1 to 28.0 at 12 months (P<.01). At 12 months, 79.7% of patients reported that leakage was better or much better, and 90.2% reported that they were somewhat or completely satisfied with their progress. Results were maintained throughout the 48-month follow-up period.
Conclusion
The CFL sling procedure has an enduring beneficial effect on lower urinary tract symptoms and quality of life.

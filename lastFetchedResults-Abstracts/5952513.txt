Compressed video bitstream is sensitive to channel errors that may severely degrade the reconstructed pictures. Error concealment techniques implemented at decoders are effective approaches to reduce the impact of errors. They mask the effect of missing blocks by using the spatial or/and temporal correlation to create image or video of subjectively acceptable quality. This paper presents three different modifications on the fast and efficient spatial error concealment algorithm proposed in by using bilinear and directional interpolations in order to achieve better subjective and objective quality. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms are obviously subjectively and objectively superior to the original fast and efficient spatial error concealment algorithm proposed in.

The necessity of reasonable choice manufacturing center and a general method are discussed firstly. Then a multi-objective evaluation model of factory location based on the Triangular Fuzzy Number is proposed. According to the method, the reasonable formulation of the deterministic index and the probabilistic index can be achieved, and solve the unnecessary error problem in calculation results brought by obfuscating deterministic data when the index evaluation value is indicated by traditional fuzzy membership. Finally the feasibility and the validity are demonstrated by utilizing example.

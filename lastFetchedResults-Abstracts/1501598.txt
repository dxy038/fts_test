This work proposes to use thermodynamic modelling, and fuzzy thermoeconomic to optimise the small waste water treatment plant work period concerning to sewage treatment and energy generation through products associated to it. Thermoeconomic optimisation is described as a fuzzy non-linear programming problem in those local criteria is multi-objective: maximum exergetic efficiency and minimal total cost rate. These objective functions and constraints for this non-linear programming problem can be structured and represented by fuzzy sets. Several simulations about real possibilities are done to search the best performance configuration for the small waste water treatment plant. Results deal to previous system optimisation that was a physical optimisation through a thermoeconomic analysis. Then, Pareto set for this one indicated that the system had been optimised previously and it is working with better configuration.

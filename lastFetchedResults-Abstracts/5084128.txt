Driver scheduling is an important part of the base of blocking. A better method of driver scheduling is advanced in this paper. First, a model is built, the optimization objective of which includes the opportunity cost of shifts and the least wage cost. Then a genetic algorithm is designed to get the optimization solution, and the driver scheduling model and algorithm is tested by the data of Route 115, Shijiazhuang, China. The result of the example indicates that the optimization scheme generated by the proposed method is better than original manual programming, and the solution process is simple and fast, which shows the validity of the approach.

OBJECTIVE: Acute fatty liver of pregnancy has been associated with a syndrome of marked depression of antithrombin III and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We sought to identify the clinical importance of this accelerated coagulation. STUDY DESIGN: The medical records of patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy identified during the period of 1982 to 1994 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy were identified for an incidence of 1:6692 births. Laboratory evidence of persistent disseminated intravascular coagulation was found in all patients tested. Six patients had clinical bleeding, all associated with genital tract injury. Twenty-three of twenty-three patients tested had markedly decreased antithrombin III levels (average 11%, normal range 80% to 100%). Seven patients received antithrombin III transfusions, which was associated with a significant transient rise in the plasma level. Compared with patients not transfused, however, there was a similar clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Profoundly depressed antithrombin III levels and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation were present in all cases of acute fatty liver of pregnancy but rarely influenced clinical outcome unless there was concomitant genital tract injury. Antithrombin III transfusions increased plasma levels, but no definite clinical benefit was established in this series because of the small number of cases. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:211-6.)

The effect of intense pulsed electron beam irradiation and final heat treatment on the element redistribution in the surface layer of refractory alloy parts was examined with the use of electron Auger spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and optical metallography. The studied specimens were made of bars, produced of the following refractory alloys: VT6, VT8, VT9, EP866sh. The irradiation of these targets were carried out using the GESA-l accelerator under the following conditions: electron energy - E=115-l20 keV; pulse duration - &#964;=15-40 &#956;s; and the energy density in a pulse (w) as well as the number of pulses (n) were increased from w=18 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, n=1 up to w=60 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, n=5. The objective of the present research is the discussion of results, dedicated to the effect of intense pulsed electron beam irradiation regimes upon the element distributions in the surface layer of refractory alloy parts.

Objective
To compare the frequency of nail biting in 4 settings (interventions) designed to elicit the functions of nail biting and to compare the results with a self-report questionnaire about the functions of nail biting.
Design

Randomised allocation of participants to order of conditions.
Setting

University Psychology Department.
Subjects

Forty undergraduates who reported biting their nails.
Interventions

Left alone (boredom), solving maths problems (frustration), reprimanded for nail biting (contingent attention), continuous conversation (noncontingent attention).
Main Outcome measures

Number of times the undergraduates bit their nails.
Results

Nail biting occurred most often in two conditions, boredom and frustration.
Conclusion

Nail biting in young adults occurs as a result of boredom or working on difficult problems, which may reflect a particular emotional state. It occurs least often when people are engaged in social interaction or when they are reprimanded for the behavior.

The objective of this paper is to review the tools available for modeling and simulating the Sensor Craft radar system concept and assess the challenging role and potential for STAP processing to support its intended missions in severe clutter. Airborne surveillance radar systems such as those proposed for Sensor Craft, will operate in a severe and dynamic interference environment. This interference is a sum of clutter, electronic counter measures (ECM), electromagnetic interference (EMI), and noise. The ability to detect weak airborne and ground targets requires the suppression of interference in real time. STAP techniques offer the promise of superior interference suppression capability. Extensive research into STAP for the AMTI mission, i.e. high radial velocity targets competing with clutter from the antenna sidelobes, has proven its superiority over non-adaptive techniques. Looking to the future, the advantages of STAP for the AMTI mission needs to be extended to GMTI, i.e., slow targets competing with clutter from the antenna main beam

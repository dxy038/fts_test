The objective of the RD50 collaboration is to develop radiation hard semiconductor detectors for very high luminosity colliders, particularly to face the requirements of the possible upgrade of the large hadron collider (LHC) at CERN. Some of the RD50 most recent results about silicon detectors are reported in this paper, with special reference to: (i) the progresses in the characterization of lattice defects responsible for carrier trapping; (ii) charge collection efficiency of n-in-p microstrip detectors, irradiated with neutrons, as measured with different readout electronics; (iii) charge collection efficiency of single-type column 3D detectors, after proton and neutron irradiations, including position-sensitive measurement; (iv) simulations of irradiated double-sided and full-3D detectors, as well as the state of their production process.

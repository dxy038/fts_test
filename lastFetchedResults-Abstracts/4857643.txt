Power converters have great importance in this technically advanced world because many electronic devices use controlled source. Thus new converting topologies are developing to get better operation in terms of efficiency. This paper deals with a bridgeless flyback converter topology which have bidirectional power flow capability. This converter have great importance in the inverters for residential use because, a single converter can be used as AC-DC converter for battery charging and DC-AC conversion while battery discharging. Conventional flyback converter is modified to the proposed bidirectional flyback converter. It is an integration of two flyback converters. The steady state operation and its switching strategy were presented here. Bidirectional flyback converter has been designed with the requirement of 40W, 24 V output in rectification operation and inverting operation aims for the single phase AC voltage of 230V. A battery storage unit is charged by the flyback converter and is discharging through the same converter for the residential AC load, when there is no conventional supply. Matlab/Simulink model has also been developed and relevant results are also discussed in this paper. Simulation results show good correlation with theory.

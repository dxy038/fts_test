The objective of the study was to evaluate the use of a totally biodegradable fixation device in the fixation of mandibular osteotomy in sheep. Mandibular unilateral body osteotomies were fixed with biodegradable self-reinforced poly-L-lactide (SR-PLLA) multi-layer plates and screws in nine sheep. The unoperated sides acted as control. The follow-up times were 6, 12 and 24 weeks, after which radiological, mechanical and histological studies were carried out. An analysis of the implanted material was also carried out. The results showed that the SR-PLLA plates and screws were strong enough to fix the osteotomy and that the osteotomies healed mainly with callus formation. Therefore we conclude that SR-PLLA multi-layer plates and screws can be used together successfully in the fixation of mandibular osteotomies without maxillomandibular fixation. However, before they can be used in humans, the size of the plate and screws should be decreased.

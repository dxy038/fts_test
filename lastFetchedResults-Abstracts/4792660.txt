Video-streaming can now be offered on third-generation (3G) mobile networks. Most research efforts have focused on video download. This paper presents a detailed study of challenges faced for successfully deploying applications requiring life video upload. Both subjective and objective qualities as well as the effects of mobility are analyzed on real 3G networks. Consequently, video profiles are identified for delivering adequate perceptual quality to remote users and guaranteeing uninterrupted video-streaming in presence of variable radio resources.

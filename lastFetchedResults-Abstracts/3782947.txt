This paper presents a conceptual design of a human engineered alarm system for a large fossil fueled power generating station. Well-known human factors engineering (HFE) principles have been incorporated into the design. Main features of this design are integration of hard-wired annunciators, localized alarms and CRT alarms into a comprehensive systein. The primary objective is that the alarm interface between the operator and the plant during a multi-faceted emergency should become manageable and useful to the operator.

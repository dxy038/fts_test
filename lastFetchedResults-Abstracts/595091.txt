Objective: To assess the outcome of surgical excision in management of subungual glomus tumour.Material and Methods: It was a prospective and descriptive study carried out in the Plastic Surgery unit, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar and Plastic surgery clinic. From 1994 to 2001, all patients presenting with clinical diagnosis of subungual glomus tumour and later confirmed by histopathology were included in the study. All patients were regularly followed up for recurrence of symptoms/tumours.Results: A total of 6 patients were managed during study period of 7 years. Predominantly the young females were affected (M:F = 1:5). The average symptoms duration was 3.6 years. Symptoms were completely alleviated by surgery. There was no sign of recurrence on clinical examination on an average follow up of 34.5 month. Minor skin infection occurred in one case. No other complication was recorded.Conclusion: The threshold for the possible diagnosis of glomus tumour should be kept low in patients presenting with severe subungual and finger pulp pain on localized pressure and cold exposure. Surgical excision provides cure to this crippling disease.

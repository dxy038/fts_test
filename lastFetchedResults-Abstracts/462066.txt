Background
The risk of developing nosocomial infectious diseases among medical personnel in the emergency department (ED) can result in tremendous psychologic stress. The objective of this study was to estimate the median amount of money ED personnel would be willing to pay for preventing nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Methods

A contingent valuation approach with close-ended format was used. During the study period from June 15, 2003 through June 30, 2003, a convenience sample of all medical personnel working in the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital was carried out. Participants were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and were asked to choose whether or not they would pay at a specified price to purchase a hypothetical SARS vaccine. A logistic regression model was created to evaluate the relationship between willingness-to-pay and the log of the price offered in the bid questions. The median and mean amounts of willingness-to-pay were calculated.
Results

A total of 115 subjects were interviewed and most were nurses (68.7%). The median and mean amount subjects reported being willing to pay for a SARS vaccine was US $1762 and US $720, respectively. Subject responses were significantly related to the price of vaccination and their type of job.
Conclusions

Medical personnel in the ED reported that they would be willing to pay substantial monetary amounts for preventing nosocomial SARS.

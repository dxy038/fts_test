Reasonable assessment of the road-region cultural heritages is a precondition to deal with the relationships between road construction and culture protection for sustainable development. It is very important to properly select the evaluation indexes. Only on the basis of systematic analysis on highway culture problems and a rational indexes system, which can exactly extract the character parameter of the indexes and endow it with scientific evaluation criterion, can it makes the evaluation true and objective, exactly reflecting the cultural status of the highway range. This paper studied the principles and the method on determining the evaluation index system on road-region culture stability. It put forward an index system for assessing road-region culture stability as a reference.

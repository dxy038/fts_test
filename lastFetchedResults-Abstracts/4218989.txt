A concept of integral control is applied to multi-operating-point, buck-derived, pulse-width-modulated (PWM) DC-DC converters. A large-signal circuit model of the power stage is introduced, allowing the load resistance to be eliminated from the system matrix. Two closed-loop, continuous-conduction-mode, push-pull converters are designed using the pole-placement technique: a conventional converter and a converter with a small inductor achievable by a bidirectional power flow. The large-signal dynamic performance of these converters is investigated by simulations in the time domain. The bidirectional power flow converter with integral control was found to be suitable in switched load applications, e.g., radar systems dot-matrix printers and power supplies for random-access computer memories

Background: Success rate in composite restorations is associated with the degree of polymerization
and light intensity,
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the light intensity of curing units in private offices
in Qazvin 2003.
Methods: In this analytical study the light intensity of 62 light curing units were investigated before
and after cleaning their light emitting tips using a radiometer. The results were classified in 3 groups
as follows: A: sufficient intensity> 300 rc: B: borderline intensity (200-299 mw/cm"), and Co
insufficient intensity<200 mW/,m'. Data were analyzed using chi-square and Pearson correlation tests.
Findings: Mean intensity of curing units was 350.96mw/,,"' which increased significantly to
371.6mw/,m' (p~O.OI). Before cleaning, 67.8% of curing tips were in group A, 14.5% in Band 17.7%
in C. After cleaning, 72.6% were in sufficient intensity group, 11.3% in borderline intensity, and
14.1% in insufficient intensity. Removing curing tips' contamination caused a significant increase in
light intensity (p=O.Ol).
Conclusion: Periodic assessment of light intensity and quality control of light curing units are
mandatory.

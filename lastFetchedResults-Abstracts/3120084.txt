Multilevel converters offer high power capability, associated with lower outputs harmonics and lower commutation losses. Their main disadvantage is their complexity, requiring a great number of power devices and passive components, and a rather complex control circuitry. The main objective of this paper is to reduce the number of power devices and capacitors required to implement a multilevel output and to reduce the harmonics at the output voltage using gating block for switches.

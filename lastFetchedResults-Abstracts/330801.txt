Objective. Experimental measurements on various restoration configurations have shown that restored teeth deform under the influence of polymerization shrinkage, but actual residual stresses could not be determined. The purpose of this study was to calculate and validate shrinkage stresses associated with the reported tooth deformations.

Methods. Three different restoration configurations were applied in a finite element model of a molar. The composite properties were based on experimentally determined composite behavior during polymerization. The occlusal deformation pattern and the residual stress states of the tooth, restoration, and tooth-restoration interface were calculated using a polymerization model based on the post-gel shrinkage concept. Reported strain gauge measurements and occlusal deformation patterns were used for validation.

Results. The shrinkage stresses depended on the configuration and size of the restorations. The tooth's resistance against polymerization shrinkage diminished with loss of dental hard tissue. Larger restorations resulted in lower stress levels in the restoration and tooth-restoration interface, but increased stresses in the tooth. The maximum stress values found for different configurations were not decisively different.

Significance. The validated model indicated that shrinkage stress cannot be based on composite properties or restoration configuration alone, but has to be approached as a distributed pattern that depends on the location and on the properties of tooth and restoration, geometry, constraints, and restoration procedures. Tooth deformation was indicative of stresses in the tooth rather than in the restoration or across the tooth-restoration interface.

Summary form only given. The objective of the present work is to estimate the on-line BER on candidate routes and wavelengths before setting up a call. Note that the existence of other calls currently in progress, i.e., traffic variation, will affect the BER estimate (because they will affect the cross talk in cross connect switches (XCSs) and the wavelength dependence and saturation of gains and ASE noise generation in EDFAs).

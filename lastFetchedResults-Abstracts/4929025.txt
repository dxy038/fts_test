The integrated design support system on the virtual reality environment (VRE) is proposed. The developing system provides the designer the features that are important for the better understanding of the object system and for the cooperative work with other designers. Object representation in VRE, knowledge representation of the objective system and the support for the numerical calculation are three major topics in the present study. The validity for each feature has been evaluated based on the design example of space power reactor

In class-E switching-mode power amplifiers, the switch-current waveform includes a step change ("jump"), approximated by a ramp of &lt;15% of the period. At a transistor\´s highest useful frequency, the large input drive required for fast-enough switching yields marginal power gain. Objective: a high-efficiency power amplifier with jumpless current and voltage waveforms. Previously, that was proven impossible for amplifiers using only linear passive components and an ideal switch. We present the theory of a new topology that does achieve the objective: a class-E amplifier with nonlinear passive or active components in the load network. A "biharmonic" version was simulated, built, and tested. It comprises a main stage switching at the output frequency f<sub>1</sub>, drawing DC power of approximately 3/4(P<sub>OUT RF</sub>/drain efficiency), and an auxiliary amplifier switching at 2f<sub>1</sub>, injecting 2f<sub>1</sub>-current into the circuit node at the main-stage transistor\´s output port to shape jumpless voltage and current waveforms. That switching (nonlinear) output port converts 2f<sub>1</sub> power from the auxiliary amplifier to approximately 1/4 of the f<sub>1</sub> power at the load. Computer simulation, and measurement on a scaled-frequency 3.5-MHz prototype, show that switching losses practically disappear when the main-stage switch is operated in the jumpless regime.

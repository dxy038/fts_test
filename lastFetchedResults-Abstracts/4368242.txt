Level crossings, which are located at the intersections of railways and roads should cross on the level, have some problems that likely system failures tend to extend to unsafe events. Thus a great deal of effort has been made on the safety of the level crossings for a long time. However, the question remains of how to solve those problems induced by failure conditions of train detection equipment as key events of the crossing controls. Therefore, we developed a system structure such that one controller operates several level crossing control locations to reduce capital cost and to reinforce the safety of level crossing control. Our aim in this paper is to show the safety of level crossing on the integrated crossing control system (ICCS), which we also developed with an effective train tracing logic to reinforce the crossing control logic for the bidirectional running, using electronic controllers

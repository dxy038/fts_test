The extraction of fuzzy rules is always a difficult problem to fuzzy system, in this problem performance and complexity are two conflicting criteria. We have proposed a two-objective algorithm based on particle swarm optimization algorithm and the weighted fuzzy neural network. It can evolve both the fuzzy neural networks topology and weighting parameters and obtained the near-optimal structure of fuzzy neural network for taste identification of tea. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

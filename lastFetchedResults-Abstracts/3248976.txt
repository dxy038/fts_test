The main objective of this paper is to give an overview of different hybrid MRAM/CMOS cells to use in the context of reconfigurable computing. The way to convert magnetic information into an electrical one is not unique and we propose to compare different kind of hybrid cells. These hybrid cells can be used to define structures as Look-up Table, configuration memory point, Flip-flop and other basic elements needed to define programmable logic. Even if these cells were designed for the TAS (Thermally Assisted Switching) MRAM technology, it is possible to adapt them to more advanced technologies such as STT (Spin Transfer Torque).

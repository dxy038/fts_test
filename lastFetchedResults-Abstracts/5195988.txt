The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of design factors which consist of training content, training delivery, trainer competency and opportunity to use on small businesswomen´s goal setting activities. The instrument for this research is adapted and modified from the Training Transfer Model and Model for Excellence (American Society of Training and Development Competency Research). Four independent variables: training content, training delivery and trainer´s competency and opportunity to use; and goal setting as dependent variable formed the framework for this research. Multiple regressions were used to investigate the relationship between design factors and goal setting. Findings from a survey of 246 small businesswomen attending training programs organized by government agencies showed that opportunity to use made the strongest contribution towards goal setting followed by training content, trainer´s competency and training delivery. Awareness on the constraints or barriers in design factors can assist the primary stakeholders (organizer and trainers) and human resource personnel in developing effective training programs which are expected to create a fair situation for them to accomplish their training objectives as well as beneficial to trainees to transfer the knowledge and skills to their own businesses.

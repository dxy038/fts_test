The objective of this research was to present and demonstrate the major aspects and underlying constructs of social engineering. An in-depth literature review was carried out resulting in the construction of a conceptual model of social engineering attacks. A case study was undertaken to understand the phenomenon with New Zealand-based IT practitioners to contribute insightful opinions. On this basis an improved model of social engineering-based attacks was formulated.

Air Traffic Management (ATM) forms a large and complex socio-technical system which includes a variety of interacting human and technical agents. These interactions may emerge into various types of nominal and off-nominal behaviours. Agent-based modelling and simulation can provide a systematic analysis of such emergent behaviours in ATM. In order to improve the agent-based modelling, in earlier research a library of agent-based model constructs for hazards in ATM has been established. The objective of the current paper is to integrate these agent-based model constructs into a large multi-agent model. To illustrate the integration approach, a formal description of a selected combination of model constructs is presented and the results are discussed.

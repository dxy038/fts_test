Background and Objective: Post pain operative is common and a major complication which lead to numerous dangerous effects in various organs. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of methocarbamol on postoperative pain following cholecystectomy.
Materials and Methods: In a randomized, double – blind clinical trail study 60 ASA I, II patient in two group (n=30 in each group) between 30-50 years old and weigh lower of 100kg undergone general anesthesia for cholecystectomy. Elective surgery was selected in Besat Hospital, Sanandaj, Iran during 2008. Both group did not receive premedication and under similar condition of general anesthesia. Interventional group received 500mg Methocarbamol intravenus slowly and the control group received 5ml placebo slowly after operation. The pain score were measured by visual anesthesia scale (VAS) on the 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after operation and if necessitated narcotics (PRN, VAS > 4) were prescribed. Data were analyzed using SPSS-16, ANOVA, Chi-Square and student’s t-tests.
Results: There were no significant differences between two groups in terms of age, gender. The mean of score pain was lower for interventional group at 6.24 hours after operation (P < 0.05). But no significant differences was observed at 1, 3 and 12 hours. The prescribe narcotic in interventional group was lower compared to controls (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: According to analgesic effects and low prescribe narcotics, it is suggested to use methocarbamol after operative due to analgesic effect.

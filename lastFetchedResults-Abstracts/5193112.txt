In this study, we consider a system with two processes (A,B) sharing a single resource. Through out the study we assume that each box consists of a single transition, and processes A and B work in a cyclic manner according to the temporal constraints. An ordinary timed Petri net is introduced, which demonstrates both conflicts and concurrency. The objective of this study is to describe the dynamics of the system when there is no conflict and focus on the natural sequence. We then analyse the situation when the conflict is introduced into the system

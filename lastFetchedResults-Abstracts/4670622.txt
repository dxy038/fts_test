The induction motor design represents a complex multivariable optimization mathematical problem with constraints. Even advanced mathematical tools do not guarantee a global optimum. Based on a nonlinear analytical field-circuit model, the paper introduces a novel practical approach structured into two stages: the optimal lamination and the longitudinal optimization. The first stage-divided into three substages-produces a unique optimal lamination crest section for given external stator diameter and number of poles, based on the criterion of maximum airgap flux density for given airgap and magnetization m.m.f. With only the external diameter as an independent variable, in the second stage, the chosen optimization objective function is minimized (maximized) in a straight forward iterative manner. Numerous practical examples have produced a global optimum. The total computation time for an optimal case study is less than one hour on a PC-486, meeting thus the claims of real practicality

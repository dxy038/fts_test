BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is known as one the leading causes of hepatic disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the liver damage in diabetes mellitus and the protective effect of milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) in rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocin.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 60 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups including: control diabetic, normal treated with 10 and 20% milk containing LA, and diabetic rats treated with 10 and 20 percent of milk containing LA. After 60 days fasting, blood samples were obtained directly from cardiac puncture and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, and albumin were tested. Histopathology of liver sections stained with H & E histological sectioning was prepared according to conventional methods.
FINDINGS: In diabetic rats, increase in serum liver enzymes, showed significant damage compared to the control group (p?0/05). While in the diabetic group treated with milk containing LA, these indicators when compared to diabetic group was significantly lower (p?0.05). The lowest level of ALT, AST and ALT in diabetic rats treated with 20% milk containing LA was 78±6.5, 205±3.4 and 168±1.9, respectively. Histopathologic findings were in agreement with the results of serum biochemical markers confirmed the repair of hepatic damage in the diabetic rats after intervention.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that milk containing LA has a protective effect on the liver of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes.

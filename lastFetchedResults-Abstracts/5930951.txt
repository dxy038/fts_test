The objective measurement of vocal cords for function and morphology analysis is one of the goals of current vocalization research, especially in the field of art phonetics. The main purpose of the authorsÂ´ research is to analyze individual videostroboscopic images quantitatively, and to provide helpful data for doctors to assist their clinical diagnosis and basic research. Here, the authors introduce the whole hardware devices first. Then they describe several algorithms that maybe useful for detecting the edge of vocal cords in an image. Finally, the authors put the system into practice to figure out the value of some important features of a clinically obtained real image

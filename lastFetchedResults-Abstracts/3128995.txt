Directing to the difficulty in system integration, an optimal control model of multi-agent and multilayer in automobile body coating line was proposed. The architecture of optimal control model was built, which included central coordination agent layer, regional coordination agent layer and equipment agent layer. Combined with the coordination principle of game theory, a coordination mechanism of the optimal control model was analyzed. For achieving the greatest degree on the collaboration of equipment, improving its intelligence and realizing the low power consumption, optimal coordination strategy was established, which took the minimization of system power consumption as objective function. Finally, the validity of the model was demonstrated by an example.

Multi-agents are increasingly gaining the attention of researchers and developers of virtual games. The agents can control the user performance, adapting the interface and automatically changing the difficulty level of tasks. The objective of this paper is to describe the development of a game that combines the technologies of Virtual Reality and Multi-Agent. This system aims at improving the cognitive functions in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. The integration of different technologies, the development methodology and the test procedures are described throughout the paper.

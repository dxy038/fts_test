OBJECTIVE: Histiocytosis - X (H-X) is more common in children who are under 12 years. It involves different organs such as bone, lung, liver , spleen and skin. The purpose of this study was to investigate about radiographic findings of patients with H- X that have been confirmed by pathology.
METHODS: This descriptive study was done to survey radiographic findings on patients with H-X. We studied the files and graphs of 32 cases who were hospitalized in Mond hospital (Tehran) during 1980-2000 with a confirmed pathological diagnosis after taking biopsy from different tissues such as skin, lymph node and bone.
FINDINGS: From 32 patients, 29 cases had bone involvement with involvement of flat bones more common than long bones in which metaphyses of long bones were more commonly involved than diaphyses. Lytic lesion with a defined limit and without sclerotic margins was the most common radiologic finding. In 23 cases, among the flat bones. skull was the most commonly involved bone. Vertebral involvement as vertebra plana and bilateral destruction of mastoid were observed in 5 and 3 patients respectively. In 12 patients, pulmonary involvement was noted with reticulonodular involvement as the most common radiologic finding.
CONCLUSION: In this disease, the bones especially flat bones were the most commonly involved. In long bones, the involvement of metaphysis was more than diaphysis.

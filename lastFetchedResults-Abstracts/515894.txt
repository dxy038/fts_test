Background and Objective: The incidence of CS has been increasing and one of the most important reasons is the request of healthy mothers due to their fear of labor pain. Regional analgesia as a popular technique is provided for labor pain relief. The aim of our study was comparison of two drugs used in spinal anesthesia: fentanyl and sufentanil. We assessed advantages and disadvantages of each.

Materials and methods: In a randomized double blind clinical trial, 64 parturient women in vaginal delivery room randomized to receive fentanyl or sufentanil with bupivacaine and epinephrine intratecally. All participants were 19-34 years old, gravid 1 to 3, full term (37 weeks), ASA physical status 1 or 2 with no absolute contraindication for vaginal delivery. We studied fetal and maternal complications and duration of pain relief. The SPSS software (version 16) was used for data analysis.

Results: There was no statistical significant difference between side effects and duration of pain relief (p value = 0.33), except for moderate sedation (p value = 0.046) and duration of second stage of labor (p value = 0.03) that have not clinical significance. Neonatal icter was the same (p value = 1) and headache and backache were seen in 25% and 3% of cases respectively.

Conclusion: Both drugs had the same effects and side effects, then, we can use each one which is available instead of another one. In addition, spinal analgesia with fentanyl and sufentanil for painless labor are safe with enough duration of pain relief.

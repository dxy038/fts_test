Introduction: Flexible flat foot is one the most common extremities diseases happen among adults, this causes change in foot, tibia, and higher joints alignment, pain and certain complications in upper joints and soft tissues.      
Objective: This study aimed to investigate differences in foot direction among patients with flexible flat feet as so called foot static response to a certain prefabricated insole.
Materials and Methodology: It was a quasi-experimental study and patients were consisted of 32 female with flat feet in range of 18 to 28 years old and to measure differences a laser device was used. The rear foot angle amount which is calculated by investigating the heel valgus angle and the forefoot angle amount which is calculated by   investigating leg angle and forefoot, both assessed at barefoot condition and with medial flange insole mode.    
Results: Results showed that by using the insole there is a significant decrease in direction of anterior line angle (p<0.001). At mean, by using  medial flange insole 3.5 degrees decrease at forefoot angle and 2.5 degrees decrease at heel angle was observed (p<0.001).
Conclusion: This study showed that the prefabricated insole with high internal septum could normalize the direction of foot. Namely, it corrected the heel angle and leg deviations. Moreover, the NAS line despite of specifying the leg changes, it represents the influence of orthoses on this section.

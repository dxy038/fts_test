Regional comprehensive corridor takes on the characteristics of heavy transport demand and supply, and consists of many travel modes; meanwhile, competition is severe among different trip modes. In order to avoid vicious competition so that transportation market is disturbed, multi-objective and nonlinear programming model is built up, which is based on the maximization of unity of traveler. The objective of model is minimization of distance between practical capacity coefficient and ideal capacity coefficient. Multi-objective is transferred into single objective by TOPSIS method before model is solved. The transformed objective function is multi-peak function, so niche GA is introduced into solving the problem to obtain all of optimal solution. K-means clustering is adapted to classify the set of optimal solution. The centre of gravity of each cluster is taken as value of decision variables. At last a numeric example demonstrates the validity and feasibility.

In this paper, the bit error rate (BER) performances of the physical layer network coding (PLNC) without channel coding in bidirectional relay networks with different PSK modulation schemes over Rayleigh fading channels are investigated. A bidirectional relay system where the two source nodes exchange information via a single relay node is considered. Several transmission scenarios, including both symmetric and asymmetric relaying, where the two source nodes use the same modulation and different modulation schemes in the multiple access channel transmission phase, are analysed. And an end-to-end BER analysis for each transmission mode is then given. Simulation results show that our derived BER analysis accurately matches with the simulation results for both symmetric and asymmetric relaying under various modulation schemes.

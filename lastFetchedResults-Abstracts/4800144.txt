The objective of the work is twofold. A first part is devoted to the problem of tracking trajectories of feedforward systems. A family of the time-varying state feedbacks which globally uniformly asymptotically and locally exponentially stabilize trajectories which are not necessarily periodic functions of the time is exhibited. Strict Lyapunov functions are constructed. In a second part, the problem of tracking a trajectory of the practical system called cart-pendulum system is solved

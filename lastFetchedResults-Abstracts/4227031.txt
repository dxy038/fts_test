The main goal of this paper is to extract land topographical information by analyzing the 3D GPR data by the Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima Lines (WTMM) method. The first objective is to delimitate boundaries of each obstacle, the second is to characterize each one with a special roughness coefficient. Application on real data shows that the proposed tool can enhance the GPR data interpretation.

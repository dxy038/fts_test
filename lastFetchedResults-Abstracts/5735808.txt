In this manuscript an attempt has been taken to solve the thermistor problem by using B-Spline FEM numerical technique. Here two different basis function has been adopted for the solution. The thermistor is a thermally sensitive resistor whose electrical conductivity changes drastically by orders of magnitude as the temperature reaches a certain value. Basis of its working is an electrical conductivity that is highly nonlinear function of temperature. The current flowing through the device drives internal Joule heating. The objective is to introduce the fifth order B-Spline Basis function to solve. There is some techniques are already exists in literature few terminology are adopted directly. The solution is obtained for the cold phase and warm phase separately for both the Basis function then a comparison table is made for the obtained solution. The solution of a PTC problem. Numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the exact solution available. paper. The comparison is also made with existing result which is also have a great achievement of study.

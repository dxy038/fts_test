Background: Occupational exposures to workplace hazards
in health-care workers can affect on their health including the
reproductive system. Some exposures cause reproductive system
disorders. Objective of this study was to compare reproductive
system disorders between hospital personnel who work in clinical
and administrative setting.
Methods: This is a historical cohort study on clinical and
administrative workers of hospitals. The study tool was flexible
interview and questionnaire. Pregnant personnel had been
followed until the end of pregnancy. Frequency of reproductive
disorders was compared between two groups. Data were analyzed
with SPSS 16, t-test, and ?2 were calculated considering P  <  0.05 as
significant level. Odds ratio had been calculated with a confidence
interval 95%.
Results: Frequency of menses disorders in clinical personnel
especially, personnel of emergency departments were the
highest and showed a significant difference between two groups
(P = 0.042). The odds ratio for menses disorders in clinical
personnel was 1.362 (1.008?1.84) and in administrative personnel
was 0.653 (0.368-1.159).
Conclusions: Clinical personnel are at higher risk for menses
disorders compared with administrative personnel. Assessing the
health of these personnel may help to improve future generationâ€™s
health.

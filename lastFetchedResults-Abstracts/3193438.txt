The objective of load identification is to manage power consumption by the determination of the operation schedule of individual appliances. We applied fuzzy clustering analysis and fuzzy pattern recognition algorithm to load identification in this paper. In the method, the most ideal state is to treat each household appliance as a classification, then cluster them, and get a clustering result about home appliances. One of the critical advantages of fuzzy clustering analysis algorithm is its capacity to identify the main loads accurately.

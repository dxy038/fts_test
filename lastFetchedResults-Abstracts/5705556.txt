In this paper, we present a portable intelligent electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system using the Zigbee wireless network technology. The system consist of both hardware and software development. For the hardware development, a Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), ECG sensor, preprocessing circuit, Zigbee transmission module, and external memory are used. And the FPGA with a Nios II soft-core CPU is the heart of the system, which is used to control all other units. As for the software development, a real-time system called &#956;C/OS-II is used and some related application programs is designed. The objective of this system is to continuously monitor cardiac patients.

The objective of this study was to determine the contents of biogenic amines (BAs) and aflatoxin levels in laboratory-made starter culture soybean fermented samples of Doenjang. Various starter cultures of Meju, made by using different microbial strains, were used for the production of Doenjang samples under standardized fermentation/manufacturing conditions, and the contents of BAs and aflatoxins were analyzed. Determination of nine different BAs and total aflatoxin was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography and immunoassay-based total aflatoxin detection kit, respectively. It was found that the amount of BAs in all laboratory-made starter culture Doenjang samples was within the limit of human consumption safety level. Also the level of total aflatoxin was under the limit, according to the standard parameters of FAO/WHO.

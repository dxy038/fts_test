Objective. This study assessed the impact of keyboard angles (in terms of Pitch, Roll and Yaw) on tendon travel and wrist and finger joint kinematics for the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis.

Design. A repeated measures, laboratory study was conducted. Independent variables were three Pitch angles, three Roll angles, three Yaw angles, and three keyboard separation distances. Dependent variables were tendon travel, wrist deviation, wrist and finger joint kinematics, and Borg comfort rating.

Background. The increased usage of computers and the risk of cumulative trauma disorders have led to the development of alternate keyboards. This study is a biomechanical assessment of several keyboard designs.

Methods. Lightweight wrist and finger goniometers were used to measure motion of the wrist in three planes, and for three finger joints. Fifteen experienced typists (eight women, seven men) typed a standard text on 30 keyboard conditions. Regression equations were used to calculate tendon travel from joint positions.

Results. Tendon travel is sensitive to changes in Pitch, Roll and Yaw angles with not, vert, similar13% difference between the minimal and maximal tendon travel. A flat keyboard produced more tendon travel than keyboards with greater Pitch and Roll angles.

Conclusions. There is a trade-off between wrist and finger positions; as the wrist extends more, the finger joints flex more to compensate. Keyboards imposed different trade-offs between the wrist and finger positions, affecting the overall tendon travel.

Background and Objective: Low Back Pain (LBP) is a common disorder that everybody may experience it at least once in his or her lifetime, interfering with function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of stabilization exercises and Pilates training method on LBP.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-three patients with chronic non-specific LBP were randomly assigned into two groups, 1- Stabilization exercises (n=12), and 2- Pilates training (n=11). They pursued their therapeutic protocols for six weeks. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Modified Shober test, and Oswestry Disability Index were used to evaluate pain intensity, flexion range of motion (ROM) of the lumbar spine, and function status of participants, respectively. SPSS software (version 20) with independent t and paired t tests were utilized at 5 percent to analyze the data.

Results: Lumbar spine flexion ROM, pain intensity, and function of both experimental groups significantly improved (P < 0.001) after the treatment. No significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed for changes of flexion ROM and function between the two groups, although pain was significantly (p < 0.05) alleviated in Pilates group in comparison with the other group.

Conclusion: Pilates method can be used as a part of rehabilitation program for patients with chronic LBP in order to decrease pain, increase ROM, and for improvement of function.

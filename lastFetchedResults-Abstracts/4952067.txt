This paper presents the working principle of a laser-based tracker for wide field of view applications. The objective is to develop a motion capture laser tracker based on a cost effective process that operates in the range of sub-centimeter accuracy. The laser tracker has a wide range of motion and can operate at high speed for both indoor and outdoor without the need for light calibration. Traditional laser scanning devices use expensive high dynamic steering mirror mechanism such as galvanometric scanners. The novel approach presented in this paper consists of splitting the tracking action into two sub-systems. First, a static local scanning based on several laser sources is implemented. The second sub-system consists of a global tracking that moves the overall head tracker using two electrical DC servo-motors. Applications targeted are object tracking and inspection of tanks. The approach is also valid for applications where traditional vision systems are not indicated because of non cooperative lighting condition and where an hemispheric field of view is required.

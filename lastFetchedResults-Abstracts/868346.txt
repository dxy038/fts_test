This paper deals with the production and preventive maintenance control problem for a multiple-machine manufacturing system. The objective of such a problem is to find the production and preventive maintenance rates for the machines so as to minimize the total cost of inventory/backlog, repair and preventive maintenance. A two-level hierarchical control model is presented, and the structure of the control policy for both identical and non-identical manufacturing systems is described using parameters, referred to here as input factors. By combining analytical formalism with simulation-based statistical tools such as experimental design and response surface methodology, an approximation of the optimal control policies and values of input factors are determined. The results obtained extend those available in existing literature to cover non-identical machine manufacturing systems. A numerical example and a sensitivity analysis are presented in order to illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach. The extension of the proposed production and preventive maintenance policies to cover large systems (multiple machines, multiple products) is discussed.

A survey of important data (maximum voltage and current ratings for the elements, rms values for the semiconductor devices and a rough approximation of the losses) of a half-bridge bidirectional DC/DC converter is given. A realistic converter model is derived. The transfer function for output voltage depending on the duty cycle and the transfer function for coupling of two voltage sources are calculated and the function of a zero voltage switching concept is explained.

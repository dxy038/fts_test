The objective of this study was to select the optimal operational conditions for the production of instant soy protein isolate (SPI) by pulsed fluid bed agglomeration. The spray-dried SPI was characterized as being a cohesive powder, presenting cracks and channeling formation during its fluidization (Geldart type A). The process was carried out in a pulsed fluid bed, and aqueous maltodextrin solution was used as liquid binder. Air pulsation, at a frequency of 600 rpm, was used to fluidize the cohesive SPI particles and to allow agglomeration to occur. Seventeen tests were performed according to a central composite design. Independent variables were (i) feed flow rate (0.5–3.5 g/min), (ii) atomizing air pressure (0.5–1.5 bar) and (iii) binder concentration (10–50%). Mean particle diameter, process yield and product moisture were analyzed as responses. Surface response analysis led to the selection of optimal operational parameters, following which larger granules with low moisture content and high process yield were produced. Product transformations were also evaluated by the analysis of size distribution, flowability, cohesiveness and wettability. When compared to raw material, agglomerated particles were more porous and had a more irregular shape, presenting a wetting time decrease, free-flow improvement and cohesiveness reduction.

This paper investigates the applicability of generalized dynamic neural networks for the design of a two-valued anesthetic depth indicator during isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia. The indicator construction is based on the processing of middle latency auditory evoked responses (MLAER) in combination with the observation of the patient's movement reaction to skin incision. The framework of generalized dynamic neural networks does not require any data preprocessing, visual data inspection or subjective feature extraction.
The study is based on a data set of 106 patients scheduled for elective surgery under isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia. The processing of the measured MLAER is performed by a recurrent neural network that transforms the MLAER signals into signals having a very uncomplex structure. The evaluation of these signals is self-evident, and yields to a simple threshold classifier. Using only evoked potentials before the pain stimulus, the patient's reaction could be predicted with a probability of 81.5%. The MLAER is closely associated to the patient's reaction to skin incision following noxious stimulation during 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia. In combination with other parameters, MLAER could contribute to an objective and trustworthy movement prediction to noxious stimulation.

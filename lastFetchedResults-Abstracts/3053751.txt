The integration of a low cost Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) with a microstrip antenna results in a low cost wireless-optical transmitter. The VCSEL impedance is matched to that of the antenna and initial microwave link results are shown. The VCSELantenna is then used as part of a fully bidirectional wireless optical link and data is successfully transferred between two wireless enabled laptops.

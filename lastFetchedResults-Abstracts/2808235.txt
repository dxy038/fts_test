This paper aims at the irreversible demagnetization phenomenon of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM). The author considers the main demagnetization factors of temperature and magnetic field distribution in IPMSM. The anti-demagnetization bidirectional magnetic network model of IPMSM is constructed by bidirectional magnetic network element, which can calculate distribution of radial and circumferential magnetic field lines. Basic characteristics and the anti-demagnetization capability of IPMSM are simulated based on the design. Then optimized result is obtained considering anti-demagnetization capacity and economy of IPMSM. The simulation results are compared with the finite element method (FEM) and experimental data with high precision.

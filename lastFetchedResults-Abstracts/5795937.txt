With the acceptance of service-oriented architecture (SOA) in many application domains and the rapidly growing number of available services, it is now a challenge to effectively discover and compose services to meet user needs. In this paper, we present a novel technique for automatic service discovery and composition based on bounded model checking. Specifically, given (1) a client specification of the objective service, described by a linear temporal logic formula, and (2) a set of available services, our technique discoveries these services which behavior satisfies the client specification or synthesizes a composite service that uses only the available services to realize the client specification.

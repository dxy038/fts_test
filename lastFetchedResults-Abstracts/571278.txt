Introduction & Objective: The study of biopsychosocial factors influencing nephropathy as a most serious complication of type II diabetes is important. This study aimed to investigate risk factors accompanied with nephropathy in patients with type II diabetes based on the biopsychosocial model. 
Materials & Methods: In a cross-sectional descriptive study, 295 patients with type II diabetes were selected by convenience sampling in Tehran Shariati hospital outpatient clinics. The data were collected by demographical information questionnaire along with disease characteristics and depression anxiety stress scales (dass), quality of life scale (who- qol- bref),  diabetes self-management scale (dsms), and diabetes knowledge scale (dks), then analyzed by chi-square, independent t-test and logistic regression with pasw software. 
Results: Hypertension (OR=3.841 & P < 0.003), glycated hemoglobin (OR =7.898 & P < 0.001), body mass index (OR=5.488 & P < 0.001), diabetes self-management (OR=3.102 & P < 0.001), depression (OR=2.574 & P < 0.007),  quality of life (OR=2.836 & P < 0.001), and diabetes knowledge (OR=2.941 & P < 0.001) can significantly  help differentiate diabetic patients with nephropathy from diabetic patients without nephropathy (P < 0.001). Sex, age, diabetes duration and stress do not play any significant role in the prediction of nephropathy incidence in this model (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: It is important to pay attention to hypertension, glycated hemoglobin, body mass index, diabetes self-management, depression, quality of life, and diabetes knowledge for therapeutic intervention programming and diabetes complications control protocols for diabetic patients.

Due to environmental concerns2interests in using renewable based distributed generation (DG) have been increased. Because stochastic nature of renewable energy resources such as wind speed and solar radiation, their effects on power system are different from dispachable distributed generation. In this paper, a method for distribution system planning and development is presented in presence of distributed generation with consideration of uncertainties. These uncertainties consist of uncertainties in power generation, failure rates and repair times of equipments as well as uncertainties in electricity market price. The proposed approach is based on optimization model including power loss reduction and reliability improvement. Stochastic generation of renewable DG is modeled by Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). Uncertainties in failure rates, repair times and electricity price are calculated using fuzzy theory concepts. Also objective values are calculated in Monte Carlo Simulation and optimization is done by genetic algorithm (GA).

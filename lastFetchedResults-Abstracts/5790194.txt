A DC-DC/AC Non isolated cuk converter is designed in this paper. This system comprises the centralized switching circuit, Non Isolated Cuk Converters, bidirectional port and battery. Renewable energy resources (Solar and Fuel cell) which are produced the DC outputs are given as inputs to this proposed system, whereas the output is either AC or DC without changing the structure of this system. This is done by proper pulses are given to the converter and inputs to the converters. It need not require additional devices like inverter, transformer and filter. Non Isolated cuk converter is used to improve the input voltage levels. The performance of this proposed system is analyzed by different controllers like Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) and Proportional Integral (PI) controller. Simulation results are shown that SMC provides good performance than PI controller. Moreover this derived controller is suitable for any changes at input voltage, it maintained constant load. MatLab/Simulation TM tool is used to perform this proposed system and the simulation outputs are viewed.

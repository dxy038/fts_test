This communication deals with the design and development of the antenna systems, for the Spacecraft and for the Ground Station, of the PICPOT satellite [1], a pico-satellite developed at Politecnico di Torino mainly as a students project [2]. The redundancy of the project requires a double link in the lower UHF and at S band. For such frequencies, miniaturized antennas have been designed and built for the satellite with the objective of reducing cost and size.

One of the disorders that affects school performance the most is isolated attention deficit disorder or attention deficit associated with hyperactivity or impulsivity disorder. This disorder poses difficulties to the students themselves, both in the verbal area and in reasoning and calculus, as well as to their teachers, as a consequence of the studentsâ€™ disruptive behaviors. The criteria established by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, revised are one of the most widely accepted procedures to diagnose the deficit, distinguishing three subtypes: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The main goal of this investigation is to determine whether there are differential patterns of cortical activation and executive control for these three types of subjects with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and for the control group (without ADHD). The sample was made up of 220 students, ages between 6 and 12 years: 56 in the control group, 54 predominantly with attention deficit disorder, 53 predominantly with hyperactivity-impulsivity disorder, and 57 with combined. The results obtained show that the four groups of subjects were significantly different in the two variables of cortical activation assessed (central and prefrontal) and in the five variables of executive control (inattention, impulsivity, response time, variability, and general executive control index). Multiple group comparisons confirm the proposed hypotheses. The results reveal a new path of great interest concerning an objective and reliable diagnostic assessment, and a pharmacological and behavioral intervention adapted to each specific situation.

Adsorption on activated carbon of organic compounds from a particle-free and low temperature gas stream has been investigated previously. However, the adsorption processes in a fluidized bed adsorber of particles interfacing with high temperature flue gas has rarely been studied. The major objective of the work was to demonstrate the performance of a fluidized activated carbon adsorber for removal of organic compounds [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX)] and particulate from flue gas of an incinerator at selected fluidized velocities, fixed bed heights, and bed temperatures. The particle-size distribution of particulate prior to and after flowing through the fluidized adsorption bed were also analyzed. The results indicate that the fluidized bed activated carbon adsorber has a high removal efficiency of PAHs and BTEX. Three evaluated parameters show different effects on PAHs, BTEX, and particles. That the fluidized bed activated carbon adsorber has the ability to filter coarse particles due to the inertia collision is also identified.

<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong>Rapid diagnosis of pertussis is important for the timely isolation of the infection source and early prevention measures among the contact persons, especially among non-vaccinated infants for whom pertussis is life- threatening.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>Targets <em>IS481</em>, <em>IS1001, BP0026 </em>and human GAPDH gene were used to develop a multiplex real- time PCR assay based on the TaqMan technology for detection and identification of <em>Bordetella pertussis </em>and <em>Bordetella parapertussis </em>in clinical samples. A total of 121 human clinical specimens obtained within 2012-2013 were used to evaluate the multiplex real-time PCR assay. Clinical specimens were also tested for culture and conventional PCR. Sensitivity and specificity for culture, conventional PCR, and multiplex real-time PCR were measured in comparison with a clinical standard for <em>B. pertussis </em>infection.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The lower limit of detection (LLOD) of the multiplex assay was similar to the LLOD of each target in an individual assay format, which was approximately 1 genomic equivalent per reaction for <em>IS481</em>, <em>IS1001 </em>and 10 genomic equivalents per reaction for <em>BP0026 </em>target. When the <em>B. pertussis </em>assays were compared with a clinical standard for <em>B. pertussis </em>infection, sensitivity was 5, 59 and 89% the specificity was 100, 100 and 100% for culture, conventional PCR, and multiplex real-time PCR, respectively.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Developed multiplex real-time PCR offers a fast tool with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of <em>B</em>. <em>pertussis </em>and <em>B</em>. <em>parapertussis </em>infections which is suitable for implementation in a routine laboratory diagnostics.</p>

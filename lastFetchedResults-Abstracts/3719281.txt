A current control scheme based on programmed PWM switching patterns is presented for AC motor drives. In this scheme, reference and feedback current correspondence is maintained with simultaneous optimization of a performance objective. The proposed scheme overcomes the disadvantages of the existing current regulators using the direct control approach and exhibits several advantages in terms of reduced switching frequency, minimum current/torque ripple, higher efficiency, and improved performance in the AC motor drive. Analytical and experimental investigations on a current-regulated induction motor drive confirm the predicted advantages of the scheme

The objective of the DT (deuterium-tritium) Preparation Project on the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) is to provide the capability required to perform a sequence of DT experiments in a manner which is consistent with DOE (US Department of Energy) orders and the environmental, safety and health requirements of the DOE and Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. These experiments will include the study of confinement and heating of DT plasmas, determining the effects of alpha particles, the demonstration of DT technical capability, and the demonstration of DT power production. The TFTR research plan summarizing these activities is shown

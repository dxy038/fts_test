In this work we propose multi-objective simulated annealing as a heuristic technique for optimal routing in time-driven sensor networks. Unlike previous algorithms and methods, this technique is intended to tackle multiple performance-related and other design objectives in a computationally feasible way. Since these objectives are usually in conflict, the general solution is formulated as the so-called Pareto set, which is the set of non-dominated design vectors representing different tradeoffs.

The main objective in the MDE<sup>1</sup> approach is to consider all handled items as models (they are &#194;&#191;first class&#194;&#191; entities). Then the second objective is to automate the integration of heterogeneous models, thanks to efficient model transformation techniques. In the field of avionic real-time and embedded systems, two modeling languages are now standardized and widely used. The UML<sub>2</sub> profile for MARTE<sup>3</sup>, ver-sion &#195;&#159;3 is standardized by the OMG<sup>4</sup> and the AADL<sup>5</sup> v2.0 is standardized by the SAE<sup>6</sup>. The MARTE profile is used in the first steps of the analysis for more abstract models (e.g. independent of the platforms), the AADL is more used in last steps of the design phase, in order to generate efficient code, mainly or the execution platforms. This paper focuses on the growing role of high-level abstraction modeling in the detailed analysis phase through an intensive the use of the MARTE profile.

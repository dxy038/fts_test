Objective

Febrile convulsion is the most common benign convulsive disorder in children. Meningitis is one of the most important causes of fever and convulsions, diagnosed by lumbar puncture (LP), a painful and invasive procedure much debated  regarding its necessity. This study evaluates the frequency of abnormal LP findings in a group of patients, to determine whether or not unnecessary LP can be prevented without missing patients with serious problems such as meningitis.

Materials& Methods

The study was a descriptive, cross sectional study, conducted on 200 children suffering from fever and convulsions. Medical files of patients were taken from the hospital records and relevant data were collected to complete the appropriate forms.

Results

Of 200 patients included in the study, 116 (58%) children were male, and 84 (42%) were female. 47 cases (23.5%) underwent LP, of whom just one (0.5%) had abnormal LP and meningitis.

Conclusion

Regarding Considering the low prevalence of meningitis in children with convulsion and fever, we conclude that by means of precise clinical examination and monitoring, it is possible to prevent unnecessary LP in these patients.

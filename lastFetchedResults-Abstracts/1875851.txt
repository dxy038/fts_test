OBJECTIVE: To identify learning needs and factors related to postdischarge use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation.

: Exploratory descriptive correlational.

G: Metropolitan and rural clinics.

TS: Adult patients (N = 21) and family caregivers, one half 60 years or older.

MENTS: Family interviews, life satisfaction and quality, family function and relationship, depression and learning preparedness.

S: There were numerous learning needs related to CPAP machine management, monitoring illness severity, and recognizing depressive symptomology, oxygen deficits, and cardiovascular sequelae. Family members are involved in overcoming barriers interfering with nightly CPAP use. Interview and questionnaire data clearly indicate life satisfaction improves after CPAP treatment.

SION: Predischarge and teaching programs coordinated by expert nurses are needed to address families' learning needs and support habitual long-term CPAP use. Family problem solving and depression interventions, instruction on recognizing symptoms of cardiovascular complications, and long-term follow-up programs are currently being studied.

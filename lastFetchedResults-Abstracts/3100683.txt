Objective This study is to explore the psychological and physiological characteristics of postpartum women in Jining City and analyze associated contributing factors. This will establish the necessary knowledge base for providing appropriate health education and nursing to women in the perinatal period. Methods Self-designed questionnaires concerning the general states, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were administered to all postpartum women admitted to three hospitals in the Jining central district between March 15 and April 15, 2006. Results Of the 505 subjects, 26.5% had depression and 18.8% had anxiety. Of the factors studied, level of education, social support, and occupation were found to be protective.

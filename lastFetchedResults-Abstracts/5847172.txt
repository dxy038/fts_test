Actual characteristics of Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) are simply introduced and a novel parameters optimization strategy of combining APSO algorithm with traditional PI controller is proposed considering specific SRM speed regulation requirements, and the application in different working environments is analyzed in detail. Through choosing an appropriate objective function as ITAE criteria, the best solution will be obtained by iteration computation processes. Simulation experiments have been implemented and the results firstly show that the PI controller parameters can be optimized automatically on the basis of APSO algorithm instead of classical cut-and-try work; then by employing the developed control strategy, more excellent speed regulation performance of the SRM system can be realized with smooth amplitude, rapid response, and low fluctuation content.

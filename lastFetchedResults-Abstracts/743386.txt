The first objective of the study was to compare the levels of big endothelin and endothelin-1 and other noninvasive parameters used for evaluation of disease severity in patients with stable chronic heart failure (CHF). Endothelin-1 and big endothelin plasma concentrations were measured in 124 chronic heart failure patients. The second objective of the study was to prove an association between endothelin-1 and big endothelin plasma levels and two frequent polymorphisms in the endothelin-1 coding gene (6p21â€“23) -3A/-4A and G (8002) A in patients with chronic heart failure. Thirdly, we tried to associate other noninvasive parameters of CHF, especially cardiothoracic index (CTI), NYHA classification, signs of pulmonary congestion (PC) and ejection fraction (EF) with determined genotypes of the two ET-1 polymorphic variants. There were significant differences between big endothelin levels in NYHA II versus IV (P<0.001) and NYHA III versus IV (P<0.001) and endothelin-1 in NYHA II versus IV (P<0.001) and NYHA III versus IV (P<0.001). No associations between plasma levels of endothelin-1 and big endothelin and polymorphisms G (8002) A and -3A/-4A in gene coding endothelin-1 were found. In patients with CHF with CTI above 60% the number of carriers of genotypes with ET-1 8002A (AA and AG genotypes) increases. Concerning on the -3A/-4A ET-1 polymorphism, we observed a significant difference in genotype distribution as well as in allelic frequency in the group of patients with CTI above 60% between patients without and with pulmonary congestion. The allelic frequency of 3A allele is twice elevated in the patients with pulmonary congestion (37.8 vs. 78.1%, respectively).

Trends in switching system technology lead to more faults of related groups of terminations. A new objective for simultaneous termination unavailability is presented, which is also applicable in these cases. The objective is independent of the size and the architecture of a switching system and covers, with one graph, single termination unavailability, complete system unavailability, and unavailability of any group of terminations. Verification of compliance with the objective is demonstrated

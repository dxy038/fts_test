There are many routing protocols and algorithms developed for data transmission in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main objective of this paper is an increasing of performance and reduction of energy dissipation in WSN. In this paper, the Bacterial Evolutionary Algorithm (BEA) or Bacteriologic Algorithm (BA) is selected to compare performance with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH). The fastest computation for the near optimal solution is obtained by using BA which causes less energy dissipation. The computer simulation showed that GA can decrease the distance of data transmission lower than BA and LEACH about 4% and 30% respectively. However, GaÂ´s disadvantage comes from slower speed with a high number of computed generation for data transmission in a WSN so the near optimal solution with faster computation can be obtained by using BA. According to the test, BA gives a lower energy dissipation of about 50% less than GA.

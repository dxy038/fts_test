Opportunistic Network is one kind of Challenged Networks, which focus on the feature that there doesn´t exist a persistent path between the source and the destination. DTN (Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking) is proposed to solve the problems in Challenged Networks, a lot of routing mechanisms has been presented, but most of them only focus one routing objective such as delay, packet losing rate, energy in their design. In this paper, we present a multi-objective routing decision-making model to satisfy different users´ and applications´ needs better. Firstly, we present a descriptive model of opportunistic network. Secondly, we give the partition of routing knowledge and routing objective in opportunistic network. Lastly, we present a multi-objective routing decision-making activities model and automata model.

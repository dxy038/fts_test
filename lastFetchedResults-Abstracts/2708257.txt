The optimal control of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) is an open problem with applications that include fluid, thermal, biological, and chemical systems. Receding horizon control is a kind of optimal feedback control, and its performance index has a moving initial time and a moving terminal time. In this study, we develop a design method of receding horizon control for systems described by nonlinear parabolic PDEs. The objective of this study is to develop a novel algorithm for numerically solving the receding horizon control problem for nonlinear parabolic PDEs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations.

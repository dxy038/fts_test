Geochemical anomaly all long is important foundation of forecasting mineral. The abnormal levels of Metals can cause vegetation biophysical, biochemical and canopy spectral variations. The objective of this research is to use the Hyperion image for deriving the geochemical anomaly information. In this paper, we study the vegetation remote sensing anomalies characteristic caused by the high background contents of copper, gold, nickel, chromium, phosphorus, magnesium PuLan in the study area, and select the TVl, MSl and SIPI three kinds of vegetation index to extract bio-geochemical anomaly information. Two Hyperion images of the PuLan in the northwest of Yunnan Province was acquired and evaluated for geochemical anomaly mapping. The results show that the chemical anomaly in the study area can be identified from Hyperion data very efficiently. The Geochemical anomaly information extracted from Hyperion data is largely consistent with the geological map and previous research results. The study explored the utility of Hyperion data in geochemical anomaly mapping.

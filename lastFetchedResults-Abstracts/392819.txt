An aberrant internal carotid artery (ICA) is a rare vascular anomaly and causes to objective pulsatile tinnitus and retrotympanic mass. In the past, it was often diagnosed during ear surgery or biopsy, which may lead to massive bleeding. We present a case of 37-year-old woman complaining of pulsatile tinnitus. The tinnitus was objectively audible at the right ear through an otoscope. Previously, MRA plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the aberrant ICA. But in this case, the resolution of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was not enough to portray the course of the ICA, because dephasing of the spins due to turbulence may cause loss of the signal intensity on MRA. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone revealed aberrant internal carotid artery passing through the middle ear. It is important to diagnose approximately this anomaly using with combination of high-resolution CT, MRI, and MRA.

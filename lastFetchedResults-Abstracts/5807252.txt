The opening and operation of high-speed railway will be soon. Therefore, it is urgent to generate the appropriate train program. However, the program mapping of the train plan and optimization methods are very complex and diverse, the urgent need for the train plan is to provide information technology to support programs. It will effectively help train plan to be programmed and adjusted. This paper integrates the technologies of the train plan at home and abroad with a variety of expressions of the program, which is designed based on high-speed railway passenger train plan for multi-granularity expression system. The purpose is to achieve passenger train visual programming operations management and multi-objective analysis and help promote the modernization and upgrading of the railway management means the level of rail transport to provide strong support for the organization.

Studying the optimal subsection of distribution networks feeders, a subsection scheme synthesizing load and the length of subsections is presented. Hierarchical data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is proposed for multi-objective evaluation of subsection schemes. First, the scientific assessment system is established by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the weights of assessment criteria are derived from the judgment matrix. Secondly, the actual index data is used to structure DEA model, the schemes are evaluated quantificational with regard to different assessment criteria. Finally, each scheme is evaluated comprehensively. Using this method and the evaluation system to evaluate the subsection schemes, the evaluation results show that the assessment method is scientific and effective; the subsection method presented in this paper can better meet the economic and reliability requirements and is simple and practical.

In the light of the analysis of CNM (contract net model), this paper brought forward an improved solution based on cooperative scoring. First, we attributed the motives of cooperation to the pursuit of the cooperative scores (credit score and task score). Second, the cooperation behavior was turned into multi-objective optimization decision for single agent. Third, the stress of cooperation support was changed into keeping the balance of creditable agents and utilitarian agents. We called this novel model as CS-CNM (contract net model based on cooperative scoring). By means of the simulation, this model shows moderate adaptability, which is meaningful and helpful for complex applications in the situations of self-interested agent

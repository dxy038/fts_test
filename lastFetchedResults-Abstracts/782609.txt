Experiment 1 was designed to determine if the estrous response and pregnancy rates differ
between two synchronization protocols (Ovsynch vs two PGF2  injections, 10 days apart), in
Beetal and Dwarf does. The Ovsynch group of goats (n = 14) received an intramuscular injection
of a GnRH analogue (12.5  g lecirelin) on day 0 and a treatment of a PGF2  analogue
(37.5  g d-cloprostenol), on day 7 – followed by a second injection of the GnRH analogue
48 h later (day 9). The double PGF-treated goats (n = 14) received two intramuscular
injections of a PGF2  analogue 10 days apart. The estrous response did not differ significantly
between the regimes (Ovsynch 71%; double PGF 100%). Further, the interval from
standing estrus to ovulation (24 ± 3.7 h vs 30 ± 2.7 h), ovulatory diameter (7.1 ± 0.2 mm vs
7.0 ± 0.2 mm), pregnancy rate (60% vs 78%) and fecundity (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 1.6 ± 0.7) was not
significantly different between the Ovsynch and PGF treatment groups. The objective of
Experiment 2 was to determine if the administration of GnRH at the time of natural breeding
increases the pregnancy rate in Beetal goats. Goats were randomly allocated to two
groups (GnRH, n = 11 and Control, n = 14). The GnRH-treated does received 12.5  g lecirelin
on the day of natural breeding, while the control does received no treatment. The interval
from standing estrus to ovulation (31.2 ± 2.9 h vs 36.0 ± 5.3 h; P > 0.05), ovulatory follicle
diameter (6.7 ± 0.1 mm vs 7.2 ± 0.5 mm; P < 0.05), pregnancy rate (54% vs 64%; P > 0.05) and
fecundity (1.5 ± 0.5 vs 1.7 ± 0.5; P > 0.05) were evaluated for the GnRH and control does,
respectively. It could be concluded that the Ovsynch treatment appeared to be similar to
the double PGF protocol in terms of the reproductive response. However, this needs to be
tested on a larger herd size. Furthermore, it would seem that the use of GnRH at the time
of breeding also did not significantly improve the reproductive rate in goats.

Cloud computing paradigm allows subscription-based access to computing and storages services over the Internet. Since with advances of Cloud technology, operations such as discovery, scaling, and monitoring are accomplished automatically, negotiation between Cloud service requesters and providers can be a bottleneck if it is carried out by humans. Therefore, our objective is to offer a state-of-the-art solution to automate the negotiation process in Cloud environments. In previous works in the SLA negotiation area, requesters trust whatever QoS criteria values providers offer in the process of negotiation. However, the proposed negotiation strategy for requesters in this work is capable of assessing reliability of offers received from Cloud providers. In addition, our proposed negotiation strategy for Cloud providers considers utilization of resources when it generates new offers during negotiation and concedes more on the price of less utilized resources. The experimental results show that our strategy helps Cloud providers to increase their profits when they are participating in parallel negotiation with multiple requesters.

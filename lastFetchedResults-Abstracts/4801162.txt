Mutual influence always exists among the indices in engineering project investment evaluation system. Since ANP (Analytic Network Process) technique can scientifically reflect the mutual influence among the indices, it is introduced into this paper instead of AHP to overcome the defect that traditional AHP technique can not reflect the relationship among the indices. And in the weight determining process, entropy method is adopted in combination with ANP to avoid the respective unilateralism of subjective weight method and objective weight method. On this basis, TOPSIS method is applied in the comprehensive evaluation for the engineering project investment schemes to quantitatively rank these schemes. Finally, by means of Super Decision software, an example is provided to show the effectiveness and scientificity of this evaluation technique.

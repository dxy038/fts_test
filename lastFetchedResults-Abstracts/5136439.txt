As electricity market participants are prevented from investing in transmission facilities and services in most markets, so transmission expansion may have not sufficient stimulation for competition within the market participators. Therefore an important issue in transmission expansion planning (TEP) is to facilitate competition among GENCOs. In order to make transmission expansion more competitive, in this paper a method proposed with objective function that defined in such a way that GENCOs with low-bids will mostly take into consideration. Therefore, providerspsila interest is to bid with minimum rate, that leads to a competition to decrease bids by GENCOs. Then, optimal results calculated base on total cost of each pattern that is calculated by non-competition and ENS costs in different time intervals. Such a competitive expansion of transmission capacity would allow the participants to improve the efficiency of the electricity market.

After analyzing the essence of service selection, an optimum service selection genetic algorithm with multi-objective constraints is proposed. The algorithm includes a matrix-coding scheme of chromosomes that expresses the relationship between service providers, services and end-users. Special crossover and mutation operations based on matrix-coding are constructed, and both operations can ensure that the new chromosomes are feasible. Simulation results show that this algorithm can obtain the optimal solutions of the test problem instances efficiently and steadily.

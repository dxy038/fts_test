A new algorithm for effectively removing impulsive noise in digital images is proposed. Our computationally efficient algorithm first classifies corrupted pixels and then performs median filtering only for them. We introduce new efficiency factors to compare the performance of the noise detection algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the existing methods in terms of both objective and subjective evaluations

Image registration is to find a suitable space transformation, making two or more images match accurately on the same points. The main time consuming is on the matrix computation over the iterative procession. As the image size increasing, the numerical approaches based on the pixel matrix may step up the computation complexity, and it is difficult to perform the large size registration on a single computer in a limited time. Then one of the most efficient solving methods is parallel computing. In this paper, we discuss a multithreading method to produce the image registration computing, detail its parallel implementation on a 4 nodes dual-core cluster, and apply this procession to the meteorological objective tracking. Some experimental results show that this method can produce the large size image registration and reduce the computation time.

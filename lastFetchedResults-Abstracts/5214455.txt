This paper presents results of modeling and solving a maintenance scheduling problem of generating units in competitive environment. In this environment, management of GENCOs and grid is separated, each maximizing its own benefit. The objective function for the GENCO is to sell electricity as much as possible, according to the market clearing price forecast. The objective function of ISO is to maximize the reserve capacity of the system with equal ratio of reserve capacity in each period; provided the energy purchase cost should be smaller than a pre determined amount when the units of GENCOs are out for maintenance. Therefore there are two objective functions for finding an optimum maintenance schedule in restructured power systems. In this paper we apply genetic algorithm methodology for finding the optimum preventive maintenance schedule of generating units

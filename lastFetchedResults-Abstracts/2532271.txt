Background: Quality assurance in the hematology laboratory is a must to ensure laboratory users of reliable test results with high degree of precision and accuracy. Even after so many advances in hematology laboratory practice, preanalytical errors remain a challenge for practicing pathologists. This study was undertaken with an objective to evaluate the types and frequency of preanalytical errors in hematology laboratory of our center.
Methods: All the sles received in the Hematology Laboratory of Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India over a period of one year (July 2013July 2014) were included in the study and preanalytical variables like clotted sles, quantity not sufficient, wrong sle, without label, wrong label were studied.
Results: Of 471,006 sles received in the laboratory, preanalytical errors, as per the above mentioned categories was found in 1802 sles. The most common error was clotted sles (1332 sles, 0.28% of the total sles) followed by quantity not sufficient (328 sle, 0.06%), wrong sle (96 sles, 0.02%), without label (24 sles, 0.005%) and wrong label (22 sles, 0.005%)
Conclusion: Preanalytical errors are frequent in laboratories and can be corrected by regular analysis of the variables involved. Rectification can be done by regular education of the staff.

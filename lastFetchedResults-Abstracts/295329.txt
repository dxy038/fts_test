Objective: It is controversial whether the use of prostaglandin inhibitors could prevent progressive dermal ischemia in the postburn stasis zone. This study evaluated the effect of Ibuprofen on preventing postburn dermal ischemia using an animal model of India ink perfusion and skin transparent preparation techniques. Methods: The closely clipped backs of the guinea pigs were bathed in 75 °C water for 10 s. Ibuprofen-treated groups were fed intragastrically with Ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg) every 6 h. All animals were perfused with 70% India ink via a cervical artery cannula at 16 kPa constant pressure at 0, 8, 16, 24 h postburn. Skin transparent preparations were made, and 6-keto-PGF1α and TxB2 levels in skin tissue were assessed. Results: India ink filling rates in skin capillary plexuses decreased gradually with postburn time elapsing (P<0.01). 6-keto-PGF1α and TxB2 levels in two groups increased. The increase of TxB2 was dominant, which was related to postburn dermal ischemia (r=0.742, P<0.01). Though levels of 6-keto-PGF1α and TxB2 decreased in Ibuprofen-treated groups, India ink filling rates showed no significant difference between controls and experimental groups (P>0.05). The results were also confirmed by observation of skin transparent preparations. Conclusion: This study suggests that Ibuprofen has no preventive effect on progressive dermal ischemia after burning.

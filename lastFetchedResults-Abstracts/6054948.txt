The question of how to promote the graduate student´s simulation ability and achieve the purposes of visualizing the principles in signal processing course is addressed in this paper; In pursuit of this objective the design and realization for several virtual instrument modules based on the platform LabWindows/CVI with graph user interfaces (GUI) which provides users the functions of flexible data acquisition, signal analysis and processing, signal output and display on the windows platform are presented. The project of the simulation not only realizes the idea ´The software is the instrument´ which achieves the Dynamic Demonstrating Experiment Teaching in the classroom, but also as a context of tacit knowledge utilization make the acquisition and sharing practical know-how take place between project team members. It is really to kill two birds with one stone.

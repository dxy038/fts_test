In this paper, we study the wireless sensor network deployment for water pollution monitoring in the Amazon rainforest rivers. Our objective consists in minimising the number of deployed geographical field installations along the river, while ensuring the detection of the substance spilled in the given river regardless of the position of its source. A geographical field installation is formed by a set of barrier coverage underwater sensors which detect the pollutant if its molarity in the water is greater than a predefined threshold. Indeed, the substance molarity is inversely proportional to the moving distance. To generate the best topology, we propose a sub-optimal novel geographic Installation Field Deployment Algorithm based on the Backtracking heuristic named BT-FIDA. Since the river has a several forks, in order to reduce the number of installation fields, BT-FIDA minimises the rate of at least 2-covered river segments. The simulation results obtained show that our proposal minimises the number of field installations (i.e., deployment cost) while minimising the rate of areas which are miss-covered and over-covered.

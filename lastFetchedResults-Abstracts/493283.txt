Background: Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) a member of the Lamiaceae family is used in traditional medicine in treatment of different human diseases. Also, this plant used as a culinary herb and a source of flavouring principles. Mycorrhizal fungi have been observed to be associated with plants cause to improve their productivity. 
Objective: Study of growth changes and some physiological parameters of basil after colonization with a native mycorrhizal fungus, Glomus etunicatum.
Methods: The effect of a mycorrhizal fungus Glomus etunicatum on the growth and some physiological parameters of two cultivar of basil (green and purple) were investigated under greenhouse conditions in three replications.
Results: Results showed that the roots of basil cultivars were colonized significantly with Glomus etunicatum. Mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased leaf area, shoot and root fresh and dry weight, chlorophyll a and b, total phenolic and anthocyanin contents of mycorrhizal plants as compared to the non-inoculated plants.
Conclusion: The endo-mycorrhizal fungus Glomus etunicatum isolated from Iranian soils affects positively on the growth and physiological parameters of the basil cultivars, and it could be applied for improvement of basil growth.

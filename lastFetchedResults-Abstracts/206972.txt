Group technology (GT) has emerged as an important scientific philosophy in improving the productivity of manufacturing systems. GT philosophy offers a systems approach to the reorganization of traditional complex job shop and flow shop manufacturing systems into cellular or flexible manufacturing systems. The main objective of this philosophy is to achieve benefits for manufacturing systems . For implementation of this method the formation of machine part
families is an important task in the design of cellular and flexible manufacturing systems. The formation results in the creation of many benefits for mnufacturing systems. Among the many methods utilized in rnachinecells formation, the similarity coefficient method(SCM) is most widely used. When SCM is used, the
rearrangement of machine and part components is required to form machine-part families.
This process of' rearrangement has been considered as being subjective and difficult and may result in improper assignments to parts families, resulting in a negation of benfits promised. This paper presents an effective algorithm to identify part families and bottleneck parts, given machine groupings, rather than addressing the machine grouping problem in general.

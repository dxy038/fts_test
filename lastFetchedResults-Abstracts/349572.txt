Objective
To describe the clinical and electrophysiological evolution of a group of patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) who have not undergone any type of treatment (injections, braces or surgery).
Methods
Clinical and electrophysiological monitoring was done consecutively in a series of patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of CTS. The average time for follow-up was 2 years. The Historic and objective Classification scale (HiOb) was used to establish the severity of the disease in the test group, and neuro conductions were done to determine the electrophysiological classification.
Results
A total of 132 patients were monitored. In 31 patients (23.4% of the cases), the HiOb classification deteriorated, 28.8% remained stable, and 47.6% showed recovery. In the nerve conduction studies, 10 cases (7.6%) exhibited electrophysiological deterioration, 67.4% remained constant and 25% improved.
Conclusions
A significant percentage of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome had no change in their clinical and electrophysiological condition, while some improved spontaneously without treatment.
Significance
Given that most patients diagnosed with CTS remain stable or even improve over time, a conservative treatment may be all that is needed in a selection of patients with this disorder.

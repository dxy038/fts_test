The islands have plentiful renewable recourses such as solar, wind, wave, tide energy. They can not only improve the power supply ability of hybrid system on the island, but also minimized the operating frequency of the diesel power generation unit, which could contribute to environment protection. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model is presented with the economy and power supply reliability as the optimal objects, and the island micro grid as the object of study. Considering the ocean unique environmental condition, the optimum capacity will be solved by traversal method. At last the software has been designed based on the methods above, which can get the result of the best demand for power generations and energy storage devices quickly, and provides a reference for the design of the micro grid.

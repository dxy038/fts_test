This analysis has been based upon field research conducted by AGERGS, a regulating agency of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in December 1999. The study comprises 86% of the cities of this state, accounting for 98% of the urban population. The main objective of this study is to detect the expectations of the population with regard to power services in order to derive two main conclusions: to understand the population´s acceptance and tolerance to the services offered; to evaluate the practical possibility of fulfilling these expectations. The information in this research has crucial importance in supporting issues about quality service regulations for consumers´ satisfaction. With the regulation restructuring in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in 1997, eight concessionaires started to supply energy in most of RS. That is when AGERGS was created, aiming to regulate the electric power service in the state based on an agreement with ANEEL, the National Agency of Electric Power. A correlation between the consumers´ satisfaction and the incidence of power supply interruptions was verified in the research. In this study we analyze some results of the opinion poll performed and present the correlations and statistical tests that result from it

In the case of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, the full state vector is generally unknown on account of the nature of the system and the difficulty of measuring some components of the state vector. The objective of the paper is an experimental comparison between two different sliding surface algorithms applied to the two real one link manipulators. The first algorithm is a variable structure adaptive control with reference model using only the measurements of input and output; the other algorithm is a variable structure adaptive control with reference model using the full state vector. To increase the switching frequency and reduce the amplitude of switching oscillations a variable related to the acceleration of the manipulator shaft is introduced in the switching surface

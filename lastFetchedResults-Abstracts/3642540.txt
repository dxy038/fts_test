This paper presents the joining of active nonlinear polymer waveguides with passive silicon nitride waveguides (SiO<sub>2</sub>-Si <sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub>) to form an integrated Mach-Zehnder modulator with a lateral electrode configuration on a silicon substrate. Passive and active waveguides are based on a silicon-nitride-strip guiding structure. In the active waveguide a nonlinear polymer layer is used to obtain an index modulation via the electrooptic effect. Despite the silicon nitride strip based guiding structure, 63% of the energy of the fundamental mode is guided in the nonlinear polymer (provided by Flamel Technology, Venissieux, France). Poling with field strengths up to 75 V/&#956;m applied to the lateral electrodes has been employed to orient the chromophores. A half wave voltage of 35 V has been measured for an electrooptic coefficient of 5.8 pm/V at a wavelength of 1.3 &#956;m. Optical loss measurements have been done on polymer and passive waveguides. The best results have been 1.8 dB/cm for the active and 0.78 dB/cm for the passive waveguides leading to a total loss of 6 dB for a modulator with an interaction length of 2.5 cm. The coupling loss between a laser diode and the passive waveguide structure was measured to be at least 4.6 dB using a microscope objective and piezo-electric displacement elements. Stability tests under atmospheric conditions have shown a decrease of the electrooptic coefficient which might be due to the hygroscopic behavior of the active polymer. The bandwidth of the modulator has been determined to be 4 MHz

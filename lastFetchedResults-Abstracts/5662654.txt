Dynamic allocation of network resources in packet-based mobile ad hoc networks requires the operation of autonomous mechanisms that can provide assurance that the user or host application can reasonably expect a satisfactory quality-of-service (QoS). In general, a combination of mechanisms is required to operate concurrently and in real-time to meet this objective. This paper discusses an architectural framework for a mobile ad hoc node, where the functionality required to achieve QoS is achieved by a combination offunctional layers and cross-layer control methods. The framework enables functionalities to support QoS at the application, transport, network, MAC, and physical levels by adaptation to application traffic loads, network conditions, topology, and radio linkperformance. The QoS framework described provides a basis for many possible implementations. Examples of its application that illustrate key functionalities are discussed. These include: adaptation of physical layer attributes to enhance network fabric capacity, source to destination path selection to enhance end-to-end performance, and admission control to facilitate operation.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of assessing individuals in the group or team of learning and therefore this should lead to the assessment of the group or team itself as a learning entity. Many problems exist at distant learning devices, such as the lack of possibilities for structuring and planning of assessment activities. Hence the lack of consideration of susceptible scenarios to be exploited in collaborative assessment situations to reap the maximum of indicators that will help a more objective assessment knowing that any evaluation system is afraid of being subjective. For these reasons, we propose an architecture which expresses the fundamental structure of the proposed system which represents a set of components forming a web wizard to take, manage and track the assessment processes of collaborative activities.

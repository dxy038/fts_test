The study of vehicle navigation in constrained space depends on both the mobile base and on the assigned task. However, it always leads to considering the problem in term of path finding in the admissible space. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of a feasible trajectory for person on wheelchair during the assessment of accessibility of habitat. The objective is to evaluate the accessibility to the mobility and to the reachability. The calculation of the trajectory for a person in wheelchair is not necessary because he/she always executes a trajectory that seems to him the most comfortable. According to that, we just prove the existence of at least one feasible trajectory for wheelchair.

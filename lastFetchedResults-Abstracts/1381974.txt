The objective of this paper is to propose a novel methodology for determining dynamic fracture toughness (DFT) of materials under mixed mode I/II impact loading. Previous experimental investigations on mixed mode fracture have been largely limited to qusi-static conditions, due to difficulties in the generation of mixed mode dynamic loading and the precise control of mode mixity at crack tip, in absence of sophisticated experimental techniques. In this study, a hybrid experimental–numerical approach is employed to measure mixed mode DFT of 40Cr high strength steel, with the aid of the split Hopkinson tension bar (SHTB) apparatus and finite element analysis (FEA). A fixture device and a series of tensile specimens with an inclined center crack are designed for the tests to generate the components of mode I and mode II dynamic stress intensity factors (DSIF). Through the change of the crack inclination angle β (=90°, 60°, 45°, and 30°), the KII/KI ratio is successfully controlled in the range from 0 to 1.14. A mixed mode I/II dynamic fracture plane, which can also exhibit the information of crack inclination angle and loading rate at the same time, is obtained based on the experimental results. A safety zone is determined in this plane according to the characteristic line. Through observation of the fracture surfaces, different fracture mechanisms are found for pure mode I and mixed mode fractures.

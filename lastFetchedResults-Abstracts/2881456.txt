Novel robotized and haptic technologies are popular among the bio medical research areas due to its precision in operation. This paper presents haptic implementation to orthopedic surgeries which requires high skilled process. Due to the diversity of human bone it is very difficult to make accurate decisions. Therefore orthopedic drill with haptic interface is very important to make real time decision to avoid unwanted damage to tissues and other anatomic parts surrounding the bone. This research propose a haptic interface to current orthopedic drill to feel the irregularities of bone. The objective of proposed method is identify the profile of the bone, breakthrough and transfer the discrimination among the bone profile to the surgeonÂ´s hand to improve the accuracy of decisions.

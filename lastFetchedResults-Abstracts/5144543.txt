Since its initial publication in 1983, IEEE 515 has been the primary industrial trace heating standard in the US and the basis for many other countries and international industrial trace heating standards. With the overall objective of one worldwide standard for industry, the goals of revised IEEE P515 were to incorporate technical updates and further harmonize with international industrial trace heating standards. The two industrial trace heating standards considered were IEC 60079-30 -1 &amp; -2 [1] [2] and CSA 130-03 [3]. This paper presents the key changes in IEEE 515-2011 [4], the process used for harmonization, and the rationale for the additions and changes.

Objective
m of this study was to assess the short term effect of ethanol administration on periodontal disease in rats.

eceived either ethanol 2 g/kg or water by gastric gavage twice a day. On the fifth day ligatures were tied around the molars of half of the rats to induce periodontitis. After 7 days gingival tissue was removed and assayed for inflammatory markers. Finally, hemi-mandibles were extracted to evaluate bone loss by histomorphometrical techniques.
s
perimental periodontitis increased significantly the mRNA expression (p &lt; 0.001) and activity (p &lt; 0.001) of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the gingival tissue, whilst short time ethanol administration increased iNOS activity (p &lt; 0.05) and produced an additive effect on iNOS mRNA expression augmented by periodontitis (p &lt; 0.01). The short time ethanol administration also potentiated the periodontitis stimulatory effect on the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001, in semi-quantitative and real time PCR, respectively) and on the height of periodontal ligament (p &lt; 0.05). However, the ligature-induced periodontitis, but not ethanol administration, increased the prostaglandin E2 content (p &lt; 0.05) and, diminished the alveolar bone volume (p &lt; 0.05), as compared to sham rats.
sion
esent results suggest that ethanol consumption could represent a risk indicator for periodontal disease since augments the expression of inflammatory markers, in healthy rats, and increases them, at short term, during the illness. However, scale longitudinal investigation and more case–control studies are needed to confirm this statement.

To tackle the QoS based routing and wavelength allocation problem (QRWA), a multi-objective genetic algorithm which is based on the ideas of SPEA-II is applied to solve it. The chromosome coding scheme, crossover and mutation operators are redefined, and a repair method is proposed to guarantee the generated offspring are valid. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a set of different scale test problems and compared with the recently proposed related GA based multi-objective optimization algorithms. The experimental results reveal very encouraging results in terms of the solution quality and diversity.

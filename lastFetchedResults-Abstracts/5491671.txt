Measuring the attitude of an aircraft model in wind tunnel accurately is one way to improve the accuracy of wind tunnel experiment results. This paper investigates a stereo vision-based attitude measurement system for aircraft model in wind tunnel. To measure the attitude of an aircraft model, a cooperative object mounted on the aircraft model is firstly used to generate two bidirectional collimated laser beams, and then the laser beams are projected onto the surfaces of two screens. A pair of binocular stereo vision measurement systems is used to measure the 3D coordinates of the laser spots on the wall surfaces. Once the 3D coordinates of the laser spots are measured accurately, the attitude of the aircraft model in wind tunnel can be determined. The method for attitude measurement is validated in a controlled laboratory environment, and some preliminary experimental results are presented in the paper.

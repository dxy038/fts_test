The objective of this paper is to present the experimental results of a two-branch polarisation diversity system utilised in a pager. Measurements have been conducted within the University of Liverpool precinct at a frequency of 450 MHz. The evaluation of the antenna correlation, the mean effective gain (MEG), the cross polarisation ratio (XPR), and the diversity gain has been performed for two different positions of the pager on the body. It has been shown that the pager antennas received signal characteristics are dependent on the body placement. This influence has been presented in terms of the variation in the XPR and subsequently the diversity gain for the two positions.

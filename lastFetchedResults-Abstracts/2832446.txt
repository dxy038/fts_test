This paper proposes a regression model of propagation loss in obliquely crossed road which can apply to not only the inter-vehicles communications but also road to vehicle and pedestrian to vehicle communications. For 760 MHz band specified in the ITS Standard in Japan, a regression formula is developed from predicted distance characteristics of propagation loss based on geometric optics theory. In the regression analysis, the propagation loss is set as objective variable and propagation distance, distances from building wall in road side to locations of both transmitter and receiver, road width, heights of transmission and receiving antennas, and the angle of intersection in the street are set as explanatory variables.

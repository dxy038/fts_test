The object under consideration is a spacecraft with the attached pantograph design transformed in orbit, which is used for placement solar batteries. The objective of the research is to study the deployment of such a system in view of flexibility of the pantograph design elements. The mathematical model is developed on the basis of Lagrangian formalism. The software is created for numerical simulation of dynamic processes in the system. It, if necessary, may be adapted for research of systems with deployed constructions of other types. Numerical simulation of behavior of this object is carried out in modes of deployment, and also retrieval and repeated deployment under action of various perturbing factors. Plots are given illustrating behavior of characteristic variables.

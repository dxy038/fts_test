The simulated chassis dynamometer is a kind of test equipment which is used to test vehicle performances. The main objective of the system is to accurately simulate actual operating conditions of the vehicle. Based on previous experiences, an improved controlling mechanism has been developed in which a fuzzy-PID controller and the associated mathematical models are introduced. The results of simulation study and theoretical analysis on the model show that the measurement accuracy has been greatly improved because of the Fuzzy-PID controller. In addition, test data and analytic results on this dynamometer are also presented.

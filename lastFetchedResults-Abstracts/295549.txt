The present study was performed in order to evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of serial cholesterol and triglycerides measurements in patients with severe burns. One of the main objective was to find out if these parameters are clinically relevant to determine the morbidity of a burn patient and thereby the patient’s outcome. In 220 patients with thermal injuries, cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured daily. Blood samples were drawn immediately upon admission and thereafter daily until patient’s discharge or death. For both parameters, a characteristic course was noted: in the group of non-survivors, a decrease of cholesterol prior to death was noted, while survivors, increased prior to discharge. The time courses of both groups (survivors–non-survivors) differed statistically significantly (P=0.0068). An increase in triglycerides was observed in all non-survivors prior to death, but in the group of survivors triglycerides remained more or less unchanged. These time courses also had statistically significant differences (P=0.0004). In our 220 patients, changes in cholesterol (P<0.0001, hazard ratio 1.02) and triglycerides (P=0.0008, hazard ratio 1.01) had comparable capability to predict the severity of a burn trauma and thereby its outcome than the established parameters in the treatment of burns (total body surface area burned, age, inhalation). We consider the serial measurements of cholesterol and triglycerides as clinically relevant to assess the morbidity of a patient and thereby to estimate the patient’s outcome. We think that these serial measurements provide useful information for the clinician treating patients with severe burns.

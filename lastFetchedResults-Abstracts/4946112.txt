Dynamic topologies and constrained recourses are two main characters of satellite networks. These characters require a specialized and efficient routing algorithm. In this paper, a QoS routing algorithm based on PEC multi objective optimization method is proposed to find paths that satisfy all user QoS requirements efficiently. A new routing scheme is also developed to reduce the computing load in satellites. Simulation results show that our routing scheme and algorithm can achieve optimized routing and perform well in multi-layered satellite IP networks.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential use of less stiff materials based on acrylic copolymers of methyl methacrylate/2-ethylhexyl acrylate (MMA/EHA) as devices to correct, stabilize and improve the effect of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) intracorneal ring segments. MMA/EHA and PMMA intracorneal ring segments were surgically implanted in the corneas of Lohmann Classic hens. The effects of the intracorneal ring segments were assessed by optical measurements and corneal tolerance was evaluated through biomicroscopic examination over a 90-day observation period and by conventional histology. The experimental results demonstrated that the intracorneal ring segments made of MMA/EHA copolymers provided a significant change in the corneal curvature and an improved in vivo response compared to those obtained for PMMA rings, which was attributed to the higher flexibility of the copolymeric materials, indicating that these systems might be considered suitable as an alternative to those currently used, for application in clinical practice.

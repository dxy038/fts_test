In this paper we compare some of the objective quality measures with subjective, in several HDTV formats, to be able to grade quality of objective measures. Also, comparison of objective and subjective measures between progressive and interlaced video signal will be presented to check which scanning emission format is better, even if it has different resolution format. Several objective quality measures will be tested, to examine correlation with subjective tests.

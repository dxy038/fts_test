In this paper, the novel hybrid enhanced particle swarm optimization and differential evolution (EPSO/DE) optimization technique [1-2] is used in designing different configurations of concentric circular arrays (CCAA) and concentric hexagonal arrays (CHAA). Many advantages were achieved by the rearrangement of the circular arrays (CA) and hexagonal arrays (HA) elements into CCAA and CHAA multi-ring geometries. Different configurations with two-rings, three-rings and four-rings are designed with the same number of elements and the same main beamwidth of the initial circular and helical geometries. The objective of this paper is to design optimum multi-ring antenna arrays that achieve minimum sidelobe level (SLL), high directivity and reduced mutual coupling in compare to traditional circular and helical arrays. Hybrid EPSO/DE algorithm is applied to optimize the complex weights (amplitude and phase) of the elements current. The objective is to minimize the SLL of the concentric configuration arrays while achieving the highest possible directivity and minimum mutual coupling.

Positron Emission based mammography systems are expected to constitute a significant breakthrough in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. This may lead to a significant enlargement in the horizon of women life, since breast cancer is considered to be among the most deadly types. With this purpose, a consortium has been built to develop a mammography PET system in the framework of the Clear-PEM Collaboration. The Clear-PEM scanner is a unique Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) scanner using APD-based detectors. It is capable of measuring Depth-of-Interaction (DoI) with a resolution of 2 mm in LYSO:Ce crystals, enabling a spatial resolution of 1.2 mm. An important part of the PEM scanner is a high-speed DAE (Data Acquisition Electronics) system. DAE has been developed to process and acquire data coming from the 12,288 front-end (FE) photo-detector channels. In this paper, an overview of this scanner (system and board-level electronics, mechanical design, service and image reconstruction software) is presented, focusing on the specification and implementation of the DAE which is responsible for real-time retrieving, analyzing, filtering and formatting the data coming from the front-end. The objective is to identify relevant data and after conditioning, according to pre-defined protocols, send the data to an acquisition PC for image reconstruction. Communication between DAE and PC is carried out using the S-Link (proprietary of CERN) protocol. Experimental results of validation and test of the DAE system are presented.

Spare optimization models for systems with components connected in series and parallel are presented. The component availability at any time is obtained through Poisson process theory and the availability of the series-parallel system is written by system reliability analysis method. The objective of the optimization problem is to maximize the availability of the system satisfying the constraint on cost. Genetic algorithms are used to find the optimal amount of spares for each component. Finally, two illustrative examples are given.

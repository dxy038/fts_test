Objective: This research intends to unravel the temporal expression profiles of genes involved
in three developmentally important signaling pathways [transforming growth factor-B
(TGF-B), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and wingless/int (WNT)] during pre- and peri-implantation
goat embryo development.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we examined the transcripts that
encoded the ligand, receptor, intracellular signal transducer and modifier, and the downstream
effector, for each signaling pathway. In vitro mature MII oocytes and embryos at
three distinctive stages [8-16 cell stage, day-7 (D7) blastocysts and day-14 (D14) blastocysts]
were separately prepared in triplicate for comparative real-time reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the selected gene sets.
Results: Most components of the three signaling pathways were present at more or less
stable levels throughout the assessed oocyte and embryo developmental stages. The
transcripts for TGF-B, FGF and WNT signaling pathways were all induced in unfertilized
MII-oocytes. However, developing embryos showed gradual patterns of decrease in the
activities of TGF-B, FGF and WNT components with renewal thereafter.
Conclusion: The results suggested that TGF-B, FGF and WNT are maternally active
signaling pathways required during earlier, rather than later, stages of pre- and periimplantation
goat embryo development.

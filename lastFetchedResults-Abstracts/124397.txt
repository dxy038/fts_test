BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Aluminium has been known to cause toxic effects on organ systems. Although the knowledge on aluminium (AL) toxicity has markedly improved in recent years, information concerning the reproductive toxicity of this element is still very limited. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of graded dose of aluminium chloride administered to pregnant mice on their placenta and uterine in a short time.
METHODS: This study was performed on plug-positive female NMRI (National Medical Research Institute) mice that were randomly divided into six groups (12 mice in each group). Three groups of plug- positive female NMRI mice were given IP injections of ALCL3 at 150 mg/kg on days 10, 11 and 12 of gestation, respectively. Three other groups were given normal saline on the same days as control groups. Mice were killed on day 15 of gestation, the weight and diameter of placenta were recorded. Both placenta and uterus were examined with stereomicroscope and also uterus fixed and stained for microscopic examination.
FINDINGS: In all experimental groups, in 14.3%, 13.8% and 13.3% of fetuses, placenta showed abnormal appearance and some degrees of atrophy on days 10, 11, 12 of gestation, respectively that in comparison to control group it was significantly higher (p<0.05). Also, the diameter of placenta in experimental groups (7.2, 7.2 and 7.3mm respectively) was significantly smaller than control groups (7.6rnm)(p<0.05). The uterine of AL treated groups showed hemorrhagic area in external examination and infiltration reaction and dispersed nectrotic foci in myometer in microscopic
examination.
CONCLUSION: According to the results, ALCL3 showed toxic effect on placenta and uterus of pregnant mice. It could explain at least part of teratogenic effects of ALCL3.

Matrix converters are said to be integrable in smaller installation areas rather than DC-link converters due to the absent DC-link capacitor. In return the matrix converter may require input filters larger in size compared to the DC-link converter to suppress the power grid perturbations with the objective of keeping the perturbations below the normative regulated limits. Henceforth, a fair handed comparison has to be performed for the input filtersÂ´ installation spaces of both converters investigated on a common basis of comparison. As the the power grid perturbations of both systems have already been presented in a prior work as well as a generic filter calculation method, which fits both systems, in this paper the absolute values of the input filters are introduced for the full normative frequency range. Dilating the prior presented results, a method for varying the PWM frequency in a very calculation time saving way is presented for so-called pseudo-spectra, containing the maximum values of the amplitudes occuring under permutation of the spectra influencing parameters.

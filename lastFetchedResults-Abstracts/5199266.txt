The rapid layout synthesis of a lateral accelerometer from high-level functional specifications and design constraints is demonstrated. Functional parameters such as sensitivity, minimum and maximum detectable acceleration are satisfied while simultaneously optimizing a design objective, such as device area. The optimal synthesis tool allows exploration of micromechanical device and system design issues and objectives. Layout synthesis couples optimization-based design to determine the values of layout geometry followed with layout generation to translate the desired device performance into a device layout. This rapid layout generation allows for an ´on-the-fly´ cell library generation methodology for use in design of integrated microsystems. In particular, the optimization-based approach to design allows the designer to determine the crucial design tradeoffs in meeting the system-level performances, as shown by synthesis results presented.

A novel robust model predictive control strategy is presented for a class of discrete-time time-varying system with delays. The modified quadratic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals for uncertain discrete-time system with both states and input delays is proposed. A robust model predictive control law is derived such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and a dasiaworst-casepsila infinite horizon performance objective is minimized. A feasible state feedback model predictive control law is obtained by using linear matrix inequalities approach. And then, a convex optimization problem is formulated to design the robust model predictive controller which minimizes the upper bound of the closed-loop performance objective. The robust model predictive controller design is illustrated with numerical examples.

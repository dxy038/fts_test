High traffic always leads to descending quality of communication, higher lost call rate and increased complaints with the expansion of regional customer scale. Therefore, it is necessary to improve communication quality by enlarging the capacity of base station with the consideration of utilization efficiency of network resources. The difficulty of decision on PHS network capacity enlargement increases for the stochastic characteristic of traffic. The traffic and the base station capacity in a region are simulated by modeling and simulation experiment in this paper. Considering the economy in network resources, a reasonable enlargement plan is given after the effect comparison of different ones. The conclusion shows that multi-objective optimization plan, which also takes the stochastic characteristic of traffic into account, can be obtained by Monte Carlo simulation in the decision on PHS network capacity enlargement.

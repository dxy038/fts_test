MOEA/D is a generic multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithm. MOEA/D needs a approach to decompose a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of single objective optimization problems. The commonly-used weighted sum approach and the Tchebycheff approach may not be able to handle disparately scaled objectives. This paper suggests a new decomposition approach, called NBI-style Tchebycheff approach, for MOEA/D to deal with such objectives. A portfolio management MOP has been used as an example to test the effectiveness of MOEA/D with NBI-style Tchebycheff approach.

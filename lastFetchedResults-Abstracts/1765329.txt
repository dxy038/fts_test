The objective of the present study was to synthesize and characterize chitosans with different degrees of deacetylation (DDA%), prepare chitosan microspheres with controlled chemistry and geometry, and fabricate three-dimensional (3-D) chitosan matrices based on microspheres with appropriate pore size, porosity and mechanical properties suitable for bone tissue engineering applications. Chitosans with three DDA% of 69%, 79% and 97% were obtained using a thermomechanochemical technique by varying the applied pressure and NaOH solution concentration. The prepared chitosans were comprehensively characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, elemental analysis, viscosity measurements, thermal analyses and X-ray diffraction. In addition, chitosan microspheres were prepared using an ionotropic gelation method. Three-dimensional chitosan matrices were fabricated via a sintered microsphere technique. Scanning electron microscopy revealed rough surfaces of the prepared chitosan microspheres. Mercury intrusion porosimetry revealed a porosity of 19.2% and a median pore diameter of 199.62 μm of the fabricated 3-D matrix. The compressive modulus of the sintered microsphere matrix (662.26 ± 54.53 MPa) was in the range of human cancellous bone (10–2000 MPa), making it suitable for bone tissue engineering applications.

Adopting digital techniques in the local network area will enhance the possibility of extending digital operation capability to the subscriberÂ´s equipment. The problem is to convey digital signals at a bit rate of at least 64 kbits/s in both directions over existing two-wire subscriber loops. This paper describes a time-shared two-wire digital subscriber transmission system in which the directional separation of two signals (GO and RETURN) is accomplished by the time division bidirectional transmission method in burst-mode, and also reports results of investigations on the feasibility of an all digital telephone subscriber loop system.

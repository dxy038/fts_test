The virtual laboratory of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Calgary comprises all laboratory components of the department, with two locations already developed for long distance education: a remotely controlled instrumentation laboratory, SelfLab@Home, and a digital design experiments collection where the operation of the basic digital circuits is simulated with HTML applets. The students are invited to take a virtual visit of the laboratory rooms in which they perform course required experiments in order to easier locate the devices to be used as well as operate them appropriately. The main objective of SelfLab@Home was to become a self-paced remotely accessed training site for the use of four basic laboratory devices: oscilloscope, waveform generator, DMM and a power supply. The digital devices experiments demonstrate the logic operation of digital circuits and a remotely controlled traffic light with its computer visual interface application.

With recent large-breed organization acceptance, the use of frozen semen is gaining more attention in the equine industry. However, cryopreserved stallion semen is commonly associated with poor quality and decreased pregnancy rates as compared with those produced during normal mating or with cooled semen techniques. Therefore our objective was to investigate a new unique freezing technique (UFT) with the intent of improving fertility outcomes. A series of experiments tested the UFT compared with traditional liquid nitrogen methodology in combination with influence of the extenders and stallions used. In Experiment 1, post-thaw motility results of UFT variations were compared with those from liquid nitrogen methods. The averaged post-thaw motility percentages of the 4 UFT treatments were similar when compared with the traditional liquid nitrogen control group (P = .845). In Experiment 2, 2 egg-yolkâ€“based freezing extenders, Biladyl AB intended for bovine samples and Freezing Medium Test Yolk Buffer used for human samples, were compared. A significant difference in the average post-thaw motilities was found between Biladyl AB (17%) and Freezing Medium Test Yolk Buffer (25%) (P < .002). In the third experiment, we compared variability among stallions using the UFT with the intention of creating a more consistent outcome. Post-thaw motilities and percent of original motility returns among the 4 stallions were significantly different (P < .001). In a field trial using shipped semen from a regional stallion station, the UFT demonstrated very promising results.

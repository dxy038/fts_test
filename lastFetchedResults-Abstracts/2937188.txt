The objective of this paper is to explore the application of wavelets to the field of data compression in the process industry. The wavelet transform is compared with the discrete Fourier and cosine transforms. To examine a complete approach to data compression, quantization techniques are applied to the transformed coefficients. Different quantiser designs are used for the compression of data from an industrial distillation column. Comparisons are made with the Box-Car and backward-slope methods currently used in the process industries

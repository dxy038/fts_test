Two months of spaceborne POLDER polarization measurements have been used to generate empirical surface bidirectional polarization distribution functions (BPDFs). Eleven surface classes have been defined based on a surface classification and a vegetation index. Within each class, the surface polarized reflectance was found rather homogeneous. The surface polarized reflectance is highly anisotropic and varies between 0 close to the backscattering direction, and a few percent in the forward scattering direction. For a given observation geometry, the polarization is about twice as large over the pixels classified as &#8220;desert&#8221; than over vegetated surfaces. An empirical function with two parameters fits the estimated surface polarized reflectance with a residue on the order of 10<sup>-3</sup> in reflectance units. An analysis of top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) polarized reflectance over specific sunphotometer sites where the atmospheric contribution is well characterized confirms the estimated accuracy of 10<sup>-3</sup>

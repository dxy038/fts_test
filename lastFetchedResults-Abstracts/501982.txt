Objective of the present study was to estimate GCA, SCA and gene action in some chickpea genotypes in drought stress condition by diallel cross analysis (6x6). The experiment materials were 15 crosses along with 6 parents in RCBD design with three replications. The experiment was conducted at Sararood Research Station (Kermanshah) during 2007-2008. Genetic analysis was accomplished with second Griffing and Hayman method. Significance of mean square of the genotypes indicated sufficient genetic diversity among the genotypes. The mean square of general and specific combining ability and Baker quotient showed that traits of days to ripening , plant height and 100 seed weight, due to high Baker quotient were under the control of additive genes, whereas low Baker quotient for the traits of days to flowering, number of primary and secondary branches, number of pods in plant, number of seeds in pod, seed yield and plant width indicated that these traits were mostly under the control of non additive genes. The mean amount of Baker quotient for traits of lost water in leaf (LWL) and biomass showed the importance of both additive effects and non additive in controlling these traits. The highest level of specific heritability was found for 100 seed weight and the lowest for number of seeds in pod. The estimation of mean of dominance degree and regression Wr on Vr showed that the traits of primary and secondary branches in plant, number of pods in plant, number of seeds in pod, seed yield and plant width were under the control of genes with over dominance effect, whereas days to ripening, LWL, plant height, biomass, and 100 seed weight were under the control of genes with partial dominance. The parent ICCV96079 and the genotype SEL9324469xICCV96079 had the highest effects of negative GCA and SCA and were significant for the trait of early ripening respectively.

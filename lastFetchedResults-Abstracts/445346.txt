Objective:

To demonstrate chest roentgenograms after central venous line changes over a guidewire delay the use of the central lines and increases charges with no change of morbidity or the rate of complication.

Methods: Retrospective study using the Surgical Intensive Care database followed by a nonrandomized, prospective study of central venous line changes. The total time from the catheter change until chest radiograph confirmation and an analysis of charges was done.

Results: The retrospective study of 1,201 central line changes demonstrated no pneumothorax and two central lines malpositioned. The prospective study of 100 patients demonstrated no pneumothorax and one catheter malpositioned. The average time from completion of the central line change until the radiographic confirmation was 60.2 minutes. The charge for the chest x-ray film was $156.

Conclusions: The combined studies composed of 1,301 patients demonstrated no pneumothorax and three malpositioned catheters. This study demonstrates that radiographic confirmation of central venous line placement after routine line change is of no benefit as the malpositioned catheters caused no morbidity, produces significant delays and increases medical charges to the patient. Extrapolation predicts an annual reduction of $46,800 in the Vanderbilt Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

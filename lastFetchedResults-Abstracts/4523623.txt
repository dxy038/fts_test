In the process of multiple-object optimum design of the round angle on the filleted corner of the universal mill´s frame, the proximity degree between the optimal solution with different weight number and the perfect solution was calculated based on the membership function of the fuzzy mathematics firstly, and a logical weight number group can be determined, then the rigidity object and weight object of frame were combined into a unified objective function. Setting the unified objective function as a single objective function, the radius of filleted corner of universal mill´s frame was optimized by the ANSYS software and an optimum round angle on the filleted corner of frame was obtained. The fuzzy mathematical method was applied in the multiple-object optimization successfully and a theory foundation was provided to determine the weight number of multiple-object optimization. This method and its result are important to the structure optimization of universal mill´s frame.

Currently there are little objective parameters that can quantify the success of one form of prostate surgical removal over another. Parameters such as the percent of coverage and depth of extra-capsular soft tissue removed with the prostate by the various surgical approaches can aid in quantifying prostate surgery success. Previously, we presented visualization methods as well as measurement algorithms to determine extra- capsular tissue coverage. In this paper, we present a modification to the coverage algorithm where we changed the way of mapping the reconstructed model as well as applying different neighborhood check approaches.

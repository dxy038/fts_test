Reliable stabilization of multicontroller systems composed of one plant and two controllers are considered. The main objective is to propose a reliability design when controllers use independent inputs and outputs of the plant. The assumption of independence is crucial if one wants to increase the chance that at least one of the controllers survives the sensor and actuator failures, which otherwise could disable both controllers and result in a system breakdown

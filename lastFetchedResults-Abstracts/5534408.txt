The major objective of an admission control in wireless mesh networks is to prevent excessive real-time traffic from over-utilizing the bandwidth resources. A key component of an admission control is an accurate estimator of the bandwidth available at each node and of the actual bandwidth (including the MAC overhead) required by a new flow. This estimation problem is particularly difficult when node localization information is not available. We propose a novel admission control based on active neighbor bandwidth reservation (AC-ANBR), by which active neighbors periodically broadcast bandwidth reservation information and flow setup requests carry their bandwidth reservation states. Our proposed AC-ANBR accurately estimates the available bandwidth at each node, as well as the bandwidth required by each new flow. The effectiveness of AC-ANBR in multi-hop wireless networks is demonstrated by NS-2 simulations.

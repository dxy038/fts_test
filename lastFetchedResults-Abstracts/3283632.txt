The regional distribution of Renewable Energy Sources effects power plant scheduling and power system planning significantly. This applies for all countries with high targets for distributed power generation. In this paper, various cases of the regional distribution of future Renewable Energy Sources and the electrical load are analyzed and compared with one another using the example of Germany. Therefore, various regionalization factors are defined and calculated which describe the percentage of the total installed capacity that is installed in all regions within Germany. The comparison of the regionalization factors is evaluated with the objective of identifying a set of future scenarios for network development planning that include all or most of the conceivable and plausible development cases.

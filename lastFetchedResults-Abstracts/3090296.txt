This paper attempts to develop a model for fuzzy multi- criteria decision making under the supervision of subjective preference information. A supervised algorithm, which amalgamates the subjective and objective weights into optimization, and can simultaneously determine the index weights and relative membership degrees, is developed under the supervision of decision makersÂ´ experience and preference. A case study is followed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm.

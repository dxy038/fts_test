Background and objective: In medical education environments using technology is so important. This study investigates the effective factors on the using information and communication technology among the medical science students.
Materials and methods: This descriptive correlational study is done at College of Management of Shiraz Medical Science University. In order to evaluate the effective factors using technology, we used five questionnaires: understanding to use technology, understanding of profitability of using technology, pleasure and enjoyment, and being able to apply the system. For data analysis, descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient, path analysis and goodness of  fit indices were used. 
Results: All the effective variables in the form of the conceptual model of the research have were evaluated and finally the conceptual model with goodness of fit indices were confirmed.
Conclusion: Many variables affect using  the technology by medical science students. Some of them have been evaluated in this study. Path analysis results indicate that perceived ease and pleasure of seeking the most effective way to use the technology is significant.

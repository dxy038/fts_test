Quantization of SAR raw data represents an aspect of primary importance, since the number of bits used for radar signal digitization on the one hand controls the on-board memory consumption and the data volume to be transmitted on the ground, and on the other hand affects directly the performance of the SAR images. The TanDEM-X mission started in 2010 and comprises the two twin satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X. Its primary objective is the generation of a worldwide and consistent digital elevation model (DEM) with an unprecedented accuracy. The two satellites fly in close orbit configuration and act as a large single-pass radar interferometer with the adaptability for flexible baseline selection [1]. In this paper, the impact of quantization on bistatic TanDEM-X data is evaluated. First, the effect on the Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ) is investigated. Then, the dependence of interferometric coherence on raw data quantization is assessed, and the impact on relative height accuracy is estimated from TanDEM-X repeated acquisitions. A dedicated analysis aimed at evaluating interferometric performance in presence of inhomogeneities in the backscatter response (the so-called low scatterer suppression) is performed. Based on the presented results, the resource allocation strategy for the second global coverage of TanDEM-X has been consequently adapted to further improve the final DEM performance.

Test prioritization techniques can be used to determine test case ordering and early discover faults in source code. Several of these techniques exploit a single objective function, e.g., code or requirements coverage. In this tool demo paper, we present MOTCP, a software tool that implements a multi-objective test prioritization technique based on the information related to the code and requirements coverage, as well as the execution cost of each test case. To establish usersÂ´ and system requirements coverage, the MOTCP uses Latent Semantic Indexing to recover traceability links among application source code and requirements specifications. The test case ordering is then obtained by applying a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm.

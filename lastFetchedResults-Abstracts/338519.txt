Notch receptors are involved in a variety of cell-fate decisions that affect the development and function of many organs, including hematopoiesis and the immune system. There are four mammalian Notch receptors that have only partially overlapping functions despite sharing similar structures and ligands. The ligands for Notch are transmembrane proteins expressed on adjacent cells, including Jagged and Delta, and it is quite possible that signaling is bidirectional. A large Notch precursor protein is proteolytically cleaved to form the mature cell-surface receptor. Ligand binding induces additional proteolytic events followed by translocation of the intracellular domain to the nucleus. There, Notch interacts with transcription factors such as RBPJÎº, activating transcription of basic helix-loop-helix genes such as HES1. These in turn regulate expression of tissue-specific transcription factors that influence lineage commitment and other events. In this review, the details of Notch signaling will be discussed, with a focus on what is known about the role of Notch in hematopoiesis.

Introduction: The genus Brucella consists of six species, four of which are associated with human Brucellosis, B. Abortus, B. Melitensis, B. Suis and B. Canis.
Brucella are small, no motile, none capsulated gram negative and coccobacilli. It is an intracellular parasite of the Reticuloendotnlial system. Brucella infection has a worldwide distribution. Objective: In this research, serologic test data results from 500 patients were evaluated. Materials and Methods: Method of tests consisted slide and tube agglutination test, Rose Bengal, 2ME and Immunofluorescent test, that were compared.
Results: Relative frequency of Antibody titers was consisted:
Rose Bengal 24.4%, Rapid Wright 21.2%, Coomb'sw 23.8% and IFA 21.4%.
GMRT (Geometric mean of reciprocal titers) of Anti -. Brucella Antibody titers was consisted: Tube Wright: 284.5, c.w; 294.39, IFA: 326.3.
Relative frequency of Anti- Brucella Antibody titers by sex and age groups was explained that percent of disease in made (38.3%) was more than female (15.6%) and relative frequency of Anti - Brucella Antibody by seasons of the year was not significant.
The specificity of the IFA was higher than of tube test.
The sensibility of the 1FA was higher than 2ME test.
Conclusion: As a general rule, IFA test has less false positive and negative results.

Assessing the environmental performance of hydrogen infrastructures is essential for determining their practical viability. Previous optimization approaches for hydrogen networks have focused on optimizing a single environmental metric in conjunction with the economic performance. This approach is inadequate as it may leave relevant environmental criteria out of the analysis. We propose herein a novel framework for optimizing hydrogen supply chains (SC) according to several environmental indicators. Our method comprises two steps. In step one, we formulate a multi-objective mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that accounts for the simultaneous minimization of the most relevant life cycle assessment (LCA) impacts. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is next employed in the post-optimal analysis of the MILP in order to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of its solution space. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach through its application to the design of the future (potential) hydrogen SC in Spain.

Bidirectional DC-DC converters allow transfer of power between two dc sources, in either direction. Due to their ability to reverse the direction of flow of power, they are being increasingly used in many applications such as battery charger/dischargers, dc uninterruptible power supplies, electrical vehicle motor drives, aerospace power systems, telecom power supplies, etc. This paper proposes a new bidirectional Sepic/Zeta converter. It has low switching loss and low conduction loss due to auxiliary communicated circuit and synchronous rectifier operation, respectively. Because of positive and buck/boost-like DC voltage transfer function (M=D/1-D), the proposed converter is desirable for use in distributed power system. The proposed converter also has both transformer-less version and transformer one. The paper also suggest some design guide line for the proposed converter.

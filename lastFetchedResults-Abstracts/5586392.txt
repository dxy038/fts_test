The issues surrounding digital splicing of advertising into digital streams (DID) are many. While we in the industry must always strive to find the ideal solutions to these issues, the practical reality often dictates compromises or operational constraints which make implementation simpler, more cost effective or enable earlier implementation. Toward that end, a larger issue becomes how to integrate an effective DID solution as an element of a total digital delivery system. It is our view, therefore, that any DID implementation must be achieved through the development of sophisticated techniques that easily, transparently and gracefully integrate those competencies with existing DIA and DID operations as well as ensuring compatibility with new generations of systems as they come on-line. It is our premise that in order to achieve this objective, the migration path to DID must integrate standards-based, off-the-shelf components with software solutions and enhancements that deliver next-generation functionality while maintaining compatibility with existing technologies

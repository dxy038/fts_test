The objective of this research was to devise a method of accurately and consistently extracting the dicrotic notch from the aortic blood pressure signal for various heart rates and arrhythmias. The aortic blood pressure signal has been analyzed by calculating the wavelet transform at several scales to consistently detect the temporal location of the dicrotic notch. The simultaneous locations of the peaks in the wavelet transforms of the first derivative of the aortic pressure waveform across 2 consecutive scales corresponds to the location of the dicrotic notch. A final algorithm analyzes the transform results and labels the notch point. Locating the dicrotic notch is critical for analyzing systolic time interval

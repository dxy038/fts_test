The robust design of flank milling parameters is dealing with the optimization of the cutting loads, milled surface roughness and the material removal rate (MRR) in the machining of an Al-alloy casting plate for injection moulds. The considered flank milling parameters include the coolant employment, number of end mill flutes, cutting speed, feed per tooth, axial depth of cut, and radial depth of cut. Grey-Taguchi method is combining the orthogonal array (OA) design of experiments (DOE) with grey-relational analysis (GRA), which enables the determination of the optimal combination of flank milling parameters for multiple process responses. The basic idea of GRA is to find a grey-relational grade (GRG), which can be used for the optimization conversion from a multi-objective case to a single-objective case. GRG is also used to estimate the parameter effects on the overall performance response.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Microleakage is one of the major problems of composite restorations. Most of clinical failure was caused by inadequate marginal seal. The aim of this study was to compare the microleakage of one-step self-etch adhesive with two-step total etch adhesive. 
METHODS: In this in-vitro study, class V cavity was prepared in the buccal side of thirty human molars with occlusal margin in enamel and gingival margin in dentin (2mm width, 5mm length and 2mm depth). All cavities were divided into two groups (n=15): 1. Restorations bonded with total etch adhesive (Adper Single Bond 2); 2. Restorations bonded with self-etch adhesive (S3 Clearfil Bond). After thermocycling and dye penetration with silver nitrate 50% wt, teeth divided in two mesiodistally halves. Amount of dye penetration was measured by stereomicroscope and data were recorded. 
FINDINGS: Adper single bond 2 showed lower microleakage in enamel margin (15 microleakage-free samples versus 14). The difference was not statistically significant. S3 Clearfil Bond showed lower microleakage in dentinal margin (12 microleakage-free samples versus 10) but this difference was not statistically significant. There were not statistically differences between enamel and dentinal marginal microleakage in both groups. 
CONCLUSION: Based on results of this study, investigated total etch and self-etch adhesives have similar marginal seal. Self-etch dentin bonding because of fewer working steps and easiness in using, can be a good substitute for total etch adhesive with more complicate usage

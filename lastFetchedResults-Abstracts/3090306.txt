Based on credibility theory, this paper provides the input-oriented credibility data envelopment analysis (CDEA) model, in which we adopt the concept of fuzzy chance constrained programming on objective function and all constraints with fuzzy inputs and fuzzy outputs. In some special cases, such as the fuzzy inputs and fuzzy outputs are independent trapezoidal fuzzy variables, this kind of CDEA model can be changed into the crisp equivalent class. Furthermore, some basic properties about the proposed CDEA model are discussed. At last, we give a numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDEA model.

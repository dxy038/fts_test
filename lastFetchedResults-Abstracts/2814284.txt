In this paper, we have developed an integrated maintenance policy for each sector and a global transported plan between the sectors. The problem consists on a several sites unable to satisfy random demands during a finite horizon, under service level. In order to assure an efficiency economical objective, we have determined the optimal production/maintenance plan and the economically transported plan. It is therefore to consider the aspect distribution under a policy of overall coordination of the producer, with a strategy of switching between several productions sites to ensure service levels of warehouses for each sector. The final aim of the proposed approach is to determine an optimal production, maintenance and transport strategies, which minimizes the total cost under a fixed service level constraint. A numerical example confirms the analytical results.

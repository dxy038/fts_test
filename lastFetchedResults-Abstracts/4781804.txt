Establish the optimal design mathematical model of involute standard cylindrical gear single-stage reducer. The optimum design system is developed by using Visual Basic6.0, Visual FoxPro6.0 and Visual LISP. Based on the optimization example, it is analyzed that the number of teeth, tooth width coefficient and helix angle have influence on the objective function. The number of teeth must be positive integer, and modulus must be discrete positive. These lead to the discontinuity and extremum properties of objective function. It is most possible to get optimal solution by using integer optimization method in field of definitions.

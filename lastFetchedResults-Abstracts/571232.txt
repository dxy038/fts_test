Background and Objective: Curcumin exhibits antidiabetic and antioxidant effect and memory augmenting property. This study was done to evaluate the effect of its chronic administration on the learning and memory of diabetic rats. 

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups, i.e. control, curcumin-treated control (50 mg/kg), diabetic, and curcumin-treated diabetic groups (10 and 50 mg/kg). Curcumin was administered 7 days after streptozotocin injection for 5 weeks. For evaluation of learning and memory, passive avoidance and Y-maze tests were used. Level of malondialdehyde in hippocampus was also measured.

Results: STL significantly decreased in diabetic (p < 0.01) and low-dose curcumin-treated diabetic (p < 0.05) groups and this parameter was significantly higher in diabetic group receiving high-dose curcumin as compared to diabetics (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, alternation percentage was significantly lower in diabetic group relative to control (p < 0.05) and high-dose-treated diabetic group showed a significant increase in comparison with diabetic group (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, high-dose curcumin significantly reduced level of MDA in diabetic group (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Chronic treatment with curcumin at a dose of 50 mg/kg could enhance the capability of consolidation and recall in diabetic animals and could improve short-term spatial memory in diabetic animals.

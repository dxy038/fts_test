The form of semiconductor packaging is shifting from a wire bonded package to a flip chip package, using a buildup PCB as its substrate. Flip chip technology, used in main frame computers for a long time, is now spreading throughout many applications, with the large advantage of low cost achieved by "under-fill reinforced flip chip bonding" and "epoxy-base build-up PCB technology". The applications include telephones, high-tech consumer products, PC processors and ASICs, and there is an expected further movement to server applications. It is now nearing its original objective, the system-on-package.

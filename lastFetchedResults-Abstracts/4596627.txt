Electronic commerce (EC) is characterized by keen competition. Therefore, understanding how to attract consumers to browse and purchase on the web sites becomes increasingly important to electronic retailers. In the EC context, salespeople are replaced by web interface. Therefore, web interface may influence consumers´ product knowledge and purchase intention. The objective of this research is to examine how presentation mode and product type influence consumers´ product knowledge and purchase intention in the EC environment. The results of this research contribute to an expanded understanding of EC web design.

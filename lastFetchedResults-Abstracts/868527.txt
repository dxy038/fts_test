The task of telescopic resolution of diffuse images of point sources can be interpreted as a type of programming problem with nonlinear objective function. As a programming problem, the selection of intensities and positions of a minimal number of virtual sources is NP-complete in the strong sense. However, a novel heuristic dynamical system approach always yields feasible solutions and with modifications can yield optimal solutions. Also, a closely related problem can be solved with linear programming. The two methods can be interpreted as image decompression for a special type of image.

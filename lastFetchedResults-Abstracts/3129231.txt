In this paper, an optimization model with a linear objective function subject to a system of interval-valued fuzzy relational equations is presented. We convert the problem to an equivalent problem involving 0-1 integer programming and present a procedure to find an optimal solution. For solving it more effectively, we propose a method to simplify the work of computing. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of our procedure.

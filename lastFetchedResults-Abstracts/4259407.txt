In this paper, we propose a video noise reduction method in low light environment. The basic idea is to analyze the pixel characteristic of the image. Divide the image into four kinds of regions and filtering these regions with different ways. The main advantage of the technique is that it is able to reduce the noise variance in smooth areas but at the same time retains the sharpness of edges in object boundaries. For the identification for personal information, the clarity of face feature are enhanced. Experimental results show that our method is superior to other previous methods in the objective evaluation and subjective evaluation of human looking. The filter can achieve higher video quality and improve compression ratio. This filter not only can reduce video noise but also keep real-time process.

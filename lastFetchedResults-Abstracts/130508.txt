Background & Aim: Quality of life (QOL) is a state of well-being in which the individual is able to perform everyday activities related to physical, psychological, and social well-being and patient satisfaction with function and/or control of disease and/or treatment of symptoms. This study reviews the literature regarding the development and use of these oral health related QOL. In modern medicine, the traditional way of assessing change in patients has been to focus on laboratory or clinical tests. While these give important information about the chronic and progressive diseases, it is impossible to separate disease from an individual's personal and social context. No illness exists in a vacuum. One way of capturing the personal and social context of patients is to use quality of life measures. These measures give the possibility to express subjective changes in wellbeing to patients. These are accepted as outcome measures in clinical research but are rarely used in routine clinical practice. In dentistry, as in other branches of Medicine, it has been recognized that objective measures of disease provide little insight into the impact of oral disorders on daily living and quality of life. A significant body of development work has been undertaken to provide health status measures for use as outcome measures in dentistry.
Conclusion: It has been shown that socioeconomic status; oral health behavior and oral health status each influence oral quality of life.

Heat sinks are complex designs that balance many variables to achieve optimum performance. This balancing act is especially important in designs for digital applications where shrinking packaging size makes it increasingly difficult to remove the generated heat. For best results, the heat sink should be designed specifically to fit the application. The comparison of alternatives among the various criterions for optimal heat sink selection was carried out using Analytical Hierarchical Processing, which provides a clear rationale for decision making. The methods used are specifically oriented to calculator aided computation. Design parameters have been included in the formulations which enable parametric evaluations and optimization of performance relative to configuration characteristics. Standard optimization procedures involve quantitatively defining what is to be optimized and framing means to improve the efficiency of the heat sink. It also involves specifying the variables that influence the objective function. Reaching this goal involves trading off various heat sink parameters, such as number of fins, fin thickness and base thickness, etc. The impact of each parameter influencing the heat sink geometry and hence the efficiency of heat sink has been studied.

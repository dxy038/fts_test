This paper presents a new control structure to reduce torque ripple
in switched reluctance motor. Although SRM possesses many advantages in
motor structure, it suffers from large torque ripple that causes some problems
such as vibration and acoustic noise. In this paper another control loop is
added and torque ripple is dened as an objective function. By using fuzzy
sliding mode strategy, the DC link voltage is adjusted to optimize the objective
function. Simulation results have demonstrated the proposed control method.

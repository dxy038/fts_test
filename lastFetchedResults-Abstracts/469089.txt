Objective
Insulin resistance is greater and obesity is more common in women with preeclampsia. The Trp64Arg polymorphism in the β3-adrenergic receptor is associated with these metabolic changes. This study investigated whether the Trp64Arg polymorphism is more common in women with preeclampsia.
Study design
β3-Adrenergic receptor genotypes were determined in 177 women with a history of preeclampsia and in 179 normal pregnancies. We also compared prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), length of gestation, baby weight percentile, and glucose values during an oral tolerance test in women with and without the polymorphism.
Results
The genotypes and allele frequency did not differ significantly between women with preeclamptic and normal pregnancies (P = .17). Women with and without the polymorphism had similar prepregnancy BMI, glucose at 1-hour screening, gestational age at delivery, and adjusted baby weight.
Conclusion
The Trp64Arg polymorphism of the β3-receptor does not predispose to preeclampsia, and it is it not associated with obesity and carbohydrate intolerance in a population of young pregnant women.

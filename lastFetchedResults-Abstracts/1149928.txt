The major objective of this study is to establish an analytical technique in order to investigate the behavior of semi-solid material considering induction heating of the workpiece. The induction heating process is analyzed using the commercial finite element software, ansys. The finite element program, sfac2d, for the simulation of deformation in the semi-solid state is developed in the present study. The behavior of semi-solid material is described by a viscoplastic model for the solid phase and by Darcyâ€™s law for the liquid flow. Simple compression and closed-die compression processes considering induction heating are analyzed. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical technique, the results of simulation are compared with those of experiment.

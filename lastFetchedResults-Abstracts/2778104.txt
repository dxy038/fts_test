Outage probability and outage ergodic constrained capacity are important performance metrics of broadband satellite communication networks operating above 10 GHz. The objective of this letter is to propose a simple method, using piecewise linear fitting, for the calculation of these figures of merit in rain fading channels. Rain fading affecting the signal amplitude is described by log-lognormal distribution. The results are focused on well-accepted DVB-S2 satellite communication system. Finally, a lower bound for the ergodic constrained capacity of log-lognormal channels is given. The numerical results highlight the accuracy of the proposed method.

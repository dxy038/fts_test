At the basis of studying the generating law and inner link of the Koch curve, making use of a vector to ascertain unified and high-effect mathematic model, it changes the problem into pure algebra easily with the intersection angle and model of the vector. Then, the use of neural networks and mathematical optimization methods to find the maximum or minimum value of the objective function of the discrete or continuous values of model parameters, has got a very effective optimization method in dealing with nonlinear model of the most challenging aspects. So it can be come true mechanically on the computer, this is a mechanization of the fractal problem.

Relay stations (RSs) can enhance signal quality for mobile stations (MSs) close to the cell boundary. To abundantly exploit the advantages of RSs, it is a critical task to investigate the impact of RSs location on link reliability and system capacity in two-hop cellular networks. In this paper, the closed-form of the number of disconnect MSs and the expression of system capacity for varying RSs location are obtained in two-hop cellular networks with decode-and-forward scheme. Finally, the Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to verify the theoretical results and to get the optimal RSs location with different objective functions.

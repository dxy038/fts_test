The objective of this work is the development of predictive controller of heat exchanger and addresses the difficulties in tuning a predictive control, predictive control and state feedback controller is used to regulate the temperature of a heat exchanger. The identification of the heat exchanger is done by using the step identification technique. Although the PI controller is widely used for these types of applications there is still a need for optimization of conservation of energy. In this paper a model based predictive algorithm is used for controlling a temperature of heat exchanger and the associated difficulties in tuning are analyzed. The transients and steady state results obtained using a predictive control it is observed that the results obtained are excellent compare to state feedback controllers.

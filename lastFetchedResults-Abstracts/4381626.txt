This paper presents experimental results concerning the control of a distributed solar collector field, where the main objective concerns the regulation of the outlet oil temperature by suitably manipulating the oil flow rate. This is achieved by means of a constrained nonlinear adaptive model-based predictive control framework where the control action sequence is obtained by solving an open-loop optimization problem, subject to a set of constraints. The plant dynamics is approximated by an affine state-space neural network, whose complexity is specified in terms of the cardinality of dominant singular values associated with a subspace oblique projection of data-driven Hankel matrices. The neural network is first trained offline and subsequently improved through a recursive updating of its weights and biases, based on a dual unscented Kalman filter. The control scheme is implemented on the Acurex field of the Plataforma Solar de Almeri&#769;a, Spain. Results from these experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, and highlight the ability to cope with time-varying and unmodeled dynamics, under the form of disturbances, and its inherent capability for accommodating actuation faults.

This paper evolves a 2.4GHz microstrip antenna for WiFi application by using the differential evolution (DE). The antenna structure is square substrate with a size of 50mm &#215; 50mm&#215;1.6mm. The bottom side of the substrate is printed with a microstrip feed line. The top is metallic painted where a ellipse cut off. The structure is parameterized as a solution vector, and the requirements of the antenna are modeled as objective and constraints. Then a constrained optimization problem (COP) is formulated. The DE algorithm finds an antenna which satisfy the requirements in the simulating. The measured performance of the fabricated antenna matches the simulated one on the whole. This evolved antenna can be applied as a antenna for router and personal computer in indoor use. Notably, an exceptional achievement is the bandwidth of the antenna reaches over 1 GHz.

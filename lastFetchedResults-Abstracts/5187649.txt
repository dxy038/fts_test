Nowadays, with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization, national security situation become more and more serious. Although various security facilities have played a positive role in the field of social security prevention, there are some defects with poorly designed and personnel protection, physical protection, and electronic protection formation non-integration. The effectiveness evaluation of crime prevention system focuses on the experience and management level, and lack of scientific quantitative evaluation of the theoretical methods and technical means. So it is a major strategic task to research on risk assessment techniques and the establishment of objective evaluation of the risk of crime prevention system in the area of the development on national security prevention. In this paper, to begin with, we put forward the concept of risk entropy according to the Shannon information theory, establish the risk entropy model of security node, and research on the expression and calculation of security node risk entropy. On the other hand, we establish the abstract security network simulation model to study the path dependence of the method of the calculation on security network risk entropy based on a broad crime prevention system that is formed in the connection security node with traffic network. Finally, the simulation results show that the change relationship between the risk of crime prevention system and system effectiveness is in line with the objective reality.

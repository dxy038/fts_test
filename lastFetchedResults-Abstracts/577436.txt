Introduction & Objective: Cardiac glycosids are the oldest drugs in congestive heart failure. Digoxin one of this class drugs has widespread use Today. Because the therapeutic index of this drug is small, the change in kintic of drug induce change in serum level of drug and can be dangerous. The aim of this study was evaluation of serum level of digoxin in hospitalized patients.
Materials & Methods: This was a cross-sectional study and the samples were collected from cardiac patients that were hospitalized in cardiology and pulmonology wards in Ekbatan hospital during the study. Serum levels of digoxin were measured by HPLC. Patient?s demographics,clinical situation and serum electrolyte were recorded in a questionnaire.The data was analyzed by t-test, coefficient of correlation and P < 0.05was considered significant.
Results: In this study the digoxin serum level in 76.9% of patients was in therapeutic level , 8.9% had insufficient level , 5.8% had intermediate level , and 8.4% had toxic level of digosin. The patients that had lower body mass index had greater serum level of digoxin.
Conclusion: We can indicate in Ekbatan hospital, patients had a suitable coundition due to digoxin serum level.

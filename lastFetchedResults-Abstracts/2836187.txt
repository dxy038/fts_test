In this research work breakdown voltage, transmittance and heat dissipation of transformer oil have been tested. Three types of samples from transformer oil have been chosen in these studies. These transformers have been manufactured in Bangladesh. The higher the value of breakdown voltage indicates the lower the presence of contaminants. The breakdown voltage of oil from new container was 71 kV which is well above the minimum breakdown voltage, i.e., 30kV - 40 kV. However, the breakdown voltage decreased with aging of transformer oil. The transmittances of these three oil samples were 88.93%, 85.27% and 61.87% respectively at wavelength of 600nm which was measured using UV spectrophotometer. The report also explains the heat dissipation capability of transformer oil. The main objective of our study is to reduce failure of transformer in the environment of Bangladesh.

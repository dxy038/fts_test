The paper proposes a method to use contextual data from the web applications DOM (Document Object Model) to aid test cases generation for functional testing. The objective is to enhance the automation by reducing the time allocated to obtain the input values and the rough steps of the test cases. The DOM architecture for Web applications will be considered the starting point in the development of the method. The discussion remains if the tester inspection is needed in order to choose between the diversity of test cases automatically generated or the tests will be entirely executed without exception. The required system resources will be taken in consideration to repeatedly run all the tests in regression testing. In the case of applying this method to several user interfaces, by saving the extracted properties and the generated test cases and results, statistical data regarding effective templates to use would emerge.

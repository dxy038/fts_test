Evaluation and ranking of candidate restoration schemes is a typical hybrid multiple attribute decision-making problem. An extended VIKOR method is proposed in this paper to consider multiple types of attributes and uncertainties in restoration. Subjective weights obtained by mathematical programming are integrated with objective weights from maximum deviation model to form combined weights. Euclidean distance is utilized to reduce information losses and make the decision-making more reliable. Restoration of Shandong power system is taken as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The resultant ranking demonstrates that considering multiple types of attributes and uncertain information is significant in the assessment and decision-making for restoration.

Due to recent progress in signal processing techniques, the traditional collision channel model is inadequate for communication networks where the transceivers are endowed with the ability to transmit or receive multiple packets simultaneously (the MPT/MPR capability). This paper studies the schedule construction in MPT/MPR systems with the objective to understand how the flows traversing the network can leverage the MPT/MPR capabilities in multi-hop wireless networks. Towards our goal, we present a heuristic algorithm MDSatur to produce a schedule and propose the wireless water-filling (WF) algorithm which extends the traditional water-filling algorithm to multi-hop wireless scenarios to compute max-min allocations when the MPT and MPR capabilities are equal. By combining MDSatur and WF, we also design the LEX scheme to approximate the lexicographically optimal allocation of the system when the network has nonidentical MPT and MPR capabilities.

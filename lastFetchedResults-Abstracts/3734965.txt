The impact of an interline power-flow controller (IPFC) on composite system delivery point and overall system reliability indices is examined in this paper. In this application, the IPFC with dc transmission lines is employed in a system for coordinated control of line impedances of two, distance away, transmission lines with the objective of managing power flows on the two lines. It is also used to balance the real power being transferred between the compensated lines. For this purpose, the reliability model associated with a converter station has been developed and incorporated in an IPFC reliability model. A number of reliability indices are calculated at both the loadpoint and system levels to illustrate the impact of employing IPFC and examine the effects of different failure modes on the system performance. The technique is applied to the IEEE reliability test system and the results are presented. The results indicate that IPFC improves system reliability.

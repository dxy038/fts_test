Recent research at the University of Utah on U.S. Army Research Laboratory Contract No. DAAL01-95-K-3541, provided the design and construction of two backward wave oscillators: (1) a tunable oscillator from 300-600 GHz, and (2) a tunable oscillator from 500 GHz-1 THz. The objective has been to use a specially prepared electron stream over an inter-digital circuit capable of octave bandwidths. With submillimeter-wave backward-wave oscillators, the principle challenge is to maintain close proximity between the electron beam and the circuit.

The objective of the present study is to determine the influence of the loading rate on the critical energy release rate GIc of fibre-reinforced epoxy laminates. In order to perform pure mode I loading at higher opening velocities, a new test device is developed. The approach is based on a symmetrical opening displacement applied to a DCB specimen. In the data reduction, the influence of the kinetic energy has to be taken into account. The results obtained on the unidirectional carbonâ€“epoxy laminate T300/914 at crack opening rates up to 1.6 m/s show a slight effect of the loading rate on GIc.

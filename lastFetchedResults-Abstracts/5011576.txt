Objective: A study on the kinematic characteristics and Rings features of landing from Rings after the backward giant swing tuck of 2-circle back flip and a 360&#176; turn aims to provide Chinese athletes with certain scientific theories and training practice. Methods: To get relevant kinematic data through the analysis of Yan Mingyong´s performance in Rings Finals of 2011 National Gymnastics Championships. Results and Conclusions: The velocity of gravity centre increased as Yan´s handstand started to swing down; The velocity of gravity centre of his body moved up swiftly as his legs threw up forwards while the whole body just passed through the vertical plane; Both hands left from the rings immediately at the point where the rising body resumed from the handstand; The landing angle was a bit larger as a result of a big step forward to make a stable landing; The landing skill needs to be improved.

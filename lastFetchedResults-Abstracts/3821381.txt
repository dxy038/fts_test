When RF power is measured using a bolometer bridge, generally its accuracy depends on the power level to be measured and the sensitivity of the bolometer mount in use. The former is principally due to the accuracy of bridge current measurement and the latter is due to an imperfection of bridge control. These are the dominant errors of the bridge measurement system. The objective of this paper is to design a bolometer bridge which offers an effective reduction of these errors and simplify its automation. As a result, a system introducing a digital control technique is proposed and tested.

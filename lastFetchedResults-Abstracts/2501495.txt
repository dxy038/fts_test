Objective: Nuclear actin is involved in transcription regulation by recruitment of histone
modifiers and chromatin remodelers to the regulatory regions of active genes. In recent
years, further attention has been focused on the role of actin as a nuclear protein in transcriptional
processes. In the current study, the epigenetic role of nuclear actin on transcription
regulation of two stemness (OCT4 and NANOG) and two differentiation) NESTIN
and PAX6) marker genes was evaluated in a human embryonal carcinoma cell line (NT2)
before and after differentiation induction.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, differentiation of embryonal cells was
induced by retinoic acid (RA), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was used to evaluate differential expression of marker genes before and 3 days after RAinduced
differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with real-time PCR
was then undertaken to monitor the incorporation of B-actin, as a functional component of
RNA polymerase II, in the regulatory regions of marker genes.
Results: Data showed significant change in nuclear actin incorporation into the promoter
regions of NESTIN and PAX6 after RA-induction.
Conclusion: We emphasize the dynamic functional role of nuclear actin in differentiation
of embryonal cells and its role as a subunit of RNA polymerase II.

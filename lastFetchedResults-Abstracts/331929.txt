Objective: We have proposed a calcium phosphate precipitation (CPP) method that occludes dentine tubules with apatitic minerals for the treatment of dentine hypersensitivity. The current CPP method uses 1 mol/l NaOH as the post-treatment solution. However, its high pH is not desirable for clinical use. The aim of this study was to evaluate several solutions, especially buffer solutions, as post-treatment solutions for the CPP method.

Methods: The CPP solution was mixed with several post-treatment solutions at various mixing ratios in test tubes. The precipitates were collected, and freeze-dried in a vacuum. Their weights were measured to evaluate the feasibility of buffer solution for the post-treatment solutions. Among the solutions, we selected one buffer solution and have done further evaluation using human dentine disks. The degree of occlusion of dentine tubules was evaluated by scanning electron microscopic observation and measurement of dentine permeability. Also, the composition of the precipitate was analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis and powder X-ray diffraction.

Results: Among the solutions, 1 mol/l NaHCO3 gave sufficient amounts of precipitate at a relatively mild pH, and thus was considered to be a good candidate for a post-treatment solution. Scanning electron microscopic observation showed that dentine tubules were occluded with the precipitate to a depth of approximately 10 μm from the surface when the CPP treatment was done twice, and dentine permeability was reduced to 98.8%. The precipitate was dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD; CaHPO4·2H2O) when the post-treatment solution was free of NaF. In contrast, the precipitate was an apatitic mineral with CaF2 as a by-product when the post-treatment solution contained NaF.

Conclusions: We concluded that 1 mol/l NaHCO3 containing 0.3 mol/l NaF would be suitable as the post-treatment solution for the CPP method as it has a relatively mild pH and occludes dentinal tubules well.

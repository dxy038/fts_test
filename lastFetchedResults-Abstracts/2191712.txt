Objective(s):This study was planned to appraise the protective effect of Nigella sativa fixed oil (NSO) against subchronic ethanol induced toxicity in rats. Materials and Methods: Studies were carried out on six groups of six animals each, including control (normal saline, gavage), ethanol (3 g/kg/day, gavage), NSO (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 ml/Kg/day, IP) plus ethanol and NSO (0.5 ml/Kg/day, IP) groups. Treatments were continued for 4 weeks. Results: According to data, treatment with NSO attenuated ethanol-induced increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as histopathological changes in liver and kidney tissues. Moreover, NSO improved the level of serum liver enzymes (including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and glutathione (GSH) content in liver and kidney tissues in ethanol-treated rats. Western blot analysis and quantitative real time RT-PCR showed that NSO treatment inhibited apoptosis stimulated by ethanol through decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (both protein and mRNA levels), cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8 and cleaved caspase-9 level in liver and kidney. Conclusion: This study showed that NSO may have protective effects against hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity of ethanol by decreasing lipid peroxidation and inflammation and preventing apoptosis.

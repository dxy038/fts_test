It poses high requirements for the calculation speed and the precision of the solving method when we consider the large-scale transmission expansion planning (TEP) problems. Therefore, combined with the respective characteristics of EDA (Distribution of Estimation Algorithm) and DE (Differential Evolution algorithm), this paper puts forward a new hybrid EDA/DE algorithm for large-scale TEP problems. Meanwhile, it improves the updating mechanism of probabilistic model of EDA based on the characteristics of the TEP problems. Considering the investments of grid company, the new energy incentive politics and network security constraints, this paper proposes a multi-objective static planning model for the TEP considering wind power penetration, which takes the comprehensive cost, the wind curtailment and the risk value into consideration. Finally, a specific example is applied in this paper to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.

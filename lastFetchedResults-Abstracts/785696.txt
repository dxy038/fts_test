The objective of this study was determining the heavy metal contents in sediment along the coastlines
of Hormuzgan province. Sediment constitutes are important part of aquatic ecosystems. They provide
habitat for benthic organisms and could be a significant sink as well as a potential source of
contaminants. Three sources of heavy metals pollution in this area are industry, natural mineralogy of
soil and oil. The levels of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni) have been investigated over a 4 season period
at 9 sites. We collected sediment samples from a depth of 0-10 cm. Heavy metals assessed by the
atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results showed Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni concentrations in the
sediment ranging from 3.00 to 28.00 ?g/g, 2.96 to 10.11 ?g/g, 2.60 to 11.27 ?g/g and 8.03 to 105.30
?g/g, respectively. Seasonal study showed that pollution levels in sediments at spring and summer
were more than autumn and winter. The heavy metal concentrations lead to the following ranking: Pb > 
Ni >  Cu >  Cd. Based on Pollution Index (MPI) values, our result indicated that station 9 was polluted
area and station 2 was unpolluted area.

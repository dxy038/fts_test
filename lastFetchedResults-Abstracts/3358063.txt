Objective-Optimize the extraction conditions of total flavonoids from Met sequoia glyptostroboides Leaves. Methods- the optimal extraction parameters and the extraction rate were studied by response surface methodology. Select the ethanol concentration, extraction temperature, ratio of material to liquid and extracting time as factors, and the extraction rate of total flavonoids as the response value, the experimental design of four factors and three levels was applied to Box-Behnken central composite method. Results-The optimal conditions for the extraction rate of total flavonoids were 81% ethanol concentration, extraction temperature at 74 &#176;C, extraction time for 2.2 h, ratio of solid to liquid were 1:41. And the total flavonoids yield was up to 1.871% at optimal conditions. The relative error were 0.44% compared the values of predict by regression model with the experimental values. Conclusion- Optimization of extracting technology condition was reliable, which based on response surface method.

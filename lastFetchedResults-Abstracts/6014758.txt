Due to the heterogeneity and versatility of emerging services and applications in wireless networks, it has been a great challenge to improve the system performance with both the awareness of service characteristics and the balance of the traffic between adjacent networks. This paper is committed to solve this problem by introducing a Service-aware Proactive Vertical Handoff (SPVH) algorithm in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks (HWN). A Bandwidth Requirement Prediction Model (BRPM) is illustrated at first, which is adaptive to the system condition variants to forecast traffic requests. Moreover, by adopting a service-aware objective utility function, each user could optimize the vertical handover decisions with awareness of the related supporting networks and service characteristics. Since the decision process is executed with consideration of BRPM predictions, the SPVH algorithm could avoid congestion in HWN through a proactive method. Experiment results show that the proposed SPVH can solidly enhance the system performance in terms of service access ratio, average access delay, system throughput, usage ratio of spectrum resource, and eventually achieve higher network utility.

For multi-radio multi-channel (MRMC) wireless mesh networks (WMNs), the joint channel assignment and routing problem has been shown to be NP-complete. In this paper, we propose a joint linear programming (LP) and genetic algorithm (LPGA), in which we use an improved genetic algorithm to tackle the CA problem and solve the routing by a mixed integer linear programming model. To successfully decouple the two problems, we evaluate the fitness value of a chromosome (certain CA configuration) in our genetic algorithms (GAs) by computing the linear objective function. Meanwhile, we propose a rate-variable model to increase the network through output, which use the physical interference model that can evaluate the capacity more precisely. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively increases the network through output.

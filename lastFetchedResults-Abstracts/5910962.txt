With the advance of electricity market, all distributed power generators will participate in electric power bidding, start up and shutdown of the unit must be considered in objective function of purchasing electricity. Therefore, this paper establishes the mathematical model of purchasing electricity optimization from distributed generators, which takes total costs from many distributed generators as an objective function, and synthetically considers supply and demand, transmission ability constraints. The mathematical model is a constrained nonlinear mixed integer programming problem. This paper presents an improved hybrid PSO algorithm to solve the problem, which is hybridization of the binary PSO and chaotic optimization. The hybrid PSO algorithm enhances the global search ability of the algorithm, and has been successfully applied to solving the problem. The simulation results show that the hybrid methodology was successfully validated for eight distributed generators, which can reach the expected requirements.

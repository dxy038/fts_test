This paper concerns the problem of distributed controller synthesis for a class of systems which we call &#8220;decomposable systems&#8221;. These systems have a special property that makes it possible to decompose them into a set of modal systems and approach the distributed control problem in an easy and effective way. In a recent paper of ours, we have shown a suboptimal H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller synthesis method based on the use of the multi-objective optimization technique making use of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs); in this article we show that another suboptimal approach is possible, which exploits robust control techniques, namely the full block S-procedure. In the end we also briefly show a method based on small gain H<sub>&#8734;</sub> robust performance synthesis, and the results of the three different methods are compared on a couple of test cases.

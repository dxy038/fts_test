Sometimes the pollution occurs as a sudden event, either intentionally or unintentionally and it may become a water quality crisis. Despite the damage that can occur due to the sudden pollution, little research has been done in this area. Damage caused by the entered pollution in reservoirs can affect the water resource system in two ways: (1) Damages that are caused due to lack of water allocation, and (2) damages that are caused due to consumption of polluted water. Those damages are in contrast with each other. Thus, the crisis should be managed in a way that the least damage occurs in the water resource system. This paper investigates the crisis management due to the sudden entrance of a 30 m3 MTBE load to the Karaj dam. To simulate MTBE advection, dispersion, and vaporization, the latest process is added to the CE-QUAL-W2 model. After that, the multi-objective optimization hybrid algorithm, NSGAII-ALANN, is used to extract the best set of decisions. According to the results, if pollution enters the reservoir in the summer, by using one of the driven policies, by a 36% reduction in demand meeting, allocated pollution decreases by 60% and also maximum concentration decreased by 76%. These results for winter are 38%, 51% and 67%, respectively. Similar results are extracted for other seasons.

The objective of  the present study was to determiner the concentration of heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Sn, Zn, Ni, Fe) in canned tuna fish from three factories of Iran in 2010. Fifty four cans of tuna fish were collected from the factories located in Karaj, Hamedan and Esfahan (in the central Provinces of Iran). Samples were analyzed by dry digestion. Metal concentrations were measured using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometery Perkin Elmer 4100. Data were analyzed statically by SPSS17 and comparison of means was done using T-Test. according to the results, the mean concentrations of Cd, Hg, Ni, Sn, Zn and Fe were 0.195±0.053, 0.036±0.003, 0.086±0.031, 0.037±0.07, 3.78±0.95, 5.71±1.23 mgKg-1 dw respectively. There were no significant differences between the concentration of Cd, Hg, Sn, Ni, Zn and Fe in samples from Karaj with Hamedan and between those from Hamedan and Esfahan (P?0.05). The concentration of Cd, Sn and Ni showed significant differences in samples from Karaj and Esfahan (P < 0.05). Although no differences (P > 0.05) were detected between.The mean estimated concentrations for Cd, Hg, Sn, Ni and Zn in the present study were lower the International Standards for these metals as declare by the World Health Organization (WHO), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

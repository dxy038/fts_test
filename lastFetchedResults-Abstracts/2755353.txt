This paper shows that a combination of: 1) the computation time-saving transfer function and eigenfunction analysis (TFEA) method, 2) eigenvalue sensitivity concept, and 3) optimization techniques makes a powerful tool in coordinated tuning of power system stabilizers (PSS). The combination allows different PSS tuning strategies to be evaluated as objective functions of optimization under constraints. Feasibility of the method is demonstrated by numerical results from a 69-generator system. Two objective functions are used as illustrative examples.

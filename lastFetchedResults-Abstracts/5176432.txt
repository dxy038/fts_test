A multi-objective mathematic model is presented, according to the synthetically analysis of electric power circuitry examination and reparation in Liaoning Province of China. And other conditions are taken into account. An improved ant colony algorithm has been used during optimization process, combining with the coloring problem of graph theory. The core of improved ant colony algorithm is the dynamic adjustment of pheromone on routes, which can make it prevented from partial optimization. Also the improved ant colony algorithm can advance the velocity of itself on the basis of getting the satisfactory solution. The results of simulation manifest that the improved ant colony algorithm is better than the originality.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite the development of science and technology, yet many patients suffer from the complications including nausea and vomiting after anesthesia that can have irreversible effects. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of C-band on controlling nausea and vomiting after general anesthesia in abdominal surgery.
METHODS: This clinical trial study was performed on 174 male patients in the surgery department of Baqiyatallah and Valiasr Naja military hospitals in Tehran. They underwent abdominal surgery and it was their first surgical experience. They were randomly divided into three groups of 58 cases: acupressure (treatment group), control and placebo groups. The severity of nausea and vomiting (based on visual assessment scale) were recorded by the patients in the related form. The frequency of nausea and vomiting was asked from the patients by the experts who had no information about how the groups were divided and it was recorded in a prepared checklist. Also, it was assessed 8, 16 and 24 hours after operation and then the groups were compared.   
FINDINGS: Based on our results, C-band caused a decrease in the frequency of nausea in 6 (10.3%) patients versus 34 (58.6%) and 33 (56.8%) patients (p < 0.001) and the severity of nausea (p < 0.007), and also it caused a decrease in the frequency of vomiting in 2 (3.4%) patients versus 13 (22.4%) and 35 (25.8%) patients (p < 0.008) and the severity of vomiting (p < 0.005) that in compared to control and placebo groups it was more and the difference was significant. 
CONCLUSION: According to the results, it is proposed to use C-band as a non-invasive method to prevent nausea and vomiting after anesthesia.

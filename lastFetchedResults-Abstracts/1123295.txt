Supplier selection and material procurement planning are the most important issues in supply
chain management. This decision is complicated when the buyers face with discount price
schemes. In real situation, each supplier may apply different methods such as different types of
discount schedules and various types of payment in order to increase market share. In this
situation, buyers try to select the best supplier/s by considering all tangible and intangible
factors which may be included in this decision problem. Mohammad Ebrahim and Razmi
(2009) introduced a Meta heuristic model in order to select the best suppliers and determine the
procurement plan under two types of discount offers. In this paper, a fuzzy bi-objective model
is proposed for single item single period supplier selection and purchasing problem under
capacity constraint, supply uncertainty and budget limitation. This model includes different
kinds of discount (all-unit discount, incremental discount). In addition, different methods for
payments which ordinary may be proposed by each supplier are considered in this model.
Finally, an interactive fuzzy programming approach (TH method), ?-constraint method and
reservation level driven Tchebycheff procedure (RLTP) are applied to solve this bi-objective
model. The efficiency of each method is evaluated by using an additive utility function which is
offered by decision maker.

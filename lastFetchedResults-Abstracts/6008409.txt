The objective of this study is to develop the simulation software for numerical control (NC) machining. This paper presents the visualization and analysis of cutting process in slope machining by using advanced octree method. A software based on advanced octree algorithms has been developed and used as the basis in this study. The suggested algorithm with supersampling techniques in computer graphics used for developing the simulation software can improve efficiently the computation and visualization of cutting process, reduce memory waste, computation time and obtain high level of accuracy. The simulation results of cutting process in slope machining verified that the application of advanced octree model can overcome several limitations of decomposition model in term of achieving high level of accuracy in cutting simulation with fast computation time.

The main objective of this research was to determine the role of
knowledge management in organizational performance in security systems
of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The question was that â€œhow knowledge
management affects the improvement of organizational performance?"
And a proper answer to the question could be; "knowledge management
affects organizational performance using processing capabilities, and
infrastructural potentials." A theoretical base for the study was established
using library collection method and descriptive research, and required data
were gathered by distributing questionnaires among managers and experts
working for security organizations in Tehran. The reliability of the
conceptual model was tested using Structural Equation Modeling, based on
the collected data. This study provides a better understanding of
knowledge management for researchers by indicating the effects of
knowledge management on organizational performance, and also by
demonstrating comprehensive aspects of knowledge management
performance. A number of 68 questionnaires were administered. From
among this number a total of 60 questionnaires were returned to the
researchers. The data were analyzed using SPSS and Smart-PLS software.
The results indicated the positive, direct and significant correlation
between knowledge management infrastructure and organizational
performance. Moreover the findings of the study showed an indirect
impact of infrastructure capabilities on organizational performance
through processing capabilities of knowledge management.

Most technology development engineers use traditional reliability engineering methods to calibrate the objective functions of their new systems to meet various marketing requirements. These methods are marginally effective in reducing failure rates. To fundamentally improve quality, the engineers need to focus on improving the robustness of the basic functions of their new product or process technologies and apply parameter design methods to make the basic functions approach the ideal functions under real conditions. These robust design activities should be conducted by research and development departments before actual products are planned. The objective is to improve the downstream reproducibility of new technologies. The technical development of an electronic circuit is used to explain this proposition

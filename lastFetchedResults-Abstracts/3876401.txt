A blocky artefact reduction algorithm using the constrained least squares (CLS) approach is described. The authors use a new objective function which effectively constrains the relationship between not only the block boundary pixels but also the inner pixels. By gracefully reducing the visible discontinuities along the block boundaries, the proposed algorithm shows excellent noise reduction performance

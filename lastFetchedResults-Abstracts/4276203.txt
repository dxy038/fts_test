The applications of Petri net modeling to the design and operations of sequential control systems (SCSs) are widely developed. Automatic Petri net generation is also possible. The bottleneck in SCS development is the acquisition of knowledge, as the adaptation and utilization of experience have not been done smoothly. The objective of this work is to simplify the acquisition of knowledge and the transition from the specification of the SCS design to Petri net modeling. A Petri-net-based representation is used to explain the acquisition of knowledge in SCSs by learning and to develop a system for Petri net generation

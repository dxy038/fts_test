This paper presents a distributed controller for distributed coordinated tracking of multi-agent systems. The dynamics of each agents is described by double integrator whose state variables are position and velocity. The objective of each agent is to track the virtual leader´s trajectory under the situation that the virtual leader´s position is known to only some followers and the followers are allowed to exchange information with their neighbors. The proposed controller is a dynamic output feedback controller in the sense that the information exchanged over the communication network is only the position. One novelty of the proposed controller is that all the design parameters except one do not use the information on the whole network.

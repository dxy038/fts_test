Aim at the characteristics of optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations, a mathematical model that solves multi-stage optimization problem based on particle swarm optimization algorithm is established. The operating strategy of reservoir was transformed to the variable sequence of reservoir water level array, which is presented by a number string of particle through certain coding form. When the particle meets certain constraints, the performance is evaluated by the predetermined objective function. According to the application research of PSO algorithms and some improve PSO algorithm to the cascade optimal operation in the Yalong River, and the comparative analysis of the performance with GA and ACO algorithm, the advantage of the former one is well presented.

This paper is aimed at analyzing and modeling a class of DC-DC interleaved boost converters (IBC) that make use of a interphase transformer (IPT). It is known that the use of IPT represents improvements with respect to classical interleaved converters such as higher efficiencies, reduced component size and reduced thermal stress. Since such converters are a promising technology for electric vehicles (EV), the unidirectional and bidirectional versions are analyzed. The proposed models are averaged linear and nonlinear and constitute useful tools for control and analysis purposes. The frequency response of the model is also presented. Moreover, models responses are compared with Synopsys Saber simulations to evaluate the effect of non-ideal modeling in switching devices and parasitic components.

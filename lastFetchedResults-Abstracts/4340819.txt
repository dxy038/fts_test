This paper introduces a DC/AC converter with high-frequency isolation and bidirectional power flow capability for photovoltaic energy applications. The topology is based on a high-frequency inverter, a high-frequency transformer and an AC/AC converter. No additional DC-link stages are required, providing a reduction of components. A modulation strategy for the commutation of the AC/AC converter switches is presented with the benefits of soft-switching commutations with no extra components. Simulation and experimental verification are provided.

The objective of this work was to study cellular changes in the epithelium of the mareâ€™s oviduct. Oviductal samples were taken from mares at different reproductive stages for optical microscopy and Hoechst 33258 staining. Glandular-like structures were observed in 100% of the oviducts. These structures were of the tubular type and were formed by ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells arranged in a way similar to the epithelial surface. The amount of structures decreased progressively from the ampulla to the isthmus, but did not change through the different reproductive stages. Histological changes in the epithelium of the oviduct were observed associated with the reproductive stages. In the ampulla, the amount of ciliated cells decreased in the anovulatory phase compared with other reproductive stages. Cords of connective tissue lined by epithelium (trabeculae) and dividing completely the lumen of the oviduct were found in 50% of the oviducts. Epithelial cells projected toward the lumen as large vesicles of cytoplasm, sometimes containing a nucleus. The amount of cells presenting nuclear protrusion varied throughout the oviduct, with highest incidence in the ampulla, decreasing progressively toward the isthmus (P < .05). In addition, nuclear protrusions were higher in number during the anovulatory and luteal phases than in the other reproductive stages (P < .05). These nuclear protruding cells appeared to be extruding from the epithelium and showed no signs of apoptosis based on the histological and fluorescent stains used. The existence of these gland-like structures in the oviductal mucosa should be considered when studying the oviductal physiology in mares.

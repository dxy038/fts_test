The objective of this paper is to incorporate the effects of fabric and its evolution into the Dilatant Double Shearing Model [Mehrabadi, M.M., Cowin, S.C., 1978. Initial planar deformation of dilatant granular materials. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 26, 269â€“284] for granular materials in order to capture the anisotropic behavior and the complex response of granular materials in cyclic shear loading. An important consequence of considering the fabric is that one can have unequal shearing rates along the two slip directions. This property leads to the non-coaxiality of the principal axes of stress and strain rate, which is more appropriate for a material that exhibits initial and induced anisotropy. In addition, we employ a fabric-dependent elasticity tensor with orthotropic symmetry. The model developed in this paper also predicts one of the experimentally observed characteristics of granular materials: the gradual concentration of the contact normals towards the maximum principal stress direction.

This paper presents reliable protocols and their performance evaluations for message control channel in distributed ATM VP self-healing networks. Combining the proposed analytic model for error recovery technology for the data-link level and a self-healing simulator for ATM VP mesh networks, the restoration time characteristics are evaluated. The case study results under the worst case scenario show that the total restoration time including link-by-link error control to self-healing control messages is expected to be less than 2 second for a metropolitan LATA network, where 2 second-service restoration is the objective for a survivable mesh network. The results also show that the average delay penalty by adding the link-by-link error recovery process is estimated to be 7.5 msec for complete service restoration

In order to layout and plan integrated passenger hub more scientifically and reasonably, we established the multi-level indicator system of integrated passenger hub as the first step. And then the improved weighted gray correlation method was selected to do evaluation work. After that, this paper took the Euclidean minimum weighted distance method to calibrate the indicatorsÂ´ weights based on the ideal point, which could make the evaluation result of integrated passenger hub layout more objective and realistic. Finally, example application results show the effectiveness of this method.

This paper outlines the creation of a finite element model of the human jaw for use in simulating mastication. The objective behind creating this model is to be able to provide dynamic calculation of the forces acting on the teeth during mastication. The model consists of anatomically realistic finite element representations of the bones, teeth, muscles and ligaments involved in the process of mastication. The muscles of the model will be electrically activated to produce forces on the mandible causing movement. Electromyograph (EMG) measurements will be used to determine this muscle activation.

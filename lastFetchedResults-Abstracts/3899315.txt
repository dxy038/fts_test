Biomedical telemetry permits the transmission (telemetering) of physiological signals at a distance. One of its latest developments is in the field of implantable medical devices (IMDs). Patch antennas currently are receiving significant scientific interest for integration into the implantable medical devices and radio-frequency (RF)-enabled biotelemetry, because of their high flexibility in design, conformability, and shape. The design of implantable patch antennas has gained considerable attention for dealing with issues related to biocompatibility, miniaturization, patient safety, improved quality of communication with exterior monitoring/control equipment, and insensitivity to detuning. Numerical and experimental investigations for implantable patch antennas are also highly intriguing. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of these challenges, and discuss the ways in which they have been dealt with so far in the literature.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the application of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm in solving the multiobjective signal timing optimization problem (MOSTOP). Three n-objective signal timing optimization problems with m-constraint, which cover both deterministic and stochastic traffic patterns, are defined and solved in this study. Mathematical approximations of the resulting Pareto Frontiers are presented to evaluate the trade-off among various objectives and thus provide the most appropriate alternatives for all potential situations of the intersection traffic signal design.

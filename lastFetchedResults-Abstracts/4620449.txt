IEEE 802.16j is an extension of IEEE 802.16 to support relay mode operation. This paper applies IEEE 802.16j to vehicular networks to provide Internet access for high-way vehicles. It designs a utility function, which considers different types of services and effect of velocity on vehicular networks. It proposes a dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm specifically for base stations (BSs) in vehicular networks to support QoS requirements of different types of services. The objective of the proposed DBA is to allocate bandwidth from the BS to its serving relay stations (RSs) with QoS consideration. The simulation results have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DBA algorithm.

Clinical evaluation of skin treatments consists of two steps. First, the degree of the disease is measured clinically on a group of patients by dermatologists. Then, a statistical test is used on obtained set of measures to determine the treatment efficacy. In this paper, a method is proposed to automatically measure the severity of skin hyperpigmentation. After a classification step, an objective function is designed in order to obtain an optimal linear combination of bands defining the severity criterion. Then a hypothesis test is deployed on this combination to quantify treatment efficacy.

Background. The objective of the study was to analyze the efficiency of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for the treatment of primary (PSP) or secondary (SSP) spontaneous pneumothorax in an initial series of 99 patients.

Methods. From April 1992 to December 1995, 74 men and 25 women with a median age of 31 years (range, 17 to 85 years) were treated by VATS for persistent (n = 40) or recurrent (n = 59) PSP (n = 65) or SSP (n = 34). Postoperative parameters such as use of analgesics, length of hospital stay, and duration of drainage were compared with those of a control group of 100 patients treated by lateral thoracotomy between January 1988 and December 1991.

Results. Conversion to lateral thoracotomy was necessary in 6 (9.2%) patients with PSP and in 10 (29.4%) patients with SSP, in most cases because of adhesions. Postoperative complications occurred in 1 (1.7%) patient with PSP and in 6 (25%) patients with SSP. There were no operative deaths. After a median follow-up period of 29 months, 4 (4.8%) recurrences were noted. All recurrences occurred in patients with PSP and during the first year of our experience. Compared with lateral thoracotomy, treatment by VATS resulted in a significantly shorter hospital stay and drainage duration in patients with PSP but not in patients with SSP. The use of analgesics was reduced in all patients treated by VATS independent of the type of pneumothorax.

Conclusions. Surgical treatment by VATS is a viable alternative to lateral thoracotomy in patients with PSP. The usefulness of VATS in patients with SSP remains to be defined.

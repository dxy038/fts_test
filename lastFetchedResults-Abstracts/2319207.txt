Objective (s): The phenomenon of collaboration is the largest knowledge sharing network and real interference of researchers in science production and scientific development. So, in the present study we define the outputs and collaborations of Iranian researchers for disasters in Scopus citation database from 1999 to 2013.
Methods: This was a scientometrics based study on collaborations indexes and type of applied study. The population of study composed of all scientific production of Iranian researchers for disasters from Scopus citation database getting indexed from 1999 to 2013 (448 document). Then information for regulation and the final analysis moved to excel software and the collaboration coefficient was obtained by cc formula. Descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, average, and standard deviation) was used to explore the data.
Results: The analysis showed that the maximum collaboration were between Iran and Great Britain with (21%) and after that with the United States of America with (20%) and minimum amount of collaboration between Iran with Japan and France with (4%). Results showed that Iranian researchers overall published 448 documents in Scopus citation database between 1999 and 2013. The maximum collaboration coefficient in document writing was found for year 1999 and 2000.
Conclusion: The finding on authorâ€™s collaboration coefficient for disaster research was appropriate. However, teamwork and its influence for the country research profile should be encourage. This might increase quality and numbers of citations and enhance quantity of scientific productions.

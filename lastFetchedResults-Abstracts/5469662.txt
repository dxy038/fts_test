In this research project we present the design and construction of a biped robot based on dynamic walking. The main objective of this research is the assimilation of technology in the field of dynamic walking robots, therefore, we built a prototype based on a previously built robot developed at Delft University created by Martjin Wisse. The reason for performing this research is to have a starting point in the development of bipedal robots and human prostheses. The robot was built under a mechatronic approach, i.e. with a synergical relationship between the mechanical, electronics and programming constituent parts. The prototype performes dynamic walking analogous to the locomotion of humans. It was concluded that these technologies can be used for the design, simulation and construction of dynamic walking robots.

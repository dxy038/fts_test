Objective: To develop a rolling walker that would reduce the risk of fall induced injuries. Methods: Three main components of the design were the failsafe brake, the active brake, and the frame. The failsafe footprint was tested for frictional forces on various surfaces. The active brake was tested by applying known loads on the spring and measuring deflection. The frame was evaluated by applying a cyclic load to the pins. The effects of loading were evaluated. Results: Contact area was shown to be 99.66%, 96.74%, and 95.34% for tile, wood and cement respectively. The springs were loaded with a percentile of the maximum weight to be applied and pound/in load rates were established for 50-85% maximum weight. For the frame component the pins were loaded to simulate three months of use. All pins passed. Conclusion: This rolling walker design has proven to be a success. The innovative braking mechanisms shall reduce injuries due to walker related falls.

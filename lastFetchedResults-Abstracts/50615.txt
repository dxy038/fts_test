The use of electrogenerated chemilummescence (ECL) at microelectrodes as a light source for scanning optical microscopy is demonstrated. Cone-shaped microelectrodes were constructed by flame etching carbon fibers to a fine point. ECL generated in solution at such electrodes was forced to the apex of the conducting surface by using high-frequency (20-kHz) potential pulses and high concentrations of ECL reagents in the solution. ECL arose from the reaction of9,10-diphenylanthracene radical cation with the radical anion of benzonitrile, the solvent. The electrode/light source was raster-scanned a finite distance above the sample surface, and images were generated with standard scanning probe software by collecting the transmitted light with a microscope objective. These images compared favorably to optical images of the same sample. A resolution of -600 nm was achieved with this arrangement even though a feedback loop was not employed to control the tip distance from the sample. The source was sufficiently bright (1.82 pW) that well-defined transmittance spectra could be obtained at individual locations on the sample.

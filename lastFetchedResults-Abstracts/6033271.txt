It is the objective of the presented System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architecture to provide a predictable integrated execution environment for the component-based design of many different types of embedded applications (e.g., automotive, avionics, consumer electronics). At the core of this architecture is a time-triggered network-on-a-chip for the predictable interconnection of heterogeneous components. A component can be a self-contained computer, including system and application software, an FPGA, or a custom hardware unit. By providing a single uniform interface to all types of components for the exchange of messages, the architecture supports the component-based design of large applications and enables the massive reuse of components. The time-triggered network-on-a-chip offers inherent fault isolation to facilitate the seamless integration of independently developed components, possibly with different criticality levels. Furthermore, mechanisms for integrated resource management support dynamically changing resource requirements (e.g., different operational modes of an application), fault-tolerance, a power-aware system behavior, and the implementation of fault-handling by reconfiguration.

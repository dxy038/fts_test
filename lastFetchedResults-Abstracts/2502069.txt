Objective(s): Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) potentials make them appropriate for cell therapy including ability of differentiation and release of anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors secreta. For treatment of azoospermia to induce proliferation and differentiation of germ cells, MSCs transplantation has been introduced. The aim of the present experimental case-control study was to histomorphometric evaluation of the germinal cells in seminiferous tubules of azoospermic rats before and after BM-MSCs allotransplantation.
Materials and Methods: In the present study, BM-MSCs were isolated from six male rats and confirmed. Their testes also served as intact negative controls. The recipient rats (n=6) were received two doses of 10 mg/kg of busulfan with 21 days interval to induce azoospermia. After cessation of spermatogenesis, the rats were allotransplanted with the BM-MSCs into efferent duct of right testes. Thirty-five days later, the right cell-treated testes were compared to left azoospermic ones.
Results: Histomorphometric analyses showed that the seminiferous tubules treated with BM-MSCs had normal morphology in comparison with azoospermic testes, which were without germinal layer. In most BM-MSCs-treated seminiferous tubules, spermatogenesis was observed.
Conclusion: The allotransplanted BM-MSCs could induce spermatogenesis in seminiferous tubules of azoospermic rats.

A novel scheme of cascaded injection locking, based on Fabry-Perot laser diodes, is proposed to generate millimeter-wave carrier and to implement bidirectional RoF wired and wireless data transmission system. It was verified for the proposed technique to improve a suppression ratio of an optical carrier suppressed signal by 20 dB. There was an achievement of 60 GHz carrier generation which had RF peak power of -40 dBm and phase noise of -103.5 dBm/Hz at 1 MHz offset. In addition, it was possible to support bidirectional 1.25-Gbps wired and wireless transmission by adopting the remodulation of a gain-saturated reflective semiconductor optical amplifier for the uplink.

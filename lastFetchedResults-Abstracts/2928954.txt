We present in this paper an expert system used to conceive a grinding process of cement. This system optimizes the consumption of energy and provides the best grinding efficiency. This consumption depends strongly on the raw material flow, ventilation and separation. Our objective is to minimize the consumption of energy. The system can also advise the users on the possibility of improvement in conceiving a grinding chain with the performance required

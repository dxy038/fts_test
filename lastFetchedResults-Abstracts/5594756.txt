Development of multi-mode waveguide transmission lines requires design of components ensuring that waveguide modes be preserved or converted from one into another when the transmission line is bent or its parameters (e.g., radius) are varied. The synthesis methods developed to date (see, e.g., [B. Plaum, et al., 2000]) were in some respects unsatisfactory, both in regard to converter parameters, such as the length and the conversion coefficient, and computer resources. The objective of this paper is to formulate and to illustrate a new efficient iterative algorithm for synthesis of waveguide mode converters.

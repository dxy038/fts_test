Summary form only given. In this paper, the authors suggest solutions for a multiple objective linear fractional programming (MOLFP) problem by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) which is a multi criteria decision making method based on ratio scales and relative comparing. For this purpose, a MOLFP problem and efficient solutions are defined in the second section. The general concept of AHP is studied in the third section. The final section is devoted to the solution method the authors proposed for this problem

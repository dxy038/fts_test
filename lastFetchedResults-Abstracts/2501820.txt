Background and Objective: Methamphetamine as a highly addictive stimulant affects the nervous neurotransmitters and physical status. This study aimed to investigate the effects of seven weeks of combined (aerobic-resistance) training on blood levels of serotonin and dopamine and physical fitness factors of addicted men to methamphetamine during rehabilitation.

Materials and Methods: In this research study, 17 men addicted to methamphetamine were selected to participate as a purposeful and available sample and were randomly divided into two groups of experimental (n = 8) and control (n = 9) groups. The experimental group had combined training for 7 weeks, 3 days a week (each session, aerobic running training for 20 minutes, with an intensity of 60-75% of maximum heart rate, followed by resistance training with 60-75 percent of one repetition maximum (1RM), while the control group was only followed up without any effective physical activity. The variables measured before and after training programs included blood levels of serotonin and dopamine, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility and aerobic power. 

Results: Seven weeks of combined (aerobicâ€“resistance) training significantly increased blood levels of serotonin and dopamine, muscular strength and endurance and flexibility in the experimental group as compared to the control (P < 0.05), while aerobic power did not change significantly (P > 0.05).

Conclusion: Combined training can affect blood levels of serotonin and dopamine and the health-related fitness factors of men addicted to methamphetamine, and a non-drug treatment is helpful during rehabilitation.

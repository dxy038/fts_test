In this paper, a comprehensive planning methodology is proposed that can minimize the line loss, maximize the reliability and improve the voltage profile in a distribution network. The injected active and reactive power of Distributed Generators (DG) and the installed capacitor sizes at different buses and for different load levels are optimally controlled. The tap setting of HV/MV transformer along with the line and transformer upgrading is also included in the objective function. A hybrid optimization method, called Hybrid Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (HDPSO), is introduced to solve this nonlinear and discrete optimization problem. The proposed HDPSO approach is a developed version of DPSO in which the diversity of the optimizing variables is increased using the genetic algorithm operators to avoid trapping in local minima. The objective function is composed of the investment cost of DGs, capacitors, distribution lines and HV/MV transformer, the line loss, and the reliability. All of these elements are converted into genuine dollars. Given this, a single-objective optimization method is sufficient. The bus voltage and the line current as constraints are satisfied during the optimization procedure. The IEEE 18-bus test system is modified and employed to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The results illustrate the unavoidable need for optimal control on the DG active and reactive power and capacitors in distribution networks.

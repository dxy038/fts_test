This paper presents a framework to carry out a simulation of Simulink model of dc drive system to optimize the controller gains for known inputs. The objective is to find the optimal controller gain (proportional and integral) in a closed loop system with parameter uncertainty. The optimization results have been obtained by three algorithms. These algorithms are gradient descent, pattern search and simplex search based optimization algorithm. The uncertainties of parameters have been also included with the case study. These uncertainties are Monte Carlo (random) and grid type uncertainty. The study has been conducted on a model of three phase converter controlled direct current (DC) drive with current control strategy. The results show a comparison between proposed two algorithms with uncertainty.

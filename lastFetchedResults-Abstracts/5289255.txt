An adjacent intersections traffic light coordinated control model based on mixed integer programming formulation is proposed in this paper. On a special moment, we can compute to obtain departure rate in the upstream intersection. Then, by switching the green light time, we can control arrival rate of downstream intersection. The contribution of the paper is that a special objective functions differing from other literatures is adapted that minimizes the sum of time needed to pass downstream intersection for the first vehicle of each cycle during K cycles. Finally, the paper makes simulation research for the modelpsilas ability of coordinated control by an example. And the simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method to reduce waiting time of vehicles.

A parallel interference cancellation (PIC) based signal detection scheme is proposed for asynchronous bidirectional relay networks using analog network coding (ANC) with differential modulation. It is shown that the proposed scheme can effectively suppress the inter-symbol interference (ISI) in the received mixed signals at the relay node in the first transmission time-slot and offers significant performance improvement when neither the source nodes nor the relay knows the channel state information, and still retains a low computational complexity.

Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is resistant to most antibiotics
and is an important pathogen of nosocomial infections. Colonization with MRSA is no longer
limited to hospitalized patients or persons with predisposing risk factors and at present there are
several strains of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA).
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of community-acquired
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and also the colonization-associated risk factors.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through random sampling of 1083 patients
admitted to Qazvin hospitals from 2004 to 2006. Nasal swabs were obtained at admission and
cultured on mannitol salt agar. Oxacillin-screening plate was used to demonstrate methicillinresistance
strains of SA (according to NCCLS guidelines). Demographic and specific information
were collected by questionnaire. Data were analyzed by Chi square test.
Findings: The participants' age group ranged between 2 to 94 years (mean 42.24) among those. 468
(43.2%) were males and 615 (56.8%) females with 613 (56.6%) living in urban areas. Of 1083
individuals, 56 (5.2%) were SA carrier, 51 (4.7%) colonized with MSSA and 5(0.5%) with MRSA
strains. Several factors such as occupation, family size, previous hospitalization, history of
antibiotic therapy within the previous 2 months, and also the presence of chronic diseases were
assessed, however, no significant relationship with MRSA colonization was found (p> 0.05).
Conclusion: This study confirmed the presence of CA-MRSA in Qazvin. There was no significant
relationship between the prevalence of CA-MRSA strains and the risk factors.

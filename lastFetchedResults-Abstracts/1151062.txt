The objective of this work is to present the relationship between macro- and microstructure of the rheocast alloy A356 obtained by electromagnetic stirring. There is a direct relationship between grain size (macrostructure) and globule size/shape factor (microstructure): the smaller the grain size, the smaller are the globule size and shape factor. The A356 alloy was processed in a simple device, which constitutes a semi-continuous casting system, coupled with a power source. The A356 (Al–7.0 wt.%Si) alloy was electromagnetically stirred under different cooling rates (controlled by the casting speed of 1 and 3 cm/s) and different power levels (600–1200 W). Ingots with 45 mm of diameter and 3 kg with very refined and homogeneous rheocast structures were obtained. The direct relationship between macro- and microstructures of the ingots were exploited. A quality index is proposed to better characterise the rheocast structure.

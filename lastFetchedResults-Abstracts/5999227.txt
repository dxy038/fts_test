To cope with the increasing number of design-for-testability (DFT) techniques, CAD tools are required to help designer organize, evaluate and select test techniques that will satisfy design objectives. The objective of this paper is to propose a fuzzy decision-making approach for the selection of test methodologies. Designer objectives and constraints are specified as fuzzy sets over the space of alternatives. The authors present F selector, a fuzzy decision-making tool developed for the selection of test methodologies. They attempt to show a single decision model which can be used in several selection problems encountered in the design of both analog and digital circuits. In particular, the technique is applied in functional verification of an operational amplifier. Results for a sample PLA are also presented

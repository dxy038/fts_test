We pose and solve an extremum seeking control problem for a class of state-constrained nonlinear systems with unknown parameters. The approach is based on previous work for unconstrained systems, where controllers are derived to drive system states to the set points, which maximize the value of an objective function with unknown parameters. State constraints are handled using an interior-point method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

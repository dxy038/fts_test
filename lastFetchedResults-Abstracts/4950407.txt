Electronic commerce is the paperless exchange of business information using electronic data interchange (EDI). The best way for e-commerce is through WWW. This paper identifies the issues related to the usability perspective of the e-commerce as a process and proposes improvements to the e-commerce process to resolve the issues identified. Today the application of e-commerce is more focused towards B2B e- commerce and less to B2C. Consumers having no credit cards are not targeted as customers. e-commerce websites are not secure due to the open payment method that requires credit card information. There are ethical issues like applying hidden charges, taxes and the cost of shipment. The process is lengthy and complex as it requires formalities like filling multiple forms. We have proposed improvements to the e-commerce process in the form of improved payment process termed as reference payment method and elimination of the requirements of having a credit card. The objective of the proposed improvements is to increase the business by targeting more on end-users.

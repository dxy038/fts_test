Background
tine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has been reported to be superior in its antiaggressive properties as compared with other antidepressants. The objective of the study was to investigate whether the effect of a minimal effective dose of fluoxetine could be potentiated by the Î±2-adrenergic agonist clonidine.
s
e (1.0 mL/kg), clonidine (0.1 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), and their combination [clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) plus fluoxetine (10 mg/kg)] were injected into apomorphine-pretreated (1.0 mg/kg, once daily during 12 days) aggressive adult male Wistar rats.
s
ed apomorphine treatment induced a gradual development of aggressive behavior. Combined clonidine and fluoxetine treatment attenuated the intensity of aggressive behavior, while these drugs alone had only a weak tendency toward reduction of aggression. Latency before the first attack was unchanged.
sions
periments confirm that combined clonidine and fluoxetine treatment elicits an additive antiaggressive effect on apomorphine-induced aggressive behavior in rats.

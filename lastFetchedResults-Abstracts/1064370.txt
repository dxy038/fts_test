Soil water repellency generally tends to increase during dry weather while it decreases or completely vanishes after heavy precipitation or during extended periods with high soil water contents. These observations lead to the hypothesis that soil water repellency is common in dry climates and rare in humid climates. The study objective is to test this hypothesis by examining the occurrence of soil water repellency in an arid and humid climate. The main conclusion of this study is that the effect of climate on soil water repellency is very limited. Field observations in the arid Middle Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico (USA) and the humid Piedras Blancas Watershed in Colombia show that the main impact of climate seems to be in which manner it affects the production of organic matter. An extremely dry climate will result in low organic matter production rates and, therefore, less potential for the development of soil water repellency. On the other hand, a very humid climate is favorable for organic matter production and, therefore, for the development of water repellency.

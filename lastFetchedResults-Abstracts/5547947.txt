Monitoring crop condition and yields at regional scales using traditional operational NOAA AVHRR data remains challenging. The 1 km spatial resolution with two primary spectral bands is not adequate for development of field level canopy parameters. MODIS imagery offers an opportunity for daily coverage and adequate resolution required in operational applications. The objective of this research is to investigate the applicability of the 8-day MODIS composite data in the operational programs for crop condition and yield assessment. A field study was conducted in the predominantly corn and soybean area of Iowa in the Upper Midwest U.S. Crop yields were simulated at 250 m resolution and results were mapped for the study area.

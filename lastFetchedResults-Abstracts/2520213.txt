Background and Objective: Numerical modeling of biological structures
would be very helpful tool to analyze hundreds of human body phenomena and
also diseases diagnosis. One physiologic phenomenon is blood circulatory system
and heart hemodynamic performance that can be simulated by utilizing lumped
method. In this study, we can predict hemodynamic behavior of one artery of circulatory system (anterior cerebral artery) when disease such as internal carotid
artery occlusion is occurred.
Method: Pressure-?ow simulation is one the leading common approaches for
modeling of circulatory system behavior and forecasts of hemodynamic in numerous physiological conditions. In this paper, by using lumped model (electrical
analogy), CV system is simulated in MATLAB software (SIMULINK environment).
Results: The performance of healthy blood circulation and heart is modeled
and the obtained results used for further analyses. The stenosis of internal carotid
artery at different rates was, then, induced in the circuit and the effects are studied.
In stenosis cases, the effects of internal carotid artery occlusion on left anterior
cerebral artery pressure waveform are investigated.
Conclusion: The fndings of this study may have implications not only for understanding the behavior of human biological system at healthy condition but also
for diagnosis of diseases in circulatory and cardiovascular system of human body

Swallowable capsule with wireless data transferring enables diagnostic of whole gastrointestinal track (GI) without invasive surgical operation. The capsule travels through GI driven by natural perilstatics. Sensors in the capsule can collect data and send them wirelessly to a receiver outside of the body. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disease in western society. The objective of this research is to develop a capsule system that automatically diagnoses IBS. The capsule includes two sensors: a 3D-accelerometer and a microphone. Both sensors can measure the vibration of the environment. The capsule has been tested in side of living pigs. The signals of peristaltic motion and sounds in the bowel are collected onboard and sent to outside of the body for analysis. The analysis is composed of three steps: filtering and data segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The measurement data is firstly denoised using a wavelet filter. Then the filtered data is segmented and events (such as sounds) are separated. Features such as dominant frequency, zero-crossing rate, and sub-band energy are extracted from the segmented data. After that, the extracted features are classifiled by neural networks.

In this paper, a hybrid fuzzy DEMATEL-TOPSIS model for multi criteria decision making is presented. The criteria weights are determined based on separate cause-effect assessment of a group of professionals using a modified fuzzy DEMATEL approach. The resulting criteria weights are applied to the decision analysis where an improved fuzzy TOPSIS model is presented to aid in the decision making process. By calculating the distances of the fuzzy preferences from both the fuzzy positive ideal solution (FPIS) and the fuzzy negative ideal solution (FNIS) an optimal membership degree of each alternative can be computed to estimate to which extent an alternative belongs to both FPIS and FNIS. The closer the degree of membership to FPIS and the farther from FNIS the more preferred the alternative. The membership degree is attained by optimizing an objective function that measures to which degree an alternative is close/far to/from to the ideal/anti-ideal solution. Finally, a classical decision making case of optimal sore throat treatment in primary care unit is presented. The results show remarkable consistency to those found in the literature for this particular case.

This paper exploits an amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relaying network (TWRN), where an energy constrained relay node harvests energy with wireless power transfer. Two bidirectional protocols, multiple access broadcast (MABC) protocol and time division broadcast (TDBC) protocol, are considered. Three wireless power transfer policies, namely, dual-source (DS) power transfer; single-fixed-source (SFS) power transfer; and single-best-source (SBS) power transfer are proposed and well-designed based on time switching receiver architecture. We derive analytical expressions to determine the throughput both for delay-limited transmission and delay-tolerant transmission. Numerical results corroborate our analysis and show that MABC protocol achieves a higher throughput than TDBC protocol. An important observation is that SBS policy offers a good tradeoff between throughput and power.

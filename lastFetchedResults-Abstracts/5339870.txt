This paper proposes a method for choosing the best transmission system expansion plan(TSEP) using nodal/bus delivery marginal rate criterion (BMR<sub>k</sub>) defined newly in this paper. The objective method minimizes a total cost which is an investment budget for constructing new transmission lines subject to the BMR<sub>k</sub> which means a nodal deterministic reliability level requirement at specified load point. Test results on an existing 21-bus system are included in the paper. It demonstrated the suitability of the proposed method for solving the TSEPproblem in competitive electricity market environment.

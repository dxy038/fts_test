Summary form only given. The energy balance of discharge lamps strongly depends on radiation trapping. Hence, the radiative flux is a fundamental quantity in radiation source research and development. Radiative transfer has been studied for several decades and different formalisms have been introduced. They lead to more or less interesting solutions depending on the particular objective to be achieved. The purpose of this paper is to present and to discuss specific interest of some approaches achieved in our laboratory in the study of discharge lamps radiation.

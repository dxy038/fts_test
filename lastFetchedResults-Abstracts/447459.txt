PURPOE: To determine whether central fuion and ditance tereoacuity are ueful a objective meaure in aeing the need for and ucce of urgery for intermittent exotropia (X[T]).

METHOD: A propective, intitutional, clinical trial wa conducted of 26 conecutive patient with X(T) who were undergoing trabimu urgery in whom fuion (central and peripheral) and tereoacuity (at near and ditance) were aeed preoperatively and potoperatively, a well a in 112 normal ubject. To obtain accurate meaurement with enory tet, the lower age wa limited to 5 year for incluion. A ucceful urgical alignment wa defined a an exotropia of 10 prim diopter or le at 6 m. enory and motor outcome meaure were determined 1 year after urgery.

REULT: The ucceful urgical alignment rate wa 69%. All patient with X(T) demontrated peripheral fuion, wherea 35% demontrated central uppreion preoperatively and potoperatively. Central fuion wa not predictive of urgical outcome (P = .078); however, there wa a trend toward le urgical ucce in patient with central uppreion. Patient with X(T) exhibited good near tereoacuity before and after urgery. Ditance tereoacuity in patient with X(T) preoperatively wa ignificantly diminihed compared with normal ubject (P < .001) and wa improved in 58% potoperatively. Patient who achieved ucceful urgical alignment had a greater likelihood of demontrating ditance tereoacuity improvement potoperatively than patient who failed to achieve ucceful urgical alignment (P = .003). Patient with central uppreion were unlikely to improve their ditance tereoacuity potoperatively (P = .014).

CONCLUION: ucceful urgery may improve ditance tereoacuity. Better ditance tereoacuity and central fuion are frequently aociated with better urgical ucce in X(T).

This paper describes the application of simulation for analyzing cluster tool cycle times and cluster tool capacity planning. The objective of this project was to develop a flexible and expandable tool for rapidly calculating tool cycle times for a multiple step process through alternative tool configurations. The calculated process cycle times are then used to calculate equipment tool set requirements against product demand. The Seagate Industrial Engineering group utilized a simulation based cluster tool model developed to predict cluster tool cycle times and analyze cluster tool capacity across multiple tools and compare with results from static probability based model predictions

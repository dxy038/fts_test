Dracaena (Dracaena marginata) is one of the important economic ornamental plants in Iran as well as around the world. Micropropagation and enhancement in genetic variation of various ecotypes of this ornamental plant have been considered in several research studies for several years. The main objective of this study was maintenance of the best media culture for callus induction and shoots regeneration in Dracaena "Tricolor". Therefore, small stem segments of 0.5 cm in length were cut from the maternal plants. In order to set up a proper decontamination control system for Dracaena small stem segment, various levels of sodium hypochlorite including 1%, 1.25% and 1.5% were applied in combination with different time periods of 15 and 10 minutes. Moreover, the most suitable medium cultures for callus induction, shoots regeneration and root induction were identified. A proper statistic approach has been used for data analysis in various stages of callus induction and shoots regeneration. The obtained results showed that the most appropriate decontamination treatment to obtain the highest percentage of tissue healthiness could be applied by using 1.25% sodium hypochlorite for 15 minutes. The most suitable MS medium for callus induction was contained either 0.5 mg/l 2,4-D or 1 mg/l NAA. Moreover, applying the following growth regulators including 1 mg/l Kinetin in MS based medium, and 1 mg/l NAA provided the best results for shoots regeneration and root induction.

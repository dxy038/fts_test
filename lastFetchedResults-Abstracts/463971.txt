Objective: Our purpose was to compare a simple artificial hormone replacement regimen with two other protocols incorporating pituitary down-regulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist for frozen embryo transfers.
Study design: We performed a retrospective analysis of pregnancy outcomes after 366 frozen embryo transfers times by one of three hormone replacement regimens. The three regimens used were regimen A, leuprolide acetate and transdermal estradiol patches; regimen B, leuprolide acetate and oral micronized estradiol; regimen C, only oral micronized estradiol.
Results: The outcomes of 366 consecutive frozen embryo transfers according to one of the three regimens were compared and analyzed. The clinical pregnancy rates were 13.7%, 11.4% and 13.5% in regimens A, B and C, respectively. No statistical differences were found among the three regimens. The mean age of the patients in the three groups was comparable. The mean number of frozen embryos transferred with regimen B was slighly higher, but it did not have a positive impact on the pregnancy rate in this group.
Conclusion: Controlled sequential hormone replacement results in an endometrium suitable for frozen embryo transfers. Pituitary down-regulation is not necessary. Therefore this regimen is not only more simple to use but also more economical.

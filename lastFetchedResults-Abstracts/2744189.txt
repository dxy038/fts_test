Efficient power conversion technologies are strategic to the advancement of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). This paper presents an overview of power conditioning system (PCS) architectures for an FCV propulsion system. Two new power conversion topologies to obtain variable ac from the fuel cell system are proposed. The switching of the power devices are based on the proposed hybrid modulation technique that minimizes the switching losses in the inverter. The proposed converters do not use the dc-link filter capacitors. Elimination of the dc-link capacitor not only reduces the size and volume but also helps in retaining the sine wave modulated information at the input of a three-phase inverter. Bidirectional converter topologies are proposed for interfacing low-voltage battery and fuel cell dc bus. Experimental results are presented for the proposed topologies.

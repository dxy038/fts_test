Objective Little is known about public
conceptions of mental disorders in Latin America and
the Caribbean. The aim of this article is to assess how
the population identifies symptoms of schizophrenia
and the causes attributed to this disorder in the city of
Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. Method A household survey was
carried out in 2002 with a probabilistic sample of 500
individuals, residents of Sa˜o Paulo with ages ranging
from 18 to 65. Vignette describing in colloquial
language an individual with schizophrenia (according
to DSM-IV and ICD-10) was presented together with a
structured questionnaire with questions about the
vignette. Results The symptoms of schizophrenia
were identified by 23.4% as depression. The term
schizophrenia was used in only 2.2% of the responses.
A bit more than half of the respondents believed it
was a mental illness. The main causes attributed were
‘‘drug use’’ and ‘‘isolation’’. Factors most influencing
responses about causes were years of schooling
and identification as a mental illness. Conclusions
Medical–scientific concepts are used less in Sa˜o
Paulo than in other countries. The main causes
attributed by the public relate to psychosocial stress.
Causes of biological or moral nature are considered
less relevant.

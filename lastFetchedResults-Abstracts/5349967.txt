In underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), one efficient way to alleviate the burdens of high propagation delay and high error probability during transmission is to deploy surface-level gateways, which utilize radio waves to forward information to a control station. Usually, deployment of the gateways is considered as an optimization problem with the objective to best satisfy certain parameters. In this work, we propose a prediction assisted dynamic surface gateway placement algorithm for mobile underwater sensor networks, called &#8220;PADP&#8221;, which intends to maximize the coverage within a specific period of time. PADP applies a tracking scheme &#8220;IMM&#8221; to predict sensor nodesÂ´ positions, adopts branch-and-cut to solve the optimization problem, and employs a disjoint-set data structure to handle connectivity. Simulation results show that PADP outperforms the existing static gateway deployment scheme.

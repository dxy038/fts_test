Convenient and safety functionalities in cars are increasing and some of them required a bidirectional communication between the car and the car driver or owner. A long range communication as discussed in this paper is such an application which required a bidirectional communication. Such a long range communication can be GSM -based or car- key-based. This paper is focussed on the car-key-based long range communication which requires a careful design of the standalone components in order to fulfil the end customer wishes. These end customers wishes are directly related to system technical aspects like transceiver sensitivity, transmitting power on car and key side, modulation scheme and protocols, battery life time, polarisation matching, attenuation due to distance, influence of construction, vegetation and relief, receiver position, antenna type and position. Within this paper, some of these technical aspects are discussed.

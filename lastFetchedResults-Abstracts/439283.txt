Background. The aorta that has undergone an aorta–pulmonary artery anastomosis may not exhibit the same velocity profile as the nonreconstructed aorta, whose velocity profile is thought to be uniform across the vessel diameter (plug flow). This may have an impact on fluid dynamics and will alter Doppler flow calculations. Our objective was to determine the impact of surgical reconstruction on the velocity and flow profiles of the reconstructed ascending and descending aorta.

Methods. Using a magnetic resonance imaging tagging technique that labels flowing blood (bolus tagging), we studied 22 patients (mean age, 8.6 ± 4.7 years) who had had a Fontan procedure. A cine sequence labeled the blood and acquired the image after 20 ms in the middle of the ascending aorta and behind the left atrium in the descending aorta. The repetition time was 50 ms.

Results. The reconstructed ascending aorta displayed a velocity profile skewed anteriorly, whereas in the nonreconstructed aorta, the velocity profile was flat. Reconstructed aortas also displayed flows that were higher anteriorly, took a longer time to reach maximum velocity, and were less like “plug” flow than the nonreconstructed aorta. The descending aorta, regardless of whether aortic reconstruction was present, displayed velocity profiles (at various phases of systole) skewed posteriorly.

Conclusions. The reconstructed aorta displays disturbed flow, and the velocities across the ascending aortic diameter are more varied than those in aortas without reconstruction and are skewed anteriorly. The descending aortic velocity profile in children is skewed posteriorly, regardless of whether aortic reconstruction is present. This information may help design and build a “better” aortic reconstruction.

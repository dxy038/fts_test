Among the Gateway Engineering Education Coalition institutions are several models of restructuring the lower division undergraduate educational program. the oldest of these experiments, and the most extensive to date in restructuring the educational process, is the program at Drexel University. The objective for this session is to present the process of institutionalizing significant changes in the early engineering educational experience. The term institutionalization is taken very broadly to include the range from complete adoption of a full curriculum across the entire educational program at one institution to the adaptation and adoption of some or all of a program of change from one institution by another; overcoming the &#8220;not invented here&#8221; syndrome

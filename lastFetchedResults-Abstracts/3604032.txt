The development of sustainable, clean, and efficient transportation systems is a critical factor for the improvement of overall air quality and the reduction of the nationÂ´s dependence on diminishing domestic resources and imported fuels. This article presents the development issues for an innovative fuel cell electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and bidirectional grid connection, derived from renewable and clean energy sources, with a focus on wind energy. The effective use of wind power to drive water electrolysis plants to produce hydrogen for advanced fuel-cell EV is also illustrated in this paper.

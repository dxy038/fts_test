Objective: To observe the protective effect of Rg1 on acute myocardial ischemia in Guinea pigs. Methods: Acute myocardial ischemia models were induced by pituitrin, the effect of Ginsenoside Rg1 on ECG in acute myocardial ischemia Guinea pigs was observed, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine phosphokinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathion peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were detected. Results: Ginsenoside Rgl could reduce the heights of ST segment and T wave which caused by injecting pituitrin (P&lt;;0.05), and resist the reduce of heart rate and prolong of PR interval, QRS wave group and QT interval, and it also inhibited the levels of serum AST, CK and LDH (P&lt;;0.05, P&lt;;0.01), increased the activities of serum SOD and GSH-Px, decreased MDA content (P&lt;;0.05, P&lt;;0.01). Conclusion: Ginsenoside Rg1 have the functions of anti acute myocardium ischemia.

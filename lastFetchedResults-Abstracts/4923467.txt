Fixed wireless access (FWA) networks recently attracted increased attention as a means to accommodate the demand for high data rate broadband services. However, co-channel interference (CCI) imposes constraints of quality of service (QoS) requirements in terms of signal to interference ratio (SIR). Efficient scheduling algorithms along with terminal classification procedure have been proposed so as to compensate CCI and improve system performance. However, it has been observed that the terminal classification procedure induces a SIR margin for a significant number of terminals. The objective of this paper is to examine potential exploitation of the SIR margin by adopting multiple modulation modes. Simulation results show that a significant performance improvement in terms of the maximum throughput per sector is achieved.

Despite recent pharmaceutical advancements in the production of new antibiotics, antibiotic resistance is increasing at an alarming rate in mammals; given the high prevalence of infectious diseases. The current study aimed to determine the epidemiology of different infections in patients admitted to the infectious disease ward of Imam Reza hospital in Mashhad, North-East of Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 1681 patients referred to Imam Reza hospital of Mashhad during 2006 - 2008. Prepared checklists were used to collect the required data, including age, gender, employment status, place of residence, length of hospitalization and season of admission in patients diagnosed with infectious diseases. In the current study, prevalence of tuberculosis, septicemia, skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs), febrile neutropenia, myocarditis, and gastrointestinal infections were estimated at 8.4%, 8.3%, 7.1%, 5.4%, 4.9%, 3.9%, and 3.8%, respectively. Also, major respiratory infections were reported in 5.8% of the studied patients. Among the female patients in the study, 20.9% and 10.56% were diagnosed with pneumonia and tuberculosis, respectively. As for the male patients, 16.1%, 10.7%, and 7.1% were diagnosed with pneumonia, nervous system infections and tuberculosis, respectively. According to the results of the study, the most common causes of hospital admission were respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia), nervous system infections, tuberculosis, septicemia, skin and soft tissue infections and UTIs. Considering the diversity of infections, epidemiological evaluation of these diseases is essential, especially in regions with high prevalence of infectious diseases. Furthermore, etiological diagnosis is considered imperative for clinicians before initiating therapy in patients with infectious diseases.

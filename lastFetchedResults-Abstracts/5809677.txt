An inspection robot needs the ability to move freely on transmission lines. However, these lines may contain various obstacles. Therefore, a new structure that would allow inspection robots to easily pass these obstacles is necessary. In this study, inspection robot is designed that moves on a four-conductor transmission line. Using the structure of the robots used for exploration on Mars as reference, four types of effective link structures are suggested and developed. We set the length of each link of the robot to design variables and then conduct the effective the links to determine the relationship of each design variable. The link lengths are set as design constraint to less than 1 m. Objective fuction is to maximize the displacement for 3 seconds. We conduct optimization using the model. Finally, we arrived at an improved model.

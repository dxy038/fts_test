Topoisomerase II is a cellular target for a number of clinically relevant antitumor drugs. To elucidate the possible cellular target for the antiproliferation activity of cobalt salicylaldoxime (CoSAL), which inhibits 50% of leukemic cell proliferation at a concentration of 60 Î¼M, DNA binding studies and studies of the action of this complex on topoisomerase II catalytic activities were carried out. The results from DNA binding studies show that CoSAL binds DNA strongly with a stoichiometric ratio of two drug molecules for five nucleotide bases and shows a mode of interaction similar to that of DNA groove binding agents. The results from topoisomerase II inhibition studies show that the complex inhibits the relaxation activity of topoisomerase II in a dose-dependent manner and poisons its activity through cleavage complex formation. To see if the hydroxyl group present on imine nitrogen is involved in topoisomerase II poisoning, we synthesized an analogue of CoSAL in which the hydroxyl group was replaced with semicarbazone. This complex too binds DNA with an affinity similar to that of CoSAL, but with a small difference in the mode of interaction; however, it marginally inhibits leukemic cell proliferation and does not inhibit topoisomerase II activity, which suggests the involvement of a hydroxyl group. An immunoprecipitation assay was conducted which showed that the cleavage complex formed in the presence of CoSAL contained 75% of the complex, while the other complex shows only 7.65%. Cyclic voltametric spectra of the complexes in the presence of DNA show that they do not oxidize DNA. These results suggest that CoSAL shows a bidirectional mode of interaction with enzyme and DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II activity by forming a drug-mediated cleavage complex. Our data strongly suggest that topoisomerase II may be one of the cellular targets for antiproliferation activity of CoSAL.

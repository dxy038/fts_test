The objective is to perform an experimental and numerical study to analyze short-pulse laser propagation through tissue phantoms without and with inhomogeneities embedded in them. For a short-pulse laser the observed optical signal has a distinct temporal shape, and the shape is a function of the medium properties. The scattered temporal transmitted and reflected optical signals are measured experimentally with a streak camera for tissue phantoms irradiated with a short-pulse laser source. A parametric study involving different scattering and absorption coefficients of tissue phantoms and inhomogeneities, as well as the detector positions and orientations, is performed. The temporal and spatial profiles of the scattered optical signals are compared with the numerical modeling results obtained by solving the transient radiative transport equation by using the discrete ordinates technique.

Intelligent buildings are a trend of next-generation´s buildings, which facilitate intelligent control of the building in order to fulfill occupants´ comfort demands. The primary objective in building control is to achieve a comfortable building environment with high energy efficiency. By dividing the whole building into several zones, a multi-zone building model is built for developing an effective energy and comfort management scheme. This study proposes a multi-agent control system coupled with an intelligent optimizer for intelligent building control. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized to optimize the building energy management by enhancing the intelligence of the multi-zone building during its operations. A case study of multi-zone building control is carried out and the corresponding simulation results are presented in this paper.

The challenges of promoting sacrifice and martyrdom culture consist of those pests, faults, shortages, illusions and obstacles affecting the understanding, introducing, and promoting of the culture (the essence, necessity and significance, functions, and factors influencing culture) in society and social strata and groups. The major aim of the paper is to investigate this question: From a pathological view, what challenges withhold the promotion of the culture in society? On the basis of an objective-subjective spectrum model of social fact levels (conceptual framework) and a meta-analysis of eleven papers published in the Pathology of Developing Sacrifice and Martyrdom Culture in Society Conference (1386/2007), it can be concluded that the culture suffers from two sets of subjective (4 challenges) and objective (6 challenges) obstacles, indicating the significance of investigating the subject and its negative effects. The study also suggests some solutions.

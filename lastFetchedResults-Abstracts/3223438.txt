In order to prevent a medical malpractice in medication, the effect is expected of patient and medicine authentication system using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and barcodes. Although objective check by information system can be conducted, reading a warped-shape barcode on patient wristband or a one which is not at the expected location is quite complicated at a bedside. To solve this problem, we focused on the &#8220;contactless&#8221; and &#8220;hidden-target-readable&#8221; property of the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. We developed a RFID-equipped PDA and RFID-embedded patient wristband and label for infusion bag, and started to use in all wards in our hospital from November, 2004. The PDA operation log showed that the time required for the authentication by RFID was just the half of that by barcode. This system was also extended to the blood transfusion authentication on June, 2006. Although this system provides both medical safety and work efficiency, medical staff might forget or skip authentication procedure. So, we also developed a Drip-stand-integrated authentication system to incorporate the authentication procedure into the operation of medication itself. Drip stand was equipped with the devices for authentication and active RFID tag was used for patient and medical staff IDÂ´s. The effect was also evaluated and it can authenticate faster than a basic PDA. Thus, RFID technology applied to patient and medicine authentication will provide both &#8220;Accurate check and recording with IT device&#8221; and &#8220;the reduction of the complication in authentication at a bedside&#8221; at the same time.

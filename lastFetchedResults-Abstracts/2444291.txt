<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To investigate relationship between addiction potentiality and different dimensions of emotional self-regulation.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> This descriptive and correlational study included students of Sistan and Baluchistan University, Sistan and Baluchestan, Iran. Participants were selected by random sampling method. We applied Addiction Potential Scale (APS) and Difficult in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) for this study. For statistical analysis, Pearson correlation and regression analysis methods were used.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The results show that there is a positive and significant relationship between the addiction potential and all dimensions of emotional self-regulation (excepting lack of awareness). The enter regression analysis for prediction of the APS by the DERS shows that the DERS predicts 16% of the APS variances.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Regard to the results, it is necessary to introduce an especial program in emotional self-regulation for the youth with addiction potential.</p>

A differential pressure transducer with sputtered gold films as strain gauges has been designed and fabricated. The construction details of the sensing element assembly are given. The details of the strain gauge film configuration employed and the thin-film deposition process are also presented. Information on the output characteristics of the differential pressure transducer such as effect of pressure cycles on output, thermal stability, bidirectional calibration results obtained and individual gauge stability is reported

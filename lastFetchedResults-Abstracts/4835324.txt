The Erlang programming language is a concurrency oriented functional language, based on the notion of independent processes and uses message passing for communication between processes. It is specially adapted to the realization of highly reliable distributed systems. In this paper it is analyzed the use of the ErlangÂ´s computational paradigm for the design and implementation of application specific heterogeneous computational systems. The main objective is to use for the low level implementation the same computational model used in high level view of the system. This will allow an easier and faster design space exploration and optimization.

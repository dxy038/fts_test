This paper presents an image coding method for overdriving of a 10bit Full HD LCD display considering the chip size of TCON (Timing Controller) and real-time operation. The proposed method is an adaptive scheme of AM-BTC (Absolute Moment Block Truncation Coding). It splits a sample block into two sub-blocks considering the color level distribution of the sample block and applies AMBTC to each sub-block. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the conventional method in both objective and subjective visual quality.

The objective of this paper is further investigation of the shell intersection problem. The shell theory and finite element method are used for stress analysis of nozzle connections in ellipsoidal heads of the pressure vessels. Ellipsoidal heads having attached nozzles considerably displaced from the head axis are mainly considered. The features of the numerical procedure, structural modeling of nozzle-head shell intersections and SAIS special-purpose computer program are discussed. The results of stress analysis and parametric study of an ellipsoidal vessel head with a noncentral nozzle under internal pressure loading are presented.

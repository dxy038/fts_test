The collection volume method (CVM) / field intensification method (FIM) is a new shielding design method that claims that the protective range of any air terminal is much larger than that predicted by the electrogeometric model presently used in national and international standards. It hence proposes to drastically reduce the number of air terminals, a matter which could have serious consequences on life and property. The CVM/FIM is being promoted by one of the manufacturers of early streamer emission (ESE) lightning rods, and attempts are being made to introduce it, first in the Australian standard and then in the NFPA standard. In view of nature of the CVM/FIM claim, there is a need to conclusively prove the invalidity of that method. Toward that end, the author outlines a comprehensive research program that is expected to accomplish the above objective. This includes seeking evidence from examining existing lightning rod installations, analyzing the frequency of lightning strikes to wind mills, measuring striking distances on instrumented masts, and investigating the validity of ErikssonÂ´s criterion, from which the CVM/FIM is derived, regarding the final jump of a downward lightning leader.

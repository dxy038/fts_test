The main objective of this paper is to provide efficient and accurate sediment transport models and especially the bedload sediment tranport due to water evolution. The model is obtained by coupling the hydrodynamical component and the morphodynamical one. As our goal is to study coastal media, we chose the ShallowWater equations for the first component. For the other component the choice of the Exner law has been made using a function of the solid transport discharge, the Grass model. The coupled system of non linear partial differential equations is rewritten as a non-conservative hyperbolic system with source term that is solved by finite volume methods with flux limiters. Some numerical tests confirm the second-order of our numerical scheme.

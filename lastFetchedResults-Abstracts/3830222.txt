Targeting a cluster-tree ZigBee network that delivers periodic real-time packets of sensing and control, this paper proposes an algorithm to optimally configure cluster parameters such as beacon intervals (BIs), superframe durations (SDs), and guaranteed time slots (GTSs). The objective is to maximize the entire network lifetime while deterministically guaranteeing all the end-to-end deadlines of the given periodic real-time flows.

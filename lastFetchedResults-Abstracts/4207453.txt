This communication intends to summarize the recent strides carried out by the study of original Very Large Mode Area fibers (VLMA) that offer remarkable beam qualities. This work also aims in pushing farther the threshold of appearance for non-linear processes as well as thermal induced beam degradation hindering the power scaling in optical fibers. So as to fulfil this objective, thorough investigations of fibers modal content has been performed, leading to the evidencing of primordial statements for exacerbation of the beam quality and its robustness. Theoretical principles driven toward the conception of aperiodic Large Pitch Fibers (LPFs) will be reported together with experimental validation into passive fiber designs. The relevance of these original structures will then been discussed in regard to the power scaling.

The objective of this study is to determine experimentally the usefulness of different polysiloxanes as precursors for bulk ceramic products. Such resins are an alternative for currently commercially used polycarbosilanes. Four types of polysiloxanes were used. The polymers differed in C/Si molar ratio. Thermogravimetric measurements of polymers were made to determine curing and heat treatment conditions. Ceramic yield (Yc) after heat treatment over the temperature range from 20 to 1700 °C was determined. Structure, microstructure and phase composition of ceramic products obtained from the polymers were investigated. It was found that during thermal decomposition of polymers in the temperature range from 20 to 1000 °C amorphous inorganic Si–C–O ceramics were formed. When the temperature exceeded 1500 °C nanosized 3C and 2H types of silicon carbide crystallized from the resin precursors with C/Si molar ratio higher than 1. On the contrary, heat treatment of polymer with C/Si molar ratio close to 1 did not lead to the formation of nanocrystalline silicon carbide.

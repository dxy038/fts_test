Because the continually fluctuant price of vessel, the forecast of interval price is more dependable than precise data. A arithmetic of the rough &#949;-insensitive loss function-based support vector machines is introduced, which is able to forecast the interval value. In order to improve the precision of forecast, parameters of the arithmetic is optimized by chaos traverse. On the way, fore-learning objective function is established, to replace the minimum training error object function which easily leads to over training. According to above, the forecasting model of the vessel interval price is founded. Experimental results show that this RSVR model can forecast the vessel interval price has a high precision, and the fore-learning objective can reduce the over-training problems.

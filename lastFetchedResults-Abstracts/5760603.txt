The objective of this paper is to present the result of a simulation study in order to evaluate three different protocols for the administration of Propofol and Remifentanil. These protocols are used in a model based predictive control algorithm for automatic induction and control of depth of anaesthesia (DOA). In this study, DOA is monitored using the Bispectral Index (BIS) during the maintenance of general anaesthesia. The closed loop control tests are performed on a set of 24 virtually generated realistic patients. The closed loop control performance of the three different protocols are evaluated, showing that a unified approach leads to better overall performance.

Field performance of seeds is one of the most important factors in seedling growth, field surface covering and finally having higher yield. Seeds usually exhibit different percents of germination in laboratory and emergance in field which can be related to differences in their vigour. The objective of this experiment was to study the effects of seed vigour on seed germination and emergance of two chickpea (Cicer arietinum) types under saline condition. The laboratory experiment was done using three factors, genotypes (Kaka, Pyrouz, Jam and line-12-60-31). seed deterioration levels (non, 20 and 25 days, were exposed to accelerated ageing, based on the results of preliminary experiments) and salinity (non, 3 and 6 (Pm). The experiment was repeated in the greenhouse in pots. The results indicated that increasing the levels of deterioration and salinity lead to decreasing seedling root and shoot length, germination percentage and rate, emergance percentage and seedling stablishment and increasing abnormal seedlings percentage, in all genotypes. But the responses were different between the types and genotypes. The genotypes belonged to Desi type as compared to the genotypes from Kaboli type, showed better field performance. In addition, Kaka (Desi) and line-l2-60-31 (Kaboli) indicated higher seed emergance percentages than other genotypes. lt seems that measurement of seedling length in laboratory as an indirect vigour test, could be an efficient indicator of the ability of seedlings for emergence and establishment in field.

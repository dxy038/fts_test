Control is traditionally applied using periodic sensing and actuation. In some applications, it is beneficial to use instead event based control, to communicate or make a change only when necessary. There are no known general closed form solutions to such event based control problems. We consider stationary event-based control problems with mixed continuous/discrete time dynamics and stochastic disturbances. The system is modelled by a set of path constraints, which are converted into constraints on trajectoriesÂ´ moments up to some order N; upper and lower bounds on the control objective for any system that meets the constraints are derived using sum-of-squares techniques and convex semidefinite programming. Joint optimization of upper bound and controller parameters is non-convex in general; approaches to such controller optimization are investigated, including local optimization using bilinear matrix inequalities. Examples show that the bounds are significantly tighter than earlier results obtained using quadratic value functions.

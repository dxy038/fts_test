The development of information and communication technology has lead to the reorganisation of work methods and processes. More and more tasks are accomplished in a collaborative way by geographically distributed teams. These new working methods require proper training and appropriate skills, especially the ability to work in virtual environments. NETPRO (Network Based Project Learning in Engineering Education) is a European pilot project that addresses these issues. Its objective is to elaborate an innovative network based project learning model for engineering education and to develop web-based tools for implementing and supporting this pedagogy. This paper discusses some features of project-based pedagogy and proposes a model of a project-based learning management system.

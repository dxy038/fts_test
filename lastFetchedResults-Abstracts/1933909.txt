Considering the interest in avian semen processing and storage, the objective of this study was to identify the domestic fowl seminal plasma proteins using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry MS/MS. For three times in a 4-month period, seminal plasma was obtained from semen collected from four local male chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and prepared for two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A total of 83 spots were detected across all gels and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF. Among these spots, 17 have been successfully identified. The most intensely stained spots were recognized as serum albumin, ovotransferrin, alpha-enolase, fatty acid binding protein, thioredoxin, trypsin inhibitor CITI-1 and gallinacin-9. From these proteins, two are characteristic of avian seminal plasma, the ovotransferrin and gallinacin-9, and one is specific of the Gallus species, the chicken trypsin inhibitor CITI-1.

Web Search Engines have become a resource pool for the people to gain information. They always aim at achieving the goal of delivering relevant information to the users. Due to the exponential growth of information and imprecise queries, Search engines could not meet the user´s information requirements. Users have to reframe their queries until they get their desired information. Also results are not listed based on the users search context. Personalization is re-ordering of the search results that satisfies the needs of the user. This paper presents an approach to capture the user´s preferences in order to provide query suggestions. Web search personalization using collaborative filtering adapts a generic search engine for the needs of a community of users. The main objective of this work is to improve the retrieval of information by expanding the user query and to rank the result list based on the users domain of interest.

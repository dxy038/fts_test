The aggregation and sedimentation of nanoparticles in nanofluid have significant influences on the stability and applicability of nanofluids. The objective of this study is to propose a model to predict the nanoparticles’ aggregation and sedimentation characteristics. The characteristics are evaluated by the concentration of nanoparticles in nanofluid at different time. The concentration of nanoparticles can be calculated according to the speed and location of each nanoparticle. Then, the speed and location of each nanoparticle can be yielded when the forces on each nanoparticle are determined. For the forces on nanoparticles are related to the space structure of nanoparticle clusters, the clusters’ space structures are simulated. Case study shows that the mean deviation of predicted nanoparticle concentration from experimental data for Fullerence + H2O, Fullerence + Oil and CuO + Oil nanofluids are 25%, 16% and 13%, respectively. The model can provide quantitative prediction of the aggregation and sedimentation characteristics of nanoparticles in nanofluid.

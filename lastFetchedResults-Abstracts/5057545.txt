This paper details a Fuzzy-Feedback Linearisation controller applied to a non-linear missile. The design uses an evolutionary algorithm optimisation approach to a multiple model description of the airframe aerodynamics. A set of convex models is produced that map the vertex points in a high order parameter space (of the order of 16 variables). These are used to determine the membership function distribution within the outer loop control system by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This produces a design that meets objectives related to closed loop performance such as: steady state error, overshoot, settling and rising time. The evolutionary algorithm uses non-dominated sorting for forming a Pareto front of possible solutions. This paper shows that fuzzy controllers can be produced for engineering problems, with the multiobjective algorithm allowing the designer the freedom to choose solutions and investigate the properties of the system

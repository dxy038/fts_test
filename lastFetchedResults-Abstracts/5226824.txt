Real power generation dispatch and scheduling become a kind of multi-objective decision problems when fuel costs and emission are needed to be minimized simultaneously. These objectives are usually conflicting. Based on the concept of ideal point, generation dispatch model and generation scheduling model with fuel and emission minimized simultaneously are formulated. It is accomplished by constructing a hyperspace. In the hyperspace, the dimension number of which is that of the goals to be optimized, different coordinates of a space point are of such realistic meanings as costs or emission quantities. Not only the non-commensurable and conflicting problems of different goals could be dealt with, the conclusions also could give us useful insights into the multi-objective real power optimization problems by analyzing the necessary conditions of these models are discussed. These conditions are also helpful when solving these ideal point method models.

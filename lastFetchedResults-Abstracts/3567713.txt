In this paper, a new cross-layer communication protocol for vehicular Internet access along highways is introduced. The objective of the new Controlled Vehicular Internet Access (CVIA) protocol is to increase the end-to-end throughput while achieving fairness in bandwidth usage between road segments. To achieve this goal, the CVIA protocol eliminates contention in relaying packets over long distances. CVIA creates single-hop vehicle clusters and mitigates the hidden node problem by dividing the road into segments and controlling the active time of each segment. Using an analytical throughput estimation model, the protocol parameters are fine-tuned to provide fairness among road segments. Simulation results confirm that the proposed CVIA protocol provides higher throughput and better fairness in multihop data delivery in vehicular networks when compared with purely IEEE 802.11-based protocols

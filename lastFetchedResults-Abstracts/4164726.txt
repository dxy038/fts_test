A magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) inductor design using multiobjective evolution strategy techniques is proposed. Uniformity of the magnetic field and solution sensitivity are the objective functions chosen for the selection of the inductor geometry. After a 3-D finite-element analysis (FEA) of the thermal field, the coupled-field response of the synthesized inductor has been assessed.

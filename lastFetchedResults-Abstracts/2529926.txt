  Objective: One of the most common faulty posture of cervical spine is forward head posture (FHP). According to biomechanical changes in the muscles and ligaments of the neck which are rich source of mechanoreceptors, proprioception possibly impaired in forward head posture. Assessment of neck repositioning angles can be an indicator to assess proprioception of this region .The aim of this study was to investigate cervical proprioception in forward head posture subjects in sagittal plane and compare it with normal subjects.   Materials & Methods: This is a case –control study and subjects were selected simply from student of Iran University of medical science. Eighteen subjects with FHP (mean age 23.18 years) and twenty two normal subjects (mean age 22.72 years) were participated in this study. Photography of sagittal view was done in standing to determine the amount of FHP, craniovertebral angle (CVA) was calculated and the angle less than 49 degree was considered as FHP. Reposition error of target angle (50% range of motion) and neutral angle in sagittal plane with close eyes in sitting posture was evaluated with motion analysis system. Absolute and constant error of repositioning were obtained and analyzed.   Results: Absolute error did not show significant difference between two groups (P>0.05) but constant error of neutral angle when return from forward flexion showed significant difference between two groups (P<0.05). Also a significant correlation was found between body mass index(BMI) and CVA .This means that increase in BMI could be decrease CVA (P<0.05). Conclusions: Results of this study indicated that subjects with FHP had more repositioning error in some cervical movements related to the healthy individuals.

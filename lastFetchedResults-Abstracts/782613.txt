The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of selected immunological,
oxidative stress marker and antioxidants in CSF of Ossimi sheep with listerial
meningoencephalitis. Tentative diagnosis was based on case history, clinical findings and
confirmed by results of CSF analysis as well as isolation and identification of Listeria monocytogenes
from CSF and brain tissues. Based on response to treatment and clinical outcomes,
sheep were categorized responsive and nonresponsive groups. Encephalitic listeriosis was
documented in 21 out of 40 sheep with nervous manifestations. CSF analysis revealed a
significant increase (p < 0.05) of cytological parameters, creatine kinase (CK), total protein,
albumin, albumin quotient (Q), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase
(CAT) and interleukin1  (IL-1 ) in nonresponsive compared with responsive group.
Meanwhile, lysozyme, nitric oxide (NO), globulin and activity of reduced glutathione (GSH)
showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05). CK and IL-1  were positively correlated with total
protein (r = 0.46, 0.53), albumin (r = 0.52, 0.78), albumin Q (r = 0.65, 0.66), total nucleated
cell count (TNCC) (r = 0.74, 0.67), polymorphonuclear (r = 0.76, 0.70), mononuclear (r = 0.58,
0.50) cells, but negatively correlated with NO (r = −0.69, −0.64) and lysozyme (r = −0.68,
−0.58) respectively. The results of the present study indicate that CSF analysis for, CK,
NO; lysozyme, IL-1 , MDA, and activities of SOD and reduced GSH have useful prognostic
significance in Ossimi sheep with encephalitic listeriosis.

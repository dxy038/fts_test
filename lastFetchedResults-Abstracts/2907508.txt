This paper presents a speech enhancement technique for signals corrupted by nonstationary acoustic noises. The proposed approach applies the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to the noisy speech signal and obtains a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The main contribution of the proposed procedure is the adoption of the Hurst exponent in the selection of IMFs to reconstruct the speech. This EMD and Hurst-based (EMDH) approach is evaluated in speech enhancement experiments considering environmental acoustic noises with different indices of nonstationarity. The results show that the EMDH improves the segmental signal-to-noise ratio and an overall quality composite measure, encompassing the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). Moreover, the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) measure reinforces the superior performance of EMDH. Finally, the EMDH is also examined in a speaker identification task in noisy conditions. The proposed technique leads to the highest speaker identification rates when compared to the baseline speech enhancement algorithms and also to a multicondition training procedure.

We propose to implement the ARSIS concept to fuse the high spatial content of the two 250 m spectral bands of MODIS into its five 500 m bands using wavelet based multi- resolution analysis. Our objective was to test the effectiveness of this technique to increase the accuracy of snow mapping in mountainous environments. To assess the performance of this approach, we took advantage of the simultaneity between ASTER and MODIS sensors, both on the TERRA platform. With a 15 m spatial resolution, the ASTER sensor provided reference snow maps that were then compared to MODIS derived snow maps. The benefit of the method was assessed through the investigation of various metrics. The enhanced snow map are therefore of great benefit for environmental and hydrological applications in steep terrain.

Objective(s): The purpose of this study is about the preparation and evaluation of nanoparticles composed of thiolated methylated pyridinyl chitosan (TMPC) which are made P.E.C method, for bucal drug delivery of insulin.Materials and Methods: First of all have to synthesize methylated pyridinyl chitosan and then for (TMPC) L-cysteine should be attached to methylated pyridinyl chitosan by the formation amid bounds. After of synthesis the (TMPC) nanoparticles were made and insulin loaded on them. The percentage of entrapment efficiency which was calculated for a nanoparticle which loaded by insulin is about to 91+2.6%.Results: The release of insulin from nanoparticles was studied in vitro in Phosphate buffer solution (PBS) pH 6.8. After 240 minutes 71.3% of insulin released from (TMPC) and after 360 minutes 72.9% of insulin was released. By considering the specifications of nanoparticles which leads us to this result that the Zeta potential is 28.3 mv, poly dispersity index (pdi) is 0.33 and the size of the particles is about to 268 nm.Conclusion: this study suggests that thiolated methylated pyridinyl chitosan can act as a potential enhancer for bucal delivery of insulin.

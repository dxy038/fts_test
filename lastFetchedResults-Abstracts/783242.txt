Background The goal of the study was
to investigate whether women use less lethal methods
in committing suicide than men. A related objective
was to determine whether place of committing suicide
influences method of suicide. Method Data on all
completed suicides occurring in Riverside County
from 1998 to 2001 were derived from original death
certificates obtained from records of the County
Coroner. Descriptive statistics on method and place of
suicide by sex were computed and graphically presented.
Multivariate logistic regression models were
fitted to data on 643 suicide victims to estimate the
unique effects of sex and place of suicide on the three
most common methods observed: firearms, hanging,
and drug poisoning. Results Women were over 73%
less likely to use firearms than men (OR = 0.267,
CI = 0.172, 0.413). There were no sex differentials in
hanging. Female victims were over 4 times more likely
to die from drug poisoning than male victims
(OR = 4.828, CI = 3.047, 7.650). When place of
committing suicide was added to the equation, it was
found that victims killing themselves at home were
over 2.5 times as likely to use firearms as those dying
in outdoor settings (OR = 2.501, CI = 1.078, 6.051).
Persons committing suicide at home were over 3
times more likely to hang themselves than those
killing themselves outdoors or on railway tracks
(CI = 3.118, CI = 1.447, 6.718). Victims committing
suicide at home were also 3 times as likely to use
drugs as those dying outdoors or on railway tracks
(OR = 3.118, CI = 1.242, 7.828). Hotel or motel suicides
were 4.9 times more likely to use drug poisoning
than outdoor or railway suicides (OR = 4.924,
CI = 1.409, 17.206). Conclusions The proposition that
women use less lethal methods of committing suicide
than men was only partially supported by the data. It
appears that the situation is more complex than a
simple dichotomy between more lethal and less lethal
methods. In past research, hanging has been considered
a very lethal method. However, women were just
as likely to hang themselves as men. Furthermore,
firearm use was the second mode of suicide among
women. The overall policy implication of this study is
that suicide prevention efforts should concentrate not
only on dissuading potential suicide victims, but also
limiting access to firearms and promoting responsible
firearm storage practices

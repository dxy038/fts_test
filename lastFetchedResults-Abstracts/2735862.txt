This paper investigates the capability of a Quasi-Newton optimization algorithm, the L-BFGS-B one, to reduce the drawbacks of the direct coupling with FEM models. After a short description of the L-BFGS-B algorithm, the authors have tested it to the TEAM Workshop Problem 25. L-BFGS-B algorithm issues linked to FEM estimation of the objective function have been analyzed. Finally the authors present the results of an electromagnetic device optimal design, using a large number of parameters (47).

Dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) are a relatively new class of antenna that utilizes the radiation
phenomena of dielectric resonators in open space. Since mainly analytical approaches have been applied
to investigate DRA designs, the current DRA forms are limited to simple geometric shapes and highperformance
DRAs with complex shapes have not yet been developed. Topology optimization is capable
of yielding high-performance structures, and has been extensively applied to a variety of structural
optimization problems. Applying it to the task of DRA design may be extremely useful for the design
of high-performance antennas. On the other hand, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method has
been used to numerically evaluate general antenna performance, since it is numerically robust during
time domain analyses and can handle complex models. Thus, the integration of topology optimization
with the FDTD method has the potential to enable innovative designs of advanced antennas that offer
exceptional performance. In this research, we propose a new topology optimization method for the design
of DRAs that aim to operate with enhanced bandwidths, using the FDTD method. First, the concept of
topology optimization is briefly discussed, and a way to integrate topology optimization with the FDTD
method is proposed. Next, design requirements are clarified and the corresponding objective functions
and the optimization problem are formulated. An optimization algorithm is constructed based on these
formulations. Finally, several DRA design examples are presented to confirm the usefulness of the proposed
method. Copyright q 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

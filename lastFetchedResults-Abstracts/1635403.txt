Many structures in the middle-east’s Gulf region are now either reaching the end of their design life or were not constructed according to the specifications. Demolition or maintenance work on such structures results in large amount of concrete rubbles. Recycling concrete wastes will lead to reduction in valuable landfill space and savings in natural resources. The objective of this study is to investigate the strength of concrete made with recycled concrete coarse aggregate. The variables that are considered in the study include the source of the recycled concrete and target concrete strength. The toughness and soundness test results on the recycled coarse aggregate showed higher percentage loss than natural aggregate, but remained within the acceptable limits. The compressive and splitting tensile strengths of concrete made with recycled coarse aggregate depend on the mix proportions. In general, the strength of recycled concrete can be 10–25% lower than that of conventional concrete made with natural coarse aggregate.

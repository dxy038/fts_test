This paper proposes a fuzzy bi-objective unit commitment optimization model considering source-grid-load interactions. On the one hand, the model combines economic objective and environmental objective reasonably, and it can deal with bi-objective optimization both with priority and without priority. On the other hand, the model takes the interactions between supply side and demand side of power system into account. Besides, we solve the optimization by a new approach, modified Particle Swarm Optimization employing Crossover and Mutation operators in Genetic Algorithm. Results of our research show that this model has the ability to balance economic benefits and environmental benefits. In addition, it is proven that source-grid-load interactions are of evident significance to make power system operation more environment-friendly, and the interactions may also have economic advantages during the peak-load period. This model can take advantage of demand side resources effectively to reduce emission and cost of power system.

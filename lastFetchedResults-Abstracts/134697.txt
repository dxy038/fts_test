Background and aim: Tinea faciei is an uncommon fungal infection, which infects glabrous skin of the face. All species of dermatophytes can produce this disease. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of various dermatophyte species that produce tinea faciei and frequency of correct primary diagnosis in this disease in patients referred to Razi Hospital in Tehran.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 22 patients with tinea faciei referred to Razi Hospital from April 2004 to March 2005 were evaluated considering species of dermatophyte and the accuracy of primary diagnosis.
Results: The most common species was Trichophyton tonsurans that was the causative agent in 10 patients. Fifteen patients had been admitted in other centers before coming to Razi Hospital and in 86% of them tinea faciei had been misdiagnosed.
Conclusion: Clinical presentation of tinea faciei may be atypical in many cases and can lead to incorrect diagnosis. Therefore tinea faciei should be considered as a differential diagnosis in any localized erythematous lesion on the face.

The paper describes a platform support environment layer proposed by the TMN Computing Platform Special Interest Group (RACE programme) whose main objective is to provide enough support for the contrasting TMN management applications. The paper also discusses the IDEA project proposed by the PRISM Laboratory. It has developed a platform support environment for network management systems. To finish, the authors show the IDEA platform support environment and its relationship with this general TMN computing platform architecture. The important services supported by both the implementation developed by the IDEA project and the CPSIG architecture are identified and discussed

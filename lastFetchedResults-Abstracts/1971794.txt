Consumers perceive packaged drinking water, usually distributed as bottled or in polyethylene packages (sachets), as healthier and safer alternatives to tap water. The objective of this study was to determine the microbiological quality of different types of packaged drinking water available in Accra, Ghana. Sixty samples of sachet water and ten of (PET) bottled water were randomly purchased from various locations in Accra. Bacteriological and parasitological analyses of the packaged (sachet and bottled) and tap water (as control) were done according to standard procedures.

two out of 60 sachet water samples (86.7%) had HPC levels well above the internationally recommended limits. For the bottled water, nine out of the ten (90%) were within the recommended limits for HPC. Two out of the five (40%) tap water samples (control samples) had HPC above the recommended limits of 500Â cfu/mL. While none of the bottled water samples showed the presence of protozoa, two out of the five tap water and 31 out of the 60 sachet water samples had a wide range of protozoa including rotifers. The findings clearly indicate that while PET bottled water sold in Accra may be generally safe, the same cannot be said for the sachet water; since the study found its microbiological quality not significantly different from tap water.

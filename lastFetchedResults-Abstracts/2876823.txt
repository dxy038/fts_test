This paper deals with the Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem with Setup Times (UPMSPST). The objective is to minimize the makespan. In order to solve it, we propose a heuristic algorithm, based on Iterated Local Search (ILS), Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) and Path Relinking (PR). In this algorithm, named AIRP, an initial solution is constructed using the Adaptive Shortest Processing Time method. This solution is refined by the ILS, having an adaptation of the VND as local search method. The PR method is applied as a strategy of intensification and diversification during the search. The algorithm was tested in instances of the literature envolving up to 150 jobs and 20 machines. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms an algorithm from the literature, both in terms of quality and variability of the final solution. In addition, the algorithm established new best solutions for more than 80,5% of the test problems in average.

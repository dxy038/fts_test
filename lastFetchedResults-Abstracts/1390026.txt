A subset of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells of bone marrow origin is elevated in humans with solid cancers before treatment and declines with therapy. This biomarker of angiogenesis is not specific to tumor type and has great potential in the objective assessment of treatment response in clinical trials. This pilot study was designed to develop a biomarker of neoangiogenesis in dogs for the diagnosis of cancer, the measurement of treatment response, and the provision of objective data in clinical trials. Polychromatic flow cytometry was used to quantify two subsets of circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in dogs with spontaneous solid tumors before (n = 8) and after (n = 3) treatment, and normal controls (n = 6).

giogenic peripheral blood cells of bone marrow origin were detected in all eight cases and the six normal controls; however, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Interestingly, an apparent decline in pro-angiogenic cells was observed after treatment. Bone marrow derived hematopoietic cells appear to contribute to tumor angiogenesis in dogs, as has been previously reported in humans. While the methodology for pro-angiogenic cell quantification in a small number of dogs in the current study did not result in a significant difference from normal controls, an optimized canine polychromatic flow cytometry protocol holds great promise in the development of a canine cancer model and for the objective measurements of treatment response in clinical trials.

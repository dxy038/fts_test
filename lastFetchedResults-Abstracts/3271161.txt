Power systems performability evaluation becomes a very important task. Because the problem is complex we propose a performance-dependability model, taking in account the power system together with its protections and automations. We propose, for the fault-tolerant power system performability analysis, a complex Markov reward model. We take in account to save the operational state of the system and we combine dependability and safety measures. The paper implements the Stochastic Petri Nets and Fuzzy Logic in power system performability model. The fuzzy sets are used for safety analysis of the electric power protection/automation system. The Markov model uses an instantaneous reward (IR) which depends of the fuzzy Safety Transition (ST), due to the electric-power protection/automation system action. The performability comparative study is presented for a fault tolerant electrical power isolated system (EP). The purpose of the paper is to compute the performability measures with respect of the energy saving. To minimize the energy loss cost, due to system defaults is a main objective.

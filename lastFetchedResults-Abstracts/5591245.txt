This paper presents an approach to solve dynamic scheduling of multi-task for hybrid flow-shop with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption. The idea of idle time window (ITW) is introduced, then the dynamic updating rules of the sets of ITWs are explained in detail. With the sets of ITWs of machines as constraints, the mathematical model is proposed for dynamic scheduling of multi-task for hybrid flowshop with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to solve this problem. The results of simulation indicate that this approach satisfies the demand of dynamic scheduling of multitask with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption.

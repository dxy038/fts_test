Background: There is a strong evidence that genetic as well as environmental factors affect the
age of onset, severity and lifetime risk of developing periodontitis. The objective of the present
study was to compare and to evaluate the association between interleukin (IL)-1?(-889) and gene
polymorphisms in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis, chronic periodontitis and
healthy controls.
Materials and Methods: A total of 60 Indian patients, with 20 aggressive periodontitis, 20 chronic
periodontitis and 20 healthy controls were recruited for this study. From each patient, a volume
of 2 ml of blood was collected by venipuncture in the ante-cubital fossa and was stored in sodium
EDTA vacutainers and was used for genotyping assays with the polymerase chain reaction restriction
fragment length polymorphism technique. Clinical parameters such as oral hygiene index, gingival
index and clinical attachment loss (CAL) were evaluated for each patient. Genotype distribution
between different groups were analyzed using Chi-square test. A P = 0.05 or less was set for
signifi cance.
Results: The mean oral hygiene index was 3.7 ± 0.86 and 3.25 ± 0.30 for chronic and aggressive
periodontitis cases respectively. The CAL was 4.29 ± 0.63 mm for chronic periodontitis and
6.44 ± 0.57 mm for aggressive periodontitis. Homozygous genotype 2,2 was more predominant in
cases of aggressive periodontitis whereas in chronic periodontitis, heterozygous genotype 1,2 was
more predominant when compared with others (P  <  0.001). Odds ratio for aggressive versus
chronic periodontitis was calculated as 6.2 (95% confi dence interval 6.019-7.892).
Conclusion: The results of the present study support a positive association between aggressive
periodontitis and the presence of the IL-1?-889, allele 2 polymorphism in Indian patients.

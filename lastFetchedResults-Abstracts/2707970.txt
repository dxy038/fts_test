Independent component analysis (ICA) has been recently applied into hyperspectral unmixing as a result of its low computation time and its ability to perform without prior information. However, when applying ICA for hyperspectral unmixing, the independence assumption in the ICA model conflicts with the abundance sum-to-one constraint and the abundance nonnegative constraint in the linear mixture model, which affects the hyperspectral unmixing accuracy. In this paper, we consider an abundance matrix composed of Np-dimensional variables, and we propose a new hyperspectral unmixing approach with an abundance characteristic-based ICA model. Two characteristics of the abundance variables are explored, and the model is constructed by these characteristics. A corresponding gradient descent algorithm is also proposed to solve the proposed objective function. Both the synthetic and real experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the other state-of-the-art methods in abundance and endmember extraction.

Despite the huge popularity of peer-to-peer distribution and yet again growing interest towards superdistribution, there is no consensus among researchers regarding the appropriate definition of superdistribution or its different types. There is a similar lack of consistence in the definition of the relation between superdistribution and peer-to-peer distribution. The objective of this paper is to develop a classification system for superdistribution that is useful to researchers from various disciplinary perspectives and takes into account the different ways how superdistribution can be realized. We also present some statistics about general acceptance of superdistribution as a distribution method for commercial and user-created content.

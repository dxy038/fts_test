The fusion of multi-source remote sensing images can utilize the multi-source information and obtain richer and more objective information compared with the single source image data. ALOS is a new source of high-resolution satellite data, hence research on the practical methods for ALOS data fusion has great significance in prompting the ALOS data application. Based on the features of ALOS data, some common fusion algorithms are experimented and compared. Results of different fusion methods are analyzed in terms of spatial resolution enhancement and spectral information maintenance. As far as the fusion of AVNIR_4, 3, 2 multi-spectral and PRISM_PAN bands selected are concerned, the experiments show that the Brovey method has the advantage over other fusion methods in the aspect of visual representation and identifying precision.

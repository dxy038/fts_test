Background: Moringa peregrina (Forssk.) Fiori. is a small tree, which grows in south east of Iran. The shoot and root of M. peregrina contain volatile oil which has several isothiocyanates. 
Objective: To study the effect of salinity on volatile constituents of root and shoot of 
M. peregrina.
Methods: The experiment was conducted on randomized complete blocks design (RCBD) with 8 treatments and 3 replications. The treatments were consist of control, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 dS/m. The volatile constituents were determined by GC and GC/MS. 
Results: The results showed that the main constituent of volatile oil in control treatment was 
1,2â€“benzendicarboxylic acid, bis (2-methyl propyl) (29.02%) which decreased with increasing salinity. In salinity treatments, the isothiocyanates compounds such as isobutylisothiocyanate and 2-isothiocyanatepropan were increased. In control level of salinity, the main compound of root volatile oil was thiocyanic acid phenylmethyl ester (29.6%) but was not found in the salinity treatment. The content of isothiocyanates in the shoot increased with increasing salinity up to 4dS/m. 
Conclusion: The level of salinity had significant effect on volatile oil content and component of M. peregrina.

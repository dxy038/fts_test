This paper presents a study of extended learning mechanisms for KoskoÂ´s bidirectional associative memory-a classical artificial neural network with applications to, for example, pattern recognition and image processing. The incorporation of sigma-pi (&#931;&#928;)-units instead of the conventional &#931;-units in the BAM is considered leading to the &#931;&#928;-BAM. A Hebbian learning algorithm for &#931;&#928;-units is proposed and simulation results are given, indicating the increased performance of the &#931;&#928;-BAM as a pattern association device

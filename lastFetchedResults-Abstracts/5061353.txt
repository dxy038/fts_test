We consider the offline version of the impairment-aware routing and wavelength assignment (IA-RWA) problem in transparent all-optical networks as a cross layer optimization problem. In optical networks and in the absence of regenerators, optical signal quality degrades due to physical layer impairments. We initially present an algorithm for solving the RWA problem based on an LP relaxation formulation that has acceptable integrality performance. To account for signal degradation due to physical layer impairments we extend our RWA formulation and constrain the interference among lightpaths using noise variance related parameters. The objective of the resulting optimization problem is not only to serve the connection requests by minimizing the number of utilized wavelengths, but also to select lightpaths that have acceptable physical layer performance.

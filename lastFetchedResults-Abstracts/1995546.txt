Electron beam (e-beam) irradiation is an effective non-thermal processing step for the reduction of Salmonella in peanut butter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of e-beam irradiation on quality indicators of peanut butter. Peanut butter samples were exposed to a range of e-beam doses and examined over a 14-day period at 22 °C. Colour analysis (L∗, a∗, b∗), spreadability, peroxide values (PV) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances test (TBARS) for lipid oxidation were monitored, fatty acid and amino acid profiles were verified and protein degradation was determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Changes in colour, PV, and TBARS were observed as e-beam dose increased. No significant changes in spreadability were observed (P &gt; 0.05). When applied to peanut butter, e-beam irradiation will produce significant changes in quality indicators; future studies should include sensory evaluation and consumer acceptance studies.

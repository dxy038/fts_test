Hospitals use very costly medical equipment like scanners, RMI, endoscopy equipment or operating rooms. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer model to schedule patients on different hospital resources they can need during their stay in a hospital. We study the case of multiple types of resources and for each type the existence of several parallel units. The objective is to minimize the sum of all patientsÂ´ stays. We used LINGO11 solver, along with our mathematical formulation, to solve the problem. The results showed that, as expected for an NP-hard problem, the computational times rise exponentially with the size of the instances.

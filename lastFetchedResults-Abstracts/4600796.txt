In this modern era, independent mobility for blind and partially sighted people is an important objective to achieve. There are many assistive way to help visually impaired people namely, Guide Dog, White Cane as well as the tactile paving which is a very common assistive tool throughout the world, support the visually disable person walk in the correct path from one place to another. Therefore, RFID technology is introduced in this project to support the visual disable people more efficiently in outdoor activities. The system has been developed based on the integration of RFID wireless technology and voice system which assembled on the traditional white cane in order to help the visual impairment to identify the surrounding landmark via verbal notification. The tactile detection by RFID system composed by RFID system integrated on traditional white cane and RFID TAG which installed on the tactile paving where the TAG stored unique information uses to navigate/notify the user once they scan/tap the tactile paving by the designed white cane. The proposed RFID integrated white cane is successfully designed and evaluated the range of RFID tag which can be detected.

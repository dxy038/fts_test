Objective: To determine with meta-analysis the effects of nursing-delivered smoking cessation interventions. Results: Fifteen studies comparing nursing intervention with a control or usual care found intervention to significantly increase the odds of smoking cessation. There was heterogeneity among the study results, but pooling by using a random effects model did not alter the estimate of effect. There was no evidence from indirect comparison that interventions classified as intensive had a larger effect than less intensive ones. There was evidence that interventions were more effective for hospital inpatients with cardiovascular disease than for inpatients with other conditions. Interventions in nonhospitalized patients also showed evidence of efficacy. Nurse counseling on smoking cessation during a screening health check was likely to have less effect. The results indicate the potential benefits of smoking cessation advice and counseling given by nurses to their patients, with reasonable evidence that intervention can be effective.

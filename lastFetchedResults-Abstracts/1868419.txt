Kuhn’s world change claim has some problems; whether this change is an objective change (change in the world itself) or a subjective one (change in the mind)? Does objective ‘world change’ conform to the stability of sense stimulus? Whether subjective change is compatible with the incommensurability of perceptions of rival paradigms? Kuhn through his Darwinian- Kantian framework argues for the priori conditions of world perceiving and changing. As we will see, these conditions are the taxonomic structure of paradigms. We will argue that Kuhn can speak of the change of world itself in a commonsensical manner.

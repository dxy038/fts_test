In order for the transference of the tools provided by a research center to be successful, two things must be accomplished, one by the research centers and the other by the product groups. First, the research centers must provide their results in terms of products in time for the projects of the product groups (i.e., they must be in line with project plans of product divisions). Second, this objective cannot be reached by the research centers alone. The transfer of the results has to happen between the research centers and the product divisions. Close cooperation is required; overall plans and schedules must be established between research centers and product groups

This paper gives a brief introduction to noise development in switched reluctance machines (SRMs) and presents psychoacoustic quantities that allow an objective evaluation of their sound quality by taking into account the characteristics of the human hearing system. The relevance of these quantities is determined by listening tests and statistical analyses. The goal of this work is to demonstrate that a successful acoustic optimization of a SRM should be performed based on both technical and psychoacoustic know-how

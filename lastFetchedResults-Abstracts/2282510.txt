One of the problems that the researchers of geomorphology, hydrology, agriculture, etc. encounter with is to estimate the rate of sediment in water systems, whose rate can impose high degrees of damage to hydraulic structures such as dams. The objective of the present study is to investigate the degree of erosion and the factors affecting it, and to compare the two models of CORINE and SLEMSA in Tang-e-Sorkh Basin of Shiraz. For this purpose, maps and values of the main parameters of SLEMSA model including topographical data (topographic map and slope map), rain erosion and soil erosion (geological map) and vegetation (land use map) were collected and the rate of erosion, erosion canons and the most important factors in this model were evaluated using the ARC MAP software program (raster calculator function). Then by calculating the main parameters of CORINE model such as erodibility (depth & texture of soil and stoniness), and erosion generator map (Fournier & aridity index), the slope and vegetation maps of the studied area were classified. Comparing these two models shows that CORINE model offers more details and is more accurate. Furthermore, it indicates that the slope is the most important factor in increasing the rate of erosion in the watershed.

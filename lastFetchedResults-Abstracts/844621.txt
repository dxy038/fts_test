The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamical behavior of a family of two-dimensional
nonlinear maps associated to an economic model. Our objective is to measure the
complexity of the system using techniques of symbolic dynamics in order to compute
the topological entropy. The analysis of the variation of this important topological invariant
with the parameters of the system, allows us to distinguish different chaotic scenarios.
Finally, we use a another topological invariant to distinguish isentropic dynamics and
we exhibit numerical results about maps with the same topological entropy. This work
provides an illustration of how our understanding of higher dimensional economic models
can be enhanced by the theory of dynamical systems.

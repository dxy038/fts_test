The main objective of this paper is to provide a flexible three-phase power flow formulation to consider the different structures for PQ loads. A set of equations, based on the current injection method are derived. Additional equations for representing PV machines with their reactive power limits are also considered. The resulting set of nonlinear equations presents a compact formulation where only voltages in rectangular co-ordinates of the symmetrical components are treated as unknowns in a full Newton method. The convergence and robustness of this method has been checked in large systems

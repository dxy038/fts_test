Objective
m of the present study was to evaluate the effect of CO2 laser irradiation (10.6 μm) at 0.3 J/cm2 (0.5 μs; 226 Hz) on the resistance of softened enamel to toothbrushing abrasion, in vitro.
s
human enamel samples were obtained, polished with silicon carbide papers and randomly divided into five groups (n = 12), receiving 5 different surface treatments: laser irradiation (L), fluoride (AmF/NaF gel) application (F), laser prior to fluoride (LF), fluoride prior to laser (FL), non-treated control (C). After surface treatment they were submitted to a 25-day erosive-abrasive cycle in 100 ml sprite light (90 s) and brushed twice daily with an electric toothbrush. Between the demineralization periods samples were immersed in supersaturated mineral solution. At the end of the experiments enamel surface loss was determined using a contact profilometer and morphological analysis was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For SEM analysis of demineralization pattern, cross-sectional cuts of cycled samples were prepared. The data were statistically analysed by one-way ANOVA model with subsequent pairwise comparison of treatments.
s
ve surface loss was significantly lower in all laser groups compared to both control and fluoride groups (p &lt; 0.0001 in all cases). Amongst the laser groups no significant difference was observed. Softened enamel layer underneath lesions was less pronounced in laser-irradiated samples.
sion
ation of dental enamel with a CO2 laser at 0.3 J/cm2 (5 μs, 226 Hz) either alone or in combination with amine fluoride gel significantly decreases toothbrushing abrasion of softened-enamel, in vitro.

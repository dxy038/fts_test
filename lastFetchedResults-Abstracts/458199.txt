The objective of this paper is to present a simulation model for controlling combustion phasing in order to avoid knock in turbocharged SI engines. An empirically based knock integral model was integrated in a quasi -dimensional simulation tool. The empirical knock model was optimized and validated against engine tests. This model can be used to optimize control strategy of combustion initiation in SI engine to reach the maximum berak turque. The model is able to predict knock onset with an accuracy of 2 crank angle degrees. With the established knock model, it is possible not only to investigate whether knock is observed by changing operating and design parameters, but also to evaluate their effects on knock intensity.

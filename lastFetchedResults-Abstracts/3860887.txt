We demonstrate 60-GHz band bidirectional radio-on-fiber (RoF) links based on InP-InGaAs heterojunction phototransistor (HPT) optoelectronic mixers. They employ remote up/down conversion scheme with optical local oscillator signals distributed from the central office and intermediate frequency (IF) fiber transmission for both up- and down-links. Since frequency up/down conversions and photodetection are carried out by a single HPT optoelectronic mixer, base station architecture is greatly simplified. In order to validate its feasibility, both up- and down-link RoF transmissions of 16 quadrature amplitude modulator data are successfully demonstrated at 60-GHz band using 1.25-GHz IF for down-link and 2.0-GHz IF for up-link.

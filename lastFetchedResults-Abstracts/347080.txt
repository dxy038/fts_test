Objective: From EEG studies, it is known that structural brain lesions are accompanied by abnormal rhythmic electric activity. With the better spatial resolution of MEG, MEG dipole analysis can extend the knowledge based on EEG power spectra. This study presents the first results of a completely automatic analysis method applied to spontaneous MEG.
Methods: Spontaneous MEG data of 5 patients with cerebral brain tumors and 4 controls were collected using a whole-head MEG system. Signals were bandpass-filtered with cut-off frequencies according to standard EEG bands. A moving dipole model was fitted to samples with at least twice the average sample power. Dipoles explaining 90% or more of the magnetic variance were projected onto a matched MR scan.
Results: In controls, dipole distributions are symmetrical with respect to the mid-sagittal plane whereas distributions in patients often are asymmetrical to it. Dipoles describing gamma activity were located contralateral, and dipoles describing delta and theta activity were located ipsilateral to lesions.
Conclusions: The automatic method gives plausible 3-dimensional information about generator foci of abnormal slow waves and other rhythms with respect to lesion foci and thereby adds physiological knowledge to that derived from EEG power spectra.

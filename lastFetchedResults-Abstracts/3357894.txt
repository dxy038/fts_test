This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the make-up examination arrangement problem. The objective of make-up examination arrangement to minimize the number of classrooms is analyzed, and a greedy algorithm and an original mutation operator are devised to achieve this goal. This new operator, combined with a crossover and a local search operator which are used to minimize the number of timeslots, leads to a very powerful genetic algorithm. Experiment shows that the solutions of this hybrid genetic algorithm are of excellent quality, providing a theoretical foundation for the practical application.

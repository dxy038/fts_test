To improve the performance of electric machinery, it is necessary to obtain the optimal topology of
a structure in magnetic "elds. The homogenization design method is applied to obtain the optimal topology.
In the method, the change of inner hole size and rotational angle of unit cell determines the optimal material
distribution in a design domain and this distribution de"nes an optimal topology. The objective function is
de"ned as maximizing magnetic mean compliance (MMC). This is the same as maximizing magnetic vector
potential and e!ective to improve the performance of electomagnet. The analysis and optimization is
performed based on three-dimensional hexahedral elements. This design method is applied to the H-shaped
electromagnet (H-magnet)

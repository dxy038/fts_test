Objective.
We evaluate the 6-month efficacy of Keep Active Minnesota, a phone- and mail-based physical activity maintenance intervention designed for use with adults age 50 to 70 years who have increased their physical activity within the past year.
Method.

Participants (N = 1049) recruited in 2004 and 2005 from one large managed-care organization in Minnesota were randomly assigned to either treatment (N = 523) or usual care (N = 526) with physical activity assessed using the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors questionnaire, and expressed as kcal/week expenditures.
Results.

Total physical activity at baseline was similar for treatment and usual care participants (p < 0.44) as was moderate/vigorous physical activity (p < 0.21). Maintenance of physical activity was higher among treatment participants whose mean 6-month change in total kcal/week energy expenditure was − 91, compared to − 683 for usual care participants (p < 0.002). Mean 6-month change in kcal/week expenditure in moderate or vigorous activities was − 49 for treatment participants, compared to − 612 for usual care participants (p < 0.001).
Conclusions.

This phone- and mail-based physical activity maintenance intervention is efficacious at maintaining physical activity at 6 months.

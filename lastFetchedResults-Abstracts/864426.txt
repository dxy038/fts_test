Several environmentally relevant contaminants are characterized as xenoestrogens by virtue of their ability to induce responses similar to 17β-estradiol (E2). There is concern that exposure to these xenoestrogens may result in endocrine and, thus, reproductive disruption. The objective of the present research was to determine whether xenobiotics known to elicit estrogenic responses in mammals were estrogenic in channel catfish, and if these compounds were capable of altering normal physiological response to E2. Sexually immature catfish were exposed by intraperitoneal injection to E2, suspected xenoestrogens or combination doses of E2 and xenoestrogen. Appearance of vitellogenin (Vg) in serum was used as the bioindicator of estrogenicity; Vg was measured by ELISA 7 days after injection. The ED50 of E2 for the appearance of Vg in blood, 0.6 mg/kg, was used as the positive control. Synthetic estrogens, ethinylestradiol, mestranol and DES were effective in inducing Vg; the antiestrogen tamoxifen inhibited response to E2 when given in a combination dose. Treatment by both methoxychlor and p-nonylphenol resulted in Vg appearance in serum; the doses required were 300 times that of E2, and the vitellogenic response was less when compared to the E2-induced response. In addition, a combination dose of methoxychlor with E2 decreased the magnitude of the response to E2. Other mammalian xenoestrogens, o,p′-DDT, chlordecone, lindane and β-HCH, were not able to produce a vitellogenic response in this study.

The selection of measurement configurations in robot calibration is investigated. Condition number of the robot error propagation matrix was achieved through singular value decomposition, using the condition number as the optimization objective function, a set of robot measurement configurations were selected with Solis&amp;Wets algorithm, so that the effect of the measurement and modeling errors in parameter estimation can be minimized. Experiment results show that its calibration effect is superior to those of the random selection calibration configurations.

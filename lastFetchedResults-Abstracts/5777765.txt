This paper considers an optimization of weight factors in a multi-objective circuit design problem. The procedure is based on formulating the problem as a multi-objective geometric program (MOGP). Generally, solving the problem via GP requires multiple objectives be combined into a scalar objective by weighing the individual objectives with arbitrary, fixed weight factors. On the contrary, this paper considers weight factors as optimization variables as well. As a result, the achieved solution becomes closer to the ideal multi-objective optimum than the fixed-weight MOGP.

Under the background of China, the civil servant competency is of the characteristic of fuzziness and itÂ´s hard to quantify. In response to this situation, this paper based on fuzzy linguistic assessment scale gives the corresponding expression formula of triangular fuzzy numbers, assembles different programs with the generalized GIOWA and calculates the evaluation results. The paper calculates of 6 characteristics. This model provides an objective basis for the selection, assessment and training of civil servants in government-related bodies. Finally the paper verify the evaluation algorithm by means of analyzing practical cases.

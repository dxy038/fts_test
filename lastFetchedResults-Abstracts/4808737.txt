An XML-based language for simulation components (XLSC) is presented in this paper. The language is designed in a way that the resulting components comply with the DEVS formalism. The objective is to model the static structure of a component as well as its behavior (dynamic structure). For execution of XLSC, an interpreter is prototypically implemented in Java. The use of XLSC enables components to be exchangeable and to be used with any DEVS simulator regardless of its implementation language. Thereby, the interpreter acts as an interface between the model and the simulator as it can directly execute the componentÂ´s functions.

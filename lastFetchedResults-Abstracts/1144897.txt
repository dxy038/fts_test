It has been increasingly realised that traditional parameters, such as A-weighted sound levels, sound power and noise spectra in octaves or third octaves are not enough to describe a sound and that machine labels should show more subjective information about the emitted noise. A new labelling system based on empirical data is proposed. The methodology of the study used as the basis for the proposal is explained, as well as the objective and subjective characteristics to be included in the new label. The uses and applications of the label are discussed briefly.

The objective of this paper is to estimate the photovoltaic energy on inclined panels for a given site. Its characterization is based on measurements carried out on horizontal plane. A comparison of different models of the diffused radiation released with respect to the monthly and annual energy balance is presented. An optimization of the inclination angle (tilt angle) by maximizing the annual photovoltaic energy is proposed. At the end of this study, energy efficiency of different solar tracking systems is also analyzed.

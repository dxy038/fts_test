The objective of this paper is to introduce a new mutation operator characterised by its non-uniformness. The operator has been used in the parameter optimisation of the controllers of a supply ship. Four different kinds of controllers have been considered and optimised, providing a wide range of optimisation problems with their own unique search spaces to test the mutation operator.

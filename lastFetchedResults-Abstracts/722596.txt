Analogues of the natural antibiotic thiolactomycin, with acetylene-based side chains, have the highest recorded in vitro inhibitory activity against the recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Î²-ketoacyl-ACP synthase mtFabH condensing enzyme. In particular, 5-[3-(4-acetyl-phenyl)-prop-2-ynyl]-4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-5H-thiophen-2-one exhibited more than an 18-fold increased potency, compared to thiolactomycin, against this key condensing enzyme, involved in M. tuberculosis mycolic acid biosynthesis. Analogues of the antibiotic thiolactomycin, with acetylene-based side chains, have the highest recorded activity against cloned mtFabH condensing enzyme.

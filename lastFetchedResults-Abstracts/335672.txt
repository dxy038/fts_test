Aim:  The objective of this study is to analyze the complication rates after the completion thyroidectomy and compare them with primary total thyroidectomy.

Methods: The outcomes of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who were operated over a period of eight years were evaluated. One hundred and forty-one patients underwent completion thyroidectomy and 92 patients had primary surgery.

Results: The two groups were comparable in respect of clinical variables. Residual tumor was found in 66 of 141 patients (46.8%) in completion thyroidectomy group. The rate of the two most important complications, permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and permanent hypoparathyroidism were 3.5 and 4.2%, in completion thyroidectomy group, and 3.3 and 4.3%, in primary total thyroidectomy group. The complication rates were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusion: In conclusion, completion thyroidectomy can be done safely in a specialized center with acceptable morbidity.

The objective of this paper is to describe some power quality (PQ) analyses that are better served by monitoring with generic data acquisition systems rather than dedicated PQ analyzers. Measurements which are discussed include harmonics, interharmonics, voltage sags and flicker. Potential problems with clamp-on current transformers and phase-locked loop circuitry commonly employed in PQ analyzers are also discussed

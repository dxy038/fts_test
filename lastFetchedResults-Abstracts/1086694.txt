considered. In this issue, in contrast with other project scheduling, the project availability of needed resources level is considered decision variable and the goal is to find a schedule and resource requirement level. Researches regarding this field are related to optimizing an objective. In this paper, resource investment problem is studied for simultaneous optimization minimizing projectspan and project resource costs. Two multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms, two process sub-population genetic algorithms and multi-population genetic algorithm are proposed to find solutions. According to evaluation criteria, the function of two algorithms is computationally compared and.

Objective
This prospective study investigated the risk of respiratory distress in the patients who were applied nasal packing at the end of nasal surgery; and effects of nasal packing on consciousness level while the patients were awake or asleep, measured by Bispectral Index (BIS).
Methods
The study group consisted of 15 adult patients (10 male, 5 female), who were applied nasal packing at the end of nasal surgery. The control group consisted of 15 adult patients (10 male, 5 female), who received general anesthesia for various reasons. In the study and control groups, BIS index, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, pulse per minute and blood pressure were measured at seven different times.
Results
There was no statistically significant difference between BIS indexes of the study and control groups. In the fourth hour after sleep (AS-4 h), respiratory rate of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group. In the fourth hour after the anesthesia (AA-4 h), oxygen saturation value of the study group was lower than that of the control group.
Conclusion
We conclude that in patients who are applied nasal packing at the end of nasal surgery; at AA-4 h and AS-4 h times, there may be risk of decrease in the oxygen saturation and respiratory rate parameters, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor non-invasive respiratory parameters and to give enriched oxygen by an oral catheter.

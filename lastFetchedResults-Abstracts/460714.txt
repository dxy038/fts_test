Background
QuantiFeron-TB (QIFN) is a whole-blood interferon-;Î³ assay for the recognition of cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
Objectives

To compare the QIFN assay with the tuberculin skin test (TST) in patients with newly diagnosed culture-proven tuberculosis (TB) and healthy volunteers with high or low risk of latent M tuberculosis infection and to identify factors associated with discordance between tests.

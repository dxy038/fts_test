Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a well-known optimization technique originally proposed for solving single-objective, continuous optimization problems. However, PSO has been extended in various ways to handle multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). The scalability of multi-objective PSO algorithms as the number of sub-objectives increases has not been well examined; most observations are for two to four objectives. It has been observed that the performance of multiobjective optimizers for a low number of sub-objectives can not be generalized to problems with higher numbers of sub-objectives. With this in mind, this paper presents a scalability study of three well-known multi-objective PSOs, namely vector evaluated PSO (VEPSO), optimized multi-objective PSO (oMOPSO), and speed-constrained multi-objective PSO (SMPSO) with up to eight sub-objectives. The study indicates that as the number of sub-objectives increases, SMPSO scaled the best, oMOPSO scaled the worst, while VEPSOÂ´s performance was dependent on the knowledge transfer strategy (KTS) employed, with parent centric recombination (PCX) based approaches scaling consistently better.

PROMETHE II is a multicriteria decision aid method based on pairwise comparisons. As a consequence, it cannot reasonably be applied to problems involving a large number of alternatives (such as for instance in combinatorial or continuous multi-objective optimization). The aim of this paper is to present an approach inspired by genetic algorithms that allows to overcome these difficulties. An illustrative example based on financial portfolio management is presented.

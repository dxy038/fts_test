The loss of the objective position information led to low efficiency for cooperative hunting by swarm robotic systems which combined cyclic pursuit strategy, distributed hunting control (DHC) algorithm based on topology was proposed. The algorithm determined the location of the virtual collaborative hunting robot according to the topology of the hunting system, and took full advantage of the position relationship of the hunting robots, then, the trajectory deviation between the invalid hunting robots and adjacent robots was decreased, dynamic circle hunting formation was formed quickly. Simulation results demonstrate the correctness this proposed methods.

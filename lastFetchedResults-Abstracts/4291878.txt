In most wireless sensor network (WSN), energy is a limited resource. Indeed, a sensor has a limited power source (like a battery). When this power source is empty, the sensor stops working. In this paper, we will present the modeling of a multi-objective problem. The first objective is the maximization of the coverage of the area under time, the second objective is the maximization of the lifetime of the network depending on coverage, and finally the minimization of the financial cost (i.e. the number of sensors). The resolution of this problem will be done by multi-objective algorithm NSGA-II [6], SPEA-II [5] and multi-objective ant colony optimization (MOACO) [8].

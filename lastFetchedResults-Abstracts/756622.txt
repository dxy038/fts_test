Objective
To investigate the effectiveness of the strategy of transcatheter occlusion with the Gianturco coil for small-to-moderate sized ductus and with Amplatzer duct occluder (ADO) for large ductus.
Patient and methods

For ductus closure, the following strategy was applied: ADO was used in large ductus: infants and young children weighing < 15 kg with a ductus diameter  greater-than over equal to 3 mm and in older children or adults with a ductus diameter  greater-than over equal to 4 mm and coils were employed in patients with small-to-moderate sized ductus. During a 3-year period, this strategy was applied in 136 patients. The results were compared between 214 patients (group I) undergoing ductus closure using only coil before application of this strategy and strategic closure in 136 patients (group II). Each group was divided into 2 subgroups: subgroup A with large ductus and subgroup B with small-to-moderate ductus. There were 54 patients in subgroup IA, 160 in subgroup IB, 33 in subgroup IIA and 103 in subgroup IIB, respectively.
Results

In group I, PDA occlusion was successful in 207 (96.7%) and failed in 7 (6 of group IA and 1 of group IB). In group II, ductus closure was successful in 134 patients (98.5%) (32/33 with ADO and 102/103 with coils).There was no significant difference in success rate between group I and II. Distal embolization occurred in 19 patients of group I and in 2 of group II, respectively (19/214 vs. 2/136, P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in success rate between group IA and IIA but the distal embolization rate was higher in group IA than IIA (13/54 vs. 1/33, P = 0.014). Left pulmonary artery stenosis was found exclusively in 9 patients of group I at the 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05). Nine patients in group I required second intervention to achieve complete occlusion.
Conclusions

The strategy of ductus closure worked well by reducing embolization rate, incidence of left pulmonary artery stenosis and the need of second intervention.

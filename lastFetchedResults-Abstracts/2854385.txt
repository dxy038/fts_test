In this paper a genetic algorithm based optimal design of a single-phase permanent magnet brushless DC motor (SPMBLDCM) is proposed. This approach employs a genetic algorithm (GA) technique as a search tool for the optimization process of the SPMBLDCM. The specific power of the motor is selected as an objective function. At the end of the optimisation a best solution is proposed based on the values of the optimisation parameters, as well as other important motor parameters. An overall comparison of the best optimal solution and the basic model of the motor is presented.

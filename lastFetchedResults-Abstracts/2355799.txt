Objective(s):MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. They have important roles in kidney development, homeostasis and disease, and participate in the onset and progression of tubulointerstitial sclerosis and end-stage glomerular lesions that occur in various forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present study, we elucidated the role of microRNA 205 (miR-205) in cisplatin-induced renal cell apoptosis and explored the molecular mechanisms.
Materials and Methods:The chronic interstitial nephropathy rat model was induced, and the miRNA expression profile in the kidney cells from rats with CKD was screened. Cisplatin-induced apoptosis in normal renal HK-2 cells was evaluated using flow cytometry, and regulation of miR-205 on target gene was validated using luciferase assay, western blot and real time PCR assays.
Results: We found that miR-205 expression was significantly decreased in the cells from kidney of CKD rat (P<0.01). Our data showed that when miR-205 was overexpressed or silenced using the mimic or inhibitor, the percentages of apoptotic cells were suppressed or increased significantly (P<0.05), respectively. Moreover, we have identified CMTM4 gene, which is involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, as a novel target for miR-205. In addition, miR-205 could inhibit apoptosis by binding to the 3â€™UTR of CMTM4 mRNA and inhibiting its transcriptional activity.
Conclusion: This study elucidated that miR-205 plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis in renal cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to hinder CKD development.

Background: One third of all the hip fractures occur in men. The risk for mortality following hip fracture is higher for men compared to women. The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) showed that the bisphosphonate alendronate reduces the risk of fractures and increases bone mineral density (BMD) in osteoporotic women. Similar effects of alendronate were observed in men in some other trials. There are also results demonstrating alendronate to be cost-effective in the treatment of osteoporosis in women. Objective: To investigate the cost effectiveness of alendronate for male osteoporosis in Sweden by assuming the same relative risk reduction of fractures in men as for women, based on the FIT trial. Design: A Markov model earlier used to analyze cost effectiveness of alendronate in treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Sweden was adapted to fit a cohort of Swedish men. Cost effectiveness of alendronate vs. no treatment was assessed by transitioning men in the model over time between different health states. Time horizon: The patients were followed from start of intervention until 100 years of age or death. In the base-case alendronate was assumed to have a fracture-risk-reducing effect for 10 years; a treatment duration period of 5 years followed by a 5-year period where the effect declined linearly to zero. Results: Taking a societal perspective treating a 71-year-old man (mean age in the FIT) with low BMD and prior vertebral fracture (VFA) with alendronate was found to be associated with a cost of â‚¬14,843 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Conclusions: The results in this study indicate that treating osteoporotic men with alendronate was projected to be cost-effective, under the assumption of the same fracture-risk-reducing effect of alendronate for men as for women.

The Manufacturing Execution Systems Modeling Language (MES-ML) is a graphical modeling language, designed for the requirements engineering and specification of Manufacturing Execution Systems, developed during the project &#8220;SpeziMES&#8221; funded by the BMBF. The project aimed at the creation of an easily comprehensible and usable language to overcome the interdisciplinary challenges during the specification process of MES. As a method of evaluation, a series of interdisciplinary workshops were conducted to verify the real-world applicability of the MES-ML. This paper presents the projectÂ´s final evaluation steps, after the workshops had taken place. The language is evaluated by checking whether objective design principles for visual notations are adhered to and by conducting a series of guided interviews with industrial experts.

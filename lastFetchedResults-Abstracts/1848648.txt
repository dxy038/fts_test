Objective
jective of this study was to retrospectively analyze the value of dynamic half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) imaging in patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT).
als and Methods
five veins in 24 patients were interrogated using a HASTE sequence with the patients relaxed and in various degrees of Valsalva. Veins were analyzed for changes in caliber (+CAL) and signal intensity (+SI) or in their absence (−CAL and −SI, respectively) and compared with the presence of thrombus on gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.
s
was no thrombus in veins with the +CAL, +SI pattern (n=40) (P&lt;.01). Five of seven veins (71.4%) with the −CAL, −SI pattern had thrombus (P&lt;.01). A qualitative change in CAL had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 91% for the presence of thrombus. An increase of 1.5 mm in CAL had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93% for this diagnosis.
sion
c HASTE imaging offers a physiological method to evaluate veins for deep venous thrombosis.

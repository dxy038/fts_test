This paper presented an optimization of switched reluctance motor for higher efficiency. The motor in this study was designed based on the magnetic energy conversion loop according to the power requirements of application system. ItÂ´s found that besides the width of air gap, the stack length and turns of winding influenced the electric and magnetic excitation greatly. Hence, in this study, the stack length, turns of winding and width of air gap were optimized as the design variables, surrogate models including response surface model and kriging model are employed to formulate the objective i.e. the efficiency, in which optimal Latin hypercube sampling and sequential sampling are implemented. Dynamic FEM analysis coupling with external circuit is utilized to conduct computer experiments of the various models. The results demonstrate the capability and potential of this approach in solving the efficiency design of reluctance motors.

This paper has designed an electrical discharge machining numerical control system based on DSP (Digital Signal Processor). By the nice man-machine interactive interface, this CNC (Computer Numerical Control) system can operate devices automatically. It uses assembly language and has improved the system reliability and efficiency. The application of the open modular design idea is beneficial to the secondary development and technology upgrading. The operation indicates that the system has achieved the prospective design objective.

The objective of this research is to investigate the seismic performance of as-built, retrofitted, and repaired hollow bridge columns with insufficient shear strength. Two as-built full-scale columns were first tested and repaired using carbon-fiberreinforced polymer composites (CFRP) jackets and dog-bone-shaped bars and then retested. Another two columns having the same reinforcement as the as-built columns were retrofitted with CFRP jackets. In addition to the tests, the repairability of the failed hollow columns was investigated by analytical evaluation. The test results and analysis of the retrofitted columns showed that CFRP composites can effectively strengthen shear-critical hollow bridge columns and can successfully transform the failure mode from shear to flexure. The test results of the repaired circular columns show that dog-bone-shaped bars successfully repaired the flexural damage caused by the fractured longitudinal bars.

Objective
ts with heart failure need education and support to improve knowledge and self-care. Shared medical groups that provide education and support have been successful in other patient populations. This study compares an advanced practice nurse-led shared medical appointment intervention in the office setting with standard care relative to self-care and knowledge among community-living adults with heart failure.
s
ipants were randomized to shared appointment and standard care groups, and completed the Heart Failure Knowledge Test and Self-Care Heart Failure Index at baseline and 8 weeks.
s
aseline to 8 weeks, Heart Failure Knowledge Test scores improved more for the intervention group than the control group (F time Ã— group = 4.90, df = 1.21; P = .038). There was no difference in groups' rates of change on the total Self-Care Heart Failure Index.
sion
ndings reveal improved knowledge when education and support are provided in a shared medical appointment setting. The shared medical visit model may be feasible as a way to provide patients with heart failure and their families with ongoing education and a supportive environment.

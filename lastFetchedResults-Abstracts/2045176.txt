Objective(s): We examined the effects of endurance exercise in the presence of Bunium persicum extract administration on lipid profile and cardiorespiratory capacity in hypercholesterolemic male mice. Materials and Methods: Forty male hypercholesterolemic mice were divided into four groups: Vehicle, Endurance exercise (EE), Bunium persicum extract (BPE), and EE + BPE. The exercise protocol was performed at a speed of 18 m/min, 40 min/day, and 5 days/week for 6 weeks. The BPE was administered orally by a dose of 20 mg/Kg/day. Results: The results indicated that the 6-week endurance training accompanied by Bunium Persicum extract administration increased cardiorespiratory capacity significantly (601±39 vs. 293±20 meters, p<0.001). Total cholesterol level was significantly reduced in EE + BPE compared with Vehicle and EE groups (p<0.05). LDL-c was lower in EE + BPE compared with the Vehicle (p<0.01). HDL-c in BPE and EE + BPE groups was significantly higher than Vehicle (pConclusion: The results suggested that Bunium persicum extract is very useful in improvement of lipid profile in hypercholesterolemic animals. Supplementation of the extractto exercise significantly increased the cardiorespiratory capacity.

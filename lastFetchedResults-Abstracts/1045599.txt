Unsteady cavitating turbulent flow simulations need to be responsible for both cavitation and turbulence modeling issues. The Partially-Averaged Navier–Stokes (PANS) computational model developed from the RANS method and the k–ε turbulence model are used to model turbulent cavitating flow with a mass transfer cavitation model in the present paper. An objective of this study is to pursue more accurate estimates of unsteady cavitating flows with large-scale fluctuations at a reasonable cost. Firstly, the unsteady cavitating flow simulations over a NACA66-mod hydrofoil are performed using the PANS method with various values of the resolution control parameters (fk = 1 ∼ 0.2, fε = 1) to evaluate the numerical methods based on experimental data. The comparison with the experiments show that the numerical analysis with a fk = 0.2 can predict the cavity evolution and shedding frequency fairly well. Then, cavitating flow around a marine propeller in non-uniform wake was simulated by PANS method. The calculations show that large cavity volume pulsation as the blade passes through the wake region is resolved better by the PANS method with fk = 0.2 than by the RANS method with the k–ε or k–ω SST turbulence models. This can be contributed to the fact that a smaller fk give larger cavity volume pulsations leading to increased cavity volume accelerations and larger pressure fluctuations above the propeller, while a larger fk overestimates the turbulent viscosity along the rear part of the cavity. Finally, it is confirmed from the simulation by the PANS method with fk = 0.2 that the whole process of cavitating flow evolution around the propeller in non-uniform wake can be very well reproduced including cavitation inception, sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation observed experimentally.

Design of an optimal Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) is a key step in implementation of Wireless SCADA. This paper presents Implementation and Testing of an RTU design which is suitable for wide area operation essential for controlling and monitoring oil and gas sector, water and power industries. This particular implementation is based on FPGA which has resulted in reliable and reconfigurable RTU. It has significant advantages resulting in a more powerful and optimized solution for execution of wireless based SCADA. The main objective of this research work is to implement and verify a design considering performance parameters which assists in optimized development and inexpensive implementation of an RTU, also featured with wireless communication.

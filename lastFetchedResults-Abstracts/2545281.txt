There are very limited data for Iranian populations on the
                            predisposing genetic factors for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The
                            objective of the present study was to investigate the association of the
                            angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene polymorphism and ACS in an
                            Iranian population. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 263
                            subjects (97 men and 166 women). Patients (n = 128) aged 30 - 80 years
                            with chest pain were recruited from the emergency department of Ghaem
                            Hospital (Mashhad, Iran). A 12-lead electrocardiograph plus creatine
                            kinase MB (CK-MB) levels were used as the basis for the diagnosis of
                            myocardial ischemia. The control group was selected from age-matched
                            healthy subjects (n = 135). Non-enzymatic kits were used for extraction
                            of DNA from blood samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed
                            to amplify the DNA fragments. For restriction fragment length
                            polymorphism (RFLP) determination, the DdeI enzyme was used to digest
                            the amplified DNA fragments. Statistical analyses were performed using
                            SPSS version 13.0. There was no statistical difference in the genotype
                            frequency of patients and healthy subjects with regard to age and gender
                            (P &gt; 0.05). The AT1R A1166C polymorphism appeared not to be
                            associated with the presence of ACS in the population studied.

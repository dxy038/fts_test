Objective: We examined prognostic factors and outcome of the primary treatment in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the head and neck. Methods: Twenty patients with ACC of the head and neck who had been treated in our institution from 1985 to 1998 were enrolled in this study. Disease-specific survival rate was analyzed by the Kaplan–Mejer method, and the log-rank test was applied to compare the survival rates. Results: The overall 5- and 10-year survival rates determined by Kaplan–Meier analysis were 81 and 57%, respectively. Patients with major salivary gland ACC obtained the best 10-year survival rate (83%), while those with paranasal sinus ACC had the worst survival rate (33%). Predominance of the solid component on pathological examination might indicate a worse prognosis. Our study revealed that postoperative radiotherapy could yield better control of the lesion focus. Chemotherapy failed in some patients and was not dramatically effective by itself. Conclusions: The long-term prognosis of ACC was poor. Long-term follow-up is necessary for better prognosis of patients treated with radical treatment regimens.

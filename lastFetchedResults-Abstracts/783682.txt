Background Depression is one of the
most prevalent mental health problems worldwide
with considerable social and economic burdens.
While practice guidelines exist, their adherence is
inconsistent in clinical practice. Objective To provide
up-to-date national estimates of the adequacy of
treatment received by Canadians having suffered a
major depressive disorder (MDD) and examine factors
associated with this adequacy. To evaluate the
impact of different definitions of guideline-concordant
treatment on the results. Subjects Data were
drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey,
cycle 1.2: Mental Health and Well-Being (CCHS 1.2), a
nationally representative survey conducted in 2002
and targetting persons aged 15 years or older living in
private dwellings. In order to calculate the prevalence
of treatment adequacy, we used a sample of 1,563
individuals meeting the criteria for MDD in the
12 months preceding the survey. A subset of 831
subjects who reported having used health services for
mental health purposes at least once during that time
served to identify the factors associated with treatment
adequacy. Measurements Four definitions of
minimally adequate treatment were considered and
covariates were selected according to a well-known
behavioral model. The analyses consisted of prevalence
estimates and logistic regression models.
Results Among selected subjects, 55% received
guideline-concordant treatment according to the
Canadian guidelines. Inadequacy was more prevalent
in rural settings, for less complex cases, and in the
general medical sector. Depending on the definition,
prevalence of guideline-concordant treatment ranged
between 48 and 71%, and factors associated with
guideline-concordant treatment were mainly need
factors and sector of care. Conclusions A large proportion
of people with a depressive disorder do not
receive minimally adequate treatment. Improved access
to and quality of treatment is required, especially
in primary care settings

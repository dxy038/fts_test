It seems that there is a need to reform Iranian tax system in order to strengthen government revenue sources. This study aims to investigate the impacts of tax on agricultural sector. To get the objective a computable general equilibrium framework based on the Iranian social accounting matrix was used. The results showed that 15 percent tax on agricultural activities could cause output of agriculture and processing industries to fall sharply. It also caused a price increase of agricultural products higher than corresponding tax rate. While tax on agricultural activities could cause output expansion of oil and gas as well as service sectors, however it would cause GDP reduction by 4.8 percent as well as general level of prices to rise by 3.9 percent. In addition, Tax rate of 15 percent on agricultural activities induced a welfare reduction of 9.8 percent in rural Iran.

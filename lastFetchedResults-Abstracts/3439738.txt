The sensitivity analysis of the output current of the parallel-series resonant inverter is presented with the objective of including the analysis of component tolerances in the design criteria of current-source resonant inverters. The effects of the tolerance of circuit elements in the parallel-series (LC<sub>p</sub>C<sub>s</sub>) resonant inverter are studied to optimize the design parameters that ensure the circuit performance with minimum deviation of the operating point, i.e., minimum control action or even no feedback, and also good repeatability. The analysis shows that the capacitor ratio affects the sensitivity values. Conclusions are confirmed with experimental results and a statistical study by the Monte Carlo method

The fuzzy weighted average is widely used to solve hierarchical evaluation problems, including fuzzy consideration for the operations of scoring, weighting and aggregating. Previous works considered the fuzziness of score and weight, and used the additive function to aggregate these weighted scores. This study considers the aggregation operator also as a fuzzy variable, and uses a generalized means function to fuzzify the aggregation operator within a fuzzy weighted average. In practice, the proposed model not only considers both the relative important of the criteria and its achieved performance, but also conveys the influence of the DM’s (Decision Maker’s) evaluation attitude. Thus the proposed model can flexibly reflect any DM’s evaluation attitude, such as open, neutral or rigorous. Thereby, the proposed model can make an objective evaluation that approaches a real decision making situation, and thus has the potential to be a useful management tool for improved resolution of fuzzy hierarchical evaluation problems.

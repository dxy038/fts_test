With the use of geographic information services widely, geographic information quality of service (QoS) has become one of the key factors for the success of geographic information service applications. However, how to estimate Geographic Information Service QoS reasonably is a complex issue. Based on the analysis of the current research results of geographic information QoS, this paper firstly summarized the style of QoS with three viewpoints. Then, an extensible synthesis evaluation model for geographic information QoS was established, which can be used to define a new evaluation factor on demand, and used to realize comprehensive evaluation of geographic information QoS in the subjective, objective views through the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to quantify the subjective assessment of the QoS factors. Finally, the idea of the development for geographic information QoS and further research are also discussed.

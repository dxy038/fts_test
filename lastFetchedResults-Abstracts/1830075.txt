This work seeks to develop an innovative thermal barrier coating (TBC) that will exhibit low thermal conductivity and high durability compared with that of current TBCs. To achieve this objective, a multiple component co-doped zirconia chemistry was selected for the topcoat of the TBC system, and a new process – Solution Plasma Spray (SPS or SPPS) – was employed to produce desirable microstructural features: the co-doped zirconia TBC contains ultrafine splats, high volume porosity and vertical cracks, for lower thermal conductivity and better durability, respectively. Test results verified a low thermal conductivity of 0.55–0.66 W/K·m over a temperature range of R.T. to 1300 °C, 1/3X that of EB-PVD 8YSZ TBCs, and its thermal cycling durability was 2.5X that of APS 8YSZ TBCs and 1.5X that of EB-PVD 8YSZ TBCs.

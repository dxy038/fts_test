Background. Although bloodstream infections (BSIs) occur more frequently in intensive care unit patients than in ward patients, most studies of nosocomial BSIs in critically ill patients have not distinguished between intensive care unit populations beyond surgical, medical, and pediatric patients.

Methods. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the secular trends in rates of nosocomial BSIs for all pathogens among patients admitted to a busy cardiothoracic intensive care unit in a single tertiary care institution between January 1986 and December 1995. Patients with nosocomial BSIs were identified through continual prospective surveillance.

Results. A total of 40,207 patients were admitted to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit during the 10-year study period, and 804 episodes of nosocomial BSIs among 681 patients were identified. The mean crude BSI infection rate was 6.0 per 1,000 patient-care days and increased linearly during the study period (range, 4.4 to 8.1 per 1000 patient-care days), and approached statistical significance (p value = 0.07). The most common organisms causing BSIs were Staphylococcus aureus (12%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (11%), Candida albicans (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), and Enterococci (9%). The leading sources of nosocomial BSIs were primary BSIs (33%), intravascular devices (27%), lower respiratory tract infections (17%), and surgical wound infections (12%). The etiologic fraction or the proportion of deaths in cardiothoracic intensive care unit patients with BSIs was 15-fold higher than those patients without BSIs (37% versus 2.5%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions. Rates of nosocomial BSIs among patients in our cardiothoracic intensive care unit have increased linearly during the past decade and patients with nosocomial BSIs have an increased risk of in hospital mortality.

Objective
This study was undertaken to develop a process that provides Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME)-required documentation of obstetric/gynecology (OB/GYN) clinical experience comparability and mid-clerkship feedback.
Study design
Institutional review board approval was obtained. OB/GYN clerkship students at the University of North Carolina (UNCSOM) from June 2004 through June 2005 were given Clinical Activities Tools (CATs) to guide clinical work. CAT books listed Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics–recommended topics/procedures/skills and had a section for mid-clerkship feedback. Residents/faculty signed CAT sections to document student completion of topics/procedures/skills/feedback. CAT tool data were analyzed with univariate, χ2, and analysis of variance statistics.
Results
CATs were submitted by 81% (134/165) of students; 71% of CAT clinical activities had teacher signatures. CAT comparability was successfully documented for all topics/procedures/skills and for mid-clerkship feedback across sites and across rotation blocks. CATs provided active learning/communication opportunities and data used for curriculum revision.
Conclusion
CATs facilitated successful documentation of clinical experience comparability and mid-clerkship feedback. The process is feasible and likely will be helpful to other institutions.

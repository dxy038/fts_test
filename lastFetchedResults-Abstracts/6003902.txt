In this paper, graphene oxide (GO) was modified in-situ on an electrochemical electrode array for attachment of protein. GO suspension made from natural graphite flakes was directly dip-coated onto the Au working electrodes. Detected by cyclic voltammetry, the peak current of GO on Au electrode increased by 1&#956;A as compared with bare gold electrode. Modified graphgene oxide (MGO) with stable active esters was formed by in-situ modifying GO with N-ethyl-NÂ´-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC)/ N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). MGO was ready for protein attachment. An immunesensor chip (GO-antigen) was prepared by tuberculosis (TB) antigens bound with MGO. The peak of CV curve of GO-antigen increased by about 3&#956;A as compared with that of MGO, however, after the GO-antigen reaction with the antibody, the peak of the current decreased 4&#956;A. Such results showed potential applications of the immunosensor.

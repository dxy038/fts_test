In order to analyze the effect of toll standard of regional freeway network on traffic flow assignment, this paper presents a network tolling model based on the optimization of traffic flow. In this model, system optimization and user optimization are considered together, cost of road users is minimized as the objective function, and the benefit of road builders and external benefit are treated as the constraint requirements. Confronting such a complex problem, genetic algorithm is induced to solve the constructed model and a case example validates its effectiveness and feasibility of real use. The result shows that the model can make the traffic flow assignment of freeway network more reasonable.

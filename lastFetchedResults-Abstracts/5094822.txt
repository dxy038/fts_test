The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis and solution for sympathetic tripping in distribution network. Al Ain Distribution Company (AADC) is responsible to operate and maintain the power distribution from 0.415 kV up to and including 33 kV level in the eastern region of Abu Dhabi emirate. AADC is always keen to provide safe and secure power supply to its customers. This paper analyses the sympathetic tripping problems and provides solution using an economical, safe, secure, and reliable scheme with utmost care, in order to minimize the damage to equipments and ensure continuity of power supply to customers as far as practicable in AADC network. The scheme is developed in combination of overcurrent, under voltage and negative sequence functions, which are readily available in numerical protection relays. The solution provided in this paper not only analyses modern relays/schemes, but also the possibility of improving existing protection scheme problems, where electromechanical relays are available with required modification without major cost impact.

Having studied the linkage between the unit output change and the power price fluctuation, and synthesized the bidding risk exponent, environmental protection cost, generation cost and unit valve point effect, the optimal response model of thermal units to the electricity spot market was established. The objective is to guarantee generating and bidding of generating side in electricity market with minimum emission, low risk and maximal profit. A differential evolution algorithm with jitter variation was designed for the solution of this model with nonlinear and non-convex characteristics, and the environmental economic operation plan of units and a reasonable scheme of generating and bidding were achieved to maximize profit. The feasibility and validity of the proposed method was demonstrated with the results of the environmental/economic operation simulation calculation and analysis using an applied example.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate effects of metacognition training on the improvement of mathematical function in primary school students with mathematic learning disability.  Method: The statistical population of the study was third-grade students of a primary school in Isfahan. To conduct the research, 30 students with mathematic learning disability were selected through random multi-stage clustered sampling. The sample was divided randomly into two groups (15 students in the experimental group and 15 students in the control group). Interventions of metacognition training were administered on the experimental group. The instruments of the research included Wechsler (4) ‍Children’s Intelligence Scale, the Mathematic Disability Diagnosis Test and Mathematics Function Test. The data were analyzed through covariance analysis method.  Results: The results indicated that metacognition training affected mathematical function of children with mathematic learning disability.  Conclusion: The findings supported the notion that metacognition training could be employed in teaching mathematics to students. As other studies concluded, too, the educational system should try to utilize metacognition training in primary schools in order to improve students’ learning ability.

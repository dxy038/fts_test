Background The frequent psychiatric
comorbidity among subjects with a substance use
disorder (SUD) can be explained by an increased
vulnerability to problematic drug use among subjects
with a non-substance-related psychiatric disorder
(NSRPD). The care of this disorder should then reduce
the likelihood of a secondary SUD. Objective To
examine how healthcare use for psychological symptoms
modifies the lifetime association between SUD
and NSRPD. Methods Two hundred and twenty four
students were evaluated for mental disorders and
healthcare use. Mental disorders were assessed with
the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview
(MINI). Healthcare use included consultations with a
general practitioner (GP), a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
The lifetime occurrence of a SUD was
analysed by lifetime number of NSRPD and healthcare
use for psychological symptoms. Analyses were
adjusted on gender, university affiliation, living
environment and temperament and character
dimensions. Results Compared to subjects without
NSRPD, those with at least two NSRPD who did not
use healthcare were more likely to have had a lifetime
SUD (O Ë† R = 3.9). By contrast, those who had only one
NSRPD seemed to be as likely as those with no
NSRPD to have had a SUD. Discussion These results
suggest a decreased probability of SUD among subjects
with several NSRPD who used healthcare. Due to
the cross-sectional design of this study, causal inferences
cannot be drawn. This analysis shows the
importance, however, of taking healthcare use into
account in comorbidity studies.

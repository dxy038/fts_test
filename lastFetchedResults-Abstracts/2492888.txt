Background: Currently, volunteer forces are among the main members of the healthcare&nbsp;services, particularly in the treatment sector, and play a key role in healthcare and treatment&nbsp;services. Since efficient human resources are the greatest and most important assets of all&nbsp;organizations, they constantly work to train, retain, and get the best of these valuable assets.&nbsp;The main objective of this work was to prioritize the motivational factors and satisfaction of&nbsp;the volunteer forces participating in treatment and health programs in the case of emergencies.
Materials and Methods: The study population of this research was all volunteers (N=600) in&nbsp;treatment and health programs of Kerman Province. Using the Morgan Table, 360 subjects were&nbsp;selected. The data-gathering instrument was Andam&rsquo;s questionnaire of motivational factors&nbsp;with reliability of 0.94, and Galindo-Kuhn and Guzley (2001) questionnaire of satisfaction&nbsp;with reliability of 0.92. To determine research data distribution, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was&nbsp;applied. Moreover, for data analysis inferential statistics tests of Friedman, Mann&ndash;Whitney U,&nbsp;and Kruskal&ndash;Wallis were used at significance level of P<0.05.
Results: The present research revealed that the most and least important motivational&nbsp;factors in volunteers of treatment and health units were purposeful motivation and financial&nbsp;motivation with average rankings of 5.45 and 1.99, respectively. In addition, among the&nbsp;satisfaction factors, the volunteers reported communication with volunteers and organizational&nbsp;communication as the most and least important satisfaction factors, respectively.

The results&nbsp;of this research indicated that the female volunteers participated in volunteer activities with&nbsp;greater occupational, support, progress, and social motivations. In addition, single participants&nbsp;had greater occupational, social, and financial motivations towards participation in these&nbsp;activities as compared to married participants.
Conclusion: The results of this research revealed that to absorb a higher number of volunteers&nbsp;in health and treatment organizations, commitment and purposeful aspects must be emphasized&nbsp;on, as by improving the motivational and satisfaction factors, we can expect that satisfaction&nbsp;and retention level increases in volunteers. Furthermore, by knowing the volunteers&rsquo;&nbsp;motivations, the managers of the health and treatment organizations can provide their retention&nbsp;and satisfaction and play a key role in crisis management during disasters by exploiting the&nbsp;volunteer services.

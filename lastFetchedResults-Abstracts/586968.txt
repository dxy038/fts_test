Results: Mean age of the samples was 31 years, and the range of BMI was 25/67 to 48/55. Data showed that scale hypochondriasis (Hs) in obese women and men, and scale psychasthenia(Pt) in men, are high. BMI was not correlated with the scales of MMPI-2. 
Conclusion: According to (MMPI-2) scales, the profile of obese men and women was normal. Since T scores in scales of Hs for obese women, and Hs and Pt scales in obese men were higher than 65, these cases are vulnerable for hypochondriasis and anxiety.

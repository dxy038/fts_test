<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong><em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>type b (Hib) is divided into two distinct genotypes, type I and type II, based on the structure of capsular polysaccharides. The capsulation locus of <em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>type b consists of three functionally distinct regions, designated regions 1 to 3. Region III contains <em>hcsA </em>and <em>hcsB </em>genes; however, notable sequence variation in this region can be used to recognize different Hib genotypes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and genotype of the Hib strains isolated from patients with invasive disease in Iran.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>In the present study, 8 pairs of primers were used for identification and serotyping of encapsulated <em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>strains, as well as confirmation of species identification. Additionally, in order to identify the cap- sular genotypes of <em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>type b (type I and II), two additional primer pairs were used to amplify the <em>hcsA </em>gene.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Out of 50 isolates of <em>H. influenzae</em>, four were found to be type b. Interestingly, among these 4 Hib isolates, 2 strains belonged to the type-II category.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Our study shows that the prevalence of both Hib types I and II seems to be high in Iran.</p>

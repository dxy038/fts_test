Obj ective s : The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of definitive continuous distraction (DCD) employed through an Ilizarov type external fixator on fracture healing in a rabbit tibia model. M e tho d s: Fifteen mature New Zealand white rabbits weigh¬ing 2.8 to 4.0 kg were randomly assigned to three groups fol¬lowing osteotomy of the tibia and fibula. The first group (controls) was treated only with the Ilizarov type external fixator while the second and third groups were subjected to DCD amounting to '0% and 30% of the body weight, respectively, being employed through modulated springs on the Ilizarov external fixation system. All the rabbits were evaluated by radiographies on the '2th, 2'st, 28th, and 35 th days following surgery and were sacrificed on the 45th day. Radiographic evaluations were made according to the Lane and Sandhu's scoring system, and histologic evaluations according to the scoring system proposed by Heiple et al. The results were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results : The highest radiographic and histologic scores were obtained from the second group, being 8.6 and ''.6, respec¬tively (p<0.05). Radiographic and histologic scores of the third group were lower than those of the control group. Conclusion: Application of DCD of '0% of body weight through modulated springs on the Ilizarov external fixator improves fracture healing while a greater amount of insta¬bility results in delayed healing.

The main objective of this work is to present a methodology for development of reduced order models that can be used to estimate the fluid flow and the flow forces in hydraulic valves, as a function of a reduced number of critical dimensional and material parameters. The methodology is based on classical incompressible flow theory and numerical (CFD) simulations of the fluid flow through the valve.

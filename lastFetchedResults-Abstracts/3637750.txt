In this paper, the objectives and detailed analysis of the multistage distribution expansion are presented. The problem is modeled as a directed graph minimum edge cost network flow problem. This new formulation details a multistage framework within a single mathematical program while addressing several deficiencies of previous approaches. The accuracy of a single step approximation of the objective function, without using the conventional linearization techniques, is discussed. Each of the constraints is introduced in terms of industry standard practices. Detailed numerical results for practical study cases are provided in a separate paper.

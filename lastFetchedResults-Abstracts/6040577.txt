Use of Low Cost Access Devices (LCADs)based on Android platform is on the rise for educational purposes. There is a growing need for open source educational content in order to tap the advantages of this platform.2D/3D animation is preferred to explain complex visalization concepts. Most of the 3D animation content available for desktops has high-poly models. To use these models on LCADs is challenging, because of their low hardware configuration. Methodologies to port 3D content to LCADs (used in gaming industry) are unsuitable for educational visualizations, as they hamper functionality and mesh topology of the objects. It is desirable to remodel 3D content with an objective to use them for LCADs. In this paper we present one such methodology to create low-poly 3D models using open source 3D tool, Blender. The models created using this methodology show reduction in file sizes, mesh-density and loading time on LCADs.

Background and Objective: Reduction of the anabolic to catabolic hormones plays an important role in muscle loss and strength reduction in post-menopausal women. The ratio of testosterone to cortisol concentration (T:C) is used as indicative of the stress level imposed by the exercise. Increases in this ratio are responsible for hypertrophy and strength gain. The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of a resistance exercise session and an endurance exercise session on T:C ratio in post-menopausal women.

Materials and Methods: In this cross- sectional research study, 10 elderly women (age= 54.3±3.74 years, BMI= 24.88±2.07 kg.m-2) participated in three protocols: 1) resistance protocol (1 session, 3 sets of 10 repetitions of eight exercises with %80 1RM), 2) endurance protocol (45 minutes of cycling at %60-70 Vo2Peak) and 3) rest protocol (control groups). Blood samples were taken before, immediately after and 15 minutes after the end of every protocol. Finally, the serum levels of testosterone and cortisol were measured and data was analyzed using GLM-repeated measures ANOVA at a significance level of p < 0.05.

Results: Resistance group showed a significant increase in T:C ratio within the groups (p < 0.05) but variations in T:C level were not significant between the groups. The difference of T:C levels were not significant within and between the groups in endurance exercise group.

Conclusion: The results showed that a single bout of resistance exercise and a single bout of endurance exercise do not acutely influence T:C ratio in post-menopausal women.

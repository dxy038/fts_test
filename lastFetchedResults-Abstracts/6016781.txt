In the present world where quality control has become a most needed and costlier venture, the need for reducing the cost of quality testing of mechanical parts has gained importance so that it can be implemented effectively in all kind of industries. Normally the production happens using molding machinery with some malfunctions which changes the size of the products, present quality system is semi automated and need human help to identify the defect and uses costly testing equipments such as LASER resulting in a cost of Lakhs. Here we have developed a fully automated system named as EQCS that is capable of identifying the defects of the spare parts at micron scale; it also reduces the fluctuation of auto parts quality, and improves Robustness and performance. The system is designed for weight calculation, and also for Temperature and pressure sustainability testing which confirms the quality of the product that is being tested. The system is also featured with a perfect mechanical design which adapts to any industrial environment. This paper outlines the approach to build an intelligent system that is capable of testing the quality of the auto parts and interacting with the remote server to avoid the defects being produced by the machinery any further. Our main objective was to bring up a low cost solution and with this system we can maintain the quality to the maximum level at minimal cost ranging for auto parts such as screws, frames, engine components and various other parts.

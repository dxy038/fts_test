Objective: To evaluate the functional outcome and extensor apparatus of operative management of intra-articular fractures of distal humerus using modification of the Triceps Tongue Flap approach.
Methods: This prospective study was conducted between June, 2012 to April,2014 in NIMS Medical College and Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan(India). We included 23 patients with intraarticular fractures of distal humerus that were managed surgically. Modification of Triceps Tongue Flap approach with Triceps flap in inverted ‘V’ shape was used. Follow-up was done using standard radiograph anteroposterior/lateral (AP/Lat) at immediate postoperative day, 1,3, 6 and 12 month intervals. Functional outcome was assessed using range of motion at elbow joint, Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)Score and Objective Muscle Strength Testing (MRC Grade) of triceps muscle at 1,2, 3,6 and 12 month follow-up.
Results: Overall we included 23 patients of whom 16 (69.5%) were men and 7 (30.5%) were women with mean age of 34.6+4.8years. Mean duration of the follow-up was 12.9+1.1 months. Mean DASH Score at final follow up was 7.7+1.1(indicating mild residal impairment). Mean muscle strength at final follow-up was 4.7 ± 0.4 (Range 3 to 5). Mean flexion deformity at elbow was 9.2 ±0.9 (Range 5 to 45) degrees and mean arc of flexion extension as 119 ± 3.4(Range 65to 140) degrees.
Conclusion: This approach provides an excellent exposure as well as a good functional outcome as measured by DASH score and full range of motion at the elbow joint with return of almost complete power of the extensor apparatus in patients with intra-articular fractures of distal humerus.

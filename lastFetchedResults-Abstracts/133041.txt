Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the enzymatic activity of catalase, glutathione s-transferase and protein concentration in serum and tear samples of patients and to compare the findings with normal samples.
Material and Methods: We analyzed specific activity of catalase in tear and serum samples, specific activity of glutathione s-transferase in serum and protein concentration in tear and serum samples and compared the results in normal and patient groups. Results: There was statistically significant increase in protein concentration (P<0.001) and specific activity of catalase (P<0.05) in patient's serum samples as compared with normal serum samples.
Conclusion: The role of hydrogen peroxide in ocular disease especially in cornea, imbalance of oxidant/antioxidant systems in serum, tear and ocular tissues is very important. More electrophoresis studies are necessary to determine the specific protein type that leads to total protein increase.

The data acquisition and processing (DAQP) is design to acquire multiple heterogeneous signals and processing them in real time process. The main objective of this technology is to monitor different levels of signals from different sensors without any additional usage of the hardware devices. The proposed system is design in system on chip via Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) to check the speed of the acquired signals. Various modules of the conceptual designs are implemented and verified using LabVIEW graphical programming. The hardware testing is implemented with the help of NI-DAQ and NI-ARM. This testing allows for high speed processing and also keeping the device cost less.

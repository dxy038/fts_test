In many rapid three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging applications, such as when following a contrast bolus in the vasculature using a moving table technique, the desired k-space data cannot be fully acquired due to scan time limitations. One solution to this problem is to sparsely sample the data space. Typically, the central zone of k-space is fully sampled, but the peripheral zone is partially sampled. We have experimentally evaluated the application of the projection-onto-convex sets (POCS) and zero-filling (ZF) algorithms for the reconstruction of sparsely sampled 3D k-space data. Both a subjective assessment (by direct image visualization) and an objective analysis [using standard image quality parameters such as global and local performance error and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] were employed. Compared to ZF, the POCS algorithm was found to be a powerful and robust method for reconstructing images from sparsely sampled 3D k-space data, a practical strategy for greatly reducing scan time. The POCS algorithm reconstructed a faithful representation of the true image and improved image quality with regard to global and local performance error, with respect to the ZF images. SNR, however, was superior to ZF only when more than 20% of the data were sparsely sampled. POCS-based methods show potential for reconstructing fast 3D MR images obtained by sparse sampling.

Background &objective: Heamodialysis  is one of the most common replacement  treatment of renal transplantation. Effective and adequate heamodialysis could improve the quality of life of patients. Inadequite heamodialysis can lead to multiple uremic complications.The aim of this  study was to determine dialysis  adequacy of hemodialytic  patients based  on  urea kinetic  modeling  in hemodialysis  center  in Bojnourd.
Materials&Methods: This descriptive study was carried out on 63 patients who were under dialysis treatment (at least 3 month and once a week) in Imam Ali hospital,Bojnurd. Hemoglobin , hematocrit ,cholesterol and BUN were measured before and after heamodialysis. Adequacy of dialysis was calculated by Daugirddas II. Data were analyzed by SPSS software 15 and presented with chi square, independent a paired t-test, ANOVA.
Results: Our results showed that %36.1 of individuals have URR > 65% and %47.7 individuals have KT/V  > 1.2.After dialysis mean blood pressure,weight,BUN showed meaningfull reduction.There was  a significant difference between mean of  BUN post dialysis and KT/V and URR. There wasnâ€™t significant between KT/V URR and Hb Hct,Alt,cratinen,Chlostrol.
Conclusion: According to this study  the adequacy of dialysis in patients was lower than those of same reported studies .we suggest  more study  in order  to determine the underlying reasons for dialysis inadequacy in these patients.

Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the
quality of life of Neyshabur health-care staff and some factors
associated with it with use of WHOQOL-BREF scale.
Methods: This cross?sectional study was conducted on 522 staff
of Neyshabur health-care centers from May to July 2011.
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was applied to examine the internal
consistency of WHOQOL-BREF scale; Pearson’s correlation
coefficient was used to determine the level of agreement between
different domains of WHOQOL-BREF. Paired t?test was used to
compare difference between score means of different domains.
T-independent test was performed for group analysis and Multiple
Linear Regression was used to control confounding effects.
Results: In this study, a good internal consistency (? = 0.925) for
WHOQOL-BREF and its four domains was observed. The highest
and the lowest mean scores of WHOQOL-BREF domains was
found for physical health domain (Mean = 15.26) and environmental
health domain (Mean = 13.09) respectively. Backward multiple
linear regression revealed that existence chronic disease in staff was
significantly associated with four domains of WHOQOL-BREF,
education years was associated with two domains (Psychological
and Environmental) and sex was associated with psychological
domain (P  <  0.05).
Conclusions: The findings from this study confirm that the
WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire is a reliable instrument to measure
quality of life in health?care staff. From the data, it appears that
Neyshabur health-care staff has WHOQOL-BREF scores that
might be considered to indicate a relatively moderate quality of
life.

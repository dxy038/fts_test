With the advancement in the field of assessment and treatment individualization, gait analysis is considered a routine matter
in the health care settings during rehabilitation of walking. Gait analysis refers to the specialized assessment of walking
which includes past medical history, objective examination of various characteristics of gait and the impact of disease on the
pattern of walking. Kinematics and kinematics are the most useful parameters used to assess the disabilities associated with
gait cycle. Infrared video cameras are normally used during gait analysis to define the three dimensional positions and
movements of various lower limb joints. By analysing the kinetics and kinematics of the loading response; an important
phase of the gait cycle, various deficits can be assessed in stroke patients including decreased musculoskeletal coordination,
weakness and spasticity of the lower limb muscles. The detailed assessment of the kinetics and kinematics during loading
response can enable the physiotherapists and rehabilitation specialists to design better treatment programs for the Neuro
compromised stroke patients. This review article will address the kinetics and kinematics during loading response in stroke
patients, but the technique can be used in a number of conditions.

During November 1993, we traversed by ground and by air the Vizca√≠no Desert, the last redoubt of the peninsular pronghorn (Antilocapra americana peninsularis). A total of 29 h of aerial census was performed and a total of 1900 km2were covered by ground, totalling 400 man hours of survey. At present the peninsular pronghorn population consists of 175 individuals, and inhabits an area of approximately 5000 km2. Because of the impossibility of controlling its activities over such an area and because of the present small population size, we propose to manage part of the population in semi-captivity at Mesa de la Choya island, with the objective of assuring the survival of this subspecies, the most endangered mammal in Mexico.

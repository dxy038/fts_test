This paper discusses that the coal port belt conveyor transmission process can be formulated as a precedence network. There exist many cross operations in the coal port. The objective of the paper is to study the horizontal transportation process in the coal port, and establish the coal port GPRÂ´s (Generalized Precedence Relations) networks, and analyze abnormal critical activity phenomenon to improve the efficiency of port operation and the port turnover.

This report presents the results of a twelve month study initiated and supported by ESA on SAR imaging of the ocean surface. It was jointly conducted by the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, ARGOSS and the Institute of Oceanography of the University of Hamburg. The objective of the study has been to intercompare and improve SAR retrieval algorithms and interaction models for upper ocean and atmospheric boundary layer applications, in particular for coastal oceans. As such the study is expected to enhance the usefulness of marine SAR imagery for research and practical applications. The study consists of two main phases, namely: a) review of existing algorithms and models; and b) intercomparison and assessment of the models using available data sets

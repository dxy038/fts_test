In this paper, we are interested in missile autopilot design. Our objective is to seek the approaches which significantly enhance the ability of a control engineer to deal with practical nonlinear control problem. For this purpose, two nonlinear methods are considered: "approximate feedback" and "approximate dynamic feedback" with two time-scale separation. Both methodologies are applied in order to overcome the difficulties caused by the non minimum phase phenomenon of the missile. For the sake of realism, the implementation of our controller includes a nonlinear observer. Simulation results, as well as low complexity of the control law are shown to be better by employing the second method.

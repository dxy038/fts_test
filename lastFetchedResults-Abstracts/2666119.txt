Beside various advantages of microgrids, impossibility of continuous power generation in islanding mode threats the security of electrification of sensitive loads under emergencies. This paper proposes a construction for distribution networks which is formed using microgrids connection in which the microgrids use each other power capacity when the power transfer from the utility grid is not possible. This solution can provide passive defense of next generation of distribution networks in emergency conditions. A modular bidirectional DC-DC converter for connection of a DC microgrid to a DC distribution network is proposed which provides the bidirectional power transfer. Operation principle of the proposed converter is verified using experimental measurement, and proposed power management strategy for microgrid connection to the distribution network is investigated using PSCAD/EMTDC software. Analysis results show that interconnection of microgrids increases the security of electric power for microgrid loads under emergencies, which is frequently along with microgrids islanding mode.

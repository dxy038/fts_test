A band-locator technique employing Fourier spectrum analysis has been developed for γ-ray spectra. This is a purely mathematical routine based on frequency-space descriptions of rotational bands. The objective is to distinguish a unique spectral pattern in the presence of a multitude of other frequencies. Conversion of the band into frequency space provides a pattern, segments of which can act as a template to be extracted from the frequency spectrum of the original data set. Summing the segments reconstructs the band. When confronted with the potential presence of a completely unknown γ-ray band within a data set, these segmented band frequencies provide useful information in locating the band. Computer experiments were designed to test the feasibility of locating superdeformed bands within γ-ray spectra. Search results are presented for rigid-rotor bands and published superdeformed bands.

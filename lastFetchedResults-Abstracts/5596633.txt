To provide reliable video stream transmission over wireless networks, we propose a cross-layer design model in this paper. In the proposed model, the adaptive modulation and coding parameters at the physical layer, the ARQ parameters at the data link layer and the application-layer forward error correction (A-FEC) parameters at the application layer are jointly designed. Our objective is to maximize the number of correctly decodable frames in a group of picture (GOP) according to the channel conditions and the GOP structure of the video stream. We also present a low-complexity bandwidth allocation algorithm for the A-FEC. The effectiveness of the proposed bandwidth allocation algorithm and the cross-layer design model was shown in the simulation results.

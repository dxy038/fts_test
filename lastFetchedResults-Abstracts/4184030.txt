The multiple runway planner (MRP) is a tool that has been developed at Boeing for system effectiveness analysis of arrival sequencing, scheduling, and runway assignment. Given a set of arrivals, with pre-determined meter fix assignments and estimated times of arrival (ETA), the algorithm determines runway assignments and preferred sequences and schedules at the fixes and at the assigned runways. Separation constraints are imposed at all the fixes and, again, for wake vortex purposes, at the runways. The algorithm uses an optimization-based approach which can be configured to represent a variety of objective functions and levels of automation. In addition, the algorithm can be configured to emulate the center TRACON automation system (CTAS) traffic management advisor (TMA) tool developed by NASA

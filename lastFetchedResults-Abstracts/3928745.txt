The dual-active-bridge (DAB) topology is ideally suited for high-power dc-dc conversion, especially when bidirectional power transfer is required. However, it has the drawback of high circulating currents and hard switching at light loads, if wide variation in input and output is expected. To address these issues, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis and experimental results with pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) control of the DAB. The PWM control is in addition to phase-shift modulation between the two H-bridges. The analysis addresses PWM of one bridge at a time and of both bridges simultaneously. In the latter, five distinct modes arise based on the choice of PWM and load condition. The possibilities are analyzed for optimizing power density and efficiency for low-load operation. Finally, a composite scheme combining single and dual PWM is proposed that extends the soft-switching range down to zero-load condition, reduces rms and peak currents, and results in significant size reduction of the transformer. Experimental results are presented with a 10-kW prototype.

The objective of this work is to identify geological circular forms, impact and volcano craters using satellite images. The recognition of objects (circular forms) is the last step in a processing chain which can be described in four phases: image processing, pattern detection, pattern recognition, and identification of the targets (models). The work presents the detection of circular forms in images including the south region of the Minas Gerais State in Brazil

The paper presents the dynamic modeling and coordinated control strategy for an integrated micro grid scheme using Photo Voltaic PV, Fuel Cell FC, and backup Diesel generation with additional battery backup system. The integrated scheme is fully stabilized using a novel FACTS based green filter compensators that ensures stabilized DC bus voltage, minimal inrush current conditions, and load excursions. The diesel generator set is only utilized when the demand energy exceeds the PV, FC and battery sources capacity within specified operational levels to ensure highest efficient operation of the integrated renewable energy sources with the diesel engine. The paper presents a novel application of Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO for PID controller parameters tuning to control the 6-pulse controlled rectifier converter, dynamic filter/capacitor compensation DFC and the Green Power Filter GPF AC and DC schemes using real time dynamic self regulating error tracking.

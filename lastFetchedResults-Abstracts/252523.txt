The freezing point of aluminum is one of the ITS-90 defining fixed points
widely used for thermometer calibration. However, long-term investigations have
revealed slow temperature depressions of the aluminum freezing temperature and
alterations of the metal structure that are probably due to metallic contamination
caused by the partial dissolution of crucible material. The objective of this work was
to study the iInteraction of liquid aluminum with graphite and boron nitride in order to
select a nonreactive material. Two crucibles made of high purity graphite and boron
nitride were filled with Al of 6N5 purity; then, 40 melting-freezing cycles were carried
out. The total time of contact between aluminum in the liquid phase and the crucible
was 240 h. After that, the composition of Al, graphite, and boron nitride was studied
and the results were compared with the analysis of the initial samples. The Al ingot
in contact with boron nitride was found to be contaminated by boron.

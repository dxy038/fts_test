Adaptive systems need to be aware about the user context and the occurrence of specific events to properly react to. In particular, web-based educational systems have to be improved in order to consider the learner in his/her current situation. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to present a system able to recognize the situations configured in an e-learning environment, aiming at suggesting better actions to be followed by students each time are necessary, for example, when the learner encounters a difficulty to solve an exercise or spend a lot of time to finish a course. In this work, our solution is developed as an extension of an already functional learning environment, called AdaptWeb&#174;, and enables situation-aware behavior customized to its audience. The main challenge is monitoring events and detecting situations.

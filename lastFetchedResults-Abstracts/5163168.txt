Through collecting the real time control error in the area of power grid and power generation error of the generating units in Hunan Province, combined with ultra-short term load forecasting, established the new feedback control system considering the load error, area control error and generating unit error, we can guide real-time scheduling of the Hunan power grid and improve the control performanceÂ´s assessment indicators of Hunan Power Grid. In this paper, based on the real-time scheduling system, we increase ACE indicators based on area control deviation and feedback control part of generating deviation indicators, establish the acquisition and feedback control systems of the ACE index based on power grid, connect the objective of real-time scheduling with assessment criteria of the power grid, and meet the needs of Assessment of the power grid better; also we establish the acquisition and feedback control system of the power generation deviation based on real-time power assessment in generation plant, analyze power delay because of technical factors and human-induced factors prevalent existing in reality, and improved the effect of real-time scheduling.

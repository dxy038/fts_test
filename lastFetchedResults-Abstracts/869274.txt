This paper presents a model for single-machine scheduling with stability objective and a common deadline. Job durations are uncertain, and our goal is to ensure that there is little deviation between planned and actual job starting times. We propose two meta-heuristics for solving an approximate formulation of the model that assumes that exactly one job is disrupted during schedule execution, and we also present a meta-heuristic for the global problem with independent job durations.

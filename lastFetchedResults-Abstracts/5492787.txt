Temperature rise of insulation can be due to the blockage of the hollow sub-conductors in water-cooled bars. The objective of this project is to make a software simulator to analyze the problem in water-cooled generators in Iran. An experimental setup is constructed to recognize the hollow sub-conductor blockage and its effect on the permissible load current of the generator bar. Results of experiments are used to develop an evaluation software model. The model is applied in air and in hydrogen medium. Measured temperatures of various points on the generator bar show that the hot spot of the insulation can not be detected easily by normal slot RTDs in the machine

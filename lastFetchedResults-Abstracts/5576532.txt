In this paper, the authors propose a method for intelligent computing extension of industrially applied shape centered modeling. The objective is development of intelligent model objects that include modeled object data and behavior description and human intent filtered knowledge. The proposed model objects are intelligent organizers of information, knowledge, and procedures for decision assistance. Results facilitate the completion of present simple data, rule, and formula based on relating parameters of modeled objects by an intelligent solution. The paper details application of integrated model object for description of an interrelated group of modeled objects. Following this, coordinated behavior and adaptive actions are proposed. Furthermore, associativity-based definition of affect zones for object changes is explained and intent filtered application of knowledge at engineering decisions is introduced. Finally, implementation of the proposed methodology as an extension of shape centered modeling of products and concept of the extended modeling systems are discussed as implementation issues.

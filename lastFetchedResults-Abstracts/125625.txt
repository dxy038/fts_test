Objective: Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis with signs and symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction (for example projectile non-bilious vomiting) occur in late neonatal and early infantile periods and if not treated can lead to other complications such as weight loss and death.
Methods: Data for this cross-sectional retrospective study were collected from files of 40 patients (aged between 3 to 5 weeks) who were operated on by pyloromyotomy procedure in Emam Khomeiny and Abouzar hospitals (Ahwaz) during 1373-1379 .
Results: In most patients symptoms occur in the third week of life and hospitalised in the third to fifth week of their lives. All these patients were presented with projectile non bilious vomiting (100%), other symptoms included acid-base abnormality (50 %), electrolyte abnormality (40 %), dehydration (35%) , constipation (20%), respiratory problem (15%) and weight loss (15%). Sensitivity of sonography and contrast study in detection of the abnormality was almost 100%. Most of the patients were hospitalised 1 to 2 days before operation and discharged 3days after operation. Most common post-operative complication was vomiting in 30% of cases which were treated by conservative management.
Conclusion: Early diagnosis and treatment of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis can prevent the development of serious complications.

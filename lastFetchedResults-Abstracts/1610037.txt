Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been conducted for seven experimental cubicles located in Puigverd de Lleida (Spain). The objective of this experimental set-up is to test different constructive solutions in order to point out the most sustainable solution with lower energy demand during the operational phase. Therefore, different building, insulation and Phase Change Materials (PCMs) have been tested under controlled temperature conditions to examine the thermal performance of the whole system. Although some of these materials are able to reduce the energy demand and consequently the environmental impact during the operational phase, they still have high embodied energy that can cause high environmental impact during the manufacturing phase. Therefore the LCA study in this paper focuses on assessing the impact of the embodied energy needed during the manufacturing and disposal phase by highlighting and comparing the effect of using different building materials, insulating materials, and phase change materials.

This paper presents a series active filter with a low-order and simple controller, used to cancel the voltage harmonics in single-phase systems. To accomplish this objective, the series active filter is forced to inject the appropriate voltage to the line through a series connected transformer. The active filter is capable to reduce the total harmonic distortion of the AC mains from 11% to 4%, and it presents a fast response velocity. Analysis and modeling are presented as well as simulation and experimental results, which verify the viability of the proposed approach.

The objective of this study was to identify a set of explanatory variables for Warner–Bratzler shear force and myofibril fragmentation indices after 7, 14, and 21 d of aging; and sensory tenderness after 14 d of aging of steaks from Brahman cattle. Insoluble collagen was negatively associated (P &lt; 0.001) with all tenderness traits across aging periods, and regression coefficients ranged from 5.69 ± 0.49 to 9.12 ± 0.29 N for Warner–Bratzler shear force. The effect of lean color score (P &lt; 0.05) in analyses of unadjusted traits was diminished when data were adjusted for contemporary group (calves of the same sex, fed in one pen, and slaughtered the same day). Insoluble collagen may be of special importance and offer a unique opportunity to improve palatability of steaks from purebred Brahman cattle.

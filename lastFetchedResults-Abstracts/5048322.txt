Advanced power system designs involves consideration of a number of objective, and conventional simulation models are based on a steady-state deterministic framework and do not handle uncertainties in a systematic manner. Technical and economic uncertainties are not rigorously treated or characterized in most preliminary cost and performance estimates of advanced power system designs. So, there is clearly a need of developing a computationally efficient systematic optimization framework under uncertainty using the diverse systems model to aid the decision maker. In this paper, we propose a general framework, and take example for one-dimensional, non-isothermal description of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Results are presented illustrating the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the PEM fuel fell.

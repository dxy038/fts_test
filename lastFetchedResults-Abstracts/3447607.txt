Ultra-wideband (UWB) microwave imaging has recently been proposed for detecting small malignant breast tumors. In this article, we review the current research status of this approach. First, we introduce the concept of microwave imaging via space-time (MIST) beamforming and related signal-processing algorithms. The objective of these signal-processing techniques is to form a spatial image of scattered microwave energy, and to identify the presence and location of malignant lesions from their scattering signatures. Next, we present numerical studies based on finite-difference time-domain simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of MIST beamforming for detecting small malignant breast lesions in both prone and supine configurations. Finally, the experimental feasibility of UWB microwave imaging is demonstrated using an initial imaging prototype and multilayered breast phantoms.

This paper presents the results of the wind tunnel experiments and compares them with full-scale data obtained at the Technical University of Eindhoven (TUE) building in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Difficulties with the wind tunnel testing are discussed. The objective of the study is to quantify the parameters involved in the design of pressure-equalized rainscreen (PER) walls in order to establish specific design guidelines for standards and codes of practice. Comparisons with the currently available limited provisions show clearly their inadequacy.

A rather simple ROM-based current controller is proposed for a three-phase boost type AC/DC power converter to achieve a clean sinusoidal input current, controllable power factor, an adjustable DC voltage, a bidirectional power flow capability, a fixed switching frequency and one insensitive to input voltage distortion. Three control schemes are proposed and integrated in the same controller. As well as the basic scheme, there are a further two choices for either reducing almost half the switch loss or enhancing the availability of the converter, while one arm of the converter fails. A prototype is constructed, and experimental results validate the simulated results

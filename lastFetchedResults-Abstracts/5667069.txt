Ion sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs) built in standard CMOS technology are effectively floating gate devices. They suffer from random trapped charges that alter their threshold voltage (V<sub>t</sub>). This paper describes one way to program an ISFET´s floating gate charges in order to bring its V<sub>t</sub> to a desirable value using bidirectional electron tunnelling. Two inputs are capacitively coupled to the ISFET´s floating gate via matched capacitors. They are used to indirectly tunnel opposite currents across their oxide isolation to the ISFET´s floating gate in a controlled way. The floating gate charges are programmed using a balanced combination of these two tunnelling currents. Measured experimental results demonstrated programmability and removal of positive and negative trapped charges.

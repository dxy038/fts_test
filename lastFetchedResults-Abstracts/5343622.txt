The biomedical signals are commonly recorded with a noise. Many different kinds of noise exist in biomedical environment. One of the noises is a waveform of an electrical activity of muscles. This "natural" distortion is usually modeled with a white Gaussian noise. But such assumption is not always true, because real-life muscle noise has sometimes impulsive character. First objective of this paper is an application of the &#945;-stable distribution as a model of the real-life muscle noise in the ECG signal. Second objective of this paper is an application of a family of M-filters to suppression an impulsive noise in biomedical signals (ECG signals). The reference filter is the median filter.

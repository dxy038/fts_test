Subject of the study includes mono- and anti-symmetrical open I-sections of cold-formed thin-walled beams with double flanges. The beams under uniformly distributed vertical load are simply supported at both ends. Geometric properties of each of the I-sections are separately described by dimensionless parameters. Strength, global and local buckling conditions are defined for these beams. A dimensionless objective function is assumed and formulated on the grounds of the optimization criterion. Numerical study of a family of thin-walled beams is carried out. Results of the study are presented graphically.

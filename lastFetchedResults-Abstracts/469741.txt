Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the none-invasive prenatal determination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based fetal RhD genotyping.
Study design
A prospective case series was undertaken on all RhD-negative pregnant women presenting for genetic counseling in our prenatal diagnosis center from January 2001 until December 2002. Results were compared with serologic RhD typing of the newborns.
Results
Among the 285 pregnant women who participated in the study, fetal RhD status could be determined for 283 patients. In 2 cases, the RhD-negative phenotype of the mother was not the result of a complete RHD gene deletion, and therefore, the status of the fetus could not be determined. Neither false-negative nor false-positive results were observed.
Conclusion
The present report demonstrates that a reliable fetal RHD genotype determination can be achieved with 100% accuracy. It is therefore possible to consider that such an assay could be systematically proposed to all RhD-negative pregnant women in order to more effectively utilize RhD prophylaxis.

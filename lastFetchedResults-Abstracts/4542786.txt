In electronic circuit subjects it is very important that students practice their exercise with analysis and synthesis of circuits in order to acquire knowledge, skill and competences. Usually, students are poorly motivated and thus problemspsila classes get reduced to the professor giving the solution to the set problems. Studentspsila only mission is then to copy the information from the blackboard without having to study, develop or think about the problem. In this paper, we present the use of an interactive docent tool, Educlick, which has been adapted to these problemspsila classes . Educlick is based on the use of electronic answer remote controls (clickers). The classes are wholly directed. The experience is done in the subject of Digital Systems of Computer Science at the Universitat Autnoma of Barcelona. The objective is to increment studentspsila participation in class and thus improve their learning of the design of combinational and sequential digital systems.

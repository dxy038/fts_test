Sustained mental work easily causes mental fatigue. Comfortable environments are necessary to be introduced into mental work. It is very practical research to explore the characteristics under progressive mental fatigue and make a suitable work-rest schedule. In this research, a work-rest schedule containing mental calculation task and music relaxation is specially designed to reflect effect of prolonged cognitive work and relaxation factors in mental work environments. An integrated design and evaluation system for human fatigue-relaxation research is proposed, which consisted of subjective evidence (visual analogue scale) and objective evidence (calculation performance and bio-neurological signals especially EEG signals). The results from subjective evidence and objective evidence indicate that a short break of music relaxation (e.g. 15 minutes) in sustained mental work can successfully counteract the accumulation of mental fatigue and improve work efficiency. EEG analysis supports the music function from bio-neurological point of view. Suitable work-rest schedule has widespread application in boarder population and various situations to alleviate the impact of every life and improve life satisfaction.

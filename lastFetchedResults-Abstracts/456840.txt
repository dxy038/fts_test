Objective
We assess the relationships between alcohol dehydrogenase 3 (ADH3) polymorphism, alcohol consumption and cardiovascular risk factor levels.
Methods
In a representative population sample from Southwestern France (614 men, 567 women, age 49.7 ± 8.5 years), alcohol intake was assessed by questionnaire.
Results
Alcohol consumption was significantly related with higher levels of total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A-I in men and with higher levels of HDL cholesterol in women. Also, an inverse relationship between alcohol consumption and intima-media thickness was found in men. Conversely, in both genders, no differences were found between ADH3 genotypes regarding all cardiovascular risk factors studied and carotid intima-media thickness. Also, in both genders, no significant ADH3 × alcohol interaction was found for all variables, and further adjustment on age, body mass index, educational level, smoking status or after excluding subjects on hypolipidemic or antihypertensive drug treatment did not change the results.
Conclusion
We found no interaction between the ADH3 polymorphism and alcohol intake on cardiovascular risk factor levels and atherosclerotic markers in Southwestern France.

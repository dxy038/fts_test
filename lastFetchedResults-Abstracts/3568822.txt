This paper presents a summary and consolidation of stability and robustness results based on input-output theory for discrete adaptive control systems. The objective of this paper is to clarify the techniques involved in applying this stability approach to the adaptive control problem. It is intended that this tutorial may provide a basis for continuing work in this area.

The zero-delay wavenumber spectrum (ZDWS) estimation approach is proposed for the analysis of array ECG signals as an alternative to isopotential mapping (IM). The ZDWS approach is advantageous because the key parameters related to cardiac electrical activation can be easily identified in the frequency-wavenumber domain. The method explains the data as the sum of wide-band planewaves projected onto the array plane and provides an accurate estimate of their number and bearing. The slowness distribution of each of the planewaves is then obtained by estimating their temporal spectrum. Simulated data and experimental ECG data collected from a canine epicardial preparation during control and localized myocardial ischemic conditionÂ´are analyzed via the ZDWS and IM. It is demonstrated that the ZDWS methodology provides a means for an objective, robust, and repetitive characterization of the array data which can explain the modulation in the cardiac activation wavefront produced by an area of localized coronary artery occlusion.

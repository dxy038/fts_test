Phytoremediation, the use of plants to extract contaminants from soils and groundwater, is a promising approach for cleaning up soils contaminated with heavy metals. However its use is limited by the time required for plant growth, the nutrient supply and, moreover, by the limited metal uptake capacity. Synthetic chelators have shown positive effects in enhancing heavy metal extraction, but they have also revealed several negative side-effects. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of three natural low molecular weight organic acids (NLMWOA) (citric, oxalic, and tartaric acid) as an alternative to synthetic chelators. Slurry-, column-, toxicity- and phytoextraction experiments were performed. For the phytoextraction experiment the three NLMWOA were applied to a copper- and a lead-contaminated soil respectively. A significant increase in copper uptake was visible only in the citric acid treatment (67 mg kg−1) in comparison to the EDTA treatment (42 mg kg−1). The NLMWOA application showed no enhanced effect concerning the lead phytoextraction. A possible explanation for this lack of significance could be the rate of the degradation of NLMWOA. This rate might well be too high for these heavy metals with low mobility and bioavailability such as lead. The amounts of NLMWOA applied to the soil were very high (62.5 mmol kg−1 of soil) and the effect was too little. In this respect EDTA, which was applied in very small amounts (0.125 mmol kg−1) was more efficient. Thus making NLMWOA unsuitable to enhance phytoextraction of heavy metals from soil.

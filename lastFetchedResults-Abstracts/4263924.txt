In this paper, we present an improved automated system for classification of pathological image data of renal cell carcinoma. The task of analyzing tissue biopsies, generally performed manually by expert pathologists, is extremely challenging due to the variability in the tissue morphology, the preparation of tissue specimen, and the image acquisition process. Due to the complexity of this task and heterogeneity of patient tissue, this process suffers from inter-observer and intra-observer variability. In continuation of our previous work, which proposed a knowledge-based automated system, we observe that real life clinical biopsy images which contain necrotic regions and glands significantly degrade the classification process. Following the pathologistpsilas technique of focusing on selected region of interest (ROI), we propose a simple ROI selection process which automatically rejects the glands and necrotic regions thereby improving the classification accuracy. We were able to improve the classification accuracy from 90% to 95% on a significantly heterogeneous image data set using our technique.

In order to direct industries to develop new energy saving product and to improve the energy efficiency of their products, an energy saving product innovative design process model based on TRIZ/AD is presented in this paper. This model is built based on TRIZ ideal final result driven innovative design framework. Integrated axiomatic design with the concept of energy saving and multiple objective decisions marking model to minimize energy consumption for the total product life cycle. A practical example of oil cylinder is provided to illustrate the validation of the model.

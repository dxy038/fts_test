In the last years several learning systems have been developed trying, on a different extent, to develop a solution to the problem of personalization of the learning process. Their objective is to provide the learner with a learning system able to adapt the course to her specific characteristics, knowledge, objectives and learning goals. Further more, we would like a learning system that could be sensitive to the context in which the learning session is taking place and capable to adjust the appropriate parameters accordingly. Taking this into account, the authors have selected a group of desirable characteristics for an ideal learning system and have reviewed some of the solutions developed in the last years trying to find out which of those ideal characteristics have already been implemented and which others have not.

EDP Distribui&#231;a&#771;o´s policy is to minimize the negative impacts of its activities on biodiversity. Therefore, EDP wants to have a more active role in the conservation and the promotion of the natural Flora and Fauna. Continuing with the practice of defending the values of environmental preservation and quality of life, the company adopts, among others, the commitment to adapt its actions to the needs of biodiversity protection. The existence of thousands of km of Medium Voltage (MV) networks where lines are supported by rigid insulators requires a careful analysis of the factors that impact the quality of service of this type of technical assets. Despite being a discontinued technology, at least in Portugal, it is our mission to maintain and, if possible, increase the useful life of this asset. Unfortunately, the distance between the line and the pole arm is small, increasing the risk of electrocution of animals, mainly birds. The reduction of the number and duration of incidents which cause more or less prolonged interruptions in power supply at the customers´ level, with negative impacts on production processes, especially those of sensitive technologies, is an increasing concern at EDP Distribution. The EDP Distribuicao´s Network Maintenance and Technology Departments, together with Visabeira contractor, intends to perform an experiment with the objective of covering the conductor and tie through live working procedures. The conductor will initially be coated with a RTV mastic tape and, at a second stage, by a RTV silicone tape. The tie will undergo the same treatment.

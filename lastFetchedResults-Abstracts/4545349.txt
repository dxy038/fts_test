Privacy is gaining importance since more and more data becomes digitalized. There is also a growing interest from the security community because of the existing synergy between security and privacy. Unfortunately, the privacy development life cycle is less advanced than the security one. A clear classification into different objectives is not available yet. This paper attempts to scope the privacy landscape for software engineering by proposing an operational definition for privacy and by describing a privacy taxonomy. The taxonomy is rooted in the definition and presents a classification of privacy objectives, which correspond to the developerÂ´s goals. Each objective can be achieved by one or more strategies. As a validation for the taxonomy, existing privacy solutions are matched to each strategy.

Background and Objective: There is a high prevalence of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes in most populations. Therefore, interest in use of functional foods for the control of such diseases is of importance. The present study was designed to compare the effects of inulin and oligofructose-enriched inulin on glycemic indices and blood pressure in women with type 2 diabetes.
Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, 76 women with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. The intervention groups received 10g/d oligofructose-enriched inulin (n=27) or inulin (n=24) and the control group (n=25) received 10g/d maltodextrin for 8 weeks. Dietary intakes, anthropometric measurements, glycemic index and blood pressure were measured at the baseline and after 8 weeks of supplementation. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version11.5). Paired, ANOVA and ANCOVA were used to compare quantitative variables.
Results: At the end of the study significant decrease was observed in energy and carbohydrate intake, anthropometric indices, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c and serum insulin in intervention groups compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05). Decrease in carbohydrate intake (16.50%), serum insulin (18.50%) and insulin sensitivity index (QUICKI) (16.70%) was significant in inulin as compared to oligofructose-enriched inulin group. 
Conclusions: Probably, supplementation of diabetic women with fructans in particular with long chain fructan (inulin) via improving food intake, glycemic indices and blood pressure contributes to the management of type 2 diabetes.

Objective:Diagnosis of a cutaneous tumor mass in dog for the first time in IRAN.
Design: Case report.
Animal: An 11- year- old male Dachshund.
Procedure: The dog with a cutaneous mass in the left perineum, was referred to the Small Animal Clinic, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran. The dog was examined clinically and radiographs were taken from chest and ultrasonography of abdominal cavity was performed. The mass was removed surgically and fixed in buffered 10% formalin, tissue sections were made at 5p and stained with H&E.
Results: A firm,non pedunculated (2.6x2.2x lcm in diameter) mass was found macroscopically. The mass was umbilicated and ulcerated, overlying skin showed superficial necrotic layers. The cut surface was tan in color and lobulated with delicate collagenous stroma and areas of hemorrhages. Microscopically, the neoplastic cells were large, round to polyhedral with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct cell boundaries and a centrally located round, vesicular nuclei. The cells resmbled hepatocyte and generally showed disorderly growth and didn't form discrete lobules.Histopathologic examination revealed severe pleomorphism, frequent mitotic figures, areas of hemorrhages and the presence of scattered individual and small nests of invasive neoplastic cells in the supporting stromal connective tissue. Radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations revealed no metastases in thorax and abdominal cavity.
Clinical implications: According to location, macroscopic and histopathologic characteristics This mass was diagnosed as relatively well differentiated perianal glands adenocarcinoma. Hyperplasia and adenoma of perianal glands are frequently observed, however, it is the first report of perianal glands adenocarcinoma from Iran. J. Fac. Vet. Med. Univ. Tehran. 58, 1: 41-44, 2003.

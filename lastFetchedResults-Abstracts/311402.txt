Background. It has been suggested that the function of the first metatarsophalangeal joint may be related to the motion of the ankle joint complex.

Objective. This study explored the relationship between ankle joint complex and first metatarsophalangeal joint motion during gait in a group of 14 who demonstrated clinically limited passive hallux dorsiflexion in quiet standing (cases), and 15 matched controls.

Method. An electromagnetic tracking system was used to measure the ankle joint complex frontal plane motion and first metatarsophalangeal joint sagittal plane motion during gait, in both cases and controls. The case group was then evaluated further to investigate the effect of an orthosis on first metatarsophalangeal joint motion.

Findings. The correlation between maximum ankle joint complex eversion and maximum first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsiflexion during gait was r = 0.471. Within the case group, maximum rearfoot eversion was reduced following the application of the orthoses, but there was no change in sagittal first metatarsophalangeal joint rotations.

Interpretation. The relationship between maximum ankle joint complex eversion and first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsiflexion kinematics found in this study was moderate, and decreasing maximum ankle joint complex eversion with an orthosis did not result in any increase in first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsiflexion during gait in patients with functional first metatarsophalangeal joint limitation. These results do not support the assumption that ankle joint complex eversion influences first metatarsophalangeal joint motion substantially.

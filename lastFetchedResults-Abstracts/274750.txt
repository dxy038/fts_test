In order to provide navigational guidance during computer-integrated orthopedic surgery, the anatomy of the patient must first be registered to a medical image or model. A common registration approach is to digitize points from the surface of a bone and then find the rigid transformation that best matches the points to the model by constrained optimization. Many optimization criteria, including a least-squares objective function, perform poorly if the data include spurious data points (outliers). This paper describes a statistically robust, surface-based registration algorithm that we have developed for orthopedic surgery. To find an initial estimate, the user digitizes points from predefined regions of bone that are large enough to reliably locate even in the absence of anatomic landmarks. Outliers are automatically detected and managed by integrating a statistically robust M-estimator with the iterative-closest-point algorithm. Our in vitro validation method simulated the registration process by drawing registration data points from several sets of densely digitized surface points. The method has been used clinically in computer-integrated surgery for high tibial osteotomy, distal radius osteotomy, and excision of osteoid osteoma.

This paper, according to the statistical data of a survey for nearly two thousand college students in a university, introduces the method of multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to make the criterion of studentsÂ´ comprehensive quality. Data from our survey indicate that comprehensive quality of college students is generally in a good level. Specifically, the results illustrate that the psychological adaptability of students is excellent, whereas their social practices, practical ability and innovation ability perform well, however the fundamental knowledge of undergraduates is lacking. These conclusions could be used to guide university administrators and government officials to establish more effective methods to help college students obtain more developmental opportunities for employment. In order to make this assessment more objective and accurate, the evaluation methods of questionnaire and multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method for the corresponding algorithms are improved.

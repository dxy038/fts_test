Objective: Control of weight gain is an important strategy in reducing the diabetes incidence. Recently, herbal drugs have been used as a complementary and alternative medicinal care. This study was conducted to determine the effect of Ferula asafoetida on weight gain, fat accumulation, liver steatosis and leptin level.
Materials and Methods: All rats of control and treatment groups received daily tap water (P.O) as vehicle mixed with fructose 10%. Two treatment groups received FAF oleo-gum resin at doses of 25 or 50 mg/kg (P.O). Normal rats received only tap water and standard chow food.  Body weights, abdominal fat, size of epididymal adipocyte and serum leptin were recorded.
Result: Administration of Ferula asafoetida significantly decreased body weights, abdominal fat and size of epididymal adipocyte compared to untreated rats (P < 0.05). Levels of serum leptin were significantly decreased in treated rats (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: This study showed that Ferula asafoetida extract has anti-obesity, fat lowering effects and can prevent liver steatosis in type 2 diabetic rats. Reduction of serum leptin is associated with protective effects of Ferula asafoetida in obese diabetic rats.

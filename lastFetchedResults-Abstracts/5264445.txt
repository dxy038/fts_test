A novel non-isolated three-port converter (NI-TPC) is proposed interfacing one PV port, one bidirectional battery port and one load port. Single stage power conversion between any two of the three ports is achieved. The topology is derived by decoupling the bidirectional power flow path of the conventional structure into two unidirectional ones. Two of the three ports can be tightly regulated to achieve maximum power harvesting for PV or charge control for battery, and maintain the load voltage constant at the same time, while the third port is left flexible to compensate the power imbalance of the converter. Operation states are analyzed. The multi-regulator competition control strategy is presented to achieve autonomous and smooth state switching when the PV input power fluctuates. The analysis is verified by the experimental results.

Background and objective: Nowadays, waterpipe smoking (WPS) had a growing
trend especially among young people. The increased prevalence of tobacco
use among women is getting more concerned. Thus, this cross-sectional study
was carried out to examine the predicting factors affecting continued intention
of WPS among women consumers in the city of Bushehr, Iran by using the
theory of planned behavior.
Methods: In this cross sectional study, 430 women waterpipe tobacco smokers
living in Bushehr were examined using convenience and snowball sampling
methods. A researcher-made questionnaire was used to collect the data. After
data collection, data were analyzed using SPSS20 and appropriate statistical
tests, including descriptive statistics, analyze of variance (ANOVA), Pearson correlation
coefficient, Independent t-tests and linear regression.
Results: There was an association between continued intention of WPS and
marital status. Affective attitude (r= 0.57, p= 0.000), instrumental attitude (r=
0.44, p= 0.000), subjective norms (r= 0.26, p= 0.000), self-efficacy (r= -0.27, p=
0.000) and perceived behavioral control (r= -0.17, p= 0.000) was associated with
continued intention of WPS. Affective attitude was the strongest and subjective
norm was the weakest predictors of continued intention of WPS (R2=40%).
Conclusion: Regarding to the impact of personal attitudes on continued intention
of WPS, it is recommended that professionals should concentrate their attention
on changing attitudes, reinforce behavioral control and increasing their
self-efficacy in coping with WPS temptation among women consumers.

Grid computing is increasingly considered as a promising next-generation computational platform that supports wide-area parallel and distributed computing. In grid environments, applications are always regarded as workflows. The problem of scheduling workflows in terms of certain quality of service (QoS) requirements is challenging and it significantly influences the performance of grids. By now, there have been some algorithms for grid workflow scheduling, but most of them can only tackle the problems with a single QoS parameter or with small-scale workflows. In this frame, this paper aims at proposing an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to schedule large-scale workflows with various QoS parameters. This algorithm enables users to specify their QoS preferences as well as define the minimum QoS thresholds for a certain application. The objective of this algorithm is to find a solution that meets all QoS constraints and optimizes the user-preferred QoS parameter. Based on the characteristics of workflow scheduling, we design seven new heuristics for the ACO approach and propose an adaptive scheme that allows artificial ants to select heuristics based on pheromone values. Experiments are done in ten workflow applications with at most 120 tasks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

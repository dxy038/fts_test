Multimedia has at its very core the field of signal processing technology. The key attributes of neural processing essential to intelligent multimedia processing are presented. The objective is to show why neural networks are a core technology for efficient representation for audio/visual information. Also, it will be demonstrated how the adaptive neural network technology gives a unified solution to a broad spectrum of multimedia applications including image visualization, subject-based retrieval, face detection and recognitions. Region of interest (ROI) coding as well as multidescription coding functionalities are incorporated, too.

A chip for mapping Ethernet over 2.5 Gb/s SONET/SDH is presented. The chip is designed to provide mapping from data sources into SONET/SDH including Ethernet and IP frames. The chip is compatible with GFP, ITU-T X.86/Y.1323 and HDLC standard. Full-duplex data over 2.5 Gb/s SONET/SDH data mapping can be processed in real time. It also supports the unidirectional path switched rings (UPSR) and Bidirectional Line Switched Rings (BLSR) applications. It achieves a complete and stable path protection switch implementation. The chip is fabricated in TSMC 1.5V 0.13 um process, and has about 8M gates. It has been successfully used in many network communication systems.

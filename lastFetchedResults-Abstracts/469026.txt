Objective
The study was undertaken to investigate the outcome of pregnancies in Gaucher disease, particularly in enzyme-treated women.
Study design
A retrospectve study was performed of pregnant women evaluated at a referral clinic.
Results
There were 43 (17 treated, 26 untreated) women with 66 pregnancies (23 treated, 43 untreated). The live birth rate was 78.3% among treated, 86.0% among untreated. One treated woman had three spontaneous abortions; 3 untreated women had one each. Four pregnancies in each group had postpartum bleeding, 7 requiring transfusions. Postpartum infections were prevalent among treated. Cesarean sections were generally for historic reasons. There was no exacerbation of Gaucher disease, except one bone crisis.
Conclusion
Most untreated women with milder disease enjoyed an uncomplicated course. Enzyme-treated patients (ie, with more severe disease) had more bleeding and infections post partum, but few had spontaneous abortions. Hematologic consultation is recommended. A review of world experience with pregnant patients with Gaucher disease is included.

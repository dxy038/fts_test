In the frame of the activities related to ITER divertor R&amp;D, ENEA C.R. Brasimone was in charge by Fusion For Energy (F4E) to perform the assembly, the hydraulic tests and the theoretical simulation of the hydraulic behavior of the full scale divertor cassette prototype. The objective of these activities was aimed at the investigation of the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the full-scale divertor cassette both under steady state condition and during draining and drying operational transient. In particular, the steady state tests were focused on finally check whether the hydraulic design of the divertor components is able to ensure a uniform and proper cooling for the plasma facing components, with an acceptable pressure drop; whilst the transient ones were aimed at defining proper procedures for draining and drying the divertor cassette as well as for refilling it with water.

aper presents the results of the steady state and transient hydraulic experimental test campaigns performed at ENEA C.R. Brasimone as well as the relevant numerical analysis performed at the Department of Nuclear Engineering of the University of Palermo adopting the RELAP5 Mod3.3 thermal-hydraulic system code.

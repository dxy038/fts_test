Dynamic neural networks with different time-scales include the aspects of fast and slow phenomenons. Some applications require that the equilibrium points of these networks be stable. The objective of the paper is to develop sufficient conditions for stability of the dynamic neural networks with different time scales. Lyapunov function and singularly perturbed technique are combined to access several new stable properties of different time-scales neural networks. Exponential stability and asymptotic stability are obtained by sector and bound conditions. Compared to other papers, these conditions are simpler. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

Background: Benign ovarian cysts are common among both pre- and postmenstrual women. Surgical intervention for excision of an ovarian cyst is mandated when symptomatic, or chance for malignancy is high. The damaging effect of surgical ovarian cystectomy on ovarian reserve is debated in recent studies.
Objective: In the present study we investigated serum level of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) as an indicator of ovarian reserve before and after surgical cystectomy.
Materials and Methods: 60 patients with dermoid cyst, serous cystadenoma, and mucinous cystadenoma were recruited. Measurement of serum AMH was performed prior to surgery, and at one and 3 months after laparoscopic cystectomy. Serum AMH levels were compared before and after the surgery and between various types of ovarian cyst.
Results: Serum AMH level declined significantly after the surgery which recovered to 65% of its baseline value three months later.
Conclusion: Decreased serum AMH can be contributed to decreased ovarian reserve after laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. This can result from thermo-coagulation used for hemostasis during the operation.

The technical advances in microscopy imaging techniques have been applied to assess the fate of drugs for researching respiratory drug delivery in ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Recent developments in optical imaging (confocal microscopy, multi-photon microscopy, fluorescence imaging (FLI) and bioluminescence imaging (BLI)), and in non-optical imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computing tomography (CT), positron-emission tomography (PET) and single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT)) are presented with their derivative medical devices. Novel microscopy have been utilized to address many biological questions in basic research and are becoming powerful clinical tools for non-invasive objective diagnosis, guided treatment, and monitoring therapies. The goal of this paper is to present recent advances in microscopy imaging techniques and to discuss their novel applications in respiratory drug delivery imaging.

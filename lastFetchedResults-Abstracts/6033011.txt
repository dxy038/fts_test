This paper presents two three-phase AC motor drives configurations with a reduced component count. The configurations were conceived to operate with a reduced number of switches and boost inductors. The drives provide both bidirectional power flow and power factor control. The paper presents the analysis and control strategy of the systems, including current and PWM voltage controllers. Experimental and simulation results are presented

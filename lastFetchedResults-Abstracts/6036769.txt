This paper describes an innovative environment to develop real-time embedded signal processing based applications, and a suite of example applications that have been developed to assist in academic teaching of practical signal processing. The objective of this environment is algorithmic design and simulation, which itself is educational but it can also be used as a rapid prototyping tool, enabling students to experiment with real-time DSP applications in a variety of fields. The environment offers a wide range of libraries to support this, and it has an open hardware and software architecture enabling further expansion of its functionality.

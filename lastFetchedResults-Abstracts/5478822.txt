The objective of this paper is to compare the most widely used and the most recent speckle polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) filters. Two new conceptual approaches in PolSAR filtering are evaluated on simulated PolSAR images. The criteria of comparison includes indicator of speckle reduction capability, edge sharpness and preservation of scattering properties. Results indicate better performances with the partial differential equation (PDE) -based filters.

Relaying and cooperation have emerged as important research topics in wireless communication over the past half-decade. During cooperative communication, spatial diversity can be achieved by exploiting the relaying capabilities of the involved relay nodes, which may vastly enhance the achieved system capacity. The potential gains largely depend on the location of relay nodes. In this paper, we study the relay node placement problem for multi-pair cooperative communication in wireless networks, where a finite number of candidate relay nodes can be placed to help the transmission of multiple source-destination pairs. Our objective is to maximize the system capacity. After formulating the relay node placement problem, we comprehensively study the effect of relay location on cooperative link capacity and show several attractive properties of the considered problem. As the main contribution, we develop a geographic aware relay node placement algorithm which optimally solves the relay node placement problem in polynomial time. The basic idea is to place a set of relay nodes to the optimum locations so as to maximize the system capacity. The efficiency of our proposed algorithm is evaluated by the results of series experimental studies.

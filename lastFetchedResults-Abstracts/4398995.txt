Under the background of the rapid development of new energy technology, the concept of virtual power plant (VPP), which is composed of multiple types of DER, is proposed and a power system multi-objective optimization dispatching model of SCUC problem comprehensively considering total power generation costs, pollution treatment costs, unit start-up and stop costs is established and the node power transfer factor is introduced to deal with the static security constraints under DC load flow. The improved particle swarm optimization (IMPSO), a combination of PSO and Binary PSO (BPSO), is employed, and Matlab platform is used to solve the above model. At last, a case is adopted to prove the validity and feasibility of model and algorithm, which confirms that the research of VPP participating in dispatching is of far-reaching significance.

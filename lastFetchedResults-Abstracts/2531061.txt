Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of psychological wellbeing&nbsp;with variables of mindfulness and emotion regulation strategies, and then to identify&nbsp;which one predicts better psychological well-being.
Methods: We used a descriptive-analytical design for this study. A total of 243 students from 3&nbsp;Tehran universities were selected using the convenience sampling method. Three measurement&nbsp;instruments were used in this study: mindful attention awareness scale (MAAS), cognitive&nbsp;emotion regulation questionnaire (CERQ), and psychological well-being scale (PWS).&nbsp;The statistical analysis included the Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise regression&nbsp;analysis. Study variables were calculated with SPSS ver. 19.
Results: The results indicated that mindfulness and psychological well-being are positively&nbsp;correlated to most of the more adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and&nbsp;negatively correlated to most of the less adaptive ones. In the fifth model of regression&nbsp;analysis, positive reappraisal (Beta=0.27), catastrophizing (Beta=-0.24), refocus on planning&nbsp;(Beta=0.24), mindfulness (Beta=0.22), and acceptance (Beta=-0.10) were the best predictors&nbsp;of psychological well-being, consecutively, and together accounted for 46% of the variance.
Conclusion: Higher mindfulness and using more adaptive cognitive emotion regulation&nbsp;strategies are associated with higher psychological well-being. Regression analysis also&nbsp;suggests that higher levels of positive reappraisal, refocusing on planning, mindfulness, lower&nbsp;levels of catastrophizing, and acceptance predict higher levels of psychological well-being.

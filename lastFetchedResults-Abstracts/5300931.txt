As the electrical industry restructures many of the traditional algorithms for controlling generating units, they need either modification or replacement. The main objective of restructured system is to maximize its own profit without the responsibility of satisfying the forecasted demand. The Profit Based Unit Commitment (PBUC) is solved by Worst Fit Algorithm of Memory Management Algorithm (MMA). MMA approach is introduced in this paper considering power and reserve generating. The proposed method MMA uses Worst Fit allocation for generator scheduling in order to receive the maximum profit in large scale power system by considering the softer demand. Also this method gives an idea regarding how much power and reserve should be sold in markets. The proposed approach has been tested on a power system with 10 generating units. Simulation results of the proposed approach have been compared with the existing methods. It is observed that the proposed algorithm provides maximum profit with less computational time compared to existing methods.

In this demo paper we present Orange, a system prototype for objective-aware range query refinement. Orange essentially refines a range query to meet a pre-specified cardinality constraint while taking into account the (dis)similarity between the initial query and its corresponding refined version. To achieve this goal, Orange employes the novel scheme SAQR for efficient similarity-aware query refinement. The main idea underlying SAQR is to utilize the pre-defined constraints on cardinality and similarity in order to bound the search space and quickly find a refined query, which meets the userÂ´s expectations. We showcase Orange in a web-based application which aims to guide planners in allocating service zones for police patrol units using real and historical dataset of crime incidents.

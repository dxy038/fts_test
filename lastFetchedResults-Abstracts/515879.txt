The objective of the present study was to point out differentapproaches for background limits assessment of Zn and Hg. Background limitsobtained by graphical methods (cumulative probability plot-CDF and boxplot) were similar for Zn (about 100 mg/kg-1), while background limits for Hg weredifferent (from 0.2 mg kg-1 to 0.3 mg kg-1). For three empirical methods, besidesnatural data, log-transformed ones were used. Results from log-transformed limitswere higher than from natural (except classical methods for Hg). The most of theterritory of Eastern Serbia has low content of these elements, whose backgroundlimits calculated using log-transformed data by [Median+2MAD] methods (73 mgkg-1 for Zn and 0.15 mg kg-1 for Hg) are the most suitable (MAD-median of theabsolute deviations from the dataâ€²s median). On the part of area with elevatedelements content, background limits were determined using log-transformed databy methods with the highest values: for Zn it was [Mean+2Sdev], and for Hg boxplot (166 mg kg-1 and 0.41 mg kg-1 for Zn and Hg respectively).

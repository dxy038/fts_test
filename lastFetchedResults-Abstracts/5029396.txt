Electromechanical rotary joints containing multiple mechanical &amp; electrical components are widely used to transfer power and signal (voice, data &amp; of late video too) information from one stationary electromechanical structure /member called Stator to another rotating member of same assembly called Rotor in large platforms like Naval ships, Combat Vehicles etc. The design challenges involved in such devices are plenty and one such new design for the futuristic application undertaken by our Project team faced a material selection challenge and same is described in this paper. Choice of materials for mechanical components/subassemblies besides the main housing structure is of technical importance. Fully assembled Rotary joint duly mounted and driven by suitable driving mechanism, needs to meet certain stringent mechanical, electrical and environmental specifications, particularly for defence applications. The main objective of the design was met from proper choice of materials, which are implementable through the process of castings, machining, fabrication of number of components and completing their assembly. The material selection process for various component designs is in full compliance with the technical requirements projected by the user. Design is done in such a way that it is cost effective and efficient.

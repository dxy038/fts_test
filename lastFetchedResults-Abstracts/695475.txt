The presence of helminth eggs (Ascaris eggs) in sewage sludge may constitute a sanitary risk when used as agricultural fertiliser. Sanitisation of sewage sludge can be achieved by treatment with quick lime, a process that destroys sludge pathogens in two ways: pH increase and temperature rise. Among the pathogens of epidemiological relevance, Ascaris eggs are the most resistant to liming, and, hence, may serve as indicators of hygienic quality of biosolids. This research aims at defining, between 50째C and 60째C, the time required in the case of limed sludge to obtain a product with a negligible level of viable Ascaris eggs. To achieve this objective, investigations on inactivation kinetics of Ascaris eggs were conducted in the following products: contaminated milk of lime; naturally contaminated sludge treated with slaked lime and heat; naturally contaminated sludge treated with quick lime; and sludge treated at full scale with quick lime. For the inactivation kinetics where a negligible level of Ascaris eggs was reached, the inactivation threshold was determined. Depending on the experimental situation, the inactivation threshold period was found to fluctuate between 5 and 75 min at 55째C and between 1 and 8 min at 60째C.

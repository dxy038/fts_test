An important goal, within the context of improving climate change modelling, is to enhance our understanding of aerosols and their radiative effects (notably their indirect impacts as cloud condensation nuclei). Ice-crystal size and cloud optical depth (COD) are two key parameters whose variation strongly influences radiative effects in the Arctic environment. The presence, for example, of sulfuric-acid bearing aerosols can significantly change ice-particle size formation leading to cooling the low troposphere during the Polar-winter. The objective of this research is to retrieve ice particle size and COD using infrared radiometry. In this communication we will define a candidate retrieval algorithm and present some preliminary retrievals applied to ground-based thermal infrared (TIR) data acquired at the PEARL, high-Arctic site at Eureka, Nunavut, Canada (80&#194;&#176;N). We also show that Far infrared radiometry (FIR) from satellite can improve the detection and analysis of ice clouds in the Arctic.

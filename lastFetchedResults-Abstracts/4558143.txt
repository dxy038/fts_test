A typical DC microgrid, which can be enabled by Solid State Transformer (SST), is investigated in this paper. One unidirectional DC/DC converter for photovoltaic (PV), one bidirectional DC/DC converters for battery, and a SST based on distribution system level, are included in the proposed DC microgrid system. In order to manage the system operation, a distributed power management strategy is proposed. In the proposed control algorithm, not only the DC microgrid system can interface to the distribution system, but each module in the system can be distributed based on its own characteristics. Experimental results verify that the proposed power management strategy can be applied to a DC microgrid stably and achieve good performance.

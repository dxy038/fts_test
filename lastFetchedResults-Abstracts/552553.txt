Objective: Hepatitis B is an endemic serious disease in many parts of the world. A significant proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis B are infected with a variant form of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which has a low or abolished hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) production. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B cases in Khuzestan province. Subjects and Methods: One hundred and sixty-two patients (102 men and 60 women; mean age 31+11.16 years) with chronic hepatitis B infection (HBsAg+/HBV DNA+) in Khuzestan province were included. Their HBeAg status was assessed using enzyme immunoassay (ELISA).

Results: Of the 162 patients with HBsAg+/HBV DNA+, 99 (61.1%) were HBeAg negative and 63 (38.9%) were HBeAg positive. The mean age ±SD in the former group was 33.1 ±9.9 and in the latter group was 27.7+12.2 years (P<0.00l). HBeAg status had close correlation with age. The results showed no significant correlation between ALT levels and HBeAg negativity.

Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B has a high prevalence in Khuzestan province.

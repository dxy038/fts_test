Abstract 
Background:A new treatment approach attempting to improve 
cognitive deficits is cognitive rehabilitation, the effectiveness of which 
needs to be assessed. 
Objective:The aim of the present research was to investigate the 
effectiveness of the cognitive rehabilitation in reconstructing the 
executive functions in obsessive compulsive disorder patients. 
Method:The research method was semi-experimental with 
pretest-posttest control group design. The population consisted of 300 
individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder, out of which 30 
patients (experimental group= 15, control group=15) were selected 
using conventional sampling method. The research data were gathered 
using three tests, including the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the 
Stroop Color and Word Test, and the Wechsler Digit Span subtest, and 
were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. 
Findings:The findings showed that the rehabilitation plan had a 
positive effect on improvement of conceptualization and mental 
flexibility (P < 0.01). The cognitive rehabilitation also had an effect on 
initiative and mental planning in patients. That is, the plan had a 
positive effect on decreasing the response time in cards one, two, and 
three. In other words, the plan had a significant effect on the initiation 
and planning variable in experimental group (P < 0.01). The results also 
showed that the plan had no effect on response inhibition (0.05 < P). 
The plan also improved hearing memory in the patients (P < 0.01). 
Conclusion:Generally speaking, in this study, the cognitive 
rehabilitation plan improved mental flexibility, initiation and planning, 
and hearing memory in obsessive compulsive disorder patients. 
However, it had no positive effect on response inhibition. Therefore, 
cognitive rehabilitation iseffective in in reconstructing the executive 
functions in patients with compulsive obsessive disorder.

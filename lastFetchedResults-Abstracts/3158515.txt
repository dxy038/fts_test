To improve the performance of center-less network, appropriate strategies and algorithms of task-resource matching are of importance. Some of QoS guided algorithms based on Min-Min have been investigated while flexibility and multi-QoS constraints of them need to be further researched. Firstly, task-resource matching methods in center-less network are reviewed. Secondly, a multi-QoS constrained task-resource matching algorithm, TRMA, is represented. TRMA is efficient, scalable and objective in optimizing matching process in our experiments.

In the present study, a series of N-{4-[(4-amino-5-sulfanyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)methyl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl}-2-substituted-amide (1aâ€“d) derivatives were synthesized in good yields and characterized by IR, 1H NMR, mass spectral and elemental analyses. The compounds were evaluated for their preliminary in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhosa and then were screened for antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Rv strain by broth microdilution assay method. The antibacterial data of the tested compounds indicated that most of the synthesized compounds showed better activity against bacteria compared to reference drugs. The in vitro antitubercular activity reports of tested compounds against M. tuberculosis strain H37 Rv showed moderate to better activity.

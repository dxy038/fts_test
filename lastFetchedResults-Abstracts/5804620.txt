In this paper, the Belitskii normal form, which is valid for nonlinear vector fields, is extended to nonlinear control systems with a scalar control input, dependent on some physical parameters. The objective is to find suitable local coordinates such that the considered nonlinear system is as simple as possible, in the Poincare&#769;-Dulac sense. As expected, the structure of the normal form is heavily dependent on the properties of the nominal linear approximation.

The coordination of companies in the supply chain (SC) is a pillar for achieving better overall performance. Although this problem is often studied, research does not usually take into account the influence of the relationships amongst companies on the supply chain performance. We have proposed a collaborative coordination model for the SCM. We have suggested a taxonomy of collaborative situations which influence information processing all along the SC. We also proposed reference models for coordination based on this taxonomy. In this paper, we illustrate information processing in the planning processes of a supply chain, according to these different collaborative situations and to the corresponding reference models. The objective of this paper is to illustrate by way of examples the benefit of each company to process information according to a collaborative coordination model.

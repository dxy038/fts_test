Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether digital examination introduces vaginal organisms into the cervix. Study Design: Thirty-five women with reported ruptured membranes at ≥34 weeks’ gestation underwent a sterile speculum examination and a standardized semiqualitative, semiquantitative endocervical culture before and immediately after digital cervical examination. Results: Cultures taken before digital examination demonstrated a mean of 2.8 ± 1.7 different types of organisms, whereas cultures taken after digital examination demonstrated a mean of 4.4 ± 1.5 different types of organisms (P< .0001). Twenty-eight patients (80%) had heavier growth or a greater number of different organisms in the postexamination culture than in the pre-examination culture. The state of the fetal membranes (ruptured as opposed to intact) did not alter these relationships. Conclusion: An immediate effect of digital examination is the introduction of vaginal organisms into the cervical canal. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:578-80.)

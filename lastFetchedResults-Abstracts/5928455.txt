Systematic thought (such as Christian theology) has primarily been investigated using literature-based approaches, with texts that are usually more abstract and subjective in nature than scientific papers. However, as systematic ideas and thought influence all areas of human activity and thinking, the application of scientific methodologies such as bibliometrics, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and other information technologies may provide a more objective understanding of systematic thought. This paper introduces four methods of quantitative analysis for interpretation of the Bible in a scientific manner. The methods are citation analysis for interpreterÂ´s texts, vocabulary analysis for translations, variant text analysis for canonical texts, and evaluation method for rhetorical structure.

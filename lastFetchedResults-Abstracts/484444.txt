The aim of present study is to provide an appropriate model for assessment of life quality in rural areas. First, a definition of life quality is presented based on two subjects: human need and individual satisfaction. This definition considers life quality as a multidimensional concept which is a result of interaction between objective and subjective factors. Second, a set of minimum necessities for rural communities are identified which are required anywhere and anytime. Finally, a general model is presented for assessment of the quality of rural life based on human needs and accompanied by indices and descriptives for its assessment. The results indicate that the assessment of life quality in rural areas is a complex phenomenon and in its examination time and locational conditions should be considered simultaneously. Despite this, the proposed model has the potential to apply in different situations.

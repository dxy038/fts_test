To determine whether a correlation exists between the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Aesthenia, Strain (GRBAS) scale (a subjective measure of voice) and the Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP) scale (an objective measure of voice). A retrospective review of 37 voice patients (12 male/25 female) was conducted. Each voice was perceptually evaluated using the GRBAS scale by an experienced speech pathologist and acoustically analyzed using the MDVP scale. Statistical analysis using a multivariate regression model identified a significant correlation between the noise-related parameters of MDVP and the components of the GRBAS scale. Grade correlated with voice turbulence index (VTI), noise harmonic ratio (NHR), and soft phonation index (SPI). Roughness correlated with NHR only. Breathiness correlated with SPI only. Aesthenia also correlated with SPI only. Of the 19 acoustic variables measured by the MDVP system, only three noise parameters significantly correlated with the GRBAS perceptual voice analysis. Perhaps â€œnoiseâ€‌ is the perceived acoustical quality of the dysphonic voice. A voice quantifying measure such as a â€œvoice index scoreâ€‌ could be proposed using the GRBAS scoring and the three clinically relevant MDVP values following further studies.

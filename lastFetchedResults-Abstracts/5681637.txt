A fuzzy production system for multiobjective scheduling is described in this paper. Based on the heuristic search principle in AI, this system takes the heuristic algorithms used for finding optimal or quasi optimal sequences of different single objectives as the production rules, and the fuzzy min-operator with nonlinear membership function as the test criterion. It is able to find an optimal or quasi-optimal processing sequence to meet many different objective functions simultaneously.

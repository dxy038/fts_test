Objective: To determine the prevalence of sub clinical hypothyroidism (hyperthyrotropinemia) in obese school children  Methodology: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Department of Chemistry, Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan, from June 2007 to August 2010 including eight primary schools of Dera Ismail Khan having mixed population with some of the wards belonging to high socioeconomic group. Thorough clinical examination excluded those suffering from chronic health problems. Height and weight of each child was taken according to standard anthropometric procedures. Body mass index and body mass status of each study subject was calculated according to Quetelet's Index and WHO criteria respectively. A total of 83 school children (6-11 years) were randomly selected among 1336 children. The sample included 23 (27.71%) normal weight children and 60 (72.28%) obese. Gender wise distribution of the sample was 48 (57.83%) boys and 35 (42.16%) girls. Free Thyroxin (FT4) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) were measured using radioimmunoassay. Results Hyperthyrotropinemia was the most commonly observed thyroid hormone dysfunction (8.43%) in the whole sample (n=83) and 8.33% in obese children compared with 3-8% in general population of the United States. Conclusion: Sub clinical hypothyroidism is the most common finding in the childhood obesity. The prevalence of sub clinical hypothyroidism in the present study is 8.43% in the whole sample (n=83) compared with 3-8% in general population of the United States. It is suggested that all the obese children expressing minimum organ abnormalities be investigated to prevent the irreversible problems over the course of many years.

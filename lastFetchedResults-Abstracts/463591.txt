OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine some of the classic concepts about the histologic features of the uterine septum.
STUDY DESIGN: Four biopsy specimens were taken from 16 patients with septate uteri during Tompkins metroplasty: biopsy A from the septum near the serosal layer, biopsy B from the midpoint of the septum, biopsy C from the tip of the septum, and biopsy D from the left posterior aspect of the uterus away from the septum. Thirteencharacteristics were examined in these specimens by means of mean ridit analysis and Bonferroni criteria for multiple comparisons in relation to connective tissues (four characteristics), muscles (four characteristics), and vessels (five characteristics).
RESULTS: In the septum the mean ridit score was less for the amount of connective tissues (p< 0.001) and higher for the amount of muscle tissue (p< 0.025), amount of muscle interlacing (p< 0.05), and vessels with a muscle wall (p< 0.005). However, the Bonferroni criterion for multiple comparisons was only significant for the amount of connective tissue (p< 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings of less connective tissue in the septum, which was confirmed by the Bonferroni criterion for multiple comparisons and the mean ridit results for the three other significant findings, were contrary to the classic view about the histologic features of the septum.

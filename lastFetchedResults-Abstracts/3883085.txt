We propose a bilateral switching poly-Si junction device to realize a crossbar array with a perpendicular spin-transfer torque (STT) magnetic random access memory (MRAM). An N<sup>+</sup> /P/N<sup>+</sup> bilateral junction device with two bias terminals provides bidirectional current flow enough to write STT MRAM by a drain induced barrier lowering under a reverse bias of N<sup>+</sup>/P. In addition, asymmetrical doping for two N<sup>+</sup> terminals provides a high on-off ratio of 10<sup>7</sup> under read condition, which is acceptable for a crossbar array. From this work, it is expected that a bilateral poly-Si junction will be a promising switch device to achieve crossbar architecture with a perpendicular STT MRAM.

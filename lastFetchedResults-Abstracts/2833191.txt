Wireless power transfer (WPT) can be an effective way to solve the energy supply problems in electric railways (ER). In order to develop the desired system, design optimization can be a solution to optimize the objective function (e.g. mass of a system, transfer efficiency, and air-gap) while satisfying constraints such as electromagnetic field (EMF), magnetic saturation, and induced voltage. In this paper, the optimization framework for the railway-specific WPT systems was developed by connecting between an optimization module and the electromagnetic commercial software. The framework was then applied to minimize the mass of a WPT system of the Wireless Low Floor Tram (WTRAM) under the multiple constraints. As a result of optimization, the mass of the system could be successfully reduced by 64.3% while the performance-related constraints were being satisfied. The proposed framework would help us to reduce time and cost for the development of next-generation ER systems.

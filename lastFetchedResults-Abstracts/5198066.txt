The Vice Chancellor would like to commend the Global Entrepreneurship and Research Innovation Center, Universiti Malaysia Kelantan for its joint-effort with the Center of Applied Management; together with the Accounting Research Institute, Universiti Teknologi MARA Malaysia; for the initiative and commitment to bring together researchers, stakeholders and those of like minds to exchange knowledge and share experiences that will ultimately enhance socie tal well-being. Hence, he believes congratulations are in order for all parties involved in the successful organization of the International Conference on Innovation, Management and Technology Research 2012. Organizing an international conference is not a simple task at all. The conference is indeed timely as it fits in well with the focus given by the Ministry of Higher Educ a tion (MoHE) of Malaysia to enhance collaboratio n between universities around the nation; which is in turn aligned with the objective of the New Economy Model (NEM). We are well aware that this enhancement plan, whic h also sp ells out a process of collaboration, is aimed at unlocking the potential inherent in the university, to be duly exploited in a manner that would benefit all.

Quality data were initially collected on 78 pork loins from crossbred pigs fed diets containing 0, 1.25 or 2.5% magnesium mica (MM). Loins were then vacuum-packaged, and randomly assigned to either 4 or 8 weeks of storage at 2Â°C. Dietary MM had no (P &gt; 0.05) effect on moisture loss/retention or subjective and objective color measurements. Purge volume increased (P&lt;0.05) and drip loss decreased (P&lt;0.05) as storage time increased. Moreover, longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LM) chops became lighter (P&lt;0.05), redder (P&lt;0.05), and more yellow (P&lt;0.05) during 8 weeks of storage. Although TBARS values increased linearly (P&lt;0.001) during extended storage, LM chops from pigs fed 2.5% MM tended to have lower (P&lt;0.07) TBARS values after 4 weeks of storage than chops from pigs fed 0 and 1.25% MM. After 8 weeks of storage, however, there was a tendency for TBARS values of chops from pigs fed 1.25% MM to be lower (P&lt;0.07) than chops from pigs fed 2.5% MM. Even though feeding swine diets containing MM did not affect color and water-holding capacity of pork loins during storage, the data indicated inclusion of MM in swine diets may retard onset of oxidative rancidity in vacuum-packaged pork loins.

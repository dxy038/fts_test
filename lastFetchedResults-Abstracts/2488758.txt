Objective: Boron (B) is essential for plant development and might be an essential micronutrient
for animals and humans. This study was conducted to characterize the impact
of boric acid (BA) on the cellular and molecular nature of differentiated rat bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, BMSCs were extracted and expanded
to the 3rd passage, then cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) complemented
with osteogenic media as well as 6 ng/ml and 6 ?g/ml of BA. After 5, 10, 15
and 21 days the viability and the level of mineralization was determined using MTT assay
and alizarin red respectively. In addition, the morphology, nuclear diameter and cytoplasmic
area of the cells were studied with the help of fluorescent dye. The concentration of
calcium, activity of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as well as sodium and potassium
levels were also evaluated using commercial kits and a flame photometer respectively.
Results: Although 6 ?g/ml of BA was found to be toxic, a concentration of 6 ng/ml increased
the osteogenic ability of the cell significantly throughout the treatment. In addition
it was observed that B treatment caused the early induction of matrix mineralization
compared to controls.
Conclusion: Although more investigation is required, we suggest the prescription of a
very low concentration of B in the form of BA or foods containing BA, in groups at high risk
of osteoporosis or in the case of bone fracture.

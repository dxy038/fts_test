Objective—To audit a series of isolated unilateral fractures of the mandibular condyle treated in a number of units in the United Kingdom. Design—Prospective confidential multicentre audit with review by a single external examiner between July 1993 and January 1994. Setting—Nine Maxillofacial units. Pro-formas were alphanumerically coded. Units are referred to by code letter. Subjects—142 patients with fractures of the mandibular condyle. Main outcome measures—Pain, crepitus, interincisal opening, mandibular deviation on movement, occlusion and posteroanterior and lateral radiographic analysis by a single examiner.
Results—Of the 142 patients, 135 over the age of 12 years had unilateral condylar fractures. Seventy-three attended appointments at both 6 and 12 weeks. Forty-one had identifiable symptoms attributable to the injury at 12 weeks, and most of these had fracture displacements or dislocations which had not been openly reduced. There was a 50–85% positive correlation between radiographic findings of the first clinician and the external auditor. Open reduction and internal fixation was uncommon.
Conclusions—Follow-up studies of trauma patients are difficult because of poor attendance. Fractures of the mandibular condyle should be treated by specialists in the management of facial fractures. Accurate clinical and radiographic diagnosis is more difficult than commonly supposed. Fracture displacements and dislocations have a suboptimal outcome in nearly 30% of cases. More should be spent to improve care of these patients. A consensus on objective indicators of satisfactory outcome is needed to establish a ‘gold standard’ and close the audit loop

At present the diagnosis of melanoma is mainly performed based on the experience of each doctor. The doctors need some objective measure for diagnosis of melanoma and nevus. But there are few researches on objective index for the diagnosis. This workr deals with features of melanoma and nevus for computer diagnosis. First, we extracted the contour of lesions with image processing. One hundred five values of features were computed based on ABCD-rule. Discriminant analysis showed the accuracy of 96.0% (specificity of 98.3 % and the sensitivity of 90.0%). The results obviously showed the difference between melanoma and nevus.

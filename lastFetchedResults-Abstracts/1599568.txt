The objective of the present study was to prepare controlled release formulation of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride ocular nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were prepared by solvent displacement method using Eudragit RL 100 as a polymer. Different formulations were prepared by varying the ratios of drug and polymer and varying the ratios of organic and aqueous phase. The formulations were evaluated in terms of particle size, FTIR, drug entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release profile was examined. The anti bacterial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria were determined. In vivo studies were carried out by Draize test. The mean particle size for drug loaded formulations was found to be below 200 nm. The zeta potential remained in the range of positive values for all batches +10 mV to +40mV. The formulation possesses good antibiotic activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilus and Staphylococcus aureus microorganism and no eye irritation on in-vivo testing.

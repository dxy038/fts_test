In cellular network, mobility management has allowed mobile subscribers to move freely across different networks while maintaining its quality of service for a variety of applications. Location management is one of the main tasks of mobility management. The location management cost depends mainly on subscribersÂ´ mobility behavior and its performance which is typically measured by the number of location update performed and the number of cells paged. The objective of this research is to propose, validate and evaluate the performance of location update scheme using fuzzy logic technique for cellular radio system. Three metrics: speed, user density and residence time are proposed and used for fuzzy evaluation. The results of using fuzzy logic technique show that location management cost reduction using Fuzzy logic in cellular radio network using fuzzy logic is decreased about 2% and outperforms the conventional mechanism.

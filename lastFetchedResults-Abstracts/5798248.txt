Digital audio watermarking is adopted for many multimedia applications such as copyright management, music indexing, broadcast monitoring etc. Audio watermarking hides copyright information into the digital audio signal. Simple audio watermarking provides copyright information but authentication/security of the audio can be achieved by using a chaotic sequence in the watermarking process. For which Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) along with Arnold Transform is proposed to describe audio watermarking and its authentication. Subjective and objective tests unveil that the proposed watermarking scheme preserves high quality and is simultaneously more robust to different attacks. Performance of the algorithm has been compared with the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Arnold transform based method.

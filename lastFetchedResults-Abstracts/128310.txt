Introduction: Dysmenorrhea is a common gynecologic disorder that at least half of women experience it in their reproductive period. The most important cause of primary dysmenorrhea is the enhancement of prostaglandin production and their role in appearance of the pain.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of Mefenamic Acid and fish oil with Mefenamic Acid alone in reduction of the severity of pain in primary dysmenorrhea.
Materials and Methods: This study was designed as a double blind crossover trial. 60 women with primary dysmenenorrhea presenting to Zahedan Ghods hospital clinic were selected as presenting sample and divided into two groups 1 and 2 alternately. First group used Mefenamic Acid and Fish oil for 2 first months, then they didn't take any treatment for 2 months and then used Mefenamic Acid with the previous dose and similar placebo for 2 months. Second group used this therapeutic regime reversely.
Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the response to treatment.
Results: The results indicated that the efficacy of prescription of Mefenamic Acid and Fish oil in reduction of the severity of the pain is significantly more than Mefenamic Acid and placebo.
Conclusion: So, it is recommended to use Mefenamic Acid and fish oil instead of increasing dosage of NSAIDS.

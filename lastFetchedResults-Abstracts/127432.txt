Inheritance of stein colour was studied using JG62 with purple stem colour (pigmentation) and ICCV2 with green stern color. The objective of this study was to determine the mode of inheritance of stem colour in chickpea. The studied were carried out during the RAAI season 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 at the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropic (ICRISAT). Patancheru near Hyderabad A.P. 502 324, India. The experimental material comprised of parents, F,, F2, BC'P1. BC, P2 generations and 126 RILs. The F2 population of this cross segregated into 3: pigmentation I : non-pigmentation. The results for RILs and BC1P1 showed a good fit to the expected 1:1 for pigmentation and non-pigmentation. The F3 population exhibited 1:2:1 ratio for pigmentation, segragated and non-pigmentation stem colour. All stems for F1 and BC1P7 were purple. The results of the present study revealed the stem color is controlled by single gene (B) and pigmentation is dominant to non-pigmentation.

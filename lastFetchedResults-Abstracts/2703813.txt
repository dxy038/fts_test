This paper introduces a novel catalytic mobile micro/nanorobot made only of platinum that realizes nanometer locomotion in hydrogen peroxide solution. The innovative mechanism and principle of the nanorobot are presented. A simple and effective fabrication process by focused ion beam and a stable manipulation method of the nanorobot are demonstrated. The nanorobot can steer or navigate by its finely designed geometry, and keep a stable rotational motion rather than arbitrary and uncertain movement. This paper evaluates the influence of some critical factors on the movement of the nanorobot, such as the concentration and temperature of the hydrogen peroxide solution, and the geometry of a nanorobot. The control of the nanorobotÂ´s movement can be realized based on the result of this evaluation. Compared with previous studies, this catalytic platinum nanorobot realizes bidirectional rather than unidirectional movement. The Langevin equation is used to describe the dynamic model of the platinum nanorobot.

Overtime open source software (OSS) is receiving attention from industry. The growth rate is unprecedented. The software industry is inclining towards adopting OSS despite concerns about the quality. Defect management has been a key issue in OSS. Software whether it is close or open source uses energy. Green computing argued that environmental conditions are getting worst and use of power consumptions should be minimized to protect the earth. A lot of work has been reported in the area of green hardware but very little work has been reported in making software green. The main objective this work is to increase understanding of green software development. In this study, we empirically investigate that whether there is relationship between defect management in OSS and power consumption of OSS application. We used a dataset consist of 82 OSS projects to study the research model of this investigation. The results of this investigation show that software defect management in OSS play a significant role in managing power consumption of OSS applications.

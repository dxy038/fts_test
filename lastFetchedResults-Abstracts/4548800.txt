The objective of this research is to employ Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for electrical load profiles estimation to ensure proper power usage measurement of the customers. ICA technique is able to separate the mixed signal into their source signals. Using this method, the load profiles on feeder distribution can be estimated without any knowledge of the network topology and electrical parameters. In addition, a real-time load profiles on feeder distribution can be established instead of load modeling technique by using incoming distribution feeder data profiles. The estimation quality is verified by using error measures of the load profiles. Simulation results and errors of estimations are discussed in this paper.

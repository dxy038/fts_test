"Two-oriented" society development model is a kind of scientific development model about the social, economic and natural subsystems in a certain period and space. Through the simulation study, statistical research, comparative study on the three subsystems and their natural, social and economic factors that are closely relative to the "Two-oriented" social construction and development, taking into account of time, space, coordination between various systems, sustainable development requirements, we enacted the framework of "Two-oriented" society and his evaluation modes on the composite index and the coordination development index. Unifying the evaluation system (which is closely relative to "Two-oriented" social construction) into the research of composite development index and coordination development index, we not only highlight the "Two-oriented" social development direction, but also the "Two-oriented" social development speed, so as to service for the "Two-oriented" social overall objective of coordination development together.

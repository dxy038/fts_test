This paper focuses on the concept that Adjunct Language Instruction (ALI) functions effectively when the teaching conduct, preferred materials and materials matching the learners´ proficiency act as contributing factors in the effectiveness of ALI as shown by the ALI model produced by Ref [14]. This objective of this paper is to highlight Schema Theory as an additional factor which helps learners in an ALI class to write reports. Possessing relevant schema helps in the understanding of the content. We propose that the ALI factors (Teaching conduct, Preference for materials and Proficiency), are necessary conditions which would activate learners´ content schema and aid understanding of a given task. The notion that ALI factors which rekindles relevant schema are important considerations when planning a lesson. Likewise, language teaching also can be enhanced effectively if content from core course subjects such as physics, are used as basis for writing in the English language lesson.

Background and Objectives: Because of impairment of testosterone production and occurrence of oxidant disorders in testis of varicocele (VCL) patients, these patients are treated with testosterone and various antioxidant. This study was performed with the objective of determining the effect of co-administration of these two drugs on the serum biochemical parameters of rats. 
 
Methods: In this study, 30 male rats were divided into 5 groups (n=6, each) of control-sham and test groups. In the control-sham group, only simple laparotomy was performed. In the test groups, experimental VCL was induced in all test groups. No treatment was performed for the first test group. The second test group was treated with testosterone (44Âµg/kg, ip), the third group with vitamin E (150mg/kg, orally) and the fourth group with co-administration of testosterone and vitamin E. After the end of treatment period, anesthesia and heart blood sampling were performed, and after serum separation, serum levels of glucose, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, and triglyceride were measured. The data were analyzed using      two-way variance analysis. The significance level was considered to be p < 0.05.  

Results: In this study, the serum levels of the glucose, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, and triglyceride significantly increased following VCL induction, as compared to control group (p < 0.05). This was while single administration of testosterone and                 co-administration with vitamin E significantly reduced the serum levels of mentioned parameters (p < 0.05). 
 
Conclusion: The results showed that co-administration of testosterone and vitamin E, in comparison with separate administration of each compound, improved the serum biochemical parameters in VCL-induced animals.

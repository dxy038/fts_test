We propose a bidirectional radio-over-fiber link consisting of an optical downlink transmission employing the optical frequency multiplication principle, a remote local oscillator (LO) generation, a remote down-conversion of the radio-frequency uplink signals, and an optical uplink transmission employing intensity modulation-direct detection. Experiments demonstrate the optical up-conversion of 64-level quadrature amplitude modulated radio signals to 17.8 GHz after transmission over 4.4 km of multimode fiber, 12.5 and 25 km of single-mode fiber in the downlink; the uplink performance is evaluated in terms of down-conversion loss employing the optically generated LO.

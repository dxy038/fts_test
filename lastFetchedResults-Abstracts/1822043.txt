Background and objective
rease in intrapulpal pressure occurs during inflammation and restorative procedures; however, the role of the pressure on human dental pulp cell (HDPC) is not yet clarified. In this study, the effect of pressure on interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression of HDPCs was examined.

were applied with pressure (0.7â€“1.4 g/cm2). The level of IL-6 mRNA and protein release was determined by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. The signalling pathways were investigated using inhibitors, antagonists, and small interfering RNA.
s
sults showed that pressure up-regulated IL-6 mRNA expression and protein release in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The implication of P2Y receptor was exhibited by a significant inhibition of pressure-induced IL-6 expression by suramin, an antagonist for the non-specific purinergic receptor family. Using loss of function experiments, we showed MRS2578 (a specific P2Y6 antagonist), as well as P2Y6 small interfering RNA, abolished pressure-induced IL-6, whilst MRS2179 (a specific P2Y1 antagonist) and NF449 (a P2X1, P2X3, P2Y1, and P2Y2 antagonist) had no effect. Finally, we demonstrated that either the conditioned medium collected from pressurised dental pulp cells or addition of UDP, a selective agonist of P2Y6, up-regulated IL-6 expression in HDPCs.
sions
results indicate that pressure could induce IL-6 expression through the P2Y6 receptor in HDPCs, leading to a new insight of the role of pressure on cytokine release during pulpal inflammatory process.

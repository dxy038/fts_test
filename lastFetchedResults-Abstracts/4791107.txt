Through the paper, our goal is to drive a car with the help of thin film based solar cell. Mechanical and Electrical parts are assembled thereby. The main objective of this project is to collect maximum solar energy from the solar spectrum and use that solar energy to drive the car. Amorphous silicon based thin film solar panel has been used instead of crystalline silicon to convert more solar energy to usable electrical energy. This energy is used to recharge the batteries. The operation of the solar panel can be visible through a small LED (connected in the path of the panel to the batteries). The batteries then use to run the two gear motors (12V &amp; 6V) by the remote control system. The shaft, connected with one motor by gearing mechanism, drives the car by rotating wheels. Another motor is used to change the direction. As a result the car moves in different directions and has become a real solar car.

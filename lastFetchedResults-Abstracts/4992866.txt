In this paper, topology optimization is addressed for compliant mechanisms with anisotropic composite materials. The equivalent elastic module and off-axis stiffness of composite materials are first analyzed using micro-mechanics based on anisotropic elasticity theory; the model of topology optimization of compliant mechanisms made of anisotropic materials is then built by taking the maximum output displacements as the objective. The validation and effectiveness of the presented method are verified with numerical results for micro-grippers made of anisotropic materials. The comparison of the optimization results with isotropic and anisotropic materials shows the necessity of taking material properties into account in topology optimization design of compliant mechanisms. The work in this paper forms a basis of further theoretical research and prospective applications, and provides a guidance for compliant mechanism design with anisotropic or other multi-phase materials.

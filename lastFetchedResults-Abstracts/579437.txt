Evaluating of growth and yield of the maize hybrids irrigated with water of different salinity levels was the objective of this experiment. In this experiment 45 genotypes of maize (23 inbred lines and 22 single cross hybrids) were sown and irrigated with four different levels of saline water included (1, 4, 8 and 12 ds/m) in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications at Abas-Abad Agriculture Research Center, Mashhad, Iran on June 3, 2007. Corn genotypes were planted in two lines 3 meter length. Electrical conductivity of soil solution and irrigation water were 5.9 and 5.85 ds/m, respectively. Results showed that the adverse affect of salinity on inbred lines was more considerable than hybrids and led to vegetative growth reduction particularly plant and ear height, delayed flowering and declined grain yield and yield components. ZP434, KSC500 and KE72012/1-12 Ã— K2331 hybrids (7.772, 7.66 and 7.22) ton/ha and ETH-M82 hybrid (2.894) averagely had maximum and minimum grain yield, respectively. KE72012/1-12 inbred line (1.722 ton/ha) and OH43/1-42 inbred line (0.279 ton/ha) had the highest and lowest grain yield. Furthermore, it was revealed that tolerance to salinity at germination and seedling growth can not indicate tolerance to salinity at plant maturity.

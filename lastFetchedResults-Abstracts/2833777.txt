Classical geomagnetic navigation mainly adopts geomagnetic matching technology with a priori magnetic map. In this paper, we research the navigation problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) without a priori magnetic map. Our inspiration is derived from animal moving behaviors to navigate without having any a priori knowledge. The problem is illustrated as the search problem of multi-parameter and multi-objective. To address the problem, we propose an approach based on genetic search algorithm to navigate AUV towards the destination. The algorithm is tested in two simulations with world magnetic model, and the results show the destinations are reached effectively by geomagnetic navigation, which has implies potential application in the future.

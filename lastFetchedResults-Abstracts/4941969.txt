The companies today must control their production system in a precise way. Thus the installation of performance indicator system (PIS) spreads. The PIS is used as a tool for piloting in coherence with the total objectives of the system. Our objective, through this communication is the development of PIS within a company and more particularly the department of safety. The basic tool for the development of the PIS is method ECOGRAI. The modelling of the system studied is done according to a "downward" approach making it possible to break up the objectives of the strategic levels into objectives of the tactical and operational levels. As for the establishment of the PI we use data-processing tools of type EIS (executive information system).

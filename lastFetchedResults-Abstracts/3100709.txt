Line stereo matching is critical for most methods proposed to reconstruct 3-D structures of artificial objects. A large number of algorithms have been implemented which announced solving the line correspondences. Due to the influences of partial occlusion and fragmented lines resulted from nonideal segment algorithms, the line correspondences will be present in various cases such as one-to-zero, one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many correspondences. However the one-to-many and many-to-many correspondences are usually ignored or arenpsilat solved effectively in existing methods. Here the essential causation that the various cases are present will be explored to provide support for solving all the correspondences integrally. Based on the above analysis, a method that can be expected to meet the objective is proposed, which has been proved effective by the experiments.

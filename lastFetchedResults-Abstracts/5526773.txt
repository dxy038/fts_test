Distributed systems are designed to explore transparently computational resources of hosts connected by some communication technology. Transparency can be obtained through software designed specifically for this purpose. In this paper, the problems of the distribution of the processing of the system components is investigated with the objective of improve the load balancing to obtain the best performance. In order to do that, an extension of the Linux Kernel denominated AW-Kernel was developed with the purpose of providing a processes scheduling load balancing according to the load of each host. To provide these improvements, the Linux Kernel have to be modified because of the implementation of new functionalities that allowed the initialization of Java virtual machines in the hosts, the storage and retrieving of the system processing load rate and the transference and automatic initialization of bytecodes in remote hosts. Those new functionalities have the same execution priority of Kernel, once they were implemented as a kernel module.

The primary objective of the TanDEM-X mission is the generation of a global high-precision digital elevation model (DEM) by using synthetic aperture radar interferometry. This letter presents the developed strategy for estimating the relative height error of the TanDEM-X DEM on a global scale. The mosaicking process of the final DEM combines all acquisitions at full resolution and is expected to be finished by late 2016. On the other hand, global mosaics can be generated starting from quicklook images already available for each single input data take. These downsized mosaics are operationally used to analyze the performance improvement that can be achieved by combining multiple acquisitions over the same ground areas and are a powerful mean for optimizing further acquisition planning. This letter reports the expected global performance of the final TanDEM-X product in advance of the full-resolution DEM. Knowledge of the global status of the TanDEM-X DEM relative height error is fundamental for optimizing the acquisition strategy and, therefore, the final performance and represents a valuable input for the scientific community as well as for selecting suitable areas for further interferometric experiments on a global scale.

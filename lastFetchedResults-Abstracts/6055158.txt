Giving a reliable quality assessment to a movie before it is released to the general public can guarantee cinemagoers a satisfying visual sensation, yet there is no assessment algorithm based on human vision system considering the specific viewing conditions. This paper takes into account some viewing conditions, such as image luminance, ambient light, screen size, image resolution and viewing distance, and proposes a novel quality assessment algorithm based on HVS for digital cinema environment. Experiments using contents from the Digital Cinema Initiative (DO) Standard Evaluation Material show that the proposed metric well simulates the subjective assessment and performs more sensitive than traditional objective quality assessment algorithms.

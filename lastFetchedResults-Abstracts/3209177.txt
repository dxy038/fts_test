This paper presents a compact bidirectional current mirror suitable for low voltage applications. The idea is to use complementary transistors in subthreshold which are able to set a reduced bias current through the mirror. The circuit presents a class AB operation with a THD near to 1% at 1MHz. The bandwidth is above 10MHz as shown by simulations using Spectre with 0.5&#956;m CMOS technology parameters.

This paper presents digital camera image compression solutions suitable for the use in single-sensor consumer electronic devices equipped with the Bayer color filter array (CFA). The proposed solutions code camera images available either in the CFA format or as the full-color demosaicked data, thus offering different design characteristics, performance and computational efficiency. Extensive experimentation reported in this paper indicates that pipelines which employ a JPEG 2000 coding scheme achieve significant performance improvements compared to similar processing pipelines equipped with a JPEG coder. Other improvements, both objective and subjective, are observed in terms of color appearance, image sharpness and the presence of visual artifacts in the captured images.

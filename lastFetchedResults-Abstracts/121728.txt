Objective
Generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation are associated with tissue injury following ischemic insult. It has been shown that saffron extract has antitumor, chemopreventive and radical scavenger properties as well as protective effects on genotoxins-induced oxidative stress and promote the diffusivity of oxygen in different tissues. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of safranal, a constituent of saffron (Crocus sativus L.), on lipid peroxidation level and histopatological alterations following renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in rats.
Material and Methods
In order to induct renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, the left kidney was exposed to warm ischemia for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 90 min. Safranal (with doses of 0.1 mllkg, 0.25 ml/kg and 0.5 mll/kg, i.p.) and normal saline (10 mllkg, i.p.) were administrated prior to induction of ischemia_ The lipid peroxidation level (which expressed as thiobarbituric acid reactive species, TBARS) and histopatological alteration were evaluated in kidney of control and ischemic groups.
Results
Ischemia-reperfusion injury (RI) caused a significant increase in TBARS levels (from 119.7 to 379.2 nmol/g tissue, p<0.001). In safranal pretreated groups, a significant reduction in TBARS levels (from 379.2 to 110.6 nmol/g tissue, p<0.00I; 0.5 ml/kg), as compared with control group, was observed. Histopathological data also showed that safranal attenuated renal ischemiareperfusion injury.
Conclusion
This study, therefore, suggests that safranal may be a useful agent for the prevention of lipid peroxidation following renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in rats.

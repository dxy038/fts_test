In this paper, we propose an intensity mapping function (IMF) based scheme to detect moving objects in a set of low dynamic range (LDR) images with different known exposure times. The objective is to remove ghosting artifacts from the eventual high dynamic range (HDR) image. Our contributions include a bidirectional similarity detection method, an adaptive threshold for movement detection, and an IMF based method for the synthesis of pixels to fill in the regions of moving objects. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes.

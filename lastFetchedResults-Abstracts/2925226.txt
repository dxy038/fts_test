The author briefly outlines the SOCRATES (system of cellular radio for traffic efficiency and safety) concept and introducing the four projects connected with the DRIVE 2 programme which are actively implementing the results of the DRIVE 1 SOCRATES project. This demonstrated that the concepts for a SOCRATES system were soundly based and that there were no technical obstacles in the path of full SOCRATES implementation. The main objective of each of the SOCRATES pilot projects is to speed up the process towards widespread commercial implementation of SOCRATES systems throughout Europe.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

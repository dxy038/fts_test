In this paper, we focus on broadband wireless mesh networks like 3GPP LTE-Advanced. This technology is a key enabler for next generation cellular networks which are about to increase by an order of magnitude the capacity provided to users. Such an objective needs a significative densification of cells which requires an efficient backhauling infrastructure. In many urban areas as well as under-developed countries, wireless mesh networking is the only available solution. Besides, economical and environmental concerns require that the energy expenditure of such infrastructure is optimized. We propose a multi-objective analysis of the correlation between capacity and energy consumption of LTE-like wireless mesh networks. We provide a linear programing modeling using column generation for an efficient computation of the Pareto front between these objectives. Based on this model, we observe that there is actually no significant capacity against energy trade-off.

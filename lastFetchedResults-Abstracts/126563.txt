Respiratory Syncicial Virus(RSV) is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than one year and the most important respiratory pathogens in early childhood. The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of respiratory syncicial virus infection and its clinical manifestations in children with acute lower respiratory infection in Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital in 2001. This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on 83 cases (between 2 months to 14 years of age) with acute lower respiratory infection hospitalized after taking nasal swabs and performing IFA. Positive IFA was compared in patients by SPSS9 software based on age, sex and clinical manifestations. Mean age of patients was 5.88 months. Twenty cases(23% of the patients with acute lower respiratory infection) were RSV positive. Male/female ratio was 1.8 and most of the patients were between 2 to 6 months old. The most common clinical manifestations in RSV positive, in both sexes and in all age groups were: cough, fever, rhinorrhea, wheezing and respiratory distress and 25% of cases had a history of allergy. According to statistical findings, there was not any relationship between frequency of clinical manifestations and sex. Also, there was no significant difference between the mean age of the cases with a same clinical manifestation and those without them. Therefore, unnecessary use of antibiotics can be decreased by considering clinical manifestations and performing IFA for diagnosis of RSV respiratory infection, especially, in less than 6 months infants with acute respiratory infection in cold seasons.

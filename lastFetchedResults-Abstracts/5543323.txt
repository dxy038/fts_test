In research of current enterprise Knowledge Management (KM) field, Closed and one-sided KM have come forth. After systemic analysis, I have proposed a &#194;&#191;four-in-one&#194;&#191; KM model, including the four core factors(PBOC): Process, Boundary, Objective and Culture. Because of this, we put forward the four practice components for an enterprise´s KM: enhance KM´s learning process, expand KM´s boundary learning, define KM´s strategic objective and advance KM´s cultural environment. Finally, we further propose the innovative inspiration: (1)Model innovation: construct KM´s ecology paradigm; (2) Process innovation: introduce knowledge flow to expand KM research perspective; (3) Boundary innovation: establish an open KM system to expand KM structure; (4) Culture innovation: promote human-oriented KM to construct enterprise knowledge innovation2.0 model; (5) Objective innovation: promote double helical evolution of knowledge innovation and knowledge application under customer orientation.

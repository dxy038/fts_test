This paper addresses resource allocation for weighted sum throughput maximization (WSTM) in multicell orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) networks. Two suboptimal algorithms with polynomial-time complexity are provided. First, we determine a graph-based subcarrier allocation algorithm allowing joint transmission of two interfering links whenever such a transmission fulfills the pairwise WSTM objective. An analytical expression of the optimal power allocation with two interfering cells in single-carrier transmission is obtained, and the capacity region study serves as the basis to build the interference graph. Second, we present a distributed power-control algorithm suitable for any signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) regime. It rejects users and subcarriers with weighted SINR that is too low before operating in the high SINR regime for the remaining users and subcarriers. Both algorithms and their combination are assessed via dynamic simulations, where the weight of each user is proportional to its queue length. They are shown to significantly decrease resource consumption and efficiently balance usersÂ´ queue lengths.

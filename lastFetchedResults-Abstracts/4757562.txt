A global optimization method is described to solve a nonconvex, nonlinear optimization problem for an allocation schemes model of water resources sustainable utilization. The objective was to determine the optimal process design and operating conditions for a given water production. Although the model was derived from a simplified hypothesis, it considers all the most important aspects of the process. The model takes into account the water demand constraints (urban domestic water consumption, industrial water, agricultural water, rural water and ecological water), water supply and its balance constraints. The resulting mathematical model contains inherently nonlinear and nonconvex constraints. The algorithm optimization was applied to the simplified model developed previously by a kind of linear iterative calculation of an approbatory least-square sphere fitting model. The global optimal solutions obtained by the algorithm provide scientific allocation schemes for water resources sustainable utilization. Moreover, these solutions are used as a starting point to solve more complex models efficiently. A case study is presented and discussed in order to illustrate the methodology and computational performance. Results show that it is simple and convenient to use global optimization to find the solution of water resources sustainable use allocation. Especially, it is very effective to solve the problems with multi-scale and non-linear constraints in resource management.

The objective of Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) with due-date window is to minimize the total E/T (earliness and tardiness) penalties for NP-hard problem. In this paper, an integrated optimal genetic algorithm is developed to optimize flexible scheduling objective of E/T with due-date window. In addition, mathematical model is established with respect to minimize E/T penalties, subjected to a set of practical restrained conditions. To testify optimization feasibility, the due-date window is sorted into common and discrete due-date window in the experiments. The proposed approach has been simulated on several benchmarks. Simulation results show that the hybrid algorithm proposed has satisfactory performance.

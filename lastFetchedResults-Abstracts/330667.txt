Objective. The purpose of this study was to employ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the microstructures of Pd–Cu–Ga and Pd–Ga dental alloys that had been permanently deformed, in order to obtain information about the deformation behavior of individual phases and changes in microstructure brought about by that deformation.

Methods. Heavily deformed regions taken from fractured tensile test bars of the two alloys in the as-cast condition were prepared for TEM analysis, using mechanical grinding and polishing, ion milling, and plasma cleaning. The specimens were examined in the TEM using bright-field and dark-field diffraction contrast imaging. Selected-area and convergent-beam electron diffraction patterns were employed to analyze the structures of the phases, and standardless energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry was used to determine their mean compositions.

Results. For both alloys, tweed structures underwent permanent deformation by twinning, whereas dislocation movement occurred in the face-centered cubic (fcc) palladium solid solution matrix. A body-centered cubic (bcc) phase, previously unreported in our TEM studies and containing a high density of dislocations, was identified in the Pd–Cu–Ga alloy, while fine-scale, stress-induced precipitates were found in some regions of the fcc matrix in the Pd–Ga alloy.

Significance. The present results have provided novel information about the mechanical deformation behavior of high-palladium alloys. The stress-induced precipitation in the Pd–Ga dental alloy studied may be a critical component of strengthening mechanisms.

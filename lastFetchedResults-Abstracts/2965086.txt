This paper investigates the application of LMI-based mixed objectives design techniques to a CD player mechanism. In this control design problem the main goal is to keep the time domain amplitude of a tracking error signal bounded in the presence of disturbances and norm bounded uncertainties. To this end we identified in the &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm and in the so-called generalized &#8459; <sub>2</sub> norm suitable measures to represent our specifications. The resulting design is shown to exhibit significant performance improvements if compared to a single-objective &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> design

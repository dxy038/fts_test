Due to the increased usage of loads with power electronic control, utility service providers may enforce more strict power factor and harmonic standards in future. One of the solutions towards this is to employ Active Power Filters (APF). The primary objective of this paper is to analyse the performance of Unified Power Quality Compensator (UPQC) which is a combination of Series Active Power Filter (SAPF) and Shunt/Parallel Active Power Filter (PAPF). A Left Shunt UPQC (LS-UPQC) configuration of UPQC with a Combined Mode Control (CMC) when connected to a distribution system to protect sensitive loads against power quality tribulations under Non-Sinusoidal supply condition is used in this paper. The firing pulses for the SAPF of the UPQC are generated based on Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) control and the firing pulses for the PAPF of the UPQC are generated based on hysteresis Current control (HCC). This control is achieved without using any transformation for generating the reference voltages/currents and thus avoiding complex computations for implementation. Simulation studies are carried out in PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the performance of LS-UPQC with combined mode control for various power quality tribulations under non sinusoidal supply condition.

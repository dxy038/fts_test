The CCITT has recently proposed a Draft Recommendation for a tandemable 64 kbps PCM to 32 kbps ADPCM transcoder algorithm [1],[2]. This paper presents a real-time hardware and software realization of the algorithm based on a single TI TMS 32010 each for the encoder and decoder. Objective and subjective results indicate that our changes in the adaptive quantizer and prediction filter, which make this single &#181;P chip realization possible, do not degrade system performance relative to the CCITT algorithm.

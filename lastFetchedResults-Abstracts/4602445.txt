A phased array configuration for microwave induced hyperthermia in cancer treatment is proposed with the objective of heating tumors deep within the body. The computer simulation consists of an elliptic cylinder representing the human thorax partially surrounded by a semi-circular array of radiators and a short linear array of radiators parallel to the main axis of the cylinder. This configuration of only 17 elements yields sufficient energy concentration at the desired location without excessive surface heating. Modification of the array illumination function allows a certain degree of control over the heated volume. The arrangement would be attractive in clinical practice since it neither requires contact nor close proximity to a patient as with radiation treatment in current practice.

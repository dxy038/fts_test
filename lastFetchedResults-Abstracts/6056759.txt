To support truly peer-to-peer applications in an ad hoc wireless networks, a judicious and efficient ad hoc routing protocol is needed. The primary objective of such routing protocol is the correct and efficient information exchange between the nodes. In this paper, we propose a routing scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) broadband network, which takes the physical channel quality, i.e. its channel impulse response (CIR) value as the routing metric. The scheme works by predicting the best route with the least error rate incurred, and transmitting data over the selected best route by employing OFDM adaptive modulation. Simulation result shows that the proposed scheme achieves its goal in reducing the error rate and increasing the data throughput.

The iris is an externally visible, yet protected organ whose unique epigenetic pattern remains stable throughout adult life. These characteristics make it very attractive for use as a biometric for identifying individuals. Image processing techniques can be employed to extract the unique iris pattern from a digitized image of the eye, and encode it into a biometric template, which can be stored in a database. In this paper has been proposed the modified contour segmentation for iris image segmentation. This biometric template contains an objective mathematical representation of the unique information stored in the iris, and allows comparisons to be made between templates. When a subject wishes to be identified by iris recognition system, their eye is first photographed, and then a template, combination of contour, pattern matching and coding techniques are created for their iris region. This template is then compared with the other templates stored in a database until either a matching template is found and the subject is identified, or no match is found and the subject remains unidentified. An effective authentication method should have customer acceptance, reliable performance, scalability to accommodate growth, and interoperability with existing systems and future plans.

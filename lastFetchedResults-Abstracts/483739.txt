The objective of this research is to explore the effect of international outsourcing on
economic growth in Asia-Pacific countries. Accordingly, a panel regression model
based on Soderbom and Teal (2003) is estimated using data of the considered
countries over the period 1995-2006. In addition to international outsourcing, the
model includes human capital, labor force and physical capital as the other exploring
variables. Empirical results show that human capital has a significant and positive
effect on economic growth of Asia- Pacific countries. Additionally, the cross effect
of international outsourcing and human capital on growth has been statistically
significant. Hence, investing in human resources, skill promotion and technology
improvement are the main keys of trade expansion and economic growth in the
countries under consideration.

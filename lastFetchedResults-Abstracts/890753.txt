The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different doses of domperidone on duodenal and cecal motility in donkeys. Six adult donkeys (n = 6) were used in a crossover study. Domperidone was administered orally via nasogastric tube at a dose rate of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg kg-1. Duodenal and cecal contractions were evaluated by ultrasonography using a 5 MHz curved-linear transducer. Examinations were performed before administration and at 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes post-administration. There was a significant (p <  0.05) increase of duodenal contractions after 15 minutes of domperidone administration at 1 mg kg-1 and lasted until 60 minutes. The cecal contractions were also significantly increased after 15 minutes and lasted until 60 minutes at a dose rate of 1 and 2 mg kg -1 (MANOVA fit, p <  0.01; Wilks, Lambda for dose Ã— time interaction, p  <  0.05). The results of the present study indicate that 1 mg kg-1 domperidone is the most effective prokinetic dose on duodenal and cecal contraction. Domperidone may be an alternative prokinetic drug for intestinal and cecal disorders in equines.

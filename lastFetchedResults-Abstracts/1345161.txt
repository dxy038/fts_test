Recent status of study on accelerator driven system (ADS) in Japan is presented. The double-strata fuel cycle concept has been proposed by Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) under the `OMEGA' program as a system for partitioning and transmutation (P&amp;T) of long-lived radioactive nuclides. The ADS dedicated to transmutation is the key technology of the double-strata fuel cycle concept. The proposed system is a lead–bismuth cooled, nitride fuel 800 MW ADS for transmutation of minor actinides and long-lived fission products. JAERI has carried out a conceptual design study under the joint project between JAERI and KEK (High Energy Accelerator Research Organization) on high-intensity proton accelerators. In addition to a high-intensity proton accelerator complex, two experimental facilities are planned for development and demonstration of accelerator driven transmutation technology: The major objective of an ADS physics experimental facility is to obtain reactor physics data of hybrid subcritical system. The major objective of an ADS engineering experimental facility is to accumulate material data for the design of a lead–bismuth target system.

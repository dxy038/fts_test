The objective of this paper is to establish the industrial design procedure of the resonant tank components and HF transformer in series-resonant converter or inverter. Based on the analysis of the main operation principles of the resonant tank and HF transformer, an industrial design process of these components is given by considering the design requirements which is acquired via the simulation; utilizing the aforementioned components, a 1 KW series-resonant inverter prototype has been constructed, and the validity of the design procedure has been proved via the experimental results.

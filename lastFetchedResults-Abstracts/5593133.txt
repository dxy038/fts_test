This paper describes the structure and algorithm of the whole Wireless Bluetooth Data Gloves Sign Language Recognition System, which is defined as a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system. This project is based on the need of developing an electronic device that can translate sign language into speech (sound) in order to make the communication take place between the mute &amp; deaf community with the general public possible. Hence, the main objective of this project is to develop a system that can convert sign language into speech so that deaf people are able to communicate efficiently with normal people. This Human-Computer Interaction system is able to recognize 25 common words signing in Bahasa Isyarat Malaysia (BIM) by using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) methods. Both hands are involved in performing the BIM with all the sensor connecting wirelessly to PC with Bluetooth module. In the future, the system can be shrunk to become a stand alone system without any interaction with PC.

Objective: This study among American Indian prenatal patients was conducted to validate a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) designed to (1) identify women who had consumed alcohol during pregnancy, (2) identify women who may be at risk of drinking during pregnancy, and (3) determine the quantity and frequency of alcohol and other substance use just before and during pregnancy.
Methods: The validation involved three components: (1) review of the SAQ responses by a public health nurse; (2) structured patient interview with the research nurse; and (3) medical record abstraction postpartum.
Results: Compared to extensive interview and medical record data, the SAQ is sensitive (76.6%) and specific (92.8%) in detecting pregnant women who had consumed alcohol during pregnancy.
Conclusion: The SAQ is a useful screening tool for alcohol use in this population

Genetic algorithms, a search technique which combines Darwinian ‘survival-of-the-fittest’ with randomized
well structured information, is applied to the problems of real-world truss optimization. In this work
a population of binary strings or ‘chromosomes’, which represent the coded truss design variables, a ‘fitness’
as a ranking measure of the adaptability to the environment, selection criteria and mechanical natural
operators such as crossover and mutation are used to improve the population, so that over the generations
the genetic algorithm gets better and better and at the end of the convergence, a ‘rebirth’ of the population is
used to improve the usual process.
An overview of the genetic algorithm will be described, continuing the rebirth effect; then, the chromosome
representation of trusses is exposed. Afterwards, the objective scalar function is defined taking into
account that it seems reasonable in real world to optimize trusses in minimum weight trying, at the same
time, to use the minimum number of cross-section types obtained from the market. It also seems reasonable
to have the possibility to change the shape of the conceptual design, moving some joints. To simulate nearly
real conditions, several load cases, constraints in the elastic joint displacements, ultimate tensile and elastic
and plastic buckling in the bars have been taken into account. A hyperstatic 10 bars truss is subjected to
a deep analysis in different situations in order to evaluate with other authors when possible as truss
optimization with two criteria and buckling effect has not been found in specialized literature. A 160-bar
transmission tower is also optimized.

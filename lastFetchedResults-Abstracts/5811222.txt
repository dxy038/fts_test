The progress and future plans within COST MP0702 consortium will be reviewed with particular emphasis on efficient use of specific COST networking instruments. The main objective of COST Action MP0702 &#8220;Towards Functional Sub-Wavelength Photonic Structures&#8221; (2008-2012) is to establish active links between European laboratories working in the field of artificial materials for photonics applications, where the structural dimensions are at or below the wavelength of light. The Action involves now as many as twenty seven European COST Member States, and several leading laboratories from non-COST countries. After initial two years of networking activities the three Action´s Working Groups: Working Group 1 - Plasmonics, metamaterials and non-reciprocity, Working Group 2 - Photonic devices with periodicity and hybrid material systems, Working Group 3 - New functionalities, are reporting a substantial progress in sub-wavelength photonics research, and they have achieved a clear picture of the research problems to be dealt with and to be resolved in the next two years of Action´s lifetime.

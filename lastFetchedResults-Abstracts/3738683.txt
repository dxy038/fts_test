The 1.3/1.55-mum bidirectional small form pluggable (SFP) optical transceiver with an integrated wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) subassembly using accurate ceramic blocks has been developed. The WDM subassembly on which a laser diode, a receiver photodiode, a WDM filter, and two microlenses are integrated is only 2.0 times 2.1 times 0.6 mm<sup>3</sup> in size and inserted in a TO-CAN package. The SFP transceiver coupled with single-mode fiber has been operated at a 622-Mb/s data rate. The transmitted optical output power is -2.8 dBm and the measured value of sensitivity is -32 dBm at 10<sup>-10</sup> bit-error rate.

The objective of the cooperate research project &#8220;Autonomous Driving&#8221; is the automation of an ordinary mass-produced car in such a way that it can be moved without a human driver. A possible application of such a system is the automated durability test of a vehicle, which nowadays is usually done by a human test driver under extreme stress on man and machine. This paper describes the implementation of the vehicle diagnosis system, which checks a test car on a proving ground. Therefore, the human diagnostic capabilities are to be replaced by measuring equipment to automate the detection of malfunctions which occur

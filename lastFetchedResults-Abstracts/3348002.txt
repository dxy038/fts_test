Quantum Computation has thus far proven a promising new research field, with results that vastly surpass their classical counterparts, but programming a quantum computer is in its infant stage, at best. D-Wave have successfully implemented a computing machine based on adiabatic evolution which natively solves Ising problems by construction. In this paper we present additional solutions to known computational problems by reducing them to mathematical expressions. They will be passed to the quantum computer through Blackbox, a mechanism that maps objective functions to the native Ising form the D-Wave machine recognizes.

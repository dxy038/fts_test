In hydrological investigations, modeling and forecasting of snow melt runoff requires timely information about snow properties and their spatial variability. The liquid water content in snow pack is an important parameter. A fully polarimetric C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the capability to estimate the free liquid water content-snow wetness-in the top layer of a snow pack quantitatively as demonstrated in Shi and Dozier 1995). The objective of this study is to develop an algorithm under the configuration of ASARÂ´s C-band dual-copolarization measurements, e.g., HH and VV polarization. We have established a model-simulated C-band data-base by using multi-scattering model. The data-base covers the most possible wet snow physical properties and surface roughness conditions. Using this data-base, an inversion algorithm has been developed for using C-band dual-copolarization measurements. The newly developed algorithm mainly involved two steps: 1) decomposition of the surface and volume scattering signals, and 2) then using each scattering component to estimate snow wetness

The paper presents a framework to optimise the design of work roll based on the cooling performance. The framework develops meta-models from a set of finite element analyses (FEA) of the roll cooling. A design of experiment technique is used to identify the FEA runs. The research also identifies sources of uncertainties in the design process. A robust evolutionary multi-objective evaluation technique is applied to the design optimisation in constrained problems with real life uncertainty. The approach handles uncertainties associated both with design variables and fitness functions. Constraints violation within the neighbourhood of a design is considered as part of a measurement for degree of feasibility and robustness of a solution.

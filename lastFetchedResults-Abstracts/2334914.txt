Background and objective: Assessment of physical activity patterns and its influencing
factors among adolescents for change in physical activity patterns is
valuable. Considering the importance of physical activity among youth, the aim
of this study was to assess the physical activity in girl school students in the
Tarom in Iran and its relevant factors.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study physical activity were assessed among
230 girl senior high school students in Tarom. The students were selected via
classified multi-stage random sampling. Physical activity was evaluated by the
standard, valid and reliable International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)
and pedometer to evaluate physical activity levels. Height, weight, and body
mass index (BMI) were also measured. Subjects wore a pedometer throughout
the day for one consecutive week, and average steps per day (physical activity
volume) were measured. Data were analyzed through SPSS18 using Chisquared
test and Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
Results: Regarding the level of physical activity (Pedometer results), 32% of
students were active and 68% inactive. The results of IPAQ showed that out
of active individuals, 68% performed light, 28% moderate and 2% sever
physical activity. There was only significant relationship between physical activity
and father’s jobs. In the case of level of mother and father’s education,
mother’s jobs and household income had no significant effect on the frequency
of adequate physical activity.
Conclusion: The results indicated that the level of physical activity was not sufficient
among girl students. Therefore, it is necessary to have an education plan
to educate girl students regarding life style modification.

We investigate the appearance-based gaze estimation problem, with respect to its essential difficulty in reducing the number of required training samples, and other practical issues such as slight head motion, image resolution variation, and eye blinking. We cast the problem as mapping high-dimensional eye image features to low-dimensional gaze positions, and propose an adaptive linear regression (ALR) method as the key to our solution. The ALR method adaptively selects an optimal set of sparsest training samples for the gaze estimation via &#8467;<sup>1</sup>-optimization. In this sense, the number of required training samples is significantly reduced for high accuracy estimation. In addition, by adopting the basic ALR objective function, we integrate the gaze estimation, subpixel alignment and blink detection into a unified optimization framework. By solving these problems simultaneously, we successfully handle slight head motion, image resolution variation and eye blinking in appearance-based gaze estimation. We evaluated the proposed method by conducting experiments with multiple users and variant conditions to verify its effectiveness.

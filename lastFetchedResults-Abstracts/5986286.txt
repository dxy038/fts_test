In this paper, a FIR based synchronous DS/CDMA receiver is proposed, employing sliding-window LMS algorithm. This receiver has the capacity to suppress the ISI (inter symbol interference) and combat multipath fading experiencing in both static and dynamic multipath environment. This paper emphasizes the importance of spread spectrum technique (CDMA) and the adaptive algorithms and its performance comparisons. The main objective of this paper is to implement, analyze and compare different FIR based adaptive algorithms like NLMS, DRLMS with respect to SWLMS for ISI equalization. The bit- error rate and the output SNR will be considered as the main performance criteria. Attention will be also given to the computational complexity of the implemented algorithms.

Future traffic management systems require a bidirectional communication between roadside beacons and vehicles. Several studies are concentrated on a short range microwave link for this application. Multipath fading effects, due to reflections on the road, vehicles or buildings, may interfere with the communication. In this paper, antenna and frequency diversity techniques are considered for a solution of the multipath fading problem. The results demonstrate that an efficient improvement of the link performance can be achieved

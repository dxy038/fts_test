Background and purpose: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in
hospitalized patients and different report exists about its prevalence. This study aimed at determining the
frequency of hyponatremia and its associated factors in hospitalized tuberculosis (TB) patients in Razi
hospital, Iran.
Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was done using the existing data and the
study population included all TB patients admitted in Razi Hospital during 2006 to 2011. TB was
diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, positive sputum culture, positive radiographic finding and anti TB
treatment. Variables included level of Na, age, sex, and drug regimen (standard / second line).
Hyponatremia were sodium levels less than 135 in two consecutive tests. The data was analyzed by SPSS
and Chi-square test.
Results: The cases were 200 TB patients including 115 (57.5%) male. The mean age of patients
was 51.2 Â± 20.8 years. Hyponatremia was seen in 36(18%) patients (CI 95%: 12.6% -23.4%). Distribution
of mortality was not significantly different in patients with and without hyponatremia (P > 0.05). No
significant difference was seen in frequency of hyponatremia according to the type of tuberculosis.
Conclusion: Hyponatremia was considerably higher in patients with TB which should receive
more attention for proper management and follow up.

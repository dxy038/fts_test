An investigation of Polarization Dependent Loss (PDL) behavior is performed in an Recirculation Loop (RCL) experimental apparatus. The RCL allows to simulate the transmission for several links of fiber with only one line amplifier, some filters and devices for tests and a fiber coil, with a very lesser cost. The PDL statistical nature turns its accumulated contribution in the RCL different from the sum of each different elements contributions, therefore the alignment of the elements with PDL changes, depending on the ambient conditions as tensions and temperature. Theoretical analyses are also performed using the Jones and Mueller matrix approach to represent each element in the loop. The PDL in the devices must be characterized correctly, with the objective to foresee the impact in the performance of the new generations of systems DWDM. Experimental errors are considered in the theoretical results and compared with experimental ones. A 7% depolarization most likely due to optical amplifier amplified spontaneous emission is identified in the experimental apparatus.

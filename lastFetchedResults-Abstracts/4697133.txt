The power consumption of a sequential circuit can be reduced by decomposing it into subcircuits which can be turned off when inactive. Power can also be reduced by careful state encoding. Modeling a given circuit as a finite-state machine, we formulate its decomposition into submachines as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, and automatically generate the ILP model with power minimization as the objective. A simple, but powerful state encoding method is used for the submachines to further reduce power consumption. We present experimental results which show that circuits designed by our approach consume 30% to 90% less power than conventional circuits.

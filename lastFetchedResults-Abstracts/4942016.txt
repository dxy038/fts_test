Traditional scheduling research usually targets make span as the only optimization goal, while several isolated efforts addressed the problem by considering at most two objectives. In this paper we propose a general framework and heuristic algorithm for multi-objective static scheduling of scientific workflows in heterogeneous computing environments. The algorithm uses constraints specified by the user for each objective and approximates the optimal solution by applying a double strategy: maximizing the distance to the constraint vector for dominant solutions and minimizing it otherwise. We analyze and classify different objectives with respect to their impact on the optimization process and present a four-objective case study comprising make span, economic cost, energy consumption, and reliability. We implemented the algorithm as part of the ASKALON environment for Grid and Cloud computing. Results for two real-world applications demonstrate that the solutions generated by our algorithm are superior to user-defined constraints most of the time. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms a related bi-criteria heuristic and a bi-criteria genetic algorithm.

AbstractObjective
ed to compare the levels of serum androgens in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who had a diagnosis of only major depressive disorder (MDD), only generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or who had no psychiatric disorder, as determined by a structured clinical interview. Another objective of the study was to examine whether an association exists between these psychiatric diagnoses and insulin resistance or body mass index via a comparison among the study groups in terms of these parameters.

tudy was performed between March 2011 and February 2012. A total of 73 patients were included in the study. The study sample consisted of three groups: PCOS patients with only major depressive disorder (n = 23), PCOS patients with only generalized anxiety disorder (n = 20), and PCOS patients without any diagnosed psychiatric disorders (not diagnosed â€” ND group, n = 30).
s
icant difference was found among the three groups with regard to the serum levels of 17-OHP and DHEAS. When multiple comparisons were performed among the groups, 17-OHP levels were significantly higher in the MDD group than in the ND group. DHEAS levels were significantly higher in the MDD group and the GAD group than in the ND group.
sion
esent study suggests that MDD and GAD appear to be associated with higher DHEAS levels.

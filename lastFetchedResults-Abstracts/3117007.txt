Proficiency Testing and Interlaboratory Measurements are the important requirement prescribed in ISO/IEC 17025 Quality Standard. This requirement is given in Clause 5.9 as a part of Quality Assurance. This is one of the important step in achieving overall objective of technical requirements i.e., to ensure that test laboratories generate technically valid data. Interlaboratory measurements are normally initiated by individual laboratory. National Accreditation Board of Laboratories (NABL) insists for such measurements during various stages of accreditation process of laboratories. SAMEER-CEM Chennai has artifact, Comparison Noise Emitter (CNE III) developed by University of York for Conducted and Radiated Emission measurements. Radiated measurements were carried out at various measurement sites in the frequency range of 30-1000 MHz. Measurements were carried out at Shielded anechoic chamber or Open Area Test Site (OATS) depending on the availability of test facility of the participating laboratories. This paper intends to report the results of this interlaboratory comparison programme. Measurement results were compared using the Z score.

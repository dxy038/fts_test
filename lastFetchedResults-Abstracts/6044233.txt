This paper is to perform a design optimization of micromachined piezoelectric transducer by maximizing the system exciting sensitivity. The transducer is a membrane-based micromachined transducer with the piezoelectric film to excite the membrane vibrating. In this study, the exciting sensitivity is taken as the optimization objective. Specifically, when fixing the exciting signal, the transducer structure is optimized to maximize the vibrating magnitude of the membrane. The shape and size of the piezoelectric film are selected as the design parameters to optimize the structure of the transducer. Through analysis, four different piezoelectric structure designs were proposed and explored for optimizing the exciting sensitivity of the transducer. To perform the analysis and the subsequent optimization, finite element simulation was taken and all the FEA models were built on ANSYS software. The optimal design and sensitivity analysis are performed from the results of simulations on ANSYS; the corresponding structural parameters of the piezoelectric film for optimal design are identified. Finally, the optimization results of the exciting sensitivity for the transducers of these different piezoelectric film structures are compared; the design method to improve the exciting sensitivity of the transducer is provided.

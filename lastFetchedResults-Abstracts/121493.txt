Introduction: Recurrent spontaneous abortion and fetal loss are common in obstetrics and gynecology (60% of pregnancy loss). Immunological factor probably have a major role in this problem.
Recent studies suggested an association between Antiphospholipid antibodies, especially Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) with recurrent abortion. Different studies report different association (5-51 %).
Objective: we determine the prevalence of aCL in recurrent abortion in Sari during 2000-2003. Materials and methods: In a descriptive study, women with a history of at least two abortions without any known etiology like hormonal Imbalance, systemic hypertension, diabetes, infection, hyperthyroidism and, anatomical abnormality in genital tract were studied. 512 cases, serum were investigated for presence of aZL in serum.
The patient sera were tested by Enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) method. Commercial standard ELISA kit from GENESIS Company were used according to kit instruction manual (>13 m/ml aCL considered as positive and 11<m/ml as negative). The prevalence of aCL was determined and confidence intervals (CF) were estimated.
Results: 512 women with age range of 18-40 (28.02 ± 5.66) were studied. aCL was detected in sera of 57 (11.1%) cases, with confidence interval of 2.7 (11.1 ± 2.7). 447 (87/4%) cases were negative for aCL and in 8 (1.5%) were intermediate.
49.1 of pregnancy loss with positive aCL were in first trimester of pregnancy and 50.9 in second and third trimester with odd ratio of 3.1.
Conclusion: The prevalence of aCL in recurrent abortion and fetal loss in Sari- City are not high and it is mostly positive in second and third trimester.

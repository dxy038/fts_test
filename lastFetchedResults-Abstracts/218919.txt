Introduction & Objective: Schwannoma, a benign tumor of nerve sheath origin, is commonly found in the head and neck, as well as flexor surfaces of the extremities. It can rarely occur in the breast and stomach with only a few cases being reported.
Case Reports: The cases are: 1) a 57-year- old man with breast mass, 2) a 58 -year -old man with gastrointestinal complaints who were finally diagnosed as peripheral nerve schwannomas.
Conclusion: Clinical suspicion and histopathological confirmation are the keys to schwannomas diagnosis. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for such patients.

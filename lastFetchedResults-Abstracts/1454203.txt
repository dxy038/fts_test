In this paper, the application of tabu search method for optimization in structural acoustics is introduced. A shape modification concept is used to change the vibrational and acoustical properties of the finite element model. Objective of optimization process is to minimize the root mean square level of structure borne sound for a quadratic plate made of steel. The comparison of results from this study with other previously published works shows that tabu search method can give a suitable performance for using it in structural acoustic optimization applications.

p,redictor--corrector approach based on the zxg-zag model is proposed for the bending
of thick laminated composite plates The main purpose of the approach as to reduce the differences
between the assumed variation of the transverse shear stresses provided by the constttutwe equations
and the computed variation of the same stresses from the equihbnum equations of elasticity. In the
predictor phase, a linear or cubic ztg-zag model IS adopted and the layerwlse polynomml approximation
of the Lransverse shear stresses through the thackness IS determined from the equilibrium
equations of elasticity This approximation is then used in a general higher-order zIg-zag model in
the corrector phase m order to improve the predictions for the &splacements and stresses. The
present predactor-corrector zxg-zag model satisfies the continmty of the in-plane &splacements and
the transverse ,,;hear stresses at the interfaces whale maintaining the same number of variables as in
Mlndhn's theory The numerical results for the bidirectional bending of both symmetric and
antlsymmetnc thick laminates are m excellent agreement wtth the exact elasticity results of Pagano.
They also show a marked tmprovement over the results from the hnear zig-zag model of DI Sctuva
and the cubic zig-zag model of Lee et al, especmlly at the interfaces

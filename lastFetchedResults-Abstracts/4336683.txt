The GPS receivers are often very much used in coordinates system and localization. The objective of this paper is to show the results of the new simulation of ionosphere correction model, using the comparison of the models of Kalman filter and Schmidt-Kalman filter. These errors are caused by the solar explosions, when dealing with the ionosphere, which gives delays in the phase and in the frequency of the signal.

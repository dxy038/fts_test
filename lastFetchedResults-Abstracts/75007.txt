A surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) depends on both the optical properties of the material and the microstructure of the surface and appears as combination of these factors. We propose a method for modeling the BRDF based on a separate optical-property (refractive-index) estimation by polarization measurement. Because the BRDF and the refractive index for precisely the same place can be determined, errors cased by individual difference or spatial dependence can be eliminated. Our BRDF model treats the surface as an aggregation of microfacets, and the diffractive effect is negligible because of randomness. An example model of a painted aluminum plate is presented.

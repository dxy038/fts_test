Effect of alfalfa and locust tree, two major host plants, of alfalfa black aphid ( Aphis craccivora Koch.), and two constant temperatures 20 and 27 C were studied on L. fabarum population parameters in growth chamber conditions (55 5% R.H., L:D 14:10 H. and mentioned constant temperatures). The objective of this investigation was to identify growth rate of L. fabarum population in various temperatures and on host plants. The results indicated that net reproduction rate (Ro) of parasitoid wasp in 20 2 and 27 C on alfalfa was 15.5 and 8298, and on locust tree 9.1 and 7.26 female per female respectively. Gross reproductive rate ( GRR) on alfalfa was 16.1 and 9.46 and on locust tree 10.3 and 7.4 female per female respectively. Intrinsic rate of natural increases (rm), on alfalfa was 0.2540 and 0.2925 and on locust tree (1.2108 and 0.2971 female per female per day respectively. Mean generation time (T) on alfalfa was 10.7906 and7.2342 clay and on locust tree 10.4757 and6.6724 day respectively. Another population parameters of parasitoid wasp included finite rate of increases (a.), intrinsic birth rate (b), intrinsic death rate (d), doubling time (DT), rate of weekly multiplication (rw), mean age of reproduction in stable population (A) and mean age in stable population (a) also were calculated in mentioned temperatures and two host plants. The results of gross and net fecundity rates of parasitoid revealed that these parameters were higher on alfalfa than locust tree at both temperatures. At 27 C these parameters were less than that at 20 C on both host plants. On both alfalfa and locust tree, when temperature was raised the Intrinsic rate of natural increases (rm) was increased, whereas the rate of mean generation time (T) was reduced. hi conclusion, both temperatures and host plants affected population parameters of the parasitoid wasp (L. fabarum).

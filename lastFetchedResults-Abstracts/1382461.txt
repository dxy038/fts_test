We investigated the specificity of the γ-interferon test for bovine tuberculosis (TB) in 1557 cattle in 30 paratuberculosis-free and officially certified TB-free dairy herds, located in three provinces of the Lombardy Region in Northern Italy. The TB-free status of the herds under examination was further confirmed by the tuberculin skin test, by an antibody assay and by post mortem examination of animals culled from the herds during the study period. The specificity of the γ-interferon tests after a single test and a double sampling scheme were 88.8% and 95.4%, respectively. After a single test, 11.7% of dubious reactors were also detected, while most cattle (47.4%) were shown to be avian reactors, probably due to contamination from infected birds and/or forage. There was strong evidence that the specificity of the test could be related to the animals’ interaction with environmental mycobacteria and/or ageing. To reduce the percentage of non-specific bovine reactors under alleged TB-free conditions, test procedures might involve the use of more specific antigens and/or different reaction thresholds.

Traditionally, control systems are electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic or a combination of all. However an all optical control (AOPC) system is a novel research area that needs to be investigated and further developed. The main objective of an AOPC system is to detect and manipulate the process variable and issues a control signal at the optical domain with minimum optical to electronic signal conversion. This paper is introducing a theoretical basis for the realization of AOPC systems, their mathematical modelling, and dynamics.

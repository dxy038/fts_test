We present a method for the synthesis of fuzzy-logic controllers (FLCS) for amplitude-sensitive nonlinear plants based on sinusoidal-input describing-function (SIDF) methods plus step response optimization. This method involves a two-step process wherein an initial controller is obtained via the direct generation of the membership functions and output levels based on the &#8220;frequency response&#8221; of the nonlinear plant in the describing-function sense, then the FLC is perfected via recursive optimization of the step responses for a specified set of input amplitudes. By &#8220;recursive&#8221; we mean that the average step response obtained from step k is used as the objective for the k+1 optimization problem, and the process iterates until convergence, with the objective of achieving closed-loop system j performance that is as insensitive to reference-input amplitude as possible for the selected controller configuration. An illustration of the method and its effectiveness is provided, based on a prototypical position control problem where a servo motor plus mechanical load are characterized by torque saturation and nonlinear friction (stiction)

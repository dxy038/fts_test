Active filtering has now become a mature technology to compensate harmonics in power systems with nonlinear loads. This paper introduces an iterative algorithm to investigate the optimal determination of location of an active filter. The objective function includes minimization of transmission lines losses and total harmonic distortion. The 5 bus IEEE power system is used to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method.

Objective: In recent years the use of herbal slimming supplements has increased in Iran. One problem may be the illegal inclusion of synthetic drugs by some manufacturers in these products. The aim of this study is to determine four undeclared synthetic adulterants in some herbal slimming products present in the Iranian market.
Methods: This survey study researched six common herbal slimming supplements that were obtained from the market. Supplements were purchased from Persian language advertising sites on satellite channels and the Internet. These products were analyzed by GC-MS for the detection of sibutramine, phenolphthalein, phenytoin and LC-MS for bumetanide.
Results: Three products contained phenolphthalein. Fast Slim and Original Super Slim carried the highest content of sibutramine - 57 µg per capsule for Fast Slim and 78 µg per capsule for Original Super Slim. Bumetanide was found in Herbaceous Essence, Green Lean Super Slim, Magic Slim and Fat loss. Other undisclosed components such as caffeine and pseudoephedrine were detected by GC-MS library search.
Conclusion: All herbal slimming products have been shown to contain undeclared synthetic adulterants. Increased public awareness of the risks of taking herbal weight-loss supplements is necessary.

ABSTRACT: The Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) approach evaluates plant nutritional status and based on a comparison of crop nutrient ratios with optimum values from a high yielding group (norms).  The objective of this study was establish DRIS  norms for peanut crop, to compare mean yield, nutrient contents of leaves and variance of nutrient ratios of low- and high- yielding groups. To carry out this research, ninety   leaf samples were analyzed for N, P, K, Fe, Zn and Mn contents and respective yields were recorded of peanut fields from Ismailia governorate. The data were divided into high- yielding (? 12 ton ha-1) and low- yielding ( < 12 ton ha-1) sub-population and the norms were computed using standard DRIS technique. The DRIS norms for K, Fe and Zn with high S2l/S2h ratio and low coefficient of variation (CV) found in this paper probably can provide more security to evaluate the K, Fe and Zn status of peanut

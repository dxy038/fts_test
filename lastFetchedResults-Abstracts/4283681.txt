In this paper, a diffusion-based generic demosaicing algorithm is proposed which can be used for various sensor images captured by digital cameras equipped with various RGB color filter arrays. This algorithm improves our previous edge-sensing generic demosaicing algorithm by enhancing the computation of the green band. In fact, since the green band plays a major and crucial role in the performance of the edge-sensing generic demosaicing algorithm, a diffusion-based model is used for reducing the errors generated when computing the green band. A series of tests has been made on images of the Kodak database, and our diffusion-based demosaicing algorithm performs better than the edge-sensing generic demosaicing algorithm in regard to both subjective and objective evaluation.

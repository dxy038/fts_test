The objective of this paper is to present the results of a numerical investigation of the effect of flow pulsations on local, time-averaged Nusselt number of an impinging air jet. The problem was considered to provide inputs to augmenting heat transfer from electronic components. The solution is sought through the FLUENT (Version 6.0) platform. The standard k-epsiv model for turbulence equations and two-layer zonal model in wall function are used in the problem. Pressure-velocity coupling is handled using the SIMPLEC algorithm. The model is first validated against some experimental results available in the literature. A parametric study is carried out to quantify the effect of the pulsating jets. The parameters considered are (1) average jet Reynolds number (5130 &lt; Re &lt; 8560), (2) sine and square wave pulsations, (3) frequencies of pulsations (25 &lt; / &lt;400 Hz), and (4) height of impingement to jet diameter ratios (5 &lt; H/d &lt; 9). In the case of sine wave pulsations, the ratio of root mean square value of the amplitude to the average value (A<sub>N</sub>) was varied from 18% to 53%. The studies are restricted to a constant wall heat flux condition. Parametric conditions for which enhancement in the time-averaged heat transfer from the surface can be expected are identified.

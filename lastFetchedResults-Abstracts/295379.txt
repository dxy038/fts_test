The evolution of care delivered by a multidisciplinary burns team is a function of the effectiveness of the professional communication between team members. In this exercise, we have explored concepts and communication between nurses and doctors in a burns team. Loosely structured weekly meetings were held over a 4-month period. The explicit objective was to determine and define the current model of burns care in a regional burn centre. The implicit objective, however, was to develop a mutual appreciation of actual and potential problems in communication.
Consensus task identification was achieved at the end of each meeting with full compliance in completing the tasks before the next meeting. Although there was a unanimous commitment to the team concept, traditional, professional, paradigms persist. For nurses, the concept of holistic modelling predominated, whilst the disease centred paradigm remained the focus of medical modelling. Linguistic, cultural and professional barriers to effective communication were identified but did not readily conform to prior expectations. Experience in burns care can transcend these barriers more effectively than a common culture or profession.
In conclusion, team work and team building is a complex process that can benefit from an ongoing process of re-evaluation. An obvious yet common error is to assume a level of mutual understanding that does not in fact exist. Stepping aside to re-explore fundamental principles on which team members base their personal and professional practice can help in elucidating and determining new paradigms of care, which can be evaluated and appropriately implemented. The consensus conclusion was that this approach was a very valuable investment in time in pursuing excellence in the field of burns care.

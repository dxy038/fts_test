Background and Objective: Cytomegalovirus (CMV), one of the most common opportunistic pathogens in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can cause the diseases such as encephalitis, pneumonia, and chorioretinitis. This study aimed at molecular studying of CMV infection in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
Material and Methods: this study was conducted on 50 blood samples from HIV-infected individuals, and plasma was separated and examined for the presence of cytomegalovirus genome by PCR. Patients were divided into two group of under treatment with and without antiretroviral drugs. 
Results: Of 50, 28 (% 56) were men and 22 (% 44) were women. CMV genome was identified in 8 samples (16%), and the molecular prevalence of CMV infection was 21.4% (n= 6) in males and 9.1% (n = 2) in females. 
Conclusion: Given the frequency of Cytomegalovirus Active Infection in HIV-infected individuals under antiretroviral therapy, we should be careful about the treatment of    Cytomegalovirus Active Infection.

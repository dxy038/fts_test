This paper proposes a new configuration of bidirectional intelligent semiconductor transformer with rating of 1.9kV/220V, 2kVA. The proposed transformer consists of high-voltage high-frequency AC-DC rectifier, and low-voltage DC-DC and DC-AC converters. The operational feasibility of proposed transformer was verified by computer simulation with PSIM software. Based on the simulation results, a hardware prototype with rating of 1.9kV/220V, 2kVA was built and tested in the lab to confirm the feasibility of hardware implementation. Using three units of this transformer, a 3-phase transformer with rating of 3.3kV/380V, 6kVA can be built. The proposed transformer could be applicable for implementing the smart grid.

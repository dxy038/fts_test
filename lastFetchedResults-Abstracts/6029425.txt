One objective in MPEG-2 to H.264 transcoding is to improve the H.264 compression ratio by using more accurate H.264 motion vectors. Motion re-estimation is by far the most time consuming process in video transcoding, and improving the searching speed is a challenging problem. We introduce a new transcoding scheme that uses the MPEG-2 DCT coefficients to predict the block size partitioning for H.264. Performance evaluations have shown that, for the same rate-distortion performance, our proposed scheme achieves an impressive reduction in the computational complexity of more than 82% compared to the full range motion estimation used by H.264.

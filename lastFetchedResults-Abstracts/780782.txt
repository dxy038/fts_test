My primary objective in this research was to examine diverse validity aspects of a short form of
the Achievement-Motive Grid (AMG–S; Schmalt, 1999). TheAMGis a picture-based measure
that combines features of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT; Murray, 1943) with features of
self-report questionnaires. Similar to the TAT, the motive gets aroused by presenting a set of
pictured achievement situations. Similar to a questionnaire, the motive is measured with a set of
statements representing characteristic components of the achievement motive. Quite in line
with the original version, factor analyses of the AMG–S all recommend the adoption of a 3-factor
solution in which 1 hope-of-success (HS) and 2 fear-of-failure (FF) concepts are differentiated.
The HS and passive FF factor (FFp) are based on positive and negative efficacy evaluations,
respectively. The active FF factor (FFa) describes anticipations of impending failure. FFp
is clearly a “withdrawal” factor, whereas FFa is clearly an “invigoration” factor. In the construct
validity section of this research, I focus on classical and recent elaborations of approach and
avoidance motivation in which I show that HS, FFp, and FFa play a substantial role in a motive-
goals-outcomes framework of achievement motivation.

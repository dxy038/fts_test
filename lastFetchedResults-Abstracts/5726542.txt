The objective of this study is to calculate the exposure level to cosmic radiation of every year from 1997 to 2007 of aircrew members of Hainan Airlines for radiation protection. According to the flight data, the cosmic radiation effective doses received by aircrew members on aircraft flights were calculated using software CARD. From 1997 to 2007, In 459 routes calculated, maximum effective dose on aircraft flight is 18.00&#956;Sv, minimum is 0.37&#956;Sv. For all routes, the maximum annual average effective dose rate is 1.91&#956;Sv/h for 2007, the maximum annual individual effective dose is 1.91mSv for pilots and 2.67mSv for flight attendants, both in limits recommended by ICRP.

In this paper, we suggest that EAs could be utilized for making the environmental game become much more exciting. In particular, in order attain this objective, we try to utilize evolutionary algorithms in the following steps: (1) first, we consider a new way for producing a return for each player. (2) Second, we utilize multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to generate various skilled players whose decision making concerning the investment to the chemical goods (and consideration toward environmental protection) can strongly affect the environmental state of the sea. (3) Further, we utilize evolutionary programming (EP) to derive appropriate rules which could be used to help players fully enjoy game playing. Several game playing (utilizing the new rule) by our students suggest the effectiveness of our approach.

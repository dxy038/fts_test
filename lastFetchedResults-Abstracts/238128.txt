A newly developed rotating brush biofilm reactor was used for DCP, COD and toxicity removal from 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) containing synthetic wastewater at different feed COD, TCP concentrations and A/Q (biofilm surface area/feed flow rate) ratios. A Box–Wilson statistical experiment design was used by considering the feed DCP (50–500 mg l−1), COD (2000–6000 mg l−1) and A/Q ratio (73–293 m2 d m−3) as the independent variables while percent DCP, COD, and toxicity removals were the objective functions. The experimental data were correlated by a quadratic response function and the coefficients were determined by regression analysis. Percent DCP, COD and toxicity removals calculated from the response functions were in good agreement with the experimental data. DCP, COD and toxicity removals increased with increasing A/Q ratio and decreasing feed DCP concentrations. The optimum A/Q ratio resulting in the highest COD (90%), DCP (100%) and toxicity (100%) removals with the highest feed COD (6000 mg l−1) and DCP (500 mg l−1) contents was nearly 210 m2 d m−3.

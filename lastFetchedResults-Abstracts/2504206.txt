For critical and sensitive facility location, finding an adequate coverage can reduce the amount of damages which are caused by disaster or military attacks; and also, locating the critical facilities far from each other can decrease the probability of identification and destruction of them. In this paper, a bi-objective mathematical model is derived for the critical facility location problem, in which the principals of passive defenses have been taken into account via the objective functions of minimizing the uncovered demand amount and maximizing the minimum distance between facilities. In the proposed model, it is assumed that each facility is identified and destructed based on a specific and known probability. Furthermore, it is supposed that injuries (customers) can be served by those facilities located within a predefined coverage distance. Since the proposed problem is NP-hard, a bi-objective genetic algorithm is presented in order to solve the large sized problems.

In this paper, we investigate a multiuser downlink distributed antenna system with simultaneous wireless information and power transmission under the assumption of imperfect channel state information at the distributed antenna (DA) port. To optimally design robust transmit beamforming vectors and receive power splitting factors, our design objective is to maximize the average worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while simultaneously achieving the individual energy harvesting (EH) constraint for each user and the per-DA port power constraint. We solve this non- convex problem by reformulating it into a two-stage problem. Simulation results are shown to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

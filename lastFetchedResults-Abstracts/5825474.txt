The main objective of this paper is to purpose the newly developed prototype of electronics ballast used for 250 watt high pressure sodium (HPS) lamp. In this paper, concept designs, circuit designs, and the implementation of the 250 watt prototype-ballast are presented. Test result shows that the newly developed model provides not only lower loss compares to the traditional core-coil ballast, but also give the higher system efficiency. Moreover, the overall system power factor is above 0.85 lagging with the expectation of percentage of total harmonics distortion less than 30 percent. All test procedures, and conditions are applied to employ with 250 high pressure metal halide (HPM) lamp as well.

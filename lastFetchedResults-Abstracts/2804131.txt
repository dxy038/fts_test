The objective of this paper consists in the development, implementation, testing and validation of a new mathematical model based on the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) specially designed for modeling the mobile material discontinuities with direct application in optimization of electric structures in 3D space. This new mathematical concept eliminates the conventional use of discrete elements and provides an efficient, stable, accurate and fast calculation scheme, removing the finite elements network re-meshing at each step of optimization.

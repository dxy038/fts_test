The objective of this paper is to derive, using a general approach of the calculus of variations, time-functional equations for short-range optimization of combined hydrothermal systems. Tests to establish the fact that these equations essentially produce the desired optimum operation are given in the form of three necessary and three sufficient conditions. This paper proves that several previously developed equations for short-term optimization are equivalent, and that these formulas are simplified forms of the general equations developed here.

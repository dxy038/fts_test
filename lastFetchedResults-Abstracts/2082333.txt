The current study is an attempt to develop a multi-objective mathematical model for power
generation expansion planning in Iran. The study is applied and descriptive and seeks to
develop a linear mathematical model for power generation expansion planning through
mathematical programming techniques. The main functions are minimizing the total
production costs (both investment and operational costs) and ecological pollutants (e.g.,
CO2, SO2, and NOx). The constraints of the model are demand constraints, constraints of
the production concentration in special technologies, reserve margin constraints and nonnegative constraints. The present study attempts to prepare the generation expansion
planning in Iran power industry for the time period from 2015 to 2034. The proposed model
was encoded in GAMS and was solved through both the Goal Programing and the
Comprehensive Criteria methods.

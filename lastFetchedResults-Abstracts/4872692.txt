This paper mentions the facial caricature drawing system that draws caricature reflecting user´s impressions and image of model´s face. User´s impressions and image are inputted to the system with linguistic expressions. The present system has user´s own databases of parameter values of facial features expressing impressions and facial features since the meanings of linguistic expressions are dependent on user´s own subjectivity. Parameter values of caricature are calculated according to inputted linguistic expressions of user´s impressions and image of model´s face. The system draws facial caricature using calculated parameters values. Subject experiments are performed in order to confirm the validity of the system. In the experiments subjects draw facial caricature of many models and evaluate them from both subjective and objective points of view. The experimental results show that the present system can draw facial caricatures not only reflecting user´s images of models´ faces from subjective point of view but also giving high recognition degree from objective point of view.

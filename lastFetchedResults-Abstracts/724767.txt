A series of 2-hydroxy-aminoalkyl derivatives of diaryloxy methano phenanthrenes were synthesized from nucleophilic opening of oxirane with different amines. These compounds were evaluated for their antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in vitro and showed MIC in the range of 3.12–25 μg/ml.

Building energy consumption and human comfort are two major but often contradictory themes in modern building management. To alleviate the contradiction between the two themes, multi-objective optimization methods are always introduced. In this paper, three indexes, thermal comfort, visual comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) are integrated to evaluate the indoor comfort. Based on a multi-agent structure, a model including comfort function and energy function is proposed. The multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to optimize the energy and comfort targets. And the Pareto optimal solution and its sensitivity analysis are discussed under several cases.

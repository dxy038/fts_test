The human-computer interaction became a routine and intuitive task of a cardiologist. The ECG interpretation software may be modified to trace the interaction history and to provide the information useful for the investigation of the expert preferences. Because the consciousness of the investigated expert is not engaged as much as in the disclosed questionnaire, the response is not biased making the measurement more objective. The paper demonstrates metrological backgrounds and the use of a hidden poll in the investigation of the priority of ECG diagnostic parameters in context of various cardiac diseases. This knowledge, difficult to be derived otherwise, is applied in the disease-oriented assessment of the diagnostic quality.

There is some difficulty in evaluating the designs of bulldozer. Being a complex mechanical system, the bulldozer has many subsystems and factors, which are interrelated, constrained mutually and interacted with each other. And its information is always incomplete and uncertain. The present methods like AHP and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation canÂ´t solve this type of problem satisfactorily. And the result of subjective or objective method to determine weight is one-side and unsatisfactory. So, the method of the multi-objective grey situation group decision-making based on combinatorial weight was adopted in this paper. Firstly, the theory of multi-objective grey situation decision-making was introduced. Secondly, the combination weight was determined by experts grading method and entropy method. Finally, an example of how to select a optima bulldozer design was given. The evaluation result can prove that the grey comprehensive evaluation based on combinatorial weight is effective. And this method can provide decision-makers a scientific and feasible technical support.

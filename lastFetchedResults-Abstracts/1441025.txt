The main objective of this work is to present an alternative boundary element method (BEM) formulation for the static analysis of three-dimensional non-homogeneous isotropic solids. These problems can be solved using the classical boundary element formulation, analyzing each subregion separately and then joining them together by introducing equilibrium and displacements compatibility. Establishing relations between the displacement fundamental solutions of the different domains, the alternative technique proposed in this paper allows analyzing all the domains as one unique solid, not requiring equilibrium or compatibility equations. This formulation also leads to a smaller system of equations when compared to the usual subregion technique, and the results obtained are even more accurate.

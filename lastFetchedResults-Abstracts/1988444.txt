The objective of this study was to evaluate the antioxidative properties of a chitosan–glucose Maillard reaction product (CG-MRP), and its effect on pork qualities during refrigerated storage. Chitosan (1%), which was dissolved in acetic acid (1%) with 1.0%, 1.5%, or 2.0% glucose, pH adjusted to 6.0, autoclaved (121 °C, 15 min) and cooled, was prepared. The results showed that the 2,2-dipheny1-1-picrylhydrazy1 (DPPH) radical scavenging activities, ferrous ion chelating abilities, and reducing powers of various CG-MRP solutions were not significantly different. Pork loins soaked in the CG-MRP solutions or deionized water for 10 min and without dipping were stored at 4 °C for 7 days. Little influence was observed on the L∗, a∗, and b∗ colour values of the samples. Dipping in CG-MRP tended to retard the increases in volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) values, and resulted in lower microbial counts during storage. No detrimental influence on the sensory characteristics was found.

Objective
m of this study was to investigate the effect of β-aminopropionitrile (β-APN), present in Lathyrus sativus (L. sativus) seeds consumed in drought prone areas, on the maxillary and mandibular bones of rats.

en rats were used; they were divided into experimental group (12 rats) and a control group (6 rats). In the experimental group, lathyrism was induced by a once daily subcutaneous administration of β-APN at a dose of 5 mg in 0.4 ml distilled water per 100 g of body weight for 40 days. The specimens were examined histologically, histomorphometrically and ultrastructurally.
s
athological examination of lathyritic rats showed that both mandible and maxillae were significantly affected. Irregular bone trabeculae with wide medullary cavities and abundant marrow spaces were observed. Focal resorptive areas lined with osteoclasts were also present. Histomorphometric analysis showed a decrease in the area percentage of bone in lathyritic rats as compared to the control. This decrease was statistically significant only in the mandible (p = 0.018). Moreover, a significant increase in the number of osteoclasts (p =0.014, 0.012) and resorptive bays (p = 0.013, 0.002) was detected in the maxillae and mandible of the experimental group, respectively. Ultrastructurally, there was a significant difference in the microarchitecture of the collagen fibres in lathyritic rats compared to the control. The collagen fibres in the lathyritic group appeared disorganized, fewer in number and more spaced.
sions
tudy provided evidence for lathyritic disturbances in bone architecture. These disturbances are likely to affect mineralization and bone strength as well.

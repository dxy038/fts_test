Background & Objective: The NICU is an important part in a hospital. Hence in this study, we studied the relationship between the type of delivery and conditions used in this section on IQ of Children who born prematurely   
Material & Methods: This study was carried out on 102 premature children who born in Najmye subspecialty hospitals during years 2004 to 2006. The tools used in this study were Wechsler intelligence scale for children and a questioner including demographical characteristic. In this study anesthesia, delivery, convulsion, apgar, Meconium aspiration, CPR, RDS, blood culture, congenital anomalies, hyperbilirubinemia (HY) and  use of ventilator and sorvanta  were consider as the independent variables and IQ consider as dependent variable. In this paper we used t test, Mann-Whitney and ANOVA and also SPSS programmer version 16 was used to analyze data.
Results: The sample was including 61 boys (% 59.8) and 41 girls (% 40.2). The average IQ score was 100 (±16.23).  Among the studied variables, only HY (p=0.036) showed a relationship with IQ but others didn’t show such relationship.  
Conclusion: Because of lower IQ of premature children who hospitalized in the NICU, doing some reinforcement work is recommended for these children

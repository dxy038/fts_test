The main objective of this study was estimation of three forest biophysical properties including volume, basal area and number per hectare using SPOT-HRG data in district 1 Darabkolaâ€™s forest. Images were orthorectified to reduce relief displacement errors. Different synthetic bands were generated trough principal component analysis and suitable vegetation indices were created by rationing. After take territorial information, accomplished calculation volume, basal area and number per hectare values in sample plat. Since analyze normalized data, evaluating correlation between territorial and spectral by linear regression. Cross validation getting best correlation model investigating by some sample plat and by relevant evaluation criterions. For volume estimation, results of this study showed that linear combination of NIR and SWIR bands by adjusted determination coefficient 74.5% and root mean square relative error 77.1 m3/ha were better predictors than other combination. For basal area estimation, linear combination NIR band and MSAVI2 index showed best results (R2adj=80.5; RMSE=4.02). Linear combination NIR and SWIR band by adjusted determination coefficient of 85.7% and root mean square relative error of 44.6 numbers per hectare could better predict the number trees per hectare. Results this study showed SPOT data has high capability for estimation biophysical properties as volume, basal area and number

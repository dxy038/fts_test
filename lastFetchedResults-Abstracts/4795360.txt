The objective of this study is to investigate the energy saving potential for refrigeration systems by refrigeration more at the colder night time than at the warmer day time. The potential is evaluated using a standard model predictive control formulation and illustrated on a simulation example. The results shows that the significant potential savings depends on two refrigeration system parameters and the variation of the outdoor temperature. The system dependency is illustrated in a parameter study.

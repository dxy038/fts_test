A fuzzy-based radius ossified model for bone age estimation (BAE) which involves image preprocessing, feature extraction, is afforded. The objective of this paper is to estimate the bone age using fuzzy model based on distal radius features. Results obtained confirm that the ratio of radius to distal end is a significant parameter to describe the status of bone growth before a child reach the age of 14.

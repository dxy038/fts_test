A bidirectional electromagnetic screen is proposed and demonstrated with properties that can be switched between high reflection, absorption and transmission over &#8764;10 ns. The screen comprises frequency selective surfaces loaded with pin diodes, which under partial biasing conditions provide the loss mechanism for the absorption state of the screen.

The SIDDHARTA (SIlicon Drift Detector for Hadronic Atom Research by Timing Application) experiment [J. Zmeskal, SIDDHARTA Technical Note IR-2 (2003); C. Curceanu (Petrascu), SID-DHARTA Technical Note IR-3 (2003)] represents the scientific and technical development of DEAR (DAΦNE Exotic Atom Research) [S. Bianco et al., Rivista del Nuovo Cimento 22 (11) (1999) 1], as part of the program dedicated to exotic atoms at DAΦNE [G. Vignola, Proc. of the “5th European Particle Accelerator Conference”, Sitges, Eds. S. Myres et al., Institute of Physics Publishing, Bristol and Philadelphia (1996) 22]. The objective consists in an eV precision measurement of the kaonic hydrogen Kα line shift and width induced by the strong interaction, and the first measurement of kaonic deuterium. These values will allow a precise determination of antikaon-nucleon scattering lengths and a better understanding of the chiral symmetry breaking scenario in the strangeness sector. DEAR performed the most precise measurement up to now on kaonic hydrogen, at the end of 2002. The SIDDHARTA collaboration is developing a new set of large area, triggerable X-ray Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD), which will improve by 2 orders of magnitude the background rejection, allowing to reach the proposed objectives. The results of DEAR, as well as the state of the art of the new setup are presented.

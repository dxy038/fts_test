Background: Constructed wetland is one of the natural methods of municipal and industrial wastewater
treatments with low initial costs for construction and operation as well as easy maintenance. The main objective of
this study is to determine the values of indicator bacteria removal, organic matter, TSS, ammonia and nitrate
affecting the wetland removal efficiency.
Results: The average concentration of E. coli and total coliform in the input is 1.127 × 1014 and 4.41 × 1014 MPN/
100 mL that reached 5.03 × 1012 and 1.13 × 1014 MPN/100 mL by reducing 95.5% and 74.4% in wetland 2. Fecal
streptococcus reached from the average 5.88 × 1014 in raw wastewater to 9.69 × 1012 in the output of wetland 2.
Wetland 2 could reduce 1.5 logarithmic units of E. coli. The removal efficiency of TSS for the wetlands is 68.87%,
71.4%, 57.3%, and 66% respectively.
Conclusions: The overall results show that wetlands in which herbs were planted had a high removal efficiency
about the indicator pathogens, organic matter, LAS detergent in comparison to a control wetland (without canes)
and could improve physicochemical parameters (DO, ammonia, nitrate, electrical conductivity, and pH) of
wastewater.

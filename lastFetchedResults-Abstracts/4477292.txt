The objective of this paper is to show how the operational availability (Ao) requirement that Alenia Spazio has received under the Assured Crew Return Vehicle (ACRV) program has been interpreted and assessed in terms of mathematical techniques, models and quiescent failure rate assumptions. The resulting design and operation scenarios are discussed, a preferred solution is justified and benefits that could be derived from future improvements are identified

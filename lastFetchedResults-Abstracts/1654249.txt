Background and Objective: Test anxiety as a major problem in teaching affects millions of students around the world and causes a drop in their academic performance. The effective factor in reducing anxiety is religious beliefs. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Tavasol prayer on reducing test anxiety of students in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.
Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study with a pre- and post-test design was conducted on 70 new registered nursing students of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in 2013. Data was collected by demographic information and Spielberg questionnaires. After giving an initial test to 70 students, 39 of them were identified with high anxiety and were divided into experimental (n=19) and control (n=20) groups randomly. For the intervention group, about 15 minutes audio file of Tavasol prayer was broadcast through a loudspeaker 30 minutes before the test. Immediately and 15 minutes later, students’ anxiety of both groups was assessed again. The control group didn’t hear audio file. Data was analyzed by SPSS19 software using paired and independent t-test, Chi-square and Pearson correlation tests. 
Results: The mean of pre-test anxiety score in the intervention group (44.26±2.43) compared with the control group (42.20±2.27) showed no significant difference (P=0/09). But the mean of anxiety score after the first post-test (34.73±1.45) and 15 minutes later (31.74±1.45) showed a significant decrease in anxiety level of the experimental group (P=0.001). In the control group, after the first post-test (31.05±0.82) and 15 minutes later (28.80±0.53) no significant difference was observed (P=0.99).
Conclusion: The results showed positive effect of Tavasol prayer on reducing students’ test anxiety; therefore, this prayer as a low-cost and simple method is suggested for students.

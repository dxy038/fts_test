This paper presents the field testing of a street lighting monitoring and control system. The system is based on a WSN network of the large-scale type that enables the remote control of street lighting lamps. The system also enables savings in terms of the electric power and maintenance costs. The architecture uses integrated Doppler sensors that allows for vehicle detection and help complete the power efficiency objective. Thus, when a vehicle is detected the light intensity of the lamps is increased to a preset level, so as not to affect road traffic safety, and reduced in the opposite case. Moreover, the system uses current sensors so as to allow for the identification of any possible malfunctions and thus facilitate the maintenance process. According to the obtained results, the system allows for an increased performance level and can be integrated in the Smart City concept.

Previous work on antenna selection in MIMO systems, which deal with error performance, has mainly focused on frequency-flat channels. As a result, the objective was to minimize the symbol error rate (SER) or pairwise error probability (PEP). However, in present and future communication systems, where high throughput is one of the major features, wideband systems with frequency selectivity are now becoming common. Therefore, SER in flat-fading channels may not be a good measure for evaluating antenna selection in practical systems. In this paper, instead, we formulate the antenna selection problem based on a frequency-selective WLAN system. Hence the objective is to reduce the packet error rate (PER). We propose different antenna selection algorithms depending on the extent of channel state information we have. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms proposed.

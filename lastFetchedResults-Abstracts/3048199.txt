Two further developments of the inventory control strategy are studied in this paper. First we use high gain (sliding mode) adaptive control to handle the system uncertainties caused by modelling errors and unmeasured disturbances. It is proved that this control law makes the uncertain system globally stable. The parameters of the resulting controller are easy to tune. Second, inventory control was primarily developed for systems with relative degree equal to one. In this paper we develop an objective-based control strategy which allows application of the inventory control idea to systems with higher relative degree. Several simulation studies illustrate the application of the novel method.

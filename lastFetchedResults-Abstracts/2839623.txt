This research paper attempts to acquire the electroencephalogram (EEG) to analyze the characteristic frequency bands of the brainwave related to different relaxation activities, i.e., reading novel and watching movie. Based on the cognitive neuroscience, this paper first formulates the relaxation energy index (REI) of the subject when the subject is performing relaxation. The objective of this study is to effectively analyze the learnersÂ´ energy distribution of relaxation by analyzing influences of different relaxation activities.

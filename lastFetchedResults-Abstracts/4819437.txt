Due to increasing demands, Multi-port dc-dc converters with high-voltage gain have been researched thoroughly. In recent years, these converters are widely used in automotive and photovoltaic systems. The Portable consumer products consist of different submodules and they require various voltage or/and current levels of supplies. The main objective of this paper is to simulate and implement a level shifting multiple input voltage copiers. The copier includes five different circuits. This converter can be used to copy and shift the input voltage. With lesser number of component counts, the cost is reduced considerably and the overall efficiency is increased. The double, half and inverting circuits are to be studied to implement this dc-dc converter while summation and subtraction have been presented before. Each level circuit includes only seven electronic components therefore ensure the simplicity and reliability of the voltage copier. The switching losses are to be reduced by resonant switching. In this paper, a voltage copier circuit with high efficiency is proposed which minimize the current stress and the pulsation current which are found in the classical circuits. Simulation results verify the performance of the voltage copier and the proposed method. The circuit is simulated in MATLAB Simulink.

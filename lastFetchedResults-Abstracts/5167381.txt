This paper describes a new multi-objective evolutionary programming (MOEP) method to solve the combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) and economic emission dispatch (EED) problems. The CEED is a bi-objective optimization problem that considers two objectives such as fuel cost and NO<sub>x</sub> emission. It is converted into a single objective optimization problem using weighted sum method. The EED is a three-objective optimization problem that considers the fuel cost, NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions as objectives. Non-dominated solution ranking is employed as selection mechanism in the proposed MOEP for the CEED and EED problems. The developed algorithm is tested for a three-unit and a six-unit systems, and six and 30 bus systems. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach to generate well-distributed Pareto optimal solutions of the multi-objective problems in a single run.

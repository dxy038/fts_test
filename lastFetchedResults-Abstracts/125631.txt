Geographical bases fall generally into two major categories: Natural and human. Studies have revealed that in addition to being affected by human bases, settlement system structure has also emerged due to natural bases. As an attempt to deal with this case, this study follows an applied research methodology in terms of the objective, and an analysis- correlative method in terms of nature or quality. The results gained by correlation coefficient and regression analysis of the variables under study and settlement distribution clearly reveal a direct meaningful correlation between the type of lands and settlement distributibution, and a negative meaningful one between settlement distribution and highland levels. As far as the relation between natural bases and human bases are concerned, the functional situation also influence the settlement system.
The Functional situation itself depends on the natural situation. However, it includes situational, local, area, and beyond area aspects as well.

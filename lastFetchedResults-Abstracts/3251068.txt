Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) are many used to high performance applications. Accurate faults detection can significantly improve system availability and reliability. This paper investigates the experimental implementation and detection of open phase faults in interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM). The proposed method of open phase fault detection is based only on stator current measurement. The objective of this paper is to develop a new detection method for the open phase fault in IPMSM drives. The main idea consists in minimizing the number of sensors allowing the open stator phase fault of the system to study. This paper proposes the fault diagnosis for open-phase faults of IPMSM drives using a Discrete Fourier Transform phase. The current waveform patterns for various modes of open phase winding are investigated. Discrete Fourier Transform is used for the phases (&#966;<sub>&#945;</sub>, &#966;<sub>&#946;</sub>) calculation. Experimental results show that the method is able to detect the open-phase faults in IPMSM drive. The experimental implementation is carried out on powerful dSpace DS1103 controller board based on the digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320F240. Experimental results obtained confirm the aforementioned study.

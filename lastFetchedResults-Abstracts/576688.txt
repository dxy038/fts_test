Objective: Medicinal plants are widely used throughout  the world. Since these plants are known to have minimal side effects, many people embrace them. The golpar plant, scientifically known as Heracleum persicum (H. persicum), is a common Asian and Iranian medicinal plant. The use of golpar is recommended in traditional medicine as a contraceptive

medication for females; however, no scientifically documented evidence has been reported. This study investigates the effects of the golpar plant on ovarian tissue and folliculogenesis.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, H. persicum hydroalcoholic extract (HPHE) was used at 400 mg/kg and 1600 mg/kg doses. Adult female rats were divided into three groups: control, sham, and experimental(I, II). The control group did not receive any injection, the sham group received saline solution, and the experimental group received IP injections of HPHE for 21 days, once every other day, during the sexual cycle. At the end of the injection period, ovarian samples were harvested for histological studies. The FSH assay was performed according to the chemiluminescence immunoassay
(CLIA) method. Data were statistically
analyzed
by
the Instat3 program and
one-way

ANOVA.
A
p value of  < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: In the experimental group the numbers of primordial and primary follicles increased
(p < 0.001),
while the
number of
preantral and
antral follicles decreased
(p < 0.01).

The
atretic follicles decreased in
the experimental group,
but this decrease was not significant.
There
was
no
statistical
difference
in
FSH
concentration
when
compared
with
the

control
group. 
Conclusion: This report gives primary information on the in vivo effects of the HPHE on the ovarian follicles of the female Wistar rat. The results suggest that administration
of
HPHE
may
have
inhibitory
effects
on
folliculogenesis
and
cause
infertility
in

females.

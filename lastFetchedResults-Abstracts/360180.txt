Study objective:  Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) may contain as much as 38% ethanol. We evaluated the effects of ethanol-containing MDIs on breath alcohol testing.

Design: Prospective, single-blind, crossover, controlled study.

Participants: Three healthy male volunteers 29 to 36 years old.

Intervention: We studied three brands: Tornalate, (38% ethanol), Bronkometer, (30% ethanol), and Alupent, (0% ethanol). The effects of each MDI on breath and blood ethanol measurements were evaluated separately. Two puffs of each brand of MDI were administered. Breath ethanol measurements were obtained at baseline and .25, .5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 minutes after MDI use. Blood ethanol measurements were obtained at baseline and 1 and 10 minutes after MDI use.

Results: Overall, Tornalate had the highest breath ethanol readings, with a mean ethanol level of 189 mg/dL recorded just after MDI use. Breath ethanol levels subsequently decreased rapidly over time. Mean breath ethanol concentrations were lower after the use of Bronkometer and undetectable after the use of Alupent. Blood ethanol levels were undetectable at all times tested.

Conclusion: MDIs may cause elevations of breath alcohol above the legal criteria for intoxication. These effects are transient and may be prevented by a 10-minute interval between the use of an MDI and breath alcohol testing.

Modern electric distribution networks are mutating towards higher use of renewable energy supplies, which deliver the energy depending on its availability and not the demand. That leads to fluctuations the actual electric system control cannot handle. In fact this issue may be solved mainly by storing the excess of energy until it gets needed. For faster applications requiring a high dynamic response, the most accurate storage medium are Double-Layer-Capacitors [1]. They have the ability to support the electrical distribution grid by balancing voltage drops, net flicker and harmonics due to their high power density thus low reaction time. An attractive alternative to static energy storage systems is the high number of batteries built in electric cars in the next years. Due to the future development of automotive market towards the electrification of cars, a very high distributed energy storage opportunity will be available. This may be also coupled to the grid via a bidirectional power electronics. Assuming that drivers donÂ´t always plug the cable to the mains, an automatic wireless energy transfer is proposed to guarantee a connection between the car battery and the grid. The aim of this work is to prove that both of these technologies are suitable for supporting the low voltage distribution grid for the required time intervals.

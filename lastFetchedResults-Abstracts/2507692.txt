Objective: Radiation effects induced in non-irradiated cells are termed radiation-induced
bystander effects (RIBE). The present study intends to examine the RIBE response of
QU-DB bystander cells to first, second and third radiation fractions and compare their
cumulative outcome with an equal, single acute dose.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study irradiated three groups of target cells
for one, two and three times with 60Co gamma rays. One hour after irradiation, we transferred
their culture media to non-irradiated (bystander) cells. We used the cytokinesis
block micronucleus assay to evaluate RIBE response in the bystander cells. The numbers
of micronuclei generated in bystander cells were determined.
Results: RIBE response to single acute doses increased up to 4 Gy, then decreased,
and finally at the 8 Gy dose disappeared. The second and third fractions induced RIBE
in bystander cells, except when RIBE reached to the maximum level at the first fraction.
We split the 4 Gy acute dose into two fractions, which decreased the RIBE response.
However, fractionation of 6 Gy (into two fractions of 3 Gy or three fractions of 2 Gy) had
no effect on RIBE response. When we split the 8 Gy acute dose into two fractions we
observed RIBE, which had disappeared following the single 8 Gy dose.
Conclusion: The impact of dose fractionation on RIBE induced in QU-DB cells depended
on the RIBE dose-response relationship. Where RIBE increased proportionally
with the dose, fractionation reduced the RIBE response. In contrast, at high doses
where RIBE decreased proportionally with the dose, fractionation either did not
change RIBE (at 6 Gy) or increased it (at 8 Gy).

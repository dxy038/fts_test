The optimal resource allocation policy is studied for non-real-time users in CDMA reverse link. The resource allocation policy of interest includes channel coding, spreading gain control and power allocation under the conventional receiver operation. The constraints in the optimization include peak transmit power of the mobile station, total received power at the base station and QoS in the form of minimum SINR for each user. The coding and spreading gain control can be separated from the power allocation strategy. Our results show that the optimal power allocation policy depends on the objective function: a greedy policy is optimal to maximize the sum of throughput from each user, whereas a fair policy is optimal to maximize the product of throughput from each user. A unified approach is taken to derive the optimal policies, and it can also be applied to other power allocation problems in CDMA reverse link. Numerical results of the channel capacity are presented for both objectives along with the effect of QoS constraints.

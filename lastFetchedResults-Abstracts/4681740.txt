Topology optimization method is a novel design method for MEMS actuators. In this paper, a multi-objective design method is introduced into topology optimization for MEMS actuators. Some important factors for multi-objective design of MEMS actuators are deeply researched. A multi-objective topology optimization method based on minimal structural compliance and maximal structural output displacement of MEMS actuators is proposed and the corresponding governing equation for topology optimization is established. A sensitivity analysis of adjoint method is proposed to analyze topology optimization design of multi-objective MEMS actuators. Meanwhile, GCMMA (globally convergent version of the method of moving asymptotes) algorithm is used in optimization. Two numerical examples of MEMS actuators verified the effectiveness of above theory and algorithm

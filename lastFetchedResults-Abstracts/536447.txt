The primary objective of the paper is to propose a calibration method for a stereo camera used in avisual servo control for a robot manipulator. Specifically, projection matrix between the stereo camera and worldcoordinates is established using few calibration points and solved using the single value decomposition technique. Then calibration accuracy is compared for a randomized and designed set of points, and economical number ofcalibration points is recommended. Additionally, the non-linear lens distortion is modeled and corrected toimprove the accuracy. In addition, this research focuses on the development and implementation of a fullyautomated visual servo control system using a stereo camera that is calibrated by proposed method

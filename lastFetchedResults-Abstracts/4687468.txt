It is very important to schedule container flows in a container seaport. Current paper aims to discuss the schedule issue of cranes to the handle containers, with an objective of optimizing crane scheduling and container flows in the yard subject to deterministic crane availability constraints. The problem is formulated as NP-hard problem and a revised genetic algorithm is proposed to solve it.

In the regime of partial synchronization, networks of diffusively coupled Hindmarchâ€“Rose neurons show coherent structures developing in a region of the phase space which is wider than in the correspondent single neuron. Such structures are kept, without important changes, during several bursting periods. In this work, we study the time evolution of these structures and their dynamical stability under damage. This system may model the behavior of ensembles of neurons coupled through a bidirectional gap junction or, in a broader sense, it could also account for the molecular cascades present in the formation of flash and short time memory

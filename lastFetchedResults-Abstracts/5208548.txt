ldquoFirst Respondersrdquo within, and collaborating with, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) need reliable communications capabilities providing assured access over a trusted network. The coverage area for these users stretches from Hawaii and Alaska to Maine and Florida, often in diverse terrain where the telecommunications infrastructure is either inoperable or non-existent. They need durable radios that are interoperable with other Federal agencies, such as the Coast Guard, National Guard, and Department of Defense Reserves. This paper discusses a solution that fully meets their reliable link goals in a secure and cost effective manner through leveraged use of the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). The benefits are unparalleled - no up-front or long-term leasing costs, high bandwidth, mobility, NSA-approved protection, secure gateways, worldwide coverage and a fully financed program. Finally, the paper discusses policy implications regarding capacity provisioning and usage.

The EPRI Green Circuits project was a collaborative effort of 22 utilities with the main objective of evaluating ways to improve distribution efficiency. For this evaluation, 66 circuit case studies were used. Each circuit was modeled in detail from the substation to each customerÂ´s meter. Nearly all of the circuit models were augmented with historical circuit-measurement data that allowed for hourly-resolution simulation of the operation of the circuit for actual load patterns for each hour in a calendar year (8760 hours). All sources of losses through both daily and seasonal load changes were found with these circuit models. This paper provides a summary of the collective results from 66 circuits modeled.

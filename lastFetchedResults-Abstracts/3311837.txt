For the basic requirements of power system operation of security, high quality, economy, environmental protection, a multi-objective optimal power flow(MOPF) model is established to minimize three objective functions of load buses voltage deviations, network active power loss, pollution gas emissions and meanwhile to satisfy the security constraints of power transmission limits in lines. The normal boundary intersection method (NBI) is adopted to transform three-objective optimal power flow model into a series of single-objective optimization model, and then the interior point method is used to obtain the evenly distributed Pareto frontier in objective functions space. According to fuzzy membership and entropy weight of various targets, the comprehensive compromise optimal solution can be identified from the Pareto frontier surface, which is employed as the operation dispatching scheme of the system. By the multi-objective optimization calculation of the IEEE 9-buses system and the IEEE 39-buses system, the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm, and indicate that the comprehensive compromised optimal solution can be used as an optimal dispatching scheme of power system operation.

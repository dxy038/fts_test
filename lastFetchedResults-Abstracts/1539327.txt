The synchronization in four forced FitzHughâ€“Nagumo (FHN) systems is studied, both experimentally and by numerical simulations of a model. We show that synchronization may be achieved either by coupling of systems through bidirectional diffusive interactions, by introducing a common noise to all systems or by combining both ingredients, noise and coupling together. Here we consider white and colored noises, showing that the colored noise is more efficient in synchronizing the systems respect to white noise. Moreover, a small addition of common noise allows the synchronization to occur at smaller values of the coupling strength. When the diffusive coupling in the absence of noise is considered, the system undergoes the transition to subthreshold oscillations, giving a spike suppression regime. We show that noise destroys the appearance of this dynamical regime induced by coupling.

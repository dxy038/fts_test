Investigation was carried out to illustrate some of the flow and heat transfer characteristics that occur when a single-air jet or mist/air jet impinges on a flat plate with a rotating disk mounted above the surface, representative of the work-piece in a grinding process. The first objective aimed to assess the detailed flow and heat transfer features in the vicinity of a rotating grinding wheel with single-air jet impingement directed at grinding zone by numerical investigation. The second objective aimed to assess the quantitative evaluation for heat transfer enhancement on a grinding work-piece surface subjected to the mist/air jet impingement by experimental investigation. The results show that the coupled action of swirl air entrainment and jet impingement is benefit somewhat for overall convective heat transfer in relative to stationary disk case whether the disk rotates in clockwise or contrary clockwise. When the jet impinging direction is consistent with the rotational direction of rotating disk, convective heat transfer enhancement is achieved near grinding region, especially at higher rotating speed. Furthermore, the increasing of water droplet in mist/air jet impingement showed significant enhancement of the cooling effect.

In this paper we study the bidirectional shufflenet topology, which is obtained from the well-known (unidirectional) shufflenet by considering bidirectional links. More specifically, we define a shortest-path routing algorithm, and derive the diameter and the average distance of the topology. The bidirectional shufflenet is then compared, in terms of average distance, with other variations of the perfect shuffle

DPI (Direct Power Injection) testing according to IEC 62132-4 has been widely adopted as an effective test method for IC-level pin-selective RF immunity testing. To enable DPI testing of an IC, a dedicated test board needs to be designed that basically makes up the whole EMC test set-up. Boards that are designed in accordance with IEC 62132-4, should work well up to 1 GHz. However, various anomalies can occur if no proper care is taken of all possible RF phenomena. This paper explains our design approach to effectively deal with these issues and at the same time even extend the useful frequency range up to 2 GHz. Specific guidelines to achieve this objective are given.

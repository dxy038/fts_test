Analytic hierarchy process is very extensive in decision-making of many objects. But the comparison judgement matrix is constructed, it takes to have the dense subjectivity. In this paper, the mathematical model about comparing comprehensive strength of the publishing company is studied and Analytic hierarchy process is improved properly. First a reasonable evaluation system is constituted, the comparison judgement matrix of the proposal layer is made of the index value of the evaluation system constituted, so that the result of the model is less influenced by subjective factors and the comparison judgement matrix consistency is also guaranteed. The improved Analytic hierarchy process is more objective, more logical and more compact.

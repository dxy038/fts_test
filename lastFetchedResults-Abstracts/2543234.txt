Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between social responsibility and ethical climate with perceived sport performance of volleyball players.
Methodology: The research method used was descriptive and correlational. The population sample of this research work was the volleyball players of the North Khorasan province who attended the club matches in 2014-2015 (N = 216), and all the players were selected as the sample. The data was collected with three questionnaires including social responsibility adjusted (Carroll, 1979) with 19 items and 5 dimensions, ethical climate (victor & Cullen, 1987) with 26 items and 6 dimensions, and perceived team performance (Glenn, 2003) with 6 items in a range of 5-point Likert (1= very low, 5= very much). To analyze the data, the Pearson's correlation and Path analysis were used.
Results: The results obtained showed that social responsibility had a significant and direct effect on the ethical climate and perceived performance but it did not have a significant and direct effect on the ethical climate and an indirect effect on the perceived performance.
Conclusion: Managers and coaches can affect the ethical climate and perceived performance positively through taking social responsibility promoting policies.

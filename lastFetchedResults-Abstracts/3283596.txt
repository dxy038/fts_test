Protection systems planning is essential to enhance the reliability of radial distribution feeders. This planning must consider the amount of devices as their efficient placement in the feeder. Moreover, distributed generation (DG) has been largely considered as an alternative to increase the operation performance of distribution systems, besides its merely function to provide energy. Protective devices, such as reclosers, allow DG to operate in island mode decreasing the non-supplied energy (ENS). In this paper, the economic theory of the firm, together with evolutionary algorithms, is used to derive the optimal planning of reclosers. A single objective optimization problem is developed in order to minimize the ENS. Furthermore, genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE) are implemented to solve the decision making problem. Finally, Simulations are applied on a real test feeder in two cases: without DG and with 6 MW penetration of distributed sources.

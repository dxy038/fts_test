This work performs numerical and experimental studies of coupled mode dynamics for monolithic semiconductor ring lasers. This study presents numerical analysis and experimental results of the different operating regimes, namely: bidirectional CW, bidirectional with harmonic oscillations of the mode intensities, and unidirectional.

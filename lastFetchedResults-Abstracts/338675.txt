Objective
The main objective of this work was to decrease the incidence of relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation with a “double purging” procedure.
Methods

We used a “positive” (CD34) and “negative” (CD19) double selection method to improve the efficacy of “single purging” of hematopoietic harvests in poor-prognosis lymphoproliferative disorders. All patients included in the study had a positive molecular marker of their disease. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was studied by flow cytometry and PCR techniques during the purging procedure and after transplantation.
Results

Twenty-six patients fulfilled entry criteria. Median age of patients was 50 years (range: 33–66); 17 were male and 9 female. Thirteen (50%) of the patients mobilized an adequate number of CD34+ cells (≥3 × 106/kg) to proceed with the double-selection protocol. Twelve of the 13 harvests became PCR negative after purging. Ten patients were grafted with the selected products and all but one engrafted without delay. After a median follow-up of 30 months, 2 of 10 patients suffered a molecular relapse at 7 and 19 months respectively. The earlier relapse was observed in the patient who received a MRD+ product. Only one patient experienced a clinical relapse. Three patients died due to obliterans bronchiolitis, pneumococcal sepsis, and septic shock of unknown origin, respectively, and three others presented life-threatening infections.
Conclusion

Therefore, CD34+/CD19+ positive/negative selection is an effective purging approach in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. This favorable effect is, however, counterbalanced by the high frequency of life-threatening infections.

Understanding the properties of particle aggregation and resulting aggregates under microgravity conditions leads to better insights on the formation of the early Solar System planetesimals. Simulating such conditions is the main objective of Interactions in Cosmic and Atmospheric Particle System (ICAPS), a multi-users facility currently under phase B at ESA for the International Space Station. First results of light scattering simulations by core-mantle aggregates of grains with organics and icy mantles are presented to show the evolution of polarization with aggregation. The Light Scattering Unit is both a polarization diagnostic tool for ICAPS, and an experiment that will allow the interpretation of the available light scattering dust observations in terms of physical properties of the scattering media. This presentation updates the current approach of the calibration procedures and the innovative experimental setup (providing a phase angle exploration from about 2° to 175° together with a wavelength exploration from 0.4 to 0.8 μm). We also assess the possibility for the determination of the entire Stokes vector of the light scattered by the aggregates.

The purpose of optimal voltage/reactive power control is to minimize the real power loss and improve the voltage profile. However in practice the security and the number of control movement should be taken into account. In this paper the formulation of the fuzzy multiple objective optimization problem with soft constraints is presented and the SLP algorithm is employed to solve the problem. The tests on the practical network demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed approach

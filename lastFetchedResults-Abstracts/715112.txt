ABSTRACT: There are special characteristic of the stability behavior for the inter-area power systems. Therefore, the improvement of inter-area power system is one of the important aspects in power system. To reduce the detrimental effects of inter-area oscillations on system stability, this research uses Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) to design a multi-objective state feedback. This paper presents a detailed analysis of low-frequency inter-area oscillations of systems. The influences of component maintenances in the transmission corridors on the inter-area oscillations are further investigated, and some important conclusions are drawn. We find a control law that stabilizes several contingencies simultaneously using a polytypic model of the system. We used the technique on machines and get satisfactory results.

In this paper, an adaptive color filter array (CFA) interpolation method is presented. By examining the edge levels and the variance of color difference along different edge directions, the missing green samples are first estimated. The missing red and blue samples are then estimated based on the interpolated green plane. This algorithm can effectively preserve the details as well as significantly reduce the color artifacts. As compared with some current state-of-art methods, the proposed algorithm provides outperformed results in terms of both subjective and objective image quality measures.

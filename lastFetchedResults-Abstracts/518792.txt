Background: Fungal air Spores can play a significant role in several allergic manifestations. Respiratory allergy to environmental molds is relatively common. Allergy to airborne fungi can cause rhinitis and severe asthma.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate airborne fungal spores at Qazvin.

Methods: This descriptive study was conducted by Petri - dish trapping technique. 25 different

locations selected. The data were analyzed by the chi-square and t-tests.

Findings: Totally, 2652 fungus colonies were counted from 150 Petri dish. The most common fungi wereCLadosporium spp , Penicillium spp, Aspergillus spp. Alternaria spp. Conclusion: Our results seem to confirm that fungal air spores, because of its quantity and variety, can represent a serious problem for human health .Reducing these indoor fungi is necessary to improve the health of individuals with fungal-induced diseases like asthma.

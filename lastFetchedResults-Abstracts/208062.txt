Background & Objective: Promoting quality or clinical education necessitates continuous
evaluation of the current situations, identifying strengths. and improving weaknesses. This study
was designed to assess clinical education status according to the nursing and midwifery students'
point of view in Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

were doing a Bachelor of Science and senior midwifery students who were doing technician's
Course (250 students) were asked to complete a 36 item questionnaire in a self-administered way.
Results: The most important strengths of clinical education (according to mean scores) were "on
time presence of the student in the ward" (89.06), then "on time presence of the instructor in the
ward", (85,05), "considering the pre-requisite clerkship courses", (82.5), "proper instructors'
behavior with students", (74.1), "clinical instructor's interest in working", (73.92), and "instructor's
clinical track record" (73.1). The most significant weaknesses of clinical education were related to
"use of audiovisual aids in clinical atmosphere", (9.84), "enough number of students in the ward",
(14.91), and "having facilities", (19.68).
Conclusion: Although some aspects of clinical education were good and excellent. improving
positive aspects and modifying the weaknesses may be an effective step in promoting quality of
clinical education. Repetitive assessments of clinical fields and comparing the current situation with
the previous or next ones can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of clinical education.

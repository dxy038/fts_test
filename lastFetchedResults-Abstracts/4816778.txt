Initial tests were performed using a 10 &#215; 10 cm<sup>2</sup> gas chamber containing a triple gas electron multiplier (GEM). The chamber was irradiated by soft X-rays using clinical mammography machine (LORAD M III) with an Mo target. The images were optically detected using a CCD camera. Several phantom images were recorded for characterization of the device parameters. The overall objective of this work is to advance digital radiography and nuclear imaging, mainly digital mammography and PET/SPECT techniques, through the development of specialized devices based on GEM.

Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the cervical cancer survival rates in Singapore during the period of 1968 through 1992 using population-based data. Study design: A review of cases with cervical cancer diagnosed between 1968 and 1992 from Singapore Cancer Registry was conducted. Information on vital status at December 31, 1997, was available for 3531 cases. Cumulative observed and relative survival rates were computed by using Hakulinen's method. Results: Survival in cervical cancer in Singapore has improved over the 25-year period. The overall 5-year age-standardized relative survival (ASRS) for all patients increased from 45% in 1968-1972 to 65% in 1988-92. Poorer survival rates were observed in elderly patients and Malays. Conclusion: The improvement in survival of cervical cancer is likely to be attributed to the rapid national development of Singapore, resulting in the improvements in health services infrastructure and accessibility, as well as to the impact of widely available cytology-based screening resulting in early detection.

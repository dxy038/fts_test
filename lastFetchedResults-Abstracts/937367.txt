Abstract 
Objective: It has been reported that adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a good marker for insulin function but its clinical significance in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is not yet characterized. This study aims to assess the association of ADA with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and uric acid (UA) in T2DM patients.
Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of 120 subjects divided into 3 groups: Group A: non diabetic controls (n=40), Group B: diabetic subjects with HbA1c < 7% (n=40), and Group C: diabetic subjects with HbA1c > 7% (n=40). This study was carried out in the Nepalgunj medical college and Hospital, Nepal, between April 2012 and April 2013. 
Results: In our study, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c and ADA levels were found to be increased in T2DM patients as compared to controls. ADA activity is found to be higher in Group s B and C as compared to group A. The correlation between ADA and HbA1C was positive in both Group B (r=0.03) and C (r=0.28). There was negative correlation between UA levels and HbA1c (r=-0.07).
Conclusion: There was an increase in serum ADA levels with increase in HbA1c levels, which may play an important role in determining the glycemic status in diabetes. It was found that the UA levels increased with moderately increasing levels of HbA1c ( < 7%) and then decreased with further increasing levels of HbA1c ( > 7%). Serum ADA and UA levels reflect closely related components of T2DM.

A three-layer structural product information model is put forward. The information interaction of each layer is researched. In data layer, model-driven mapping method is adopted. The bidirectional data mapping mechanism is set up between XML and database using JavaBean object as the middleware. In logic layer, the paper uses product structure tree to take organization and management on components and parts. And in user layer, the model is given the ability of real-time and synchronous information interaction using AJAX. The collaborative design prototype system is developed based on AJAX4JSF. The product information model of GC1-2 sewing machine is built using the approach put forward by the paper. The tests show that modelÂ´s real-time and synchronous information interaction capacities are improved.

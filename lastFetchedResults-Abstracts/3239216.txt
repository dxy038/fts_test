Software Product Line (SPL) development is a new approach to software engineering that aims at the development of a whole range of products. One of the problems which hinders the adoption of that approach is related with the management of the products of the line. Additionally, the scope of a software product line is determined by the bounds of the capabilities provided by the collection of products in the product line. This introduces new challenges related to the scope problem. One of the main three different forms of scoping is the Product Portfolio Scoping (PPS). PPS aims at defining the products that should be developed as well as their key features. While this has an impact on the actual reuse opportunities, it is usually driven from marketing aspects. Defining a product portfolio by considering costumers satisfaction and cost aspects is a NP-hard problem. This work presents a hybrid approach, which combines fuzzy inference systems and the multi-objective metaheuristics NSGAII to support product management by generating portfolios of products, based in segments of users and the development cost of the assets of the SPL. Fuzzy inference systems are used to generate development cost of an asset by using coupling, number of code lines and cyclomatic complexity and also to estimate the quality of the products generated by the optimization module of our approach. The NSGA-II metaheuristic is used to search for products minimizing the cost and maximizing the relevance of the candidate products. The results show that the proposed approach is effective in proposing the best products in terms of relevance and cost of the assets.

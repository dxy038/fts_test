A process, known as the goal directed approach, has been developed which ensures that the most appropriate and effective combination of techniques is used to identify potential problems in safety-critical software. The process is illustrated by application to the Hercules C-130J aircraft static code analysis project. The objective of this project is to identify safety threatening anomalies in the safety critical software for resolution before the first flight of the aircraft.

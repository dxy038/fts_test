An algorithm has been presented for the design of inherently robust observers. Unlike other techniques, the approach developed combines the linear quadratic regulator theory with minimisation of an objective function. The former guarantees a stable observer, while the latter aims at reducing the sensitivity of the observer to parameter variations. Usually, in most conventional observers, a single dynamic model is used for the estimation of the entire state of the process. However, this paper has demonstrated that observer robustness could be further enhanced by using a decentralised approach

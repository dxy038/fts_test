The key objective of this research is to reveal the change of the Oriental white storkÂ´s habitat due to local agriculture activities in the study area at landscape scale with the aid of Geographic Information System techniques. Furthermore, an analysis of breeding captivity is done for a better understanding of the relationship between the decrease in Oriental White Stork population and habitat loss and fragmentation in the study area. Result shows that: (1). In all, about 58% of potential breeding habitat and 90% of potential feeding habitat were respectively lost due chiefly to Agriculture reclamation over 1975-2006. (2). The degree of habitat fragmentation became higher, and habitat patches were isolated, smaller and closer to farmland patches over 1975-2006. Behavioral fragmentation due to agriculture reclamation is the major cause of potential habitat fragmentation. (3). The loss and fragmentation of potential habitat lead to the decrease in suitable habitat for the Oriental White Stork. Compared with 1975, suitable breeding habitat was lost 74% in 1989 and 89% in 2006 respectively. Accordingly the number of the Oriental White Stork which can be kept by suitable habitat declined. The decrease in Oriental White Stork population has a close relation with Habitat loss and fragmentation.

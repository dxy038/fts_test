Hong Kong is one of the most attractive shopping paradises in the world. Many local people and international
tourists favor to spend their time in shopping malls in Hong Kong. Good indoor air quality is, therefore, very
essential to shoppers. In order to characterize the indoor air quality in shopping malls, nine shopping malls in Hong
Kong were selected for this study. The indoor air pollutants included carbon dioxide ŽCO2., carbon monoxide ŽCO.,
total hydrocarbons ŽTHC., formaldehyde ŽHCHO., respirable particulate matter ŽPM10. and total bacteria count
ŽTBC.. More than 40% of the shopping malls had 1-h average CO2 levels above the 1000 ppm of the ASHRAE
standard on both weekdays and weekends. Also, they had average weekday PM10 concentrations that exceeded the
Hong Kong Indoor Air Quality Objective ŽHKIAQO.. The highest indoor PM10 level at a mall was 380  g m3. Of
the malls surveyed, 30% had indoor airborne bacteria levels above 1000 cfu m3 set by the HKIAQO. The elevated
indoor CO2 and bacteria levels could result from high occupancy combined with insufficient ventilation. The
increased PM10 levels could be probably attributed to illegal smoking inside these establishments. In comparison, the
shopping malls that contained internal public transport drop-off areas, where vehicles were parked with idling
engines and had major entry doors close to heavy traffic roads had higher CO and PM10 indoor levels. In addition,
the extensive use of cooking stoves without adequate ventilation inside food courts could increase indoor CO2, CO
and PM10 levels.

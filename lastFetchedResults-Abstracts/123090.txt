Background: Helicobacter pylori is one of the most prevalent infectious disease in the world. It causes gastric ulcers and stomach cancer, and normal microbial flora of oral cavity. Objective: This study was conducted to determine the pathogenic effect of helicobacter pylori on mucous in rats.
Methods: 40 rats randomly were divided into 4 groups as followed: Control 1: The lips, cheeks, tongue and palate of rats were conducted with swab contained physiologic serum. Case I: The lips, cheeks, tongue and palate of rats were conducted with swab contained helicobacter pylori. Control 2: Incised cheek were conducted with swab contained physiologic serum. Then cheek was sutured. Case2: Incised cheeks were conducted with swab contained helicobacter pylori. Then cheek was sutured. After 15 days specimens were collected from lips, cheeks, tongue and palate. The slides were provided using H and E and Gimsa stain.
Findings: There was neither helicobacter pylori nor pathogenic change of mucous comparing case I and case 2 with control 1 and control 2 respectively.
Conclusion: Helicobacter pylori is unable to produce either colony or pathogenic change on oral mucous in rats.

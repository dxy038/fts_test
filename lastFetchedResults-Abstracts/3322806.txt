In industrial automation, a huge number of motion systems are in use. Unfortunately, the manual tuning of controllers for these motion systems is a time consuming process. Assuming a basic system model is available, the manual tuning can be replaced by an automated tuning process. Based on the system model, performance requirements are formulated in frequency and time domain and are combined into a single objective function. The resulting optimization problem is solved using nonlinear optimization. The automated tuning process is applied to the velocity control loop of a ball screw drive and shows excellent results for several different configurations of the drive.

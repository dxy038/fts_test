Introduction: Level of consciousness is an important factor in management of critically ill patients and predicting outcome. However there is no quantitative, reproducible measure for evaluation of consciousness. F wave persistence can be influenced by level of consciousness according to some studies.
Objective: Survey the correlation between F wave persistence and level of consciousness in stroke patients. Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, 114 patients within 72 hours of stroke onset were divided according to their level of consciousness either with GCS and qualitative method. F wave persistence were obtained in each Tibial nerves. Effects of background variables including side of study, side of hemiparesis, type of stroke, and sex were evaluated. Data were analyzed by SPSS14.0 and ANCOVA statistic model.
Results: A significant correlation were found between F wave persistence and level of consciousness, either with GCS or qualitative method (PO.OOl). These results were independent of the side of study, side of hemiparesis, type of stroke, and sex.
Conclusion: F wave persistence can be influenced by level of consciousness. F wave study may be a useful objective and quantitative measure in documenting the severity of consciousness impairment.

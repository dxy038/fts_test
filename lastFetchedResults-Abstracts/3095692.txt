This paper proposes dynamic generator re-scheduling management subjected to wheeling transactions without violating transmission constraints at given time and load. It is the ISOÂ´s responsibility to avoid congestion during wheeling and keep the Available Transfer Capacity at a high level. In the process of congestion relief, Dynamic rescheduling carries out generation rescheduling using Transmission Congestion Relief Index (TCRT). The congestion relief model proposed in the paper is based on Repeated Power Flow (RPF) that can be used for the real time selection or rescheduling generators offers while satisfying the congestion management objective. The corrective measures need to be taken for relieving congestion over a particular congested line. It is shown that the scheme is very effective in handling system congestion. The IEEE-14 bus system is used for the case study. The solutions obtained are quite encouraging and useful in the present deregulated environment.

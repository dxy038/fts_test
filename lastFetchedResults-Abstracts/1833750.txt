The underlying mechanisms of α-tocopheryl succinate (α-TOS)-mediated apoptosis are not understood in detail, although the redox-silent vitamin E analog is a potent apoptogen and anti-cancer agent. Our previous studies showed the important role of Fas signaling in apoptosis induced by the mitocan. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether apoptosis triggered by α-TOS in gastric carcinomas cells involves both mitochondria- and death receptor-dependent pathways. α-TOS induced apoptosis and mitochondrial permeability transition in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. As a consequence, cytochrome c and the apoptosis-inducing factor were released and caspases were activated. Bax was translocated from the cytosol to mitochondria and Bid was cleaved into its truncated form, tBid. Knocking down Bid by RNAi and Fas antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in a decreased release and cleavage. The results imply that Bid may serve as a critical integrating factor of the death receptor and mitochondrial pathway in α-TOS-mediated apoptosis.

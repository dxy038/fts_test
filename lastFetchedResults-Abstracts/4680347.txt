Structural features has been analysed after the third part of SINOPEC Tianjin company´s power system been put into operation. Node voltage been treated as the constraint, minimum power loss been treated as the objective function, used PSASP to calculated the different way of generator´s combination, the voltage , power flow, power loss has been compared before and after the OPF calculation. The conclusion indicated that, by changing the active power and reactive power of generators, OLTC and reactive-load compensation equipments, the system´s power flow operated more reasonable and economical. The enterprise revenue has been maximized. This is instructive and meaningful to the operation of SINOPEC Tianjin company´s power system.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of prophylactic vaginal progesterone in decreasing preterm birth rate in a high-risk population. Study design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 142 high-risk singleton pregnancies. Progesterone (100 mg) or placebo was administered daily by vaginal suppository and all patients underwent uterine contraction monitoring with an external tocodynamometer once a week for 60 minutes, between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation. Progesterone (n = 72) and placebo (n = 70) groups were compared for epidemiologic characteristics, uterine contraction frequency, and incidence of preterm birth. Data were compared by Ï‡2 analysis and Fisher exact test. Results: The preterm birth rate was 21.1% (30/142). Differences in uterine activity were found between the progesterone and placebo groups (23.6% vs 54.3%, respectively; P< .05) and in preterm birth between progesterone and placebo (13.8% vs 28.5%, respectively; P< .05). More women were delivered before 34 weeks in the placebo group (18.5%) than in the progesterone group (2.7%) (P< .05). Conclusion:Prophylactic vaginal progesterone reduced the frequency of uterine contractions and the rate of preterm delivery in women at high risk for prematurity.

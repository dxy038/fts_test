For the nonlinear behaviors of the actuator and servo system of the optical disk player, a fuzzy control is introduced. Focus servo controls the laser beam to focus on the playing surface of the disc by vertical movement of the objective lens. The change of the distance between the objective lens and the disc must be within the allowable focus error to stay in focus. This must be maintained even with a slightly warped or uneven disc and in a portable player. This paper will observe on how the focusing is controlled in an optical disk player and will evaluate algorithm based on the model using Adaptive Fuzzy Logic.

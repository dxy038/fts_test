The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines standards as documented agreements containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines, or definition characteristics, to ensure that materials, products, procedures, and services are fit for their purpose. Further, standards contribute to making life simpler, and to increasing the reliability and effectiveness of the goods and services we use. The Scientific Database (SDB) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is comprehensive scientific information service system. It has been built by different disciplines of many institutes of CAS in the past ten years. The Chinese Resources and Environment Remote Sensing Database is one of subsidiary database of SDB. The purpose of data standardization for the Chinese Resources and Environment Remote Sensing Database is to facilitate data sharing and increase interoperability among resources and environment remote sensing applications. The primary objective of this proposed standard is to define the content for remote sensing data, thereby providing a solid basis from which to develop interoperable data formats for this common form of remote sensing data

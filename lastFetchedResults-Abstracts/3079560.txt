The objective of the paper is to study placental vascularization using two-dimensional power Doppler techniques. A prospective study was performed in patients to correlate visualization of placental vessels in vivo with known anatomy. Thirty eight patients and one patient with diabetes were used to the study. To evaluate placental vascularization, 2D power Doppler was applied to obtain the images. Our results show that the placental vessels seen with this technique correlate well with known anatomy. A progressive increase of the index of vascularization with increasing gestational age

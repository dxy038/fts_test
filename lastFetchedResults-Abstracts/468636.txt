OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of cystoscopy during major gynecologic surgery and to describe an interesting and rare complication that was encountered.
STUDY DESIGN: This was an observational descriptive study. A retrospective review was performed. Data collected included intraoperative lower urinary tract injuries, injuries that were related directly to cystoscopy, and postoperative morbidity.
RESULTS: One hundred one cases were evaluated. Eight lower urinary tract injuries were noted, 4 of which were detected at cystoscopy and 3 of which (2.97%) were detected intraoperatively before cystoscopy. There was one complication that was linked directly to cystoscopy. There were nine postoperative urinary tract infections. Total cost per case excluding anesthesia time was $54.42.
CONCLUSION: Liberal use of cystoscopy in gynecologic surgery is recommended. The procedure is safe, easily learned, and inexpensive to perform.

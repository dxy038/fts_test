Background: Central obesity - one of the metabolic syndrome components- is associated with cardiovascular diseases. Central obesity is defined based on waist circumference. Using ethnicity-specific waist circumference cut-off values is recommended as a cardiovascular risk factor.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the optimal waist circumference cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular risk factors in Qazvin. 
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 1107 residents of Minoodar district of Qazvin that were selected by multistage cluster random sampling method in 2011-2012. Anthropometric indices and laboratory tests were measured. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of waist circumference for predicting each cardiovascular risk factor were depicted and areas under curve were calculated. The optimal cut-point was identified by the maximum Youden Index. Sensitivity and specificity of waist circumference cut points according to ATP III and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria were calculated for diagnosis of cardiovascular risk factors.
Findings: Of 1107, 529 (47.8%) were male. Mean age was 40.08Â±10.33. The optimal waist circumference cut points for predicting cardiovascular risk factors were 90.5-93.5 cm in men and 85.5-92.5 cm in women.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, it seems that waist circumference cut point of ATP III is almost appropriate for women but is high for men. Waist circumference cut point of IDF is almost appropriate for men but is low for women.

Wyner-Ziv video coding is a lossy source coding paradigm where the video statistics are exploited, partially or totally at the decoder. The side information represents a noisy version of the original frame and is generated at the decoder with time consuming motion estimation and compensation tools. This paper proposes a novel bidirectional hash motion estimation framework which enables the decoder to choose between past and/or future reference frames for frame interpolation. New features include the coding of DCT hash with zero-motion, combination of trajectory-based motion interpolation with hash-based motion estimation and adaptive selection of the DCT bands which are sent to the decoder in order to guide the motion estimation procedure. Gains up to 1.2 dB compared to previous motion interpolation approaches may be reached.

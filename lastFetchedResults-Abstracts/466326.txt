Objective: Our aim was to determine the distance of the ureter from the cervix and the influence of age and weight on this distance. Study Design: The distance of the ureter from the uterine cervix was determined by evaluating the computed pelvic tomograms from 52 women. Age and body mass index were compared to this distance by means of regression analysis. Results: At the most dorsal reflection of the ureter, the average distance from ureter to cervical margin was 2.3 Â± 0.8 cm (range, 0.1-5.3 cm). There was no relationship to age, but there was a linear relationship between this distance and body mass index (R2 = 0.075; P = .049); thus the ureter was slightly more proximal to the cervical margin in heavier women. Conclusions: In women with apparently normal pelvic anatomy, the average distance between the ureter and cervix is >2 cm. The finding that this distance is <0.5 cm in 12% of the women studied may explain the relatively common occurrence of ureteral injury during hysterectomy. The relationship between body mass index and location is clinically insignificant. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:336-9.)

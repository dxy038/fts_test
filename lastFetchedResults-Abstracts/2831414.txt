LTE has been identified as a new wireless standard by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) which is using the VoIP to transmit the voice services and packet the data for all services. Traffic scheduling plays an important role in LTE technology by assigning the shared resources among users in the most efficient manner. The main objective of this paper aims to design an efficient scheduling algorithm for LTE standard. It can not only obtain the high system performance but also maintain the proportional fairness. Each user is allocated the requested resource according to the predefined QoS parameters. The scheduling algorithms performances on the downlink were measured using a MATLAB based system level simulation.

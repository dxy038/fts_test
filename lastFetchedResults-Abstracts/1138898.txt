The objective of this paper is to determine the behaviour of the Valencia orange during simulated overseas transportation under a ventilation regime to the laboratory scale. The effect of transportation time, ventilation regime, harvested period and fruit origin on orange preservation was investigated. The preservation was evaluated from the loss of mass of fruits, loss of mass per box, loss due to microbial decay, loss due to physiological damages and changes in the juice characteristics. Requests according to the fruit origin and harvest period in addition to time of transportation and ventilation regime are given. The magnitude of losses and damages expected are reported.

Objective(s):OCT4 is a transcription factor required for pluripotency during early embryogenesis and the maintenance of identity of embryonic stem cells and pluripotent cells. Therefore, the effective expression regulation of this gene is highly critical. UTR regions are of great significance to gene regulation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential regulatory role played by 5´UTR and 3´UTR of the Oct4 gene in mouse BMSC and P19 cells. Materials and Methods: The Oct4 5´UTR and 3´UTR sequences were cloned into pGL3 luciferase plasmid which led to the generation of pGL3 5´-UTR, pGL3 5´&3´-UTRs and pGL3 3´-UTR vectors. The vectors were transfected into BMSC and P19 cells followed by luciferase assay.  Results: The assay of luciferase expression exhibited a direct link between the presence of Oct4 3´- UTR and the decrease of luciferase count in both cell lines; whereas 5´UTR indicated diverse behaviors in two cells. This discrepancy could be explained in view of the difference of cellular contexts in which the Oct4 UTRs act. Conclusion: This study sheds some light on the role of UTR regions of mouse Oct4 in regulating post-transcriptional gene expression in pluripotent cells. These data represent potential to be used for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for a variety of malignancies.

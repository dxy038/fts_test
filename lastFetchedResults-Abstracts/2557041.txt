Objective: Atrazine (ATZ) as a widely used herbicide is considered as a potent endocrine
disrupter which adversely affects reproductive systems in both genders. This study
aimed to assess the effects of testosterone (T)- and vitamin E (VitE)- alone and their coadministration
on testicular function and sperm parameters after exposure to ATZ in rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the rats (n=30) are assigned into the
following 5 groups: control-sham group (n=6) receiving corn oil, ATZ group (n=6) receiving
200 mg/kg ATZ alone, ATZ+VitE group (n=6) receiving 150 mg/kg ATZ+VitE, ATZ+T group
(n=6) receiving 400 ?g/kg ATZ+T, and ATZ+VitE+T group (n=6) receiving ATZ+VitE+T for
48 consecutive days. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total thiol molecules (TTM), and
malondialdehyde (MDA) were analyzed. Serum levels of T, luteinizing hormone (LH), and
inhibin-B (IN-B) were also determined. Histological examination and sperm analysis were
performed. The data were analyzed using Graph-Pad Prism software version 2.01.
Results: Co-administration of VitE and T significantly (P < 0.05) increased ATZ-decreased
TAC and TTM levels and reduced ATZ-increased MDA content. T and VitE significantly
(P < 0.05) increased serum levels of ATZ-reduced T (1.94 ± 0.96), IN-B (122.10 ± 24.33)
and LH (0.40 ± 0.10). The T+VitE animals showed a reduction in apoptotic cells and
an increase in Leydig cells steroidogenesis. Co-administration of T and VitE significantly
(P < 0.05) reduced the ATZ-induced DNA disintegrity and chromatin de-condensation. VitE
and T protected germinal cells RNA and protein contents against ATZ-induced damages.
Conclusion: T and VitE in simultaneous form of administration were able to normalize the
ATZ-induced derangements through promoting antioxidant capacity and endocrine function.

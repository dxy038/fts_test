Objective
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a key role in intimal growth and is responsible for ventricular remodeling after stent implantation. However, little is known about the relationship between early MMPs expression post-stent implantation and follow-up restenosis.
Methods

We investigated the serial changes of serum MMP-9, MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in 16 control subjects with normal coronary angiography (control) and 40 patients before and on the 1st, 3rd and 7th day after uncomplicated stent implantation. Follow-up angiography was performed at 6 months after stent implantation.
Results

Serum MMP-2 level was higher in patients with restenosis on the 1st day post-stent implantation and returned to pre-operation level thereafter. Serum MMP-9 levels consistently increased in patients with restenosis up to 7th day post-stent implantation; MMP-9 levels in the 1st, 3rd and 7th day after stent implantation were positively correlated to the late loss index 6 months after stent implantation.
Conclusions

Increased serum MMP-9 level is associated with increased risk of restenosis post-stent implantation.

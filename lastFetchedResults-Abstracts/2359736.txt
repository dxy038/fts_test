Finite element analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool to characterize the functional behaviour of bone. Here we use this technique to study the metacarpal arrangement of the Asian elephant. The objective of this work is to search for valid criteria that distinguish the known natural arrangement among a variety of configurations, including some fictitious ones. FEA yields significant statistical differences within the three arrangements tested. Our calculations suggest that the median value of stress (von Mises) could be a discriminant criterion, at least in graviportal taxa. Such a method could thus be applied to other graviportal organisms such as sauropod dinosaurs.

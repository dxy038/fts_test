Objective(s): There is little doubt that medical students are subject to considerable amounts of physical and mental stress, resulting in high rates of depression and anxiety as well as other health problems. The present study- conducted from June to August 2006- looks at the problem of stress among Iranian medical students. Methods: A total of 742 students in different stages of their general medical training filled in a questionnaire dealing with personal and demographic characteristics, physical and mental stress, social relations and perceived job perspectives as well as problems faced at home and the campus. For each participant, a total stress score computed and its association with putative risk factors examined using Mann-Whitney test, non- parametric correlations and logistic regression analysis.
Results: In logistic regression analysis, the following factors were found to have significant, independent associations with a high degree of stress: female gender (P=0.001), living in a large family (P=0.01), low income (P=0.05), training in clinical rotations (P<0.001) and internship (P<0.001) and separation from the family (P=0.01). From a student's perspective, the most important problems (stressors) faced by the students included crowded campus and dormitories, poor learning facilities, work overload, humiliation and abuse from staff and faculty members.
Conclusion: Addressing the financial needs of the students (e.g. easier access to student loans), developing better communication skills, education in various relaxation and stress reduction techniques, and measures to reduce workload are recommended to mitigate the effects of physical and mental stress in medical students.

The paper presents a method of determination of parameters for LuGre and Dahl dynamic friction models. The method involves the use of numeric optimisation, in which the objective function is a minimisation of the sum of squares of relative errors between the actual and modelled friction hysteresis courses. It was specified that the limiting value of the cycle time of the signal, forcing the relative motion, above which the simulation of friction hysteresis in the presliding regime is not dependent on the velocity of displacement. The analyses of numerical results indicated that the parameters of dynamic models have limited the scope of application in relation to the normal forces exerted on the kinematic friction pairs, as opposed to the static friction models.

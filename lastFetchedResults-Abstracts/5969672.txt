An operational procedure for correcting the visible and near infrared reflectances of NOAA AVHRR data was developed. Correction for atmospheric effects is based on the estimation of two main parameters: aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the total water vapor content of the atmosphere, that are referenced to ground based surface meteorological data. An error of &#177;0.02 of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is expected due to the uncertainty of AOD. Scan angle effects due to the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for a designated area in Iowa is assessed by scanning pixels across a predominantly agricultural area with uniformly growing crops. The research demonstrates the characteristics that are critical to anisotropic reflection. A maximum error of 10% in NDVI is estimated after correcting the data for atmospheric and scan angle effects

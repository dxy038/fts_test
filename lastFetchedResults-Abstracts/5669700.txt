The Colombian Energy and Gas Regulating Commission -CREG- through resolution CREG 024 of 2005, requires monitoring some power quality disturbances in substations of distribution systems; the main objective of this resolution is determine electrical power quality supplied by the utility operators to costumers by means of measurements analysis. In this paper the authors proposes a computational tool for management and classification of power quality measurements required by Regulator Entity, This tool performs a power quality analysis in substations and shows information about conditions in power quality to conduct subsequent analysis.

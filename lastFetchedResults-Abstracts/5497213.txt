In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective methods for searching large image databases based on image content. The interest in image search algorithms has grown out of the necessity of managing large image databases that are now commonly available on removable storage media and wide area networks. The objective of this paper is to present a novel image retrieval system based on texture features extraction. The system works with the subdatabases that include images with the same content. Subdatabases are described with centroids. Comparison with conventional retrieval systems show that new system is faster and more accurate.

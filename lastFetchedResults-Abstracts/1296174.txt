
Background & Objective: Gastro-intestinal cancers are the most common kind of cancers all over the world. They are multifactorial disease and both genetical and environmental factors are involved in their progression. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of stomach cancers. Brevinin-2R is a novel antimicrobial and anticancer peptide that is isolated from the skin secretions of a family of frogs called Rana. The 25-amino acid long peptide shows anticancer activity and induces antimicrobial activity. Brevinin-2R is a 25 amino acid long cationic peptide that shows very low hemolytic activity against red blood cells. In this paper we study cytotoxicity of brevinin-2R onto AGS cell line.

Material and Methods: AGS cell line was incubated with different concentrations of peptide during different periods of time, cytotoxicity of peptide and viability of AGS cell line was assessed by MTT-assay. The experiment was repeated three times and the average viability values were calculated.

Results: our findings show that viability of treated cells decreased consistently with increasing concentrations within the periods of time.

Conclusion: Because of low hemolytic activity, Brevinin-2R is a good specimen in drug designing. Brevinin-2R triggers cell death by means of activation of autophagy and shows anticancer activity against AGS malignant cell lines.

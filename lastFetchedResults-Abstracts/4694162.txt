Mixed reality (MR), sometimes called enhanced reality, is a variety of virtual environment (VE) which explores various natural environments with immersive display technologies. VE technologies immerse a user completely inside a synthetic environment. By contrast, MR systems add electronic data from cyberspace onto physical space, allowing users to see the real world with virtual objects superimposed upon it. Moreover, MR can assist the usersÂ´ interaction with the virtual object through the real environment. The objective of our research is to investigate the potential of MR techniques for improving human and computer interaction with scientific data through developing a video-see through MR system. Further applications will be built upon this generic platform.

The European VLBI Network has been offering real-time capabilities for a couple of years with a primary objective to allow observations of transients on the time scales at which they occur. The technical, operational and scientific aspects of this have been recognized to be relevant for the development of the SKA. As a next step, it is the aim to include an e-VLBI aspect to all user experiments, resulting in a more sensitive, flexible and robust network. Combined with new correlators, currently under construction, this will result in an astronomical facility complementary with other SKA-pathfinder radio observatories.

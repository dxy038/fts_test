We present a network-assisted scheme for media-aware bandwidth sharing among multiple video streaming sessions. Departing from the conventional paradigm of fair-rate allocation among data traffic flows, our scheme allocates the bottleneck bandwidth among the video streams according to their rate-distortion (R-D) characteristics, with the objective of minimizing the total video distortion of all streams. This demonstration shows that our scheme achieves the optimal rate allocation with fast convergence, efficient bottleneck utilization, and balanced video qualities among the competing streams.

Objective (s): The rising of risky injections has caused HIV infections epidemics among Intravenous Drug Users (IDUs). So, high costs of HIV/AIDS care and low financial resources necessitate economic evaluation to choose the best decision to control HIV/AIDS. This study was conducted to determine cost-effectiveness of Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) centers to prevent HIV infections among IDUs. 
Methods: In this study, we selected all seven MMT centers and their IDUs (n = 259). We calculated all costs from government perspective. Mathematical models were used to estimate number of HIV cases averted from risky injecting behaviors changes. 
Results: Total cost of MMT centers was $204297.7 and cost of HIV/AIDS care in no intervention scenario, was estimated $13942756.8. ICER was $109035.3 per HIV case averted based on an estimated 126 HIV case averted. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that MMT intervention is cost-effective even in worst scenario and ICER varies from $39149.42 to $290004.1 per HIV case averted.
Conclusion: Considering to high effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MMT centers, it is necessary to develop these centers in regional and national levels to cover the high risk people more.

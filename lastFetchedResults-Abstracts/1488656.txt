The objective of this study was to investigate the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at five candidate genes with meat pH, color, marbling and water holding capacity (WHC) in young bulls from five beef breeds (n = 243) in Sweden. The UASMS2 polymorphism at the leptin gene and the SNPs at the Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gene (SCD1.878) and Î¼-calpain gene (CAPN1:c.947) were associated with variation in meat color traits after 6 days of exposure to air. The K232A polymorphism at the diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) gene and the CAPN1:c.947 SNP were associated with level of beef marbling. There was no association between the SNP at the calpastatin gene (CAST:c.155) and meat quality traits, nor was there any association of the tested SNPs with WHC traits and pH value.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term voice outcome (6.1 years after a well-defined voice treatment program) of hyperfunctional voice disorders in 27 subjects. All patients showed a muscle tension pattern type I (MTP I). Perceptual ratings, aerodynamic and acoustical analyses, Voice Handicap Index (VHI) value, and a determination of the Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI) were performed. The laryngovideostroboscopic images indicated that 51% of the subjects still show pathological laryngological findings. The negative evolution of the DSI from âˆ’1 to âˆ’3.2 is in agreement with this finding. Analysis of the components of the DSI shows that the main responsible variable for this negative change is the lowest intensity (I-low) that increased with 8.1 dB, indicating that subjects generally speak too loud, which is a typical problem for vocal hyperfunction. The VHI-score indicates an unimportant psychosocial impact of the voice disorder. The more objective and laryngostroboscopic findings indicate a chronic situation for a substantial part of the subjects and even a worse situation for some of them. Whether the long-term voice outcome results can be changed with the insertion of several follow-up voice rehabilitation sessions over the years remains unanswered and is a subject for further research.

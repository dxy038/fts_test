This paper builds a reasonable and brief system model, which can be used for the power system stability simulation. This system model consists of the mathematical models of power units, their sub-control systems, the load and grid. Moreover, this paper established two Coordinated Control System (CCS) models with different logical configuration of the actual CCS and connected these CCS models to the system model, which provided an objective and concise simulation model and analysis platform for the stability simulation of the power system. It is helpful to the modeling and the research for the stability simulation of the power system.

The properties and limitations of human visual system (HVS) are usually incorporated into objective video quality techniques for better correlation with subjective methods. In this paper, we propose a new objective assessment algorithm based on reduced reference video quality metrics (RR-VQM). The key point of our method is to design multilayer Spatial-Temporal (ST) regions based on humanÂ´s fovea region, which can utilize the nonuniform resolution properties of HVS for high definition (HD) videos. Quality features are then extracted from ST regions for computing the video quality. Experimental results shows that this kind of multi-layer ST regions can improve the performance of objective methods, not only the results of evaluation, but can also accelerate the evaluation speed and reduce the amount of quality parameters to a large extent.

The overall objective for the dependability assurance of EricssonÂ´s main product, the AXE switching system, is delivery of a product with agreed reliability and maintainability performances, and the provisioning of maintenance support with agreed characteristics. The fulfillment of these objectives is evaluated through monitoring of a set of characteristic measures for quality and dependability during the operations and maintenance phase. The AXE system is in operation in some 70 countries all over the globe. A system for field monitoring thus requires a standardized set of measures and evaluation principles. This standardization is accomplished by a common software tool, DEPEND, used for various dependability calculation needs throughout the product life cycle.

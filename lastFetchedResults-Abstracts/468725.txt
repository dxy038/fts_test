Objective
The purpose of this study was to review the population incidence of congenital gastroschisis in Western Australia over the past 2 decades.
Study design
A population-based incidence study of congenital gastroschisis from 1980 to 2001. Maternal and perinatal outcome data were collected to ascertain incidence, treatment, and outcome trends.
Results
One hundred twenty-two cases of gastroschisis were identified. The median maternal age was 23 years (range, 16-35 years). Women aged <20 years were at a 7.82 increased risk (95% CI, 4.34-14.08); women aged 20 to 24 years were at a 3.24 increased risk (95% CI, 1.88-5.61) for fetal gastroschisis compared with women aged ≥25 years. An incidence analysis over time indicated a significant increase of gastroschisis cases from 1 of 10,000 births during the period 1980–1990 to the current rate of 2.4 of 10,000 births (P<.001). The perinatal mortality rate was 12.7% (95% CI, 8.7-16.7) with a 9.8% stillbirth rate (95% CI, 6.3-13.3).
Conclusion
There has been a sustained increase in the birth incidence of gastroschisis over the past decade, particularly in teenage women. A significant fetal death rate in the third trimester is observed.

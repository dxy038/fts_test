BiogenicNMVOCs are mainly formed by plants and microorganisms. They have strong impact on the local atmospheric
chemistry when emitted to the atmosphere. The objective of this study was to determine if there are significant emissions
of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) from a subarctic mire in northern Sweden. Subarctic peatlands
in discontinuous permafrost regions are undergoing substantial environmental changes due to their high sensitivity to
climate warming and there is need for includingNMVOCs in the overall carbon budget. Automatic and manual chamber
measurements were used to estimateNMVOCfluxes from three dominating subhabitats on the mire during three growing
seasons. Emission rates varied and were related to plant species distribution and seasonal net ecosystem exchange of
carbon dioxide. The highest fluxes were observed from wetter sites dominated by Eriophorum and Sphagnum spp. Total
NMVOC emissions from the mire (∼17 ha) is estimated to consist of ∼150 kgC during a growing season with 150 d.
NMVOC fluxes can account for ∼5% of total net carbon exchange (−3177 kgC) at the mire during the same period.
NMVOC emissions are therefore a significant component in a local carbon budget for peatlands

This paper describes a line termination circuit for burst-mode bidirectional digital subscriber loop transmission. It incorporates the most advanced LSI technology to obtain compactness, low cost, and high reliability. Two CMOS LSI\´s have been developed; one is a line termination LSI (LT) and another is a circuit termination LSI (CT). LT LSI adopts a novel <img alt="RC" src="/images/tex/150.gif"/> active filter-type equalizer and decision feedback bridged tap equalizer suitable for incorporation in LSI and provides high performance. By using these LSI\´s, a line termination circuit realizes a reach of over 5 km at 88 kbit/s bidirectional digital transmission. This paper describes each LSI and shows total performance characteristics in detail.

The batch evaporator is employed as a benchmark example of supervisory control synthesis for hybrid systems. The control objective is the design of an emergency shut-down sequence. The specification is translated into a target control problem on hybrid automata and a switching controller is proposed such that all the trajectories of the controlled automaton, which initiate from a given initial set in the state space, reach a target set. The problem is studied in a straightforward manner, through reachability analysis, considering nonlinear continuous dynamics. Level set methods are utilized, where the boundary of the reachable set is characterized as the zero level set of the viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

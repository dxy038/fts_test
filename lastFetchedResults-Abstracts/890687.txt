This paper focuses on solving the bi-objective problem of no-wait two-stage flexible flow shop
scheduling. The objectives considered in this study are minimum makespan (Cmax), as well as maximum
tardiness of jobs (Tmax). This problem is known as NP-hard. Hence, three bi-objective optimization
methods based on simulated annealing, called CWSA (classical weighted simulated annealing), NWSA
(normalized weighted simulated annealing), and FSA (fuzzy simulated annealing), are developed to solve
the problem with the goal of finding approximations of the optimal Pareto front. Due to the fact that
meta-heuristic algorithms are very vigilant of parameter values, we proposed a new reliable method, by
mixing the Taguchi method and a Multi-Objective Decision Making (MODM) approach, for achieving our
purpose. The algorithms are evaluated by solving both small and large scale problems. The performances
are evaluated in terms of a relative deviation index. Finally, the result of the study is discussed and
concluded, and potential areas of further study are highlighted.

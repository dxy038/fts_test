In this paper, we investigate the issue of selecting the number of antennas at the base station and at the mobile to optimize asymptotic ergodic capacity of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system when the costs of implementing antennas at the base station and at the mobile are unequal. Total system capacity, defined as a linear combination of the uplink and downlink ergodic capacity, is used as the objective function to be maximized. The limiting case gives some insight on how the ratio of the number of antennas at the base station to the number of antennas at the mobile may change with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and cost ratio when the total system capacity is maximized.

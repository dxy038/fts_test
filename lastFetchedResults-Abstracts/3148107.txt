A new p-channel bidirectional power MOSFET (Bi-DFET) for 15-30V battery charging applications is detailed. A specially-designed bidirectional trench MOSFET was built on chip with lateral PMOS devices that connect the trench FET body to the source/drain terminal of the highest potential. Bi-DFET prototypes had greater than 2.5X lower specific on-resistance than two back-to-back standard trench MOSFETs, which are commonly used in bidirectional sockets. Thus this device is very promising for reducing the device size in &#8220;space sensitive&#8221; applications.

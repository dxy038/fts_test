Mushrooms have long been treated as a delicacy. Nowadays however, many researchers consider them to be nutraceutical foods, which has stimulated new and existing Brazilian producers to search for more productive techniques and to introduce other species. The objective of this study was to determine the vitamin B1 and B2 contents in mushrooms. The main species of mushroom cultivated in Brazil and analysed in this study are: Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom and portobello), Lentinula edodes (shiitake) and Pleorotus spp. (shimeji and oyster mushroom). The methodology employed used acid hydrolysis followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and separation of the vitamins by high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 reverse phase column and fluorescence detector. The results obtained for thiamine (vitamin B1) were from 0.004 to 0.08 mg/100 g and for riboflavin (vitamin B2), from 0.04 to 0.3 mg/100 g.

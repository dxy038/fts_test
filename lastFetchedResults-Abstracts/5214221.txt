Grids now-a-days comprise of individual resources. These types of grids are called dynamic grids. The centralized grid services are being gradually replaced by distributed and scalable algorithms. One such grid service is dissemination of resource information (DRI) state among the nodes. Every node in a dynamic grid has resource information associated with it. There are different methods proposed for DRI. High message overhead and low percentage of dissemination is experienced in DRI. In order to improve upon these problems a Hybrid Resource Information Dissemination Protocol has been presented. This protocol uses two kinds of links among the nodes, namely, bidirectional links and random links to disseminate the resource information proactively. Bidirectional links are used to transfer the resource information mutually among the nodes and random links are the unidirectional links used for DRI to random neighbors of a node. Each node disseminates the resource information to predefined number of neighbors, including all the neighbors connected by bidirectional links, which is decided by fanout capability of a node. In addition to dissemination, this protocol adapts to dynamic environments, so as to get the resource information of newly joined neighbors. Initially, all the nodes are connected by random links. In the process of dissemination, based on the strong connectivity of the nodes, the random links among the nodes may be converted to bidirectional links, decreasing the message overhead considerably at the same time increasing the percentage of dissemination.

This paper presents an educational platform for modeling of basic zero-voltage switching quasi-resonant boost converters using mathematical methods. In order to visualize the results of solving the equations that describe the converter operation, we used Matlab software modules. The advantages of this method of study are: (1) wider availability - it is possible to view the results over the Internet; (2) increased flexibility t is possible to modify any circuit component values, including parasitic components, and study their influence in converter operation, included the time periods affected; (3) it is possible to analyze both half-wave and full-wave operation mode; (4) it is possible to select which operating regimes are displayed, transient or steady-state. The conclusions of the paper allow an objective evaluation of the advantages described above vs. circuit-oriented simulators in the study of quasi-resonant switching mode power supplies. In addition, with an appropriate modeling of each circuit component, this platform allows analyses of component non-idealities (including package models) and their influence on circuit operation.

A new approach to load management is outlined, having as a major objective, provision for the emergency operation of a power system. This load-management proposal would not inconvenience consumers, yet would be accessible to operators at any time. In an emergency, this immediate load control would greatly enhance the potential for safeguarding the system. This loadmanagement approach extends to individual consumers within distribution networks. Battery installations at selected consumers would back-up portions of the load under local microprocessor control. This control could be provided by a currently available credit and load-management unit (CALMU), which, with its remote interrogation facility, is already cost competitive with conventional metering. The proposal has been conceived as an important component of a systemprotection arrangement which would be capable of countering calamitous disturbances on major power systems. It has also the potential to substantially improve distribution-network security. The stored energy of the battery installations could extend the use of this proposal for normal operations. Not only would it reduce the need for peaking generators and improve the system capacity factor, but it would facilitate the introduction of renewable and alternative generation. Only the normal operational benefits would allow tariff incentives encouraging consumers to meet the capital costs of battery installations. With this policy, the proposal would allow electric utilities, with a modest capital outlay, to significantly raise security levels of their total power grid.

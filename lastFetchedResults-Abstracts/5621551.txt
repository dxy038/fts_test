This paper introduces an adaptive DC bus voltage control strategy for renewable energy systems, combining different energy storage devices, i.e., batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors. Multiple bidirectional DC-DC converters accurate control is achieved with no source voltage sensing, which reduces the number of sensors. Unlike many adaptive controllers, the proposed strategy uses a single adaptive parameter, which yields reduced complexity. The proposed approach is compared to a classical PI-based cascaded control scheme. The adaptive control strategy achieves better performance, which yields a high-efficiency operation of the overall system.

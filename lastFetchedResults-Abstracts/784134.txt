Objective Scant research has examined the mental health
of Arab Americans. This study aimed to determine the
levels of anxiety and depression in a sample of Arab
Americans and compare the rates to normative community
samples and samples of other minority ethnic/racial groups.
Methods A non-probability sampling approach resulted
in 601 adult Arab American respondents from 35 US states.
Respondents completed anxiety and depression questionnaires
at a form-based Internet site.
Results One-fourth of participants reported moderate to
severe anxiety levels as measured by the Beck Anxiety
Inventory (BAI), and one-half reported depression scores
that met clinical caseness as assessed by the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). The
present sample of Arab Americans reported significantly
higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to standardization
samples and community samples of four other
minority groups.
Conclusions Arab Americans may be at risk for anxiety
and depression. Further studies should be conducted to
replicate and validate these results, identify stressors that
affect this population, and develop recommendations for
clinical interventions

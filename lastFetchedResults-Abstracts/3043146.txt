The Vietnamese power system is in phase of development. Due to the increase in the size and complexity in this system with the strong exchange of power between the North and South regions via a long link, the optimization of planning and exploitation of this system becomes essential. In order to ensure the quality of supply of energy, safety and economy in several operating condition for this system, the optimal control strategies are necessary. Thus this paper presents several applications of optimal power flow with different objective functions for this power system such as economic dispatch, voltage/Var control and control strategies in order to avoid risk of voltage instability. An optimal method based on indicator of voltage instability is developed.

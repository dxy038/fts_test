This study aims to investigate the role of the reconfiguration strategy to enhance the reliability of the distribution systems. In this regard, the idea of failure rate reduction approach is employed to assess three significant reliability indices including the System Average Interruption Frequency Index, System Average Interruption Duration Index and Average Energy Not Supplied. In addition, as a result of attractiveness and importance of the power loss objective function in the system, this target is also considered in the problem. The problem is then formulated in a stochastic framework based on 2<i>m</i> + 1 point estimate method to capture the uncertainty of load, failure rate and repair rate forecast error. In order to make the analysis more practical, the idea of yearly multi-level load modelling is employed. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are examined on the IEEE 32-bus test system.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for perioperative complications in elderly women who undergo urogynecologic surgery.
Study design
A retrospective chart review of patients ≥75 years old who underwent urogynecologic surgery between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. Demographics, comorbidities, and significant perioperative complications were recorded. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification were calculated to summarize the patients' overall perioperative risk. Logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for perioperative complications.
Results
Two hundred sixty-seven patients who were ≥75 years old met the inclusion criteria; 25.8% of the patients had a significant perioperative complication. The most common perioperative complication was blood transfusion or significant blood loss, pulmonary edema, and postoperative congestive heart failure. Independent risk factors that were predictive of a patient having a perioperative complication were the length of surgery, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification did not predict perioperative complications in this population.
Conclusion
Pre-existing cardiovascular disease increases the risk of a significant perioperative complication in elderly women who undergo urogynecologic surgery. However, the overall perioperative morbidity rate in elderly women who undergo urogynecologic surgery is low.

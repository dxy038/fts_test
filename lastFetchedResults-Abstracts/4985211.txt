Considering benefit, cost, likelihood of failure, potential economic loss, human death and injury, and construction duration as objectives, the most desirable construction strategy for a construction activity is determined using a gray decision analysis. The construction strategy is defined by the factors and their levels. Also, the suitability of gray mechanics to decision analysis in construction is discussed. Decision making in construction operation considered here is a form of multiple-objective and multiple-state decision making that is concerned with uncertainty factors and incompleteness of information

The space engineering spacecraft (MUSES) program, which is being carried out in ISAS along with the space physics or astronomy missions, is introduced. The major objective of the program is to verify and demonstrate space technology necessary for the future space science missions. What was achieved by the first two MUSES spacecraft (MUSES-A, and -B) launched in 1990 and 1997 respectively is briefly described, and the latest mission MUSES-C launched on May 9, 2003 is discussed in detail.

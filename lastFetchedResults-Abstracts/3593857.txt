Development of a 600 kJ Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) system is in progress by Korean Electric Research Institute (KERI). High-temperature superconducting (HTS) wires are going to be used for the winding of the system. The design of the HTS windings for the system is presented in this paper. We considered BSCCO-2223 wire for the HTS windings. The operating temperature of the winding was decided to be 20 K which will be accomplished by conduction cooling method using cryo-coolers. Auto-Tuning Niching Genetic Algorithm was adopted for an optimization method of the HTS magnets in the SMES system. The objective function of the optimal process was minimizing the total amount of the HTS wire. We also estimated the AC loss which can be generated in the discharge period. These HTS windings are going to be applied to the SMES system whose purpose is the stabilization of the power grid

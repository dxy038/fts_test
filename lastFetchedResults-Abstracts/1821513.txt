Objective
ermine serum adiponectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-α and IL-6 levels in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with periodontitis before and after periodontal intervention, and to investigate the relationship between T2DM and periodontitis.
s
l of 50 IGT and 106 T2DM patients with periodontitis were enrolled. The T2DM patients were divided into two groups: T2DM without macrovascular disease (DM1) group and T2DM with macrovascular disease (DM2) group. Each group was randomly divided into two subgroups according to whether they performed periodontal intervention. The normal control group (NC group) consisted of 30 healthy adults. The serum adiponectin, CRP, TNF-α and IL-6 levels were measured at baseline and 3 months after periodontal intervention.
s
rum adiponectin levels at baseline had decreased tendency with significant difference between each two groups, while CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels had increased tendency with significant difference between each two groups among NC, IGT, DM1 and DM2 groups (all P &lt; 0.01). At 3 months after periodontal intervention, the serum adiponectin levels were increased than those without periodontal intervention (all P &lt; 0.01), while CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α significantly decreased (all P &lt; 0.05) in both IGT and DM1 groups. In DM2 group, only CRP levels at 3 months after periodontal intervention were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the HbAlc levels in T2DM patients were improved at 3 months after periodontal invention (P &lt; 0.01).
sion
ontal intervention is helpful for glucose control, which may be associated with increased serum adiponectin levels and decreased inflammatory cytokine levels.

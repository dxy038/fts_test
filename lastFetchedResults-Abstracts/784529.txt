Background: Dysphagia is a common but severe complication in acute stroke. New bedside tests are
necessary to assess the risk of aspiration and avoid unnecessary alimentary restrictions but they must be
completed by evaluated instruments. Objective: We evaluated the prognostic validity of the recognition of forms
(rf) test related to the assessment by speech and language therapists (SLT). Design: Double blinded screening
tests. Setting: Geriatric department of general hospital. Subjects: 50 patients with acute stroke admitted
consecutively. Methods: All patients were assessed by SLT, mini mental status test, short test for assessing
deficits of memory and attention and abilities of daily living-test. The rf-test was performed twice with a twoweek
interval. Results: Assessment by SLT demonstrated aspiration in 29 of 50 patients. 18 patients failed the rftest,
giving a specificity of 90% (positive predictive value 89%), a sensitivity of 55% (negative predictive value
59%). 5 of 7 patients with aspiration pneumonia failed the test. Test-retest-correlation was 0,827. Performance in
the rf-test was related significantly to results of the activities of daily living-test. Conclusions: Bedside tests to
exclude aspiration in patients with acute stroke are necessary. No test so far combines high sensitivity with
acceptable specificity. Compared to other bedside tests the rf-test has a high specificity while sensitivity is low.
On behalf of good predictivity rf-test may be an interesting supplement to swallow tests in case of stroke and
seems to be a candidate for more extended studies

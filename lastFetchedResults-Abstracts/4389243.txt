The application of data mining techniques provides a powerful approach to manipulate and extract useful information from existing data. It allows the learning of information from hidden data that could be used for future predictions. Accurate demand forecasting of any service has been a challenging research problem. Data mining has different techniques that could support demand prediction. Estimating the demand for healthcare services as a result of rapid population growth becomes essential for the strategic planning of Abu Dhabi Emirate. Future plans should be focused on districts that have needs, either for short- or long-term plans. The objective of this paper is to develop a data mining model that allows healthcare services demand planning. We use different data mining techniques in order to build four models to assist decision makers in predicting the demand for healthcare services in Abu Dhabi Emirate.

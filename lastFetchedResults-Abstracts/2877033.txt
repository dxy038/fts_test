A process which ensures person authentication information by processing unique feature vectors, which were fetched from human inimitable characteristics, is known as unimodal biometric system (UBS). Though these systems provide a very good result, they fail in certain conditions such as noisy acquisition, missing out of unique human characteristics etc. There is need for robust biometric system. Current smart electronic devices capture and process enormous amount of data and execute results in less time. This paper presents past research and development in the field of biometric technology. It also describes major technological perspective and fundamental progress in unimodal and multimodal biometric system. Also, it reviews the modalities of biometric system, biometric classification methods, past experimental results, merits and demerits of unimodal system. It describes the integration scenario of multimodal biometrics. The objective of this review paper is to summarize past and current trends, and it conclude with the decision on future direction for developing proficiency in the field of person authentication biometric technology.

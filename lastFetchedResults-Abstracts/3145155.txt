Determination of indices weights is crucial to the comprehensive evaluation. Specifically for construction machinery, a new combinatorial weighting method for comprehensive evaluation is put forward in this paper, which combines subjective and objective weighting methods with techniques of fuzzy number judgment matrix, Friedman consistency test and Spearman ranking correlation coefficient. A case example is described in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

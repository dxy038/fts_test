A novel optimization method named RasID-GA (an abbreviation of adaptive random search with intensification and diversification combined with genetic algorithm) is proposed in order to enhance the searching ability of conventional RasID, which is a kind of random search with intensification and diversification. RasID-GA is compared with conventional RasID and GA using 23 different objective functions, and it turns out that RasID-GA performs well compared with other methods.

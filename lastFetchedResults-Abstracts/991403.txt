Abstract
 
Introduction: Methylphenidate (MPH), a mild psychostimulant drug administered orally in ADHD has a short 2-4 hours half life and 3-5 hours duration of action. Thus, frequent MPH administration is required to maintain its therapeutic blood level. The main objective of the present study was to utilize simple pelletization technique to pre-pare MPH pellets suitable for the once daily dosing schedule.

Materials & Methods: MPH matrix pellets consisting Avicel, lactose and different amo-unts of some polymers were prepared by extrusion-spheronization technique. The pa-rticle size of the pellets was determined by the sieve analysis. Hardness, weight vari-ation and disintegration time of pellets were also evaluated.  The drug dissolution study was carried out in 500 ml water at 37Â°C using USP apparatus (paddle) at 50 rpm for 12 hours. The content uniformity of pellets was also determined according to the USP guidelines.
Findings: Most 11 pellet formulations had acceptable physical properties with regard to size distribution, sphericity, flowability, crushing strength and friability. MPH pell-ets comprising Avicel 60% and Eudragit RSPO & RLPO 5% were, however, rele-ased the drug in a more time-controlled manner than other formulations with the release of 70% of its drug content after 420 min. Hardness and pellet size did not have significant effects on drug release from pellets.

Discussion & Conclusion: Pelletization can be used to produce MPH pellets exhibiting a dual release pattern of a burst release followed by a slower release rate. This can benefit patients with avoiding repeated dose administration and improve their compli-ance.

In this article, the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) has been proposed to find the optimal
solution for Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) problems. It is aimed, in the CEED
problem, that scheduling of generators should operate with both minimum fuel costs and emission levels,
simultaneously, while satisfying the load demand and operational constraints. In this paper, the CEED
problem is formulated as a multi-objective problem by considering the fuel cost and emission objectives
of generating units. The bi-objective optimization problem is converted into a single objective function
using a price penalty factor in order to solve it with GSA. The proposed algorithm has been implemented
on four different test cases, having a valve point effect with transmission loss and having no valve point
effect without transmission loss. In order to see the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it has been
compared with other algorithms in the literature. Results show that the GSA is more powerful than
other algorithms.

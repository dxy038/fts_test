One of the major problems in objective quality assessment of coding systems is the speaker dependence of the measurement results, if natural speech is used as the test signal. This problem can be avoided by using suitable speech-model processes. In this paper, we present a wide-band speech-model process, which includes the same long- and short-time characteristics as natural speech. The controlling part of the generator of this process involves several trained Markov chains to adapt the time-varying properties of the process to those of natural speech. Furthermore, we show that this process can be used for telephone speech applications, too. In this case we only have to limit it to the telephone frequency-band

Our study concerns product innovation in a shoe manufacturer featuring a multi-project environment with simple products. Due to the wide range of new products implemented, manufacturing plays a key role in the innovation process. The main study objective involves understanding how lean concepts are applied to the study environment and employed in this particular production system, since lean production is usually applied to complex environments such as those typical of the auto sector, in which few new projects are started in a given timeframe. This simple case study looks at how businesses in a sector as diverse as shoe manufacturing, which have different target markets and product structures, can benefit from lean practices as boosters of innovation. Process and personnel development, project transfer from R&amp;D to production, factory layout design, and product development practices are among the topics explored.

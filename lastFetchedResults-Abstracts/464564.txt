OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to review the efficacy and potential hazards of assisted conception. STUDY DESIGN: A review of pertinent scientific articles published in English was done. RESULTS: There are no adequate prospective, randomized, controlled, or comparative studies of sufficient power on the efficacy of in vitro fertilization, gamete intrafallopian transfer, and superovulation with intrauterine insemination in well-defined infertile couples. In vitro fertilization can overcome tubal sterility. The pregnancy per cycle is 19.8% and delivery per cycle is 16.0% for in vitro fertilization (all indications) and 29.5% and 19.8%, respectively, for gamete intrafallopian transfer. In limited prospective studies, in vitro fertilization, gamete intrafallopian transfer, and superovulation with intrauterine insemination have similar fecundity. Multiple births from in vitro fertilization and gamete intrafallopian transfer are increased, whereas preterm labor and low-birth-weight babies are significantly more common, even in singletons. CONCLUSION: The efficacy or relative superiority of IVF, gamete intrafallopian transfer, and superovulation with intrauterine insemination in nontubal subfertility remains to be shown by properly designed, prospective, randomized, controlled, or comparative studies. Therefore less invasive and less expensive methods such as expectant management or superovulation with intrauterine insemination should be used before embarking on in vitro fertilization and gamete intrafallopian transfer. Further studies on the outcome of babies delivered after assisted conception are required. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:1208-17.)

Generally, an engineering design problem has multiple objective functions. Some of these problems can be formulated as multiobjective geometric programming models. On the other hand,often in the real world, coefficients of the objective functions are not known precisely. Coefficients may be interpreted as fuzzy numbers, which lead to a multiobjective geometric programming with fuzzy parameters. In this paper, we solve the multiobjective geometric programming problem with fuzzy parameters by applying a linear ranking function. The linear ranking function is used to compare fuzzy numbers. Finally, a numerical example is given.

An axial type HTS hysteresis motor has the same structure as a conventional axial flux type permanent magnet synchronous motor. The permanent magnet rotor of a conventional permanent magnet synchronous motor is replaced by a rotor made from HTS materials with the objective of increasing power densities and reducing losses. The behavior of a BSCCO bulk rotor has been tested in rotating magnetic fields produced by two poles and three phase motor coils fed by a PWM inverter at 77 K. To characterize the torque output capability of the HTS hysteresis motor, speed versus torque and current versus torque are tested. Experimental results for the HTS hysteresis motor are presented

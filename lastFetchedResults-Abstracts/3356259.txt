The firms have engaged in initiatives that link e-supply chain processes (e.g., e-procurement) across enterprises to create Information Technology (IT) value. However, it is not clear how IT is contributing to value creation across-organization process. The objective of this paper is to investigate the process from e-supply chain capability generation to IT value creation through e-business process across-organization. A model of e-supply chain value is developed to investigate what and how e-supply chain capabilities are realized by usage of inter-firm IT resources integration and how business value of IT is co-created in multifirm environments. The paper tests the model using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with data collected from 196 manufacturers in China. Our results provide theoretical support for a dynamic process that distinctive e-supply chain capabilities embedded in e-business process lead to process performance first and then financial performance and network performance. We find that e-supply chain capabilities (ESCC) realize e-supply chain value for all partners (e.g. supplier and customer) via upstream and downstream ebusiness process.

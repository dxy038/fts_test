The objective of this paper is to realize a robust controller for an electro-mechanical fin servo system of a missile. We design the robust controller using an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization method and a disturbance observer, in order to improve the overall performance of the fin servo system. The H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller is designed using the mixed sensitivity H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control method, based on the 2-Riccati state-space approach of Glover and Doyle. The newly proposed disturbance observer is applied to the fin servo system and it consists of three elements: a time delay estimation algorithm part, an anti-filtering compensator (AFC) part and a low pass filter (LPF) part. The effectiveness of this control scheme is verified through simulations.

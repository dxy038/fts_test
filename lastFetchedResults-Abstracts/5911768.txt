A nonlinear speed controller design for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) based on adaptive backstepping technique is presented in this paper. In order to improve the ability of torque estimation, the differential action is application in the torque observe equation. To achieve good dynamic performance and robust, the controller parameters are optimized by adaptive weighted particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is an efficient and simple tool for multi-objective and multi-dimensional problem. The proposed controller is verified by simulation, and the results show that the controller has robust and good dynamic response.

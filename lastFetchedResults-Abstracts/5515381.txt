Image segmentation has been, and still is, a relevant research area in computer vision and hundreds of segmentation algorithms have been proposed in the last 30 years. An image retrieval system has now an array of available algorithm choices, however, few objective numerical evaluations of these segmentation algorithms exist. Typically, the effectiveness of a new algorithm is demonstrated only by the presentation of a few segmented images and an expert decides the effectiveness of a technique based on application requirements. This paper presents a comparison between two image segmentation algorithms: the color set back-projection algorithm that can be found in many related studies and an original segmentation method using a hexagonal structure defined on the set of image pixels. For this purpose error measures are used. The error measures quantify the consistency between these two segmentations algorithms.

Objective: Previous studies of handedness and cognitive function rely on self-classification and yield
inconsistent results. This study examines the associations of self-reported versus grip-strength-based handedness
with cognitive function in healthy older men and women. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: 1988-91
follow-up clinic visit and 1991 mailed survey. Participants: 684 men and 985 women aged 55-95 who were
community dwelling. Measurements: Cognitive function was assessed with 12 tests and grip strength was
measured by hand-held dynamometer. Self-reported handedness was obtained with a mailed survey. Results: By
self-report, 92.1% of men and women were right-handed; 2.0% were left handed. By grip strength, in men,
64.3% were right-handed, 22.5% left-handed, and 13.2% ambidextrous. In women, 61.3% were right-handed,
17.3% left-handed, and 21.4% ambidextrous. No cognitive function differences were found by self-reported
handedness in either sex (p’s>0.10). However, based on grip strength, left-handed women scored poorer than
right-handed or ambidextrous women in immediate and delayed memory, attention, and verbal fluency
(p’s<0.05). Using categorical definitions, left-handed or ambidextrous individuals based on grip strength were
more likely to show poor cognitive function on 4 of 5 tests. Conclusion: Grip strength is a useful alternative to
self-reports for classifying handedness. Left-handedness by grip-strength, may be related to poorer cognitive
function; this association may vary by gender.

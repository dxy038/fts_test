A new type of traffic simulator has been developed in Finland by Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), Laboratory of Transportation Engineering since 1989. The name of the simulator is HUTSIM. The main objective is to develop a tool for traffic signal planners to design better signal control systems, programs and strategies. This is done by making it possible to evaluate and compare control arrangements by means of delays, stops and queues caused to traffic by signals. The offline evaluation allow the designer to verify the level of signal performance to choose the best solutions

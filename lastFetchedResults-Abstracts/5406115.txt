Your three leaders have each been active with electrical safety related activities for several years. Each person has been working within their respective professional environments as required to perform their duty to their employer. When the NFPA 70E was reconstituted, each one volunteered to work on that committee along with many others. Each leader was very demonstrative in defining and sharing their experience. The work of the total committee is nearing completion and we wanted to share with you some thought that we each accept. That is our objective today. There is a lot of information. In order to make sure that all the material is covered, we would like for you to note your questions and hold them to the end unless the question relates to understanding the content. The ME committee interactions were sometimes heated since the memberÂ´s were personally committed in their beliefs. Although sometimes frustrating, the final product is much better as a result.

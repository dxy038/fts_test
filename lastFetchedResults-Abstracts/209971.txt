Objective: The present study was carried out to examine the development of word and
context fluency in bilingual children (Turkish-Persian and Kurdish-Persian). Method: In this
study, which was a basic type examination, 1000 bilingual Kurdish-Persian and TurkishPersian
primary schoolchildren were selected from among schoolchildren of the cities of
Sanandaj and Tabriz, using relative level sampling. The subjects participated in one
perceptual cue task (initial letters) and one conceptual cue task (categories). Results: The
findings showed that the number of Persian words had had an increasing trend from grades
1 to 5 in both cities, with a more regular increase for category cues than for perceptual cues
(initial letters). Kurdish-Persian and Turkish-Persian students did not show any significant
difference in different grades. However, the patterns of change and development of the
number of words in category tests were different. Also, boys showed a better performance
than girls in both tests in general. In addition, students from Tabriz generated more words
than students from Sanandaj in perceptual cues. Discussion: The developmental pattern
of the number of words in bilingual Turkish-Persian and Kurdish-Persian students is different
in tests of category cues; however, such a difference is not present in tests of perceptual
cues.

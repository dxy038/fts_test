Anechoic chambers are designed for maximum plane wave purity within the quiet zone region in which the antenna measurement is performed. In practice the resulting wavefront is imperfect, containing phase and amplitude ripple and cross-polarisation components. This degrades the pattern measurement and limits the accuracy and usable frequency range of the chamber. If the properties of the wavefront may be accurately measured, the profile of the numerous illuminating sources (due to chamber wall reflections) could be determined by a Fourier transform and, by a de-convolution process, used to compensate measured patterns to reduce the effects of non-ideal chamber behaviour. The primary objective of this work is wavefront characteristic determination by MUSIC angular spectrum estimation

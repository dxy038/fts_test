Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in patients receiving continuous subcutaneous terbutaline after arrested preterm labor.
Study design
Women with singleton, twin, and triplet pregnancies prescribed continuous subcutaneous terbutaline were studied. Electronic patient records were reviewed for patient tolerance of medication and serious adverse events. The primary study outcome was the frequency of serious adverse events.
Results
Available for analysis were 9359 patient records. Transient medication side effects were reported by 1447 (15.5%) patients. Severe adverse events were identified on 12 patients either during treatment with continuous subcutaneous terbutaline (n = 4), or after discontinuation of outpatient treatment (n = 8). The most frequent serious adverse event was pulmonary edema (n = 9). There was no maternal mortality.
Conclusion
Continuous subcutaneous terbutaline infusion was associated with an extremely low incidence of serious adverse events. Patients with comorbidities and/or concomitant tocolysis with intravenous magnesium sulfate should be closely assessed for development of serious adverse events.

Owing to its spectral efficiency, bidirectional relaying is a promising candidate for information exchange in multiple-user cooperative networks. When the network is limited by resource constraints, amplify-and-forward (AaF) relay protocol is often the choice due to its simplicity and ease of use. Power allocation for AaF protocol has being extensively studied in unidirectional relay networks but how it can be implemented in two-way multiple-relay multiple-user networks has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we consider the adaptive power allocation in bidirectional AaF multiple-relay multiple-user networks. We show that when the multiple-user interference can be removed by a robust channel assignment algorithm, power allocation by maximizing the instantaneous sum rate or minimizing the symbol error rate can be suitably casted as a geometric programming (GP) problem. Simulation results show adaptive power allocation by GP outperforms that of equal power allocation scheme particularly when there is a single serving relay, and the gain can be as substantial when there are multiple serving relays.

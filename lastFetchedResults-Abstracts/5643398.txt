Since L. A. Zadeh introduced fuzzy-set theory it has allowed a better grasp of certain systems in various fields, for instance, the modelization of process control. For a human observer can often supply subjective information about the evolution, the operation, or the value of certain parameters of a process he is acquainted with; and fuzzy set theory, by formalizing this subjective perception, allows one to achieve a first approach to modelizing the process, or to complete or confirm the results of objective analysis and measurements. In such a research orientation, this article devotes its first part to the formalism required for representing processes in the fuzzy system concept and in the second part, presents a method for calculating a regulation algorithm using a fuzzy model of the process.

Renal malacoplakia is a rare benign disease. Affected patients are often the debilitated, immunosuppressed, or those with chronic disease. On CT scan, foci of malacoplakia appear less dense than the enhanced surrounding parenchyma. Radiologically, renal malacoplakia can resemble renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and thus should be considered as a differential diagnosis of RCC. We report an unusual presentation of renal malacoplakia.

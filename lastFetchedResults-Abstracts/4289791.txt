The pia-arachnoid complex (PAC) encasing the brain plays an important role in determining the structural response of the brain due to impact or inertial loading. Some tests about the mechanical properties of the bovine´s PAC have been characterized previously. The finite element model can provide useful information about traumatic brain injury, but there is no head finite element model which includes the PAC structure with the true material parameters from tests. The objective of this study is to develop the finite element model of PAC based on the latest test data. Two PAC FE models in which the beam elements and solid elements were used to simulate the trabeculae were developed by using LS-DYNA3D 970. The simulated PAC´s stress-strain behaviors of two FE models and experimental results were correlated very well.

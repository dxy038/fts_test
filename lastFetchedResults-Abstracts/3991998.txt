Mechanization has opened up new possibilities to the coal mining industry. One of these is the mining of coal seams formerly considered too narrow for practical working. Such operations impose severe restrictions on much of the equipment employed. To meet these requirements, a low-height haulage locomotive was designed with the objective of keeping vertical dimensions to a minimum. The fact that a number of these units are now operating successfully on various properties attests the basic soundness of the design.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The end stage of many severe renal diseases is chronic renal failure (CRF). These patients have many problems in various organs especially in cardiovascular system. Since, more than one half patients die due to cardiac complications, therefore, these complications must be known and treated by physicians for improving these patients.
METHODS: This cross- sectional, descriptive and analytical study was performed on all 103 patients with CRF who were under hemodialysis about two years in Babol Shahid Beheshti hospital during 1999-2000. Information related to age, gender, duration of hemodialysis, frequency of hemodialysis in a week, clinical manifestations, lab finging, cardiac examination, electrocadiography and color dopler echocardiography were recorded and then analyzed by using SPSS soft ware and Chi- Square and t- tests.
FINDINGS: Relative frequency of cardiac complications were as follows: Aortic regurgitation (AR) (19.4%), aortic stenosis (AS) (6.79%), aortic calcification (1.94%), mitral regurgitation ( MR) (55.33%), tricuspid regurgitation (12.61%), mitral calcification (3.88%), pericardial effusion (18.44%), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (30.01%), left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (18.44%). Eighty- four percent of patients with pericardial effusion had severe anemia (Hb< 8mg/dl). Ninety- five percent of patients with pericardial effusion had serum creatinine less than 8 mg/dl.
CONCLUSION: In this study, it was found a high prevalence of many cardiac problems such as mirtal and aortic regurgitation, LVH, LVSD and pericardial effusion in patients with CRF on hemodialysis. The prevalence of MR, AR and AS in cases over 50 years was higher.

An integrated method of CAD, CAE and multi-objective optimization is proposed in this paper. It integrated prototype modeling, FEM analysis and optimization procedures. In this method to design a new product, only inputs and outputs need to be defined, which resembles to a black-box. In order to validate this method, design and optimization of a manipulator in a cherry-picker are developed as a case study. The objectives are extending its working scope and decreasing its cost under the constraints of enough strength, and the design variables are geometric dimensions. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied to achieve good tradeoffs between the conflicted objectives. The results indicate that this method is more efficient than enumerative algorithms, and it could approach a precise Pareto optimal front. Therefore, this method is effective and could be applied widely in engineering applications.

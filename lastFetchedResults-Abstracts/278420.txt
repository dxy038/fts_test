The pulsatile flow of non-Newtonian fluid in a bifurcation model with a non-planar daughter branch is investigated numerically by using the Carreauâ€“Yasuda model to take into account the shear thinning behavior of the analog blood fluid. The objective of this study is to deal with the influence of the non-Newtonian property of fluid and of out-of-plane curvature in the non-planar daughter vessel on wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and flow phenomena during the pulse cycle. The non-Newtonian property in the daughter vessels induces a flattened axial velocity profile due to its shear thinning behavior. The non-planarity deflects flow from the inner wall of the vessel to the outer wall and changes the distribution of WSS along the vessel, in particular in systole phase. Downstream of the bifurcation, the velocity profiles are shifted toward the flow divider, and low WSS and high shear stress temporal oscillations characterized by OSI occur on the outer wall region of the daughter vessels close to the bifurcation. Secondary motions become stronger with the addition of the out-of-plane curvature induced by the bending of the vessel, and the secondary flow patterns swirl along the non-planar daughter vessel. A significant difference between the non-Newtonian and the Newtonian pulsatile flow is revealed during the pulse cycle; however, reasonable agreement between the non-Newtonian and the rescaled Newtonian flow is found. Calculated results for the pulsatile flow support the view that the non-planarity of blood vessels and the non-Newtonian properties of blood are an important factor in hemodynamics and may play a significant role in vascular biology and pathophysiology.

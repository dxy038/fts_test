Segmented Finite Difference in Time Domain (SFDTD) method has been applied to carry out investigation at the frequency range from 500 MHz to 3.5 GHz on a pair of half wave resonant dipole antennas of each having length equal to 14.5 cm and separated by a distance of 20.0 cm placed in free space. One of the antennas is acting as a Transmitter (Tx) while the other as a Receiver (Rx). The objective of this study is to obtain scattering parameters S<sub>11</sub> and S<sub>21</sub> of Tx-Rx pair using SFDTD method and compared that with FDTD and IE3D methods. Comparison shows a good agreement of the results obtained by SFDTD method with that of FDTD and IE3D methods.

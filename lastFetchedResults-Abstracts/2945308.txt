This paper presents the recent developments of the LAB (Laboratoire d´Automatique de Besancon) in the field of the automatic generation of particular disassembly plans, called extraction plans. This kind of plan describes the extraction of one objective component only (elementary part or sub-assembly) from the rest of a mechanical system. The proposed method is based on a user´s approach. The potential extraction operation is defined and analysed; it is then possible to establish its performing condition, which constitutes the starting point of the proposed recurring algorithm. Finally, the main concepts are described and illustrated by an example

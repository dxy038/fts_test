This paper presents a new asymmetrical multilevel inverter topology based on H-bridge cascaded inverter. The new topology improve the number of the output voltage level greatly and simply topology structure using a bidirectional auxiliary switch. A hybrid PWM strategy is proposed for the new topology that switches in different cells works in different switching frequency to low switching losses. Lastly, an experimental 11-level asymmetrical inverter system is built to verify the topology and PWM control method. It is demonstrated that the experimental results agree well with simulations, and the validity and practicability of the new topology and control method proposed is proved.

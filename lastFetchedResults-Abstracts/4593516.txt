This paper presents a computational method for designing an assembly with multiple built-in disassembly pathways, each of which can be activated to retrieve certain components. It is motivated by the global sales of consumer products whose optimal end-of-life options vary geographically due to local recycling/reuse infrastructures and regulatory requirements. Given the sets of components to be retrieved at each location, the method simultaneously determines the spatial configurations of components and locator features, such that each set of desired components is retrieved via a domino-like "self-disassembly" process triggered by the removal of a fastener. A multi-objective generic algorithm is utilized to search for Pareto-optimal designs in terms of the realization of the desired disassembly pathways, the satisfaction of distance specifications among components, the minimization of disassembly cost at each location, and the efficient use of on-component locator features. A case study demonstrates the feasibility of the method.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of oestrous synchronization methods on oestrous behaviour, timing of ovulation and pregnancy rate during the breeding and low breeding seasons in Nili-Ravi buffaloes. In Experiment 1, oestrous behaviour and timing of ovulation were determined from (n = 34) oestruses. The mean (± S.E.M.) time of ovulation after the onset of standing oestrus was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in PGF2α-induced luteolysis (30.6 ± 1.5 h) compared to Ovsynch buffaloes (15.0 ± 0.8 h). In Experiment 2, pregnancy rates were compared between two methods of synchronization (detected oestrus and Ovsynch protocol) during the breeding and low breeding seasons. Pregnancy rates of buffaloes bred at detected oestrus (62.5%) or by the Ovsynch protocol (36.3%) during the breeding season did not differ significantly (P &gt; 0.05) from those which were inseminated during the low breeding season (55.5%) and (30.4%), respectively.

tudy demonstrates clearly that (1) timing of ovulation in Nili-Ravi buffalo is about 30 h after the onset of standing oestrus and (2) buffaloes can be successfully synchronized with optimum fertility using either PGF2α alone (detected oestrus) or using (Ovsynch protocol) during low breeding season, to calve during the period when milk availability is short.

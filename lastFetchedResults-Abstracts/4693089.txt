The huge progress in microsatellite performance has improved satellite capabilities in the field of Earth observation and, yet more precisely and cost-effectively, in imaging the EarthÂ´s surface. The paper presents the characteristics of the BALKANSAT microsatellite platform, the special challenges of the scientific programs, the expected results and their applications. The paper makes an economic and scientific survey of the various microsatellite missions and their applicability to regional and national tasks related to monitoring Earth objects and atmospheric influences. Furthermore, the role and suitability of the proposed devices and the expected multispectral data in investigating environmental performance in various time periods is explained. The future objectives are related to establishing an economically and ecologically effective framework using microsatellite technologies to evaluate environmental issues, providing an objective and scientifically sound framework as a basis of the progress in Earth monitoring.

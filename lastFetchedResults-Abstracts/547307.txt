Objective(s): To estimate blood pressure, the current prevalence and distribution of hypertension and to
determine hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in adult population in Yazd, Iran.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of a random sample of adult aged 18 years and over in Yazd. All
participants were interviewd and examined with a standard protocol in their homes. Hypertension was defined
as a systolic BP>140 mmHg or diastolic BP> 90 miriHg, and sub classified according to the Seventh Report
of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure
(JNC-7).
Results: In all 1130 individuals were studied (456 men and 674 women). The mean of systolic BP was 132.2±18.2 and 129.2±21.9 mmHg in men and women, respectively (P<0.05). It was 85.0±11.2 and 83.1±12.3 mmHg for diastolic BP (P<0.01). The mean of systolic and diastolic BP were significantly differed in different age groups (P<0.001).
The overall prevalence of hypertension in this study was 38.1%. Of these, 60.9% had stage I hypertension and 39.1% stage II. Hypertension prevalence was significantly higher in men (41.7%) than in women (%35.7) (P<0.05), and varied by age (P<0.001).
Overall, 38.1% of hypertensive individuals were aware that they had high blood pressure, and 77.1% were being treated with antihypertensive medications, and 12.4% were under control.
Conclusion: The mean of blood presser in two sexes and in age groups were relatively similar with the other studies. Hypertension was relatively high in Yazd. Despite the high rate of treatment, the rates of awareness and control were low. Discrepancies between treatment and control of hypertension might be related to inefficienct treatment or incompliance by patients. Key words: Blood pressure, Hypertension, Adult, Yazd

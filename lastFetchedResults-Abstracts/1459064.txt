The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of premixed fuel ratio on the combustion and emission characteristics in diesel engine by the experimental and numerical method. In order to investigate the effect of various factors such as the premixed ratio, EGR rate, and equivalence ratio on the exhaust gas from the premixed charge compression ignition diesel engine, the injection amount of premixed fuel is controlled by electronic port injection system. The range of premixed ratio between dual fuels used in this study is between 0 and 0.85, and the exhaust gas is recirclulated up to 30 percent of EGR rate.

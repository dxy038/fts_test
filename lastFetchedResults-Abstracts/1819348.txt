Refractory metal borides are the object of special interest for aerospace applications requiring properties of chemical and mechanical resistance in ultra high temperature, such as nose and leading edges of re-entry space vehicles. The main objective of the research is the fabrication and characterization of plasma sprayed zirconium diborideâ€“silicon carbide composite coatings and free-standing components for high temperature applications. High and low pressure plasma spray in a controlled atmosphere were selected as manufacturing techniques for the deposition of ceramic coatings. Fine ZrB2 and SiC precursors were agglomerated and preconsolidated into spherical, hollow powders for better flowability and silicon carbide thermal protection during the interaction with the plasma. Coatings and free-standing tubular specimens were fabricated and tested for high temperature behaviour. Thermogravimetric analysis, surface morphology investigation and high temperature X-ray diffraction showed that the addition of approximately 25% SiC induces a mechanism of self-protection of the ceramic material during heat treatment in oxidizing environments up to approximately 2100 K.

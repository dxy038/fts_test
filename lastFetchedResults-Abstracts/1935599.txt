ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Blunt abdominal trauma commonly seen in automobile accidents and falls. Although in severe cases, surgery is certain treatment, but according to such criteria like hemodynamic status, severity of injury and etc., a non-surgical procedure can be done. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the success rate of conservative treatment for intra-abdominal bleeding following blunt trauma to the abdomen. 
METHODS: This prospective study was done on 16 patients with blunt abdominal trauma with stable vital signs. All patients were managed by conservative treatment. Patients were hospitalized for at least a week and were followed up for a month on an outpatient basis. 
FINDINGS: Twelve patients (75%) were male and 4 (25%) were female. The mean patient age was 29Â±14.24 years. 15 patients (93.8%) had abdominal pain, 13 (75%) tenderness, and 2 (12.5%) guarding. Rupture of the liver had been occurred in 8 patients (50%), 3 cases (18.8%) of splenic rupture, 2 cases (12.5%) of simultaneous rupture of the liver and the spleen and 3 patients were suffered from other injuries. Finally, 14 cases (87.5%) responded to conservative treatment (CI95%: 69% -99%), and failure was 2 cases (12.5%) (CI95%: 1% -3%). There were no deaths in this study. 
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that in intra-abdominal bleeding following blunt trauma with stable vital signs, conservative and non-operative treatment is recommended.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Morphine is the most effective pain-relieving drugs in the management of pain. Morphine modulates survival and apoptosis of neural and tumoral cells. Some data suggest that morphine induces apoptosis in neurons, while other evidence shows that morphine could have beneficial effects against apoptosis. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of morphine on serum deprivation-induced cell death in PC12 cells
METHODS: In this study PC12 cells (Pastour Insititue, Iran) were cultured in RPMI1640 culture medium supplemented with 0.2% BSA. Cells were divided to 2 groups (group I: cells unpretreated with naltrexone; group II: cells pretreated with naltrexone). There were six treatments in each group. Cells treated with different concentrations (The treatments were: treatment1: 10-12, treatment 2: 10-10, treatment 3: 10-8, treatment 4: 10-6, treatment 5: 10-4, Treatment 6: 0.0 M,) of morphine. The percentage of cytotoxicity by lactate dehydrogenase assay and the percentage of cell death by Hoechst/PI differential staining of each group were assessed.  
FINDINGS: After 6 days, serum deprivation result in full cell death (100%) in PC12 cells (p < 0.05). The percentage of cytotoxicity and cell death assessment showed that morphine at different concentration inhibited serum deprivation-induced cell death and cytotoxicity in PC12 cells (p < 0.05). 
CONCLUSION: Our results concluded that morphine with an opioid receptor-depended as a growth factor lead to inhibition of serum deprivation-induced cell death in PC12 cells.

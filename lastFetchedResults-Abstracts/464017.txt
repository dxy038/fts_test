OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the maternal and neonatal effects of elective low-forceps delivery, as currently defined by the 1988 criteria of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
STUDY DESIGN: During a 6-month period we conducted a prospective study that included 50 nulliparous term parturients who were randomly allocated to spontaneous or elective low-forceps delivery. Patients with either maternal or fetal disorders that could affect the outcome were excluded. All deliveries were attended by three experienced obstetricians.
RESULTS: Spontaneous and forceps delivery groups were similar regarding maternal or gestational age, fetal scalp pH, antepartum maternal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, maternal outcome, mean birth weight, and number of neonates with low Apgar scores or cord arterial pH <7.20. In the spontaneous delivery group the time elapsed since randomization to delivery was significantly longer (18 vs 10.2 minutes, p< 0.001) and the mean cord arterial pH was significantly lower (7.23 vs 7.27, p = 0.01) than in the forceps delivery group.
CONCLUSION: Elective low forces delivery may be used to shorten the second stage of labor without immediate maternal or neonatal side effects.

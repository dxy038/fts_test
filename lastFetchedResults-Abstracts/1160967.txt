Steam meals are ready-to-eat meals composed of raw and semi-cooked ingredients, which get cooked while microwave heating. In this study, an Indian style meal was selected, Chicken Tandoori, from two different producers. These meals were first evaluated with the Risk Ranger® to identify the main foodborne pathogens risks, which were Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium and Bacillus cereus. Thereafter, quantitative microbiology was applied using different models and verified with growth and inactivation challenge tests. It was observed that the gamma model and the ComBase program® showed very similar results. However, in some cases the results obtained with the challenge tests showed different results. The information gathered was used to create different scenarios which indicate how to manage the risks by setting Performance Objectives during the different stages of the food chain of this product and hence reaching a suggested Food Safety Objective.

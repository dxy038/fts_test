The objective of this paper is to propose a dc-bus voltage regulation and power control strategy for the three-phase back-to-back active power conditioner (APC). The proposed three-phase back-to-back APC is able to control the power flow between micro-grids. The demanded active and reactive power via droop control regulates the frequency and voltage, which contributes the power quality and stability of micro-grids. Moreover, in order to minimize the change of the input current variation as well as to achieve the dc-bus regulation in one 60Hz cycle, the optimal ac-line current regulation strategy and the voltage trend method are integrated in this paper. Simulation and Experimental results obtained from a 5 kVA prototype circuit demonstrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.

s
ses came from 43% (388) of the 895 hospitals. Most respondents indicated that they wore gloves when handling electrodes (approximately 96%); usually the gloves were nonsterile (73%). A sterile procedure was often used to perform site care (37% for epicardial and 65% for transvenous). The most common agent used for site cleansing was povidone-iodine. Concern has been expressed in the literature about use of this agent. Gauze was the most common type of dressing (used by 60% for epicardial dressings and 31% for transvenous).
sion
is diversity in clinical practice. Further study is recommended to establish the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of identified infection precautions.

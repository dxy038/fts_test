introduction/Objective: The a-adrenergic receptor antagonists represent the most frequently prescribed first line treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tamsulosin is a uroselective a1A/a1D adrenergic receptor antagonist. The objective of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of a daily dose of tamsulosin 0.4 mg in patients with functional symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia through an evaluation of reduction of subjective symptoms, quantified through the International Prostate Symptom Score. Materials and methods: 45 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia used tamsulosin 0.4 mg over the course of 12 weeks; their International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) value was > 8 points, while their Quality of Life Index (QLI) value was > 3 points. Checkups were scheduled 4 and 12 weeks following the initiation of treatment, during which the values for IPSS and disease-specific quality of life (QLI) were obtained. Results: At the beginning of tamsulosin treatment, the total IPSS was 24.95 points. After the 4-and 12-week checkups, the total IPSS fell to 16.09 and 11.20 points, respectively. The reduction in symptoms, quantified through IPSS, was 35.51% after 4 weeks of treatment, and 55.11% after 12 weeks. The Quality of Life Index was initially 4.49 points, it decreased to 2.49 points after 4 weeks, and to 1.40 points after 12 weeks, marking an improvement of 44.54% after 4 weeks and 68.82% after 12 weeks. There was a statistically significant difference between the initial values for IPSS and QLI and their values after both checkups (p<0.05). Side effects were observed in three patients (6.66%), with one (2,22%) experiencing problems with ejaculation and the other two (4,44%) having vasodilatatory effects such as vertigo and headache. Conclusion: Clinical response to a 12-week tamsulosin treatment improved during the course of treatment, reflected in a reduction in all of the lower urinary tract symptoms, with rare and insignificant side effects.

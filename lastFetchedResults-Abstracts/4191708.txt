Four types of coupling and decoupling networks (CDNs) were developed to measure the immunity of telecommunications equipment below 150 kHz on a power line terminal and a telecommunications line terminal. The developed CDNs satisfy the specifications for the design objective. An experiment using the developed CDNs indicates that the malfunction of the actual disturbance can be estimated from the immunity test results

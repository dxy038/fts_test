This project concerns the design and fabrication of the autonomous mobile robot (AMR) prototype, utilizing backward chaining as a mainframe in helping the robot to generate a self-understanding of the area of work and mobilization to a destination desired by the user. Further explanation of backward chaining is included. The main objective of this project is to create and develop a path planning mobile robot able to avoid obstacles in its path and reach a target designated position from its starting point utilizing 4 wheel-based rover body, sensors, linear motors and microcontrollers. The paper describes the design process of the AMR development, from the initiation of idea to development of algorithms, to virtual prototype development of AMR mechanisms and controller board, to fabrication, to mobility, obstacle avoidance and path planning test. Two methods of path planning are presented, using compass bearing in undetermined space and predetermined path. Obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithms has been tested using the completed design of AMR body.

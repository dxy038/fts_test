The decision making of design schemes is an essential problem in the process of conceptual design of products. It is a valuable new topic on fusing the subjective determination method and the objective determination method according to a certain kind of rule, which both considering the subjective information, and the objective information. This article firstly build a fuzzy non-linear weight fusion mathematical model based on fuzzy set and least squares, Then a collaborative immune algorithm based on clonal selection theory and the complement activity theory is presented to solve the fuzzy non-linear weight fusion mathematical problem. Finally, the applicability of the decision making process of transmission schemes of the belt conveyor is realized, and the results displays the rank of transmission schemes is feasible and promotes the automatic decision making method and technology of the conceptual design of product.

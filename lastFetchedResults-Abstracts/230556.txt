The main objective of the present study is to perform a comparative study of five existing correlations that have been selected and identify the best performing correlations in the subchannel pressure drop analysis of a wire-wrapped fuel assembly by means of directly comparing with experimental data obtained in the present work. For this purpose, a series of water experiments have been performed using a helical wire-wrapped 19-pin fuel assembly for various combinations of test parameters. Four different test sections that have different pitch to rod diameter ratios (P/D) and wire lead length to rod diameter ratios (H/D) have been fabricated. A series of pressure drop measurements were made to obtain friction factors for these four test sections. A total of 293 data were obtained and the present along with existing data are used in the present comparative study of existing correlations. The results of this study show that both the original and the simplified Cheng and Todreas correlations give the best agreement with experimental data for all flow regions.

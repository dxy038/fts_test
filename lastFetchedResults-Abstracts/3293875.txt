The European initiative MOBISEC focuses on improving road safety for citizens as cyclists and pedestrians. The main objective is to gather information of the usual routes of cyclists on a medium-sized town, Murcia (Spain), and their interaction with other users of public roads. Through the use of technological innovations implemented on mobile devices, and the active participation of citizens, MOBISEC will track the routes of cyclists in an urban environment, to learn about their habits in order to improve dynamically the safety of pedestrian and cyclists.

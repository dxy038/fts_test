Previous work has shown that the emissivity of crude oil is lower than that of the seawater in the thermal-infrared (TIR) spectrum. Thus, oil slicks cause an emissivity decrease relative to the seawater in that region. The aim of this paper was to carry out experimental measurements to characterize the spectral and angular variations of crude oil and seawater emissivities. The results showed that the crude oil emissivity is lower than the seawater emissivity and that it is essentially flat in the atmospheric window of 8-13 &#956;m. The crude oil emissivity has a marked emissivity decrease with the angle (from 0.956 &#177; 0.005 at 15 &#176; to 0.873 &#177; 0.007 at 65 &#176;), which is even higher than that of the seawater, and thus, the seawater-crude emissivity difference increases with the angle (from +0.030 &#177;0.007 at close-to-nadir angles up to +0.068 &#177;0.010 in average at 65 &#176;). In addition, the experimental results were checked by using the dual-angle viewing capability of the Environmental Satellite Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ENVISAT-AATSR) images (i.e., 0 &#176;-22 &#176; and 53 &#176;-55 &#176; for the nadir and forward views, respectively), with the data acquired during the BP Deepwater Horizon oil slick in 2010. The objective was to explore its applicability to satellite observations. Nadir-forward emissivity differences of +0.028 and +0.017 were obtained for the oil slick and the surrounding clean seawater, respectively. The emissivity differences between the seawater and the oil slick were +0.035 and +0.046 for the nadir and forward views, respectively, which was in agreement with the experimental data. The increase in the seawater-crude emissivity difference with the angle gives significant differences for off-nadir observation angles, showing a new chance of crude oil slick identification from satellite TIR data.

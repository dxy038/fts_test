Bousquet, D., Burnside, E. B. and Van Doormaal, B. J. 2003. Biotechnologies of reproduction applied to dairy cattle production: Embryo transfer and IVF. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 83: 403-407. The objective of this paper is to review the utilization and outcome of reproductive biotechnologies in dairy cattle. Embryo transfer and IVF have their respective limits that influence their impact on a genetic improvement program. Embryo transfer is efficient and profitable in an artificial insemination breeding and selection program and IVF has great potential. Development of markers highly correlated with various economic traits will progressively be added to the present schemes to make them even more powerful.

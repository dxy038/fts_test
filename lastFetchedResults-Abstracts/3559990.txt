A proposal for developing a precompetitive, commercially viable all-optical network architecture using dense optical wavelength division is described. The objective was to demonstrate a packet-switched high-capacity all-optical LAN/MAN network based on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and capable of supporting several hundred to a thousand nodes, each requiring gigabit-per-second throughputs. The discussion covers the rationale and objectives of the program; tunable components, optical amplifiers, network protocol, and application development; network interconnection studies; and testbed construction

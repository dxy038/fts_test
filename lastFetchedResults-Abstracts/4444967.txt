Photovoltaic system (PV) is widely used in various renewable energy application. The main problem of PV system is how to get the maximum output power. Furthermore, the redundancy output power generated by on a distribution system should also be considered. This study utilizes the excess power for energy storage using bidirectional converter. Since the DC voltage which generated by PV and the energy storage will be converted into AC voltage using inverter toward load. This paper proposes ANFIS as search optimization method using SEPIC converter with a maximum efficiency of 99.95%.

Huge amounts of mud and other residues are yearly being produced by various countries as a waste product by the marble and granite (MGR) industry, causing serious threats to the environment, polluting soil and water, and when dry, turning into a fine dust that is harmful to the population. At this moment, most of the MGR waste is landfilled and alternative solutions are being explored in many countries with the aim to turn MGR waste into a sustainable material. In this article, the applicability of MGR as a sustainable alternative for cement replacement is investigated, specifically for such residues created in Brazil. Compressive strength, elastic modulus and water absorption tests are conducted to examine the mechanical performance of concrete containing MGR. Chemical analysis and particle size distribution showed that MGR is a non-reactive material and may act as a filler. A numerical analysis has been performed with the objective to calculate the contact area between the expanding outer shell of the hydrating cement particles and the surface of the MGR fillers. The analysis showed a strong correlation with the contact area and also confirmed that MGR can be used as a sustainable replacement for cement.

<strong>Objective:</strong> Elevated nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) count is introduced as a potential marker of intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). To investigate the probable association regardless of any known underlying disease, we aimed to study disturbances in NRBC count in infants experiencing idiopathic IUGR.<br /><strong>Materials and methods: </strong>Twenty three infants regarded IUGR without any known cause were chosen to be compared to 48 normal neonates. Blood samples were collected instantly after birth and the same measurements were done in both groups.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> NRBC count/100 white blood cells was significantly higher in the IUGR group (P value &lt; 0.001). pH measurements did not reveal any significant difference.<strong><br />Conclusion:</strong> Increased NRBC count in cases of idiopathic IUGR in absence of chronic hypoxia could strengthen its predictive value suggested in previous studies. It could help early IUGR detection and beneficial intervention.

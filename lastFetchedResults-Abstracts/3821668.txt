The objective of this paper is to propose a new approach for designing passive LC compensators by using the penalty function method as an optimization tool. The performance of the cost-effective passive LC compensator for a constant load depends on the appropriate inductor and capacitor selection. Several design methods are reviewed and a novel design methodology is proposed in this paper. By using the proposed method, the designer can quickly find appropriate parameter values to meet the desired circuit performance. Simulated results show that an appropriate combination of the inductor and capacitor selected by the proposed method can meet the desired power-quality requirement. Different cases of design examples are shown in this paper to verify the performance of the proposed design methodology.

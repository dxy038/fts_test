Compared with traditional remote sensing, multiangular observation provides 3-D structural information of a forest through different directional observations. The MGeoSAIL model, suitable for multiangular observations, was developed based on the single-angle model GeoSAIL. The MGeoSAIL model combines the geometric-optic model with the radiation transfer model and has the advantages of both models. Thus, it is more accurate and feasible. The geometric-optic model calculates the amount of shadowed and illuminated components within a forest scene, while the radiation transfer model [Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL)] calculates the reflectance and transmittance of tree crowns. The uniform index is introduced to characterize the relationship quantitatively between tree distribution pattern and the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The simulation results show that the MGeoSAIL model could simulate the &#8220;hot&#8221; spot in red and near-infrared bands, as well as the &#8220;bowl&#8221; shape in the near-infrared band. The relationship between the uniform index and BRDF is negatively exponential. Finally, the look-up table was calculated using the MGeoSAIL model, and leaf area index (LAI) was inversed from compact high-resolution imaging spectrometry data. The results compared well with the measured LAI in Changbai Mountain area, China.

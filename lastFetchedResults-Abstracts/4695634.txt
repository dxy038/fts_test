The medical sonography is an ultrasound-based technique used to visualize internal organs. It is based on detecting the reflections of the waves emitted by a probe. The waves may have various frequencies. Generally, the higher the frequency is, the better and more detailed output images we can get. However, if we want to obtain the brain-stem ultrasound images suitable for the Parkinson disease diagnostics, we can only use the low-frequency probes due to the presence of skull. For this reason, the output images will necessarily be of low quality. In spite of that, these images are essential for the Parkinson disease diagnostics and treatment because, except outer symptoms, they provide the only way how to determine the existence and seriousness of the disease. The low image quality may even lead to the different or inaccurate diagnosis of same image from different medical doctors. Our objective is to create a tool that should help to minimize the physicianÂ´s subjectivity in the final diagnosis and should provide more exact information about the processed images.

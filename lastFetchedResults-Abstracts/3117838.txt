This paper introduces the concept and framework of all network service (ANS). The concept of ANS has developed from social network service (SNS) and Wiki service. Social network service is designed to utilize the human network offline to online. SNS helps to connect people with relations, interests and affiliation. Wiki designed to create a knowledge repository by actively and wide openly sharing information. Unlike the SNS that information has ownership by users and can be accessible depending only on the relationships Wiki shares the information with no restriction. Information on Wiki absolutely has no ownership and information is linked each other by its similarity and relativity. Although Wiki reflects the concept of Web 2.0 - sharing and modifying information by multiple users who are willing to join - Wiki is merely oriented in information, not human relationship. ANS is designed to combine the concept of two services to overcome the limitations that each of them has; connecting people and sharing and accessing information with no restriction. ANS treats the information and human member as same identity within the service; same functionalities can be applied such as connecting each identity. In addition, ANS allows each identity can be modified by other identities, just like Wiki, for high quality objective information by multiple revisions. ANS provides low searching cost, highly objective information, and collaborative online society. This paper describes the limitation of SNS and Wiki, and How ANS recovers them.

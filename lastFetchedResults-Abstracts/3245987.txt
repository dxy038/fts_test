In the following paper, we were interested in a model related to School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP). Our first objective is to develop a transportation plan to minimize the costs of running across network while meeting a set of constraints such as the capacity of bus and the distance establish by each vehicle. The metaheuristics, namely genetic algorithm are able to solve NP-hard problems. To reach the optimal solution, a new version of genetic algorithm is developed; the set of new operators created in this version offer a great exploitation of the space and then it take can provide a feasible solution. The best solution provided by SBRP allows us to reduce the total transport costs. SBRP would be probably the key to develop the transport companyÂ´s economies and a major challenge for sustainable development.

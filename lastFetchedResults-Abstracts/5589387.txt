The objective of ODP is according to ITU-T Recommendation X.901 stated as follows: &#8220;The objective of ODP standardization is the development of standards that allow the benefits of distributing information processing services to be realized in an environment of heterogeneous IT resources and multiple organizational domains. These standards address constraints on system specification and the provision of a system infrastructure that accommodate difficulties inherent in the design and programming of distributed systems.&#8221; This objective seems to cover planning and inter working of IT systems within an organization, such as a telecom operator. Therefore, we in this paper discuss the needs of an Overall IT Plan, and discuss the use of ODP for specifying the solution. We indicate that the current ODP may be too abstract for the purpose, and indicate how to adapt ODP to fit the purpose.

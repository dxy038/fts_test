ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute administration of Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is produced dose-dependent effects on anxiety-related behaviors. High doses of MDMA have anxiolytic effects and low doses of MDMA increases anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sub-chronic (7 days) effects of low doses of MDMA on anxiety in the male rat.
METHODS: In the present experimental study, 28 male Wistar rats were used with approximate weight 20 ± 200 g. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups, 7 rats were used in each group and experimental groups for a week received different doses of MDMA (1.25, 2.5, 5 mg/kg) and sham group (1 ml/kg), received saline peritoneally. Anxiety one day before injection and 30 minutes after the last injection was performed by the elevated plus maze.
FINDINGS: Injection of MDMA significantly increased open arm time percentage that the highest observed in the experimental group received a dose of 5 mg/kg with mean 29.77±33.337. With increasing dose of MDMA increased open arm entry percentage that the difference between experimental group received a dose of 2.5 mg/kg and saline group was statistically significant (p < 0.05). MDMA decreased pure index of locomotor activity. MDMA decreased open arm latency that the experimental group received a dose of 2.5 mg/kg less delay in entering the open arm compared to the other experimental groups, averaging 70.83±114.188 showed.
CONCLUSION: Low doses of MDMA in sub-chronic (7 day) period can reduce some indices of anxiety in the rats.

In this research, application of some real-time operation methods on a single-reservoir system, Karoon IV, with decreasing sum of drinking, industry and agriculture deficit has been considered. These methods include standard operation policy (SOP), stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) and some types of operational rule curves with different orders of inflow and reservoir storage volume. To rank aforesaid, a multiattribute decision method, ELECTRE I, with combination of indices, objective function and reservoir performance criteria (reliability, resiliency and vulnerability) has been used. This ranking is accomplished in two different states including: (1) performances criteria and (2) objective function and performance criteria using the same weights for all criteria. Results show that rule curves were selected as the suitable policy in real-time operation and models validation has been presented by testing nominated curve for dry, normal and wet years.

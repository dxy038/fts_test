The stereo image pairs or two-view video sequences can be captured by two cameras at two horizontally different positions. If the stereo image pairs possess incompatible convergences of vertical parallax and horizontal parallax, human eyes generally cannot properly exhibit stereo visualisation. If the image pairs are taken from single camera or selected from a video sequence, perception of stereo visualisation will become even worse. The authors propose an effective calibration procedure to adjust the image pairs to achieve better stereo visualisation. The proposed calibration procedure contains six steps, including feature point extraction, bidirectional feature point matching, relative distance checking, image transformation, hole-filling and reshaping. Experimental results show that the proposed system can effectively adjust vertical and horizontal parallax such that the calibrated stereo image pairs can properly exhibit stereo scenes in stereoscopic display systems. Experimental results also reveal that the proposed method can achieve less vertical parallax than the existing rectification methods.

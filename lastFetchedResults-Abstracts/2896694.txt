The decision between component recycling and disposal of aircraft end-of-life constitute an important part of the management strategy of aircraft. However, this process should be mainly determined in aircraft preliminary design. But now most aircraft are designed without considering the process to reduce the amount of waste that is landfilled in order to improve the recyclability of aircraft end-of-life. The main objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework capable of integrating the life cycle assessment - LCA into preliminary aircraft design in order to enable analysis of the recommended prioritization for each alternative (reuse, recycling, remanufacturing and disposal-3RD).

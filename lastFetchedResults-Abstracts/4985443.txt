The &#8220;lumped charge&#8221; power diode compact model is extended including impact ionization while maintaining the low computational cost. The new model can better reproduce the shape of the current peak during reverse recovery, allowing for more predictive EMI/EMC simulations. The parameter extraction procedure is also improved and automated through multi-objective genetic algorithms, resulting in very good agreement between model and measurements. Finally, calibrated TCAD simulations are used to understand the limitations of the compact model.

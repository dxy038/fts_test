This paper addresses the problem of both segmenting
and reconstructing a noisy signal or image. The work is motivated
by large problems arising in certain scientific applications, such as
medical imaging. Two objectives for a segmentation and denoising
algorithm are laid out: it should be computationally efficient
and capable of generating statistics for the errors in the reconstruction
and estimates of the boundary locations. The starting
point for the development of a suitable algorithm is a variational
approach to segmentation [1]. This paper then develops a precise
statistical interpretation of a one-dimensional (1-D) version of this
variational approach to segmentation. The 1-D algorithm that
arises as a result of this analysis is computationally efficient and
capable of generating error statistics. A straightforward extension
of this algorithm to two dimensions would incorporate recursive
procedures for computing estimates of inhomogeneous Gaussian
Markov random fields. Such procedures require an unacceptably
large number of operations. To meet the objective of developing a
computationally efficient algorithm, the use of recently developed
multiscale statistical methods is investigated. This results in the
development of an algorithm for segmenting and denoising which
is not only computationally efficient but also capable of generating
error statistics, as desired.

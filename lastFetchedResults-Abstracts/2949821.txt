A channel allocation technique to guarantee different carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio constraints in wireless networks supporting multiple services is proposed and analyzed through a system supporting two services, voice and data. Since these services require different bit error rate (BER) performance, different C/I values should be used to meet these requirements. To achieve this goal a cell is divided into concentric zones with the objective of trading off C/I performance of users according to their service class and geographical location. The underlying principle is to offer the minimum required C/I performance for voice users in the inner zone having more than adequate transmission quality in order to improve C/I performance for data users which require very low BER. A Markov chain model of the proposed scheme is identified and results obtained through a comprehensive computer simulation for voice call blocking probability and data access delay are provided

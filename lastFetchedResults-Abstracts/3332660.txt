The main objective of the Ad hoc network is to deliver payloads from source node to destination. The Route discovery process results multiple paths among source and destination. The centralized infrastructure or monitoring unit is missing in the MANET to scrutinize overall routing activities, No standard configuration exists to perform parallel routing because of various factors like mobility of nodes, frequent changes in network topology, signal noise ratio and short living battery life of mobile devices. The parallel routing algorithm needs a special attention to deliver payloads in an efficient way. This paper presents a novel framework for parallel and guaranteed payload delivery in all possible ways by using greedy approach. This proposed work uses swarm intelligence to employ overall architecture with the support of bucket sorting algorithm.

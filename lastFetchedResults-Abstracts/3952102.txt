We propose a new method of processing speech degraded by reverberation. The method is based on analysis of short (2 ms) segments of data to enhance the regions in the speech signal having a high signal-to-reverberant component ratio (SRR). The short segment analysis shows that SRR is different in different segments of speech. The processing method involves identifying and manipulating the linear prediction residual signal in three different regions of the speech signal, namely, high SRR region, low SRR region, and only reverberation component region. A weight function is derived to modify the linear prediction residual signal. The weighted residual signal samples are used to excite a time-varying all-pole filter to obtain perceptually enhanced speech. The method is robust to noise present in the recorded speech signal. The performance is illustrated through spectrograms, subjective and objective evaluations

In this paper, we introduce a measure Me which is more suitable for real life decision making problems under fuzzy environments. Then we establish a general fuzzy multi-objective model with expected objectives and chance constraints (ECM) based on the Me. To handle the model and obtain solutions, we propose two approximation models by dividing the fuzzy feasible region using rough set theory. In particular, we focus on a linear ECM and several properties and two equivalent models are presented. Finally, as an illustration, we apply the proposed models and approaches to an earth-rock work allocation problem at the Longfeng hydropower construction project.

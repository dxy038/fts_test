Brain storm optimization algorithm is a newly proposed swarm intelligence algorithm, which has two main operations, i.e., convergent operation and divergent operation. In the original brain storm optimization algorithm, a clustering algorithm is utilized to cluster individuals into clusters as the convergent operation which is time consuming because of distance calculation during clustering. In this paper, a new convergent operation is proposed to be implemented in the 1-dimensional objective space instead of in the solution space. As a consequence, its computation time will depend on only the population size, not the problem dimension, therefore, a big computation time saving can be obtained which makes it have good scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed brain storm optimization algorithm in objective space.

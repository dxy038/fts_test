This work presents the solution of the optimal power flow (OPF) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The main goal of this paper is to verify the viability of using PSO problem composed by the different objective functions. Incorporation of nonstationary multistage assignment penalty function in solving OFF problems can significantly improve the convergence and gain more accurate values. The proposed PSO method is demonstrated and compared with linear programming (LP) approach and genetic algorithm (GA) approach on the standard IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that the proposed PSO method is capable of obtaining higher quality solutions efficiently in OFF problem.

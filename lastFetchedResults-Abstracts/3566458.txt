An adaptive unequal channel protection technique is proposed for JPEG2000 compressed images exploiting the hierarchical structure of the coded bit stream. The proposed technique takes into account the effect of the channel errors in different packets of the bit stream in order to optimally protect the coded data according to the channel conditions. The robustness of the proposed technique is evaluated over a Rayleigh-fading channel with a concatenation of a cyclic redundancy check code and a rate-compatible convolutional code. Comparisons are made with the cases of equal channel protection and unequal channel protection across the layers. Simulation results show a significant improvement in subjective and objective quality of the received images.

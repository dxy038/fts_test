Background and Objective: Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have become two of the main threats to public health worldwide. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of aerobic training and diet on lipid profile and liver enzymes in obese women with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods: Twenty three obese females with type 2 diabetes and a mean age of 47.75Â±7.936 years were selected as volunteers and were divided into two groups; aerobic training group and aerobic training with diet group. Aerobic training in both groups performed 36 sessions of exercise training, three sessions per week with an intensity of 50%-70% heart rate reserve (HRR). The second group in addition to aerobic training received a diet that included 500 kilocalories of energy less than the estimated daily energy requirement. Serum levels of some parameters before and after the intervention were also measured. Data were analyzed by paired-samples t-test, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whiteny U tests at a significance level of p < 0.05.

Results: Triglyceride (TG) level reduced significantly in aerobic training plus diet group and the ratio of low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein significantly reduced in aerobic training group. Moreover, the changes within groups regarding levels of serum ALT and AST were not significant in both groups. The inter-group difference regarding TG was also significant.

Conclusion: Aerobic training and diet has a desirable effect on body composition and lipid profile. However, these two programs had no desired effect on reducing liver enzymes.

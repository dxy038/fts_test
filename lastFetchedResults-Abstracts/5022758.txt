Summary form only given, as follows. This work addresses the lossy image data compression designed for the NASA Mars pathfinder (IMP) project. Both, mission profile and the availability of a RISC central board computer support a completely software oriented implementation of IMP lossy image data compression. One of the mission objectives is to demontfate the capability to place science payloads on the surface of Mars using a simple, reliable, low cost system within a demanding schedule. According to the cost and schedule objective a task oriented modification of the widely used Joint Photographic Expeqt Group (JPEG) standard for still image data compression was implemented as a starting version of compression software. This version has been delivered within a month after project kick-off. Subsequently extensions and improvements of performance were investigated and implemented as : (a) selection between pixel representation by 8 or 12 bit, \Â´item[(b)] implementation of arithmetic coding (improvement of performance), (c) implementation of "local cosine transform" (improvement of performance).

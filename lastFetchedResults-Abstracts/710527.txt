Study Objective: A review of our experience with the surgical treatment of labial adhesions refractory to medical treatment.
Design: Retrospective review.
Setting: University tertiary care hospital same-day surgery center.
Participants: Nine prepubertal females, age 3â€“6 yrs, presenting with thick, symptomatic labial adhesions refractory to medical management.
Intervention: All patients underwent surgical lysis of labial adhesions under general anesthesia. Adhesions were incised sharply and the cut edges were reapproximated with 7-0 chromic suture by a pediatric urologist (JGB).
Main Outcome Measures: Duration of recurrence-free follow-up.
Results: No patient had recurrence in an average of 8.6 months of follow-up. Surgery was well tolerated in all cases.
Conclusion: This technique effectively treats and prevents the recurrence of moderate to severe labial adhesions that are unresponsive to medical therapy.

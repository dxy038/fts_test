This paper proposes a strategy to determine speed of electrical vehicle (EV) using fuzzy logic (FL). The objective of this work is to predict the reference speed of EV for such state of charge of battery (SOC) and acceleration (ACC). The reference speed generated can be used in loop of control of electrical vehicle speed. Simulations results are realized in Matlab-Simulink demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy.

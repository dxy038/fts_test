The author alleges that there is no shortage of radio spectrum, but rather, a shortage of new concepts in spectrum usage. The recent reallocation of additional frequencies to land mobile radio uses (FCC Dockets 18 261 and 18 262) provides new opportunities for innovative approaches, approaches that are free of the constraints of existing rules and regulations, existing manufacturing and engineering processes and concepts. Intending to be provocative and to initiate action and dialogue, the author challenges the technologists of this industry to come forward with innovative approaches based upon thorough, objective engineering analyses. The FCC, he contends, sorely needs factual, objective data from industry technologists in order to make the best decisions possible.

This paper combines three different methods for the analysis of a self-oscillating bidirectional dc-dc converter under hysteresis control. First, the describing function method is used to predict the steady-state limit cycle, along with its oscillation amplitude and frequency. Second, the Tsypkin method is applied to provide more precise information on the dynamical behavior of the system. To complete the study, a sliding-mode approach is used to provide more insight into the system response in terms of its parameters. A comparative study among the results obtained from the different approaches in the frequency and time domain is given. Finally, an experimental prototype validates the theoretical and the numerical predictions.

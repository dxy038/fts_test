A new solution for the VRPSCD is considered thoroughly in this paper. Based on the characters of the VRPSCD, the description is given. And a new optimization strategy named "Prior tour" is studied. Different from the traditional one, the objective in this paper is composed with the expected distance of the prior tour and the penalty, which embodies the importance of the customers. Finally, numerical results are presented for various problem instances to illustrate the ideas.

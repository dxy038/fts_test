In a recent paper, the authors proposed an adaptive method for multiple position room response equalization. In that paper, the room responses at different positions in the zone to be equalized are estimated in the frequency domain and their common trend is extracted with efficient statistical operators. Then, the resulting prototype response is used to design the equalizer. In this paper, the approach is extended by estimating the equalizer in warped domain to improve the equalization performance at low frequencies. The effect of warping is analyzed and compared with objective and subjective measurements.

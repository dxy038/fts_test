The research was carried out to build a patient management system and decision support system (considering certain types of Leukaemia as the domain) for the Hematology Department of Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL), Malaysia. The objective of this paper is to describe the techniques used for syntactical and contextual Image retrieval for leukemic images. The system contains an image database containing digitized specimens which belong to classes of lymphocytic, myelocytic and megakaryocytic disorders and a class of healthy leukocytes. The developed system is based on open source. Pages were designed and developed using Java server pages and Java with MySQL as the database for the domain and image repository. Several Java-based tools were used for image processing, neural network based pattern classification and recognition.

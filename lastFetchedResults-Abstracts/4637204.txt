This article study the automatic generation Strategy of single-line diagrams, there is a situation that it is difficult to generate the layout which contains &#8220;T&#8221; type wiring line while take the substation as unit. According to the characteristics of the &#8220;T&#8221; type wiring line, analyzing it as a grouped-primitive grouped by four gridding cells, proposing a kind of automatic generation strategy of single-line diagram based on grouped-primitives, forming the initial layout through moving, rotating and overlapping operation. Optimizing the grouped-primitives and layout through simulated annealing algorithm and compare the value of the objective function, matching it with the most appropriate grouped-primitive, the reach the optimal layout of the single-line diagram. Quoting the partial electric network model of somewhere, testified the correctness and the effectiveness of the strategy.

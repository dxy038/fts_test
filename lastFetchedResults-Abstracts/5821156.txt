This paper presented 3D keyframe animation using orientation interpolator. 3D keyframe animation consists of a number of transform nodes that have geometrical node of initial model and several interpolator nodes that represent the object moving. In the proposed algorithm, we randomly select transform nodes with orientation interpolator node and perform to resample quaternion components for having uniform keytime. And then, bits of watermark are embedded into quaternion components with large rotation angles. Experimental results verified that the proposed algorithm has good robustness against geometrical attacks and timeline attacks and also good invisibility from a view of subjective and objective quality.

Tanimoto type duality results are presented for a class of minmax programming problems by employing minmax theorems of Game Theory which are more general than the celebrated theorem of von Neumann. This, in turn, enables one to costruct a Mond-Weir type dual and thereby weaken the convexity requirements on the objective and the constraint functions. Applications of this duality to a class of inexact programming problems are also presented.

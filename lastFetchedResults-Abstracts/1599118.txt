Purpose: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used for the treatment of
many joint disorders, inflammation and to control pain. Numerous reports have indicated
that NSAIDs are capable of producing nephrotoxicity in human. Therefore, the objective of
this study was to evaluate mefenamic acid, a NSAID nephrotoxicity in an animal model.
Methods: Mice were dosed intraperitoneally with mefenamic acid either as a single dose
(100 or 200 mg/kg in 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide/Palm oil) or as single daily doses for 14 days
(50 or 100 mg/kg in 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide/Palm oil per day). Venous blood samples from
mice during the dosing period were taken prior to and 14 days post-dosing from cardiac
puncture into heparinized vials. Plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine activities
were measured.
Results: Single dose of mefenamic acid induced mild alteration of kidney histology mainly
mild glomerular necrosis and tubular atrophy. Interestingly, chronic doses induced a dose
dependent glomerular necrosis, massive degeneration, inflammation and tubular atrophy.
Plasma blood urea nitrogen was statistically elevated in mice treated with mefenamic acid
for 14 days similar to plasma creatinine.
Conclusion: Results from this study suggest that mefenamic acid as with other NSAIDs
capable of producing nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the study of the exact mechanism of
mefenamic acid induced severe nephrotoxicity can be done in this animal model.

The objective of this study was to isolate and partially characterize several rat liver epithelial cell clones containing myc, ras and myc/ras oncogenes in order to study their roles in apoptosis and to test the hypothesis that gap junctional intercellular communication is necessary for apoptosis in solid tissues and that the loss of junctional communication leads to tumorigenesis. The co-transfection of the myc and ras oncogenes in the normal rat liver epithelial cell line (WB-F344) resulted in a loss of functional channels and normal growth regulation; cell–cell communication was significantly decreased and tumorigenicity determined in adult male F344 rats was induced. We examined cell growth properties, gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), using the scrape-loading–dye transfer and fluorescence-redistribution-after-photobleaching assays, and tumorigenicity in a series of normal and v-myc-, c-Ha-ras- and v-myc/c-Ha-ras-transfected WB-F344 cell lines. The c-Ha-ras- and the v-myc/c-Ha-ras-transduced cell lines appeared distinctly different from the other lines, having spindle-shaped morphology, shorter generation time and contact insensitivity. On the other hand, the normal WB-F344 cell line and the v-myc-transduced cell line showed excellent GJIC. Moreover, the c-Ha-ras-transduced cell lines displayed decreasing levels of GJIC associated with their increasing tumorigenicity. The v-myc/c-Ha-ras-transformed cell lines showed the lowest levels of GJIC and were also the most tumorigenic. These findings suggest that the reduction of GJIC in c-Ha-ras- and v-myc/c-Ha-ras-transformed WB-F344 cells is linked to their tumorigenic potential. These cell lines should provide valuable tools to study the role of GJIC in apoptosis during tumorigenesis.

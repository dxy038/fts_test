This paper presents an overview of some existing techniques of Quality of Service QoS and Quality of Experience QoE. QoS stands for the quality of the network in terms of transporting data with a minimum of delay and packet loss and a maximum of bandwidth. The extremum values depend surely of the provided service. QoE defines the quality perceived by the user and is assessed at the terminal level. It can be computed through objective and subjective ways. A comparison of the two techniques as well as an improvement of the service by combining them are also addressed.

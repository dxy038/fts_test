The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the applicability of similitude theory in designing scaled down models to predict the flutter pressure of delaminated composite beam-plate subjected to supersonic airflow. The linear plate theory is used for structural modeling, and linear piston theory is used for aerodynamic modeling. In this study, we consider only the procedure that is based on the direct use of the governing equations. Distorted models with different fiber orientation, delamination size, and axial position than those of prototype are studied. Results show that a set of scaling models can be found which can predict the flutter pressure of delaminated beam-plate accurately.

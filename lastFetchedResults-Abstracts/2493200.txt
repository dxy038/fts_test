In the open-pit mining, one of the first decisions that must be made in production planning stage, after
completing the design of final pit limits, is determining of the processing plant cut-off grade. Since this
grade has an essential effect on operations, choosing the optimum cut-off grade is of considerable
importance. Different goals may be used for determining optimum cut-off grade. One of these goals may
be maximizing the output rate (amount of product per year), which is very important, especially from
marketing and market share points of view. Objective of this research is determining the optimum cut-off
grade of processing plant in order to maximize output rate. For performing this optimization, an
Operations Research (OR) model has been developed. The object function of this model is output rate that
must be maximized. This model has two operational constraints namely mining and processing
restrictions. For solving the model a heuristic method has been developed. Results of research show that
the optimum cut-off grade for satisfying pre-stated goal is the balancing grade of mining and processing
operations, and maximum production rate is a function of the maximum capacity of processing plant and
average grade of ore that according to the above optimum cut-off grade must be sent to the plant.

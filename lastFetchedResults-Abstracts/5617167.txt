According to the data given spraying model and subdivision planning for complex free curved surface, make a patch approximate as a plane and optimized spraying speed and spacing distance for each patch. In order to solve the interferential problem of material distribution in integrated trajectory optimization in complex curved surface, from the geometric of the boundary line, it is divided into parallel and parallel approximation are discussed. In the case of border line parallel, compared coating uniformity between amendment to trajectory spacing method and amendment to a high degree of spray gun method, and objective function were established separately; In the case of parallel approximation, using the method of combining two methods to solve the problem of the coating distribution, Namely, in the shorter line, use amendment to trajectory spacing method to achieve the purpose of trajectory parallel to the relatively longer line, then use amendment to a high degree of Spray gun method to solve coating distribution problem. Simulation results show that, amendment to a high degree of spray gun method is more highter than amendment to trajectory spacing method in coating uniformity; In the case of parallel approximation, combination of two methods, while ensuring the quality of coating, make the questions simple.

Conducted a sensitivity analysis using two Met heuristic genetic algorithm and simulated annealing, different answers depending on the importance (weight) of the objective functions, Covering radius and the number of warehouses, are achieved and finally good results in terms of the importance of the objective functions for the management of Nina is offered. The results show that in the first approach (Considering the coverage radius of 100km), Tabriz (a warehouse), Tabriz and Ahvaz (two warehouse) and Ahvaz, Tabriz and Malayer (three warehouses) and In the second approach (Considering the coverage radius of 120km),Malayer (a warehouse), West Islamabad and Malayer (two warehouse), Malayer, West Islamabad  and Urmia (three warehouses) were selected.

Pultrusion is the continues process for production of composite constant cross section profiles that reinforced by continues unidirectional fibers or fabrics. Usually this process is used for production of thermoplastic composites. Recently pultruded thermoplastic composites are considered. Pultruded Thermoplastic composites are considered because high resistance to impact, high tensile strength, Recyclability and high strength of bending. Objective of this paper is the investigation of production parameters and determine of these Parameter values to die design and production of tubular pultruded composite and achieving to valid product with Acceptable surface roughness, uniform geometry and good impregnation between thermoplastic resin and glass fiber. For this purpose, first wire prepreg has been produced from Glass fiber continuous roving and high density polyethylene (HDPE) granules in deferent production parameters. Volume fraction of voids and glass contents measured in each prepreg and impregnation was investigated from microscopic photos qualitatively. Finally, choosing the best prepreg, tubular profile produced using pultrusion die that designed specifically to help production of tubular profile from Prepared prepreg. Also, the three point bending mechanical test was performed from the sles produced.

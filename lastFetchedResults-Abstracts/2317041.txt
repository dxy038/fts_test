Objective (s): Posttraumatic growth is defined as subjective positive psychological changes following the struggle with highly challenging life events. The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) is one of the most credible tools for measuring these changes. The aim of current study was translating the PTGI into Persian and validating it in Iranian cancer patients 
Methods: This research validated the Persian version of the PTGI using 402 patients with cancer who referred to the oncology wards of two main hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The PTGI was translated into Persian and back-translated into English and the comments of its developers were applied. The scale’s content and face validity, construct validity, and internal consistency and test-retest reliability were then assessed. SPSS 15 and LISREL 8.8 for Windows were used to analyze the data. 
Results: The mean PTGI score of the participants was 68.68 ± 14.68. In confirmatory factor analysis, all fitness indexes, except goodness of fit index (0.88), confirmed the five-factor structure of the PTGI. Cronbach’s alpha for the total 21 items of the PTGI and its five subscales was calculated as 0.87 and 0.57-0.77, respectively. Test-retest correlations (r = 0.75) suggested the acceptable repeatability of the Persian version of the PTGI. 
Conclusion: The findings of the current study support the applicability of the Persian version of the PTGI for measuring perceived growth following cancer diagnosis.

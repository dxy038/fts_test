Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the optimization techniques. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical signal processing technology that can get higher-order statistical independent and non-Gaussian components. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed, which is used to reduce the multiple access interference (MAI) in the direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems. In order to solve the issues that the objective function falls into the local optimum, this paper utilizes the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the fast fixed-point algorithm (PSO-ICA) to improve the classical independent component analysis algorithm. The experimental results show that the PSO-ICA algorithm has the advantages of smaller bit error rate than the traditional algorithm. The PSO-ICA algorithm is more suitable for applications in the DS-CDMA system.

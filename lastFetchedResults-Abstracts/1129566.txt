Tourism is being considered as a very influential factor. It proves an undeniable role regarding development of the region. This in turn implies some consequences including changes in architecture style, misallocation of different land uses, destruction of agricultural lands and the ignorance of rooted and classic rural activities. The research method of this study is based on analytical-descriptive method .It further supports the application of documentary as well as interviews with local experts in Daylaman eco tourism area. This area experiences drastic physical changes during past decades. This study aims to prove the impact of capitalist thoughts on physical elements with different identity, and its resultant decrease in unified locational characters. This study suggests that on average, 230 tourists arrive in the region daily .However, in spite of 31% decrease in rural population during 1375-1385, there exists great demand, and 25 % increase, with regard to construction activities. Moreover, even though Daylam as an administrative and political center and its corresponding villages possess physical plans, but the speed of changes in geographical landscapes are such that the organization and management of virgin and suitable spaces are being relatively ignored. The continuation of this situation could lead to monopolization of geographic spaces, destruction of resources, and divergence from the objective of Daylamanâ€™s sustainable development plans.

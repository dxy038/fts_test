In the present paper, we address the sampleddata filtering synthesis problem for continuous-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. The filtering error system obtained from augmenting the original LPV system and the sampled-data filter is a hybrid system. The design objective is to guarantee the system stability and a prescribed level of the induced energy-to-energy gain (or H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm) from the disturbance input to the estimation error. To this end, we employ the concept of lifting to derive an equivalent discrete-time LPV system. The discretizing method using the lifting approach is such that it would preserve the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm. The viability of the proposed design method to cope with variable sampling rates will be shown through numerical examples, where reliable estimation of the LPV system outputs can be achieved.

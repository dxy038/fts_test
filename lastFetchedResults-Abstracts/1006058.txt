A multi-scale model for predicting the fracture evolution of multi-phase solid materials in layered composite structures subject to monotonic loading is presented. The objective of such a model is to develop the capability to predict various fracture mechanisms of layered structure considering realistic microstructures of particle-reinforced composites. The meso-scale fracture model developed herein is firstly verified with experimental test results to determine proper materials parameters and to consider the independency of fracture tests. Essential ingredients within the context of the models are an image processing technique for obtaining microstructures of composites and cohesive softening models for representing fracture behavior of multi-phase composites. The multi-scale fracture model shows potential capabilities for predicting various fracture mechanisms and for characterizing the fracture process zone in layered composite structures.

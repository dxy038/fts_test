The objective of this paper will be to solve current open problems and trends in steam network wide modeling and demonstrate a solution based on distributed and synthetically modeling approach. The presented model for plant steam network has nonlinear dynamics varying with total steam demand and the letdown amount from the superheated steam (SH) header and the amount of SH steam produced at the boilers showed good agreement with those of actual operational data. Suggested model by simpler structure is developed in harmony with real time control and optimization purposes.

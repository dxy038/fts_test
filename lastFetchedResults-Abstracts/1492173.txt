Long-term tillage and nitrogen (N) management practices can have a profound impact on soil properties and nutrient availability. A great deal of research evaluating tillage and N applications on soil chemical properties has been conducted with continuous corn (Zea Mays L.) throughout the Midwest, but not on continuous grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). The objective of this experiment was to examine the long-term effects of tillage and nitrogen applications on soil physical and chemical properties at different depths after 23 years of continuous sorghum under no-till (NT) and conventional till (CT) (fall chisel-field cultivation prior to planting) systems. Ammonium nitrate (AN), urea, and a slow release form of urea were surface broadcast at rates of 34, 67, and 135 kg N ha−1. Soil samples were taken to a depth of 15 cm and separated into 2.5 cm increments. As a result of lime applied to the soil surface, soil pH in the NT and CT plots decreased with depth, ranging from 6.9 to 5.7 in the NT plots and from 6.5 to 5.9 in the CT plots. Bray-1 extractable P and NH4OAc extractable K was 20 and 49 mg kg−1 higher, respectively, in the surface 2.5 cm of NT compared to CT. Extractable Ca was not greatly influenced by tillage but extractable Mg was higher for CT compared to NT below 2.5 cm. Organic carbon (OC) under NT was significantly higher in the surface 7.5 cm of soil compared to CT. Averaged across N rates, NT had 2.7 Mg ha−1 more C than CT in the surface 7.5 cm of soil. Bulk density (Δb) of the CT was lower at 1.07 g cm−3 while Δb of NT plots was 1.13 g cm−3. This study demonstrated the effect tillage has on the distribution and concentration of certain chemical soil properties.

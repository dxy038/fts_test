Inroduction & Objective: Cervical canceris the second most common cancerin women .High incidence of cervic cancer and the side effects of the treatments with synthetic chemical compounds demonstrated that hazards are immense. Considering the side effects, treatment with extracts of plants such as Aloevera have proved to be reducing thelevels of side effects and can bemuch cheaper alternative. So, anti cancer properties of the extracts of Aloevera against the Hela cells of humanwas evaluated in tissue culture, in this study.
Material and Methods:After gatheringand confirmthe desiredplant species.Extractionwas performed bymaceration. The toxicity effects of different concentrations 16,17,18,19, 20 and 21 mg/ml of extract of Aloevera on the Hela cells of human, were evaluated using Trypan blue and MTT methods,on 24, 48 and 72 hours after exposure to amediumcontaining1% serum and extract.
Results: 20 mg/ml concentration ofAloe vera extract was toxical effects on Hela cells of human based on the results obtained, it was concluded that extracts of Aloe vera inhibit the proliferation of Hela cells of human

Electro-Mechanical Transmission (EMT), which is especially suitable for the heavy-duty vehicles, can transmit the engineÂ´s energy to the drive shaft by electrical and mechanical power paths so that it can improve the driving and fuel economic performance. The problem is how to split the power flow to achieve the best performance. The non-linear multi-objective optimization model was built and a hierarchic optimization algorithm was proposed. The feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm was verified by the simulation results, which can also provide the basis for further development of the control strategy.

	Kinematic trajectory optimization of the dual-arm cam-lock parallel robot in the different lock configuration has been done in this paper.A different path has been considered for each of lock configuration. The optimal trajectory of each joint has been calculated by minimizing an objective function in whole trajectory. According to the number of redundancy in the different configurations, an initial guess of the variables have been considered. Then the initial guesses have been modified and optimum results have been obtained by using Pontryaginâ€™s minimum principles and determining the governing initial condition on the system. According to the optimal joint variable, optimal trajectory has been obtained for each of the joints. In all of the configurations, optimal performance index has been achieved.  Also the direct kinematic equations have been considered as the constraints of the system.

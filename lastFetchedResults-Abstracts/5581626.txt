The main objective of this paper is to develop a dynamic neural network-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme for the Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPTs) of a satellite. The goal is to determine the occurrence of a fault in any one of the multiple thrusters that are employed in the attitude control subsystem of a satellite, and further to localize which PPT is faulty. In order to accomplish these objectives, a multilayer perceptron network embedded with dynamic neurons is proposed. Based on a given set of input-output data collected from the electrical circuit of the PPTs, the dynamic network parameters are adjusted to minimize the output estimation error. A Confusion Matrix approach is used to measure the effectiveness of our proposed dynamic neural network-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme under various fault scenarios.

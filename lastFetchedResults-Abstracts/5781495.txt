Fairness in packets scheduling in routers is a fundamental objective for designing a scheduler. The magnificent WFQ, which approximate GPS to a distinctive level of accuracy, attempts to allocate the bandwidth fairly among the flows according to maxmin principle and to source-destination fashion. Nevertheless, referring to Rawls´ method for theory of justice, &#194;&#191;rank alternatives to the worst possible outcome&#194;&#191;, could be inferred as the distribution of the congestion, in case of its incidence, rather than the fairness. This article reveals the discussion in displacing scholars´ attention from bandwidth allocation to distribution of the congestion or the charge. It introduces the conceptual framework of just queuing (JQ) principle.

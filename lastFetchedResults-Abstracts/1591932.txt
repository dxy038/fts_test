Objective. Israeli Arab citizens comprise Israel's largest minority group (15.6% of Israelis&gt;12 years old). The objectives of this study were to describe the epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in this group for the first time at a national level, and to identify health promotion and treatment needs.

s. All HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases among Israeli Arab citizens that were notified to the Ministry of Health between 1985 and 2002 were analysed and compared with other Israelis (excluding immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa and their children).

s. Twenty-five AIDS cases and 51 HIV-positive cases were notified in adult/adolescent Israeli Arabs, (3.4% of all adult/adolescent cases). In addition, four child cases were reported. The cumulative rates for Arab and non-Arab Israelis were 10.1 and 37.8/100,000, respectively. The gender ratios (male/female) were 3.3 and 4.4 for AIDS cases and HIV cases, respectively. The median age was 31.5 years [interquartile range (IQR)=12] for AIDS cases and 30 (IQR=12) for HIV cases. Modes of transmission were heterosexual contact (34%), intravenous drug use (21%), male homosexual contact (19%), unknown (14%), haemophilia (6%), children of at-risk parents (4%) and blood (2%). The mean interval from HIV notification to AIDS diagnosis was 1.5 years until 1998 and 2.8 years thereafter. Knowledge, attitudes and practices studies on AIDS in Arabs are also discussed in this article.

sion. HIV prevalence is lower in Arab Israelis than in non-Arab Israelis and Arabs residing in neighbouring countries. Nevertheless, the shorter interval from HIV notification to AIDS diagnosis in Arab Israelis suggests a lower rate of HIV testing and diagnosis at a later stage of infection. Patterns of transmission in Arab Israelis need further evaluation, including behavioural surveys.

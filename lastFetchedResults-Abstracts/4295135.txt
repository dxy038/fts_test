Due to the increasing power density and switching frequency of power converters the thermal investigation and thermal management are important for overall design process at high power and high frequency requirements. Much of the work on pulse width modulation (PWM) has been focused on improving output quality, reducing switching losses etc., but less emphasis on the more practical issues of implementation and thermal behavior in terms of device utilization factors. Development of static model for International Rectifier power MOSFETÂ´s and verification through 80T-150U Fluke temperature probe is the prime objective of this paper. Secondly, the thermal equalization PWM (TEPWM) methods, which improve the thermal management by equalizing switching losses of all the power switches of H-bridge inverter, are compared experimentally for frequency range from 10 kHz to 80 kHz. A detailed design procedure with stage-to-stage hardware debugging for high frequency PWM inverter is also presented

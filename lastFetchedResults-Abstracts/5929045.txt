Given a video sequence characterized by correlations in space and time, the objective of motion estimation is to find and accurately represent such correlations. Block matching algorithms are mainly used as the core of the motion estimation unit. Search algorithms include FSBMA, TSSMA, logarithmic etc.. At least 3 isointensity centroids in two frames are required to compute 2-D affine motion. Access to up to 8 isointensity centroids allow for two independent affine motions. Virtual displacement method is used to form linear constraints

Introduction: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of Calendula officinalis mouthwash on
preventing radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis
Materials and methods: Patients with head and neck cancers referred to our center for radiotherapy were
divided into two groups, one receiving drug and the other group receiving placebo. Patients in the drug group
received 2% Calendula extract. Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale was used to evaluate oral mucositis intensity at
the end of each week. The scale of mucositis at the end of each week was compared between groups.
Results: Calendula extract significantly decreased the intensity of oral mucositis as compared to placebo at the
end of the 2nd (p=0.019), 3rd (p < 0.0001) and 6th week (p=0.031).
Conclusion: Calendula extract could be effectively used to decrease the intensity of radiotherapy- induced oral
mucositis.

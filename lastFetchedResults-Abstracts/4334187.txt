An examination is made of the architectural alternatives for SONET self-healing rings, and the applications fit of the given architectures in interoffice and access networks is discussed. Several SONET self-healing ring architectures that meet the basic requirements for a survivable network have been proposed. The choice of which architecture(s) to deploy depends on the applications being served; different architectures can be deployed in different applications to realize a general self-healing network. In general, the path switched ring architecture is suited to access applications (applications where all traffic is terminated at one node), whereas bidirectional line switched architectures are suited to interoffice applications

This paper deals with the adaptation of a model predictive control to a blind system for building for preventing thermal discomfort, which occurs during summer. This system can be seen as a hybrid system by considering various blind positions. The MPC formulation leads to define a multi-objective optimization problem, for which the criteria are antagonist. This method seems to be effectiveness and is illustrated by various simulations within SIMBAD, a Matlab toolbox dedicated to building simulation. The proposed scheme is based on Branch and Bound techniques and does not rely on disturbance predictions, so that it could be easily implemented on industrial products.

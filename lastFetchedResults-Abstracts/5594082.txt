The sustainable development of Chinese urbanization is closely related with the housing industry. It is a critical problem to establish a suitable construction model of the housing projects which can both be effective to protect the environment and meet the demands of the housing supply due to the urbanization. There are three main construction model of housing project including brick and concrete structure construction model, reinforced concrete structure construction model and steel structure construction model which all have their own specialties. This paper constituted a multi-objective decision-making method according to the objects of the housing supply amount, the speed of manufacture, the construction cost and the environment protection. Through the evaluation standards application and the calculation, the conclusion was drawn that the steel structure housing construction model is the best one and its countermeasures has been proposed further.

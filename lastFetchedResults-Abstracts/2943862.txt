This paper presents a linear programming (LP) model that can solve the conflicts by applying fuzzy set theory. The major objective of this LP model is to maximize the concordance of each member´s subjective preference. Further, the generated constraints ensure that the satisfaction (the difference between each member´s preferred alternative and the final chosen alternative) is approximately the same for each member. If the loop situation occurs in the LP result, a fuzzy inference method is suggested to solve the dilemma. Finally, an example is provided for demonstrating the proposed LP model

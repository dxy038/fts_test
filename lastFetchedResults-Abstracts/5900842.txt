This paper presents an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for onboard embedded applications in power-efficient wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and WSN-based security systems. The objective is to keep the main advantages of the standard PSO algorithm, such as simple form, easy implementation, low algorithmic complexity, and low computational burden while the performance and efficiency can be significantly improved. Numerical experiments are performed on a very difficult benchmark function to validate the performance of the improved PSO algorithm. The results show that the improved PSO algorithm outperforms the standard PSO algorithm.

The objective of this work is to investigate the synergistic use of leaf area index (LAI) retrieved by ENVISAT ASAR data and crop growth models, such as CERES-Wheat, to improve the accuracy of wheat yield predictions. The estimate reliability of CERES-Wheat strongly depends on the accuracy of its numerous inputs, which are not always available or accurate. As a consequence, the model would largely benefit from using updated information on the wheat status, provided by remote sensing at field scale. This work shows that the assimilation of ENVISAT ASAR AP data into the model lead to significant improvements in the wheat dry biomass and the grain yield model predictions.

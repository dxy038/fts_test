Layer-encoded multimedia multicasting (LMM) has emerged in recent years to support heterogeneous subscriber stations with diverse computing and networking capabilities. With the advance of broadband wireless access technologies, wireless relay networks (WRNs) are expected to provide significant improvement on throughput and extension of coverage for next-generation wireless systems. In this paper, we study a radio resource allocation problem with the consideration of wireless interferences for LMM over WRNs. The problem is formally formulated, and the objective of the problem is to maximize the system utility where the utility is defined as user satisfaction. The NP-hardness of the problem is demonstrated, and then a heuristic algorithm is proposed. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the capability of our proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we will intend to introduce Degree of Economic
Leverage and it's usage as one of the new techniques in explanation
Beta coefticient and identification the systematic risk and profit
planning equipment in leverage theoretical conceptual as well.
Meanwhile, we will consider and analyze it through experimental
testing for increasing its justification explanatory potency. The Degree
of Economic Leverage is defined as the percentage change in the
finn's sales resulting from a unit percentage change attributable to an
exogenous economic disturbance. After theoretical conceptual studies
by using regression analysis and Pearson correlation testing, the
research objective that is the inverse and meaningful relation between
interest rate and firm's sales is not acceptable but confirmed by
hypothesis testing that there is no relation between Degree of
Economic Leverage and market return and expected return, but
Degree of Economic Leverage explanted expected return better than
Degree of Operational Leverage and Degree of Financial Leverage.
Degree of Operational Leverage will expellant market return better
than the two other leverages. Also there is a meaningful difference
between measure of the Beta calculating by DEL and the BETA
computing by CAPM, DCAPM.

A generation system is considered to be capable of serving a target firm load that is consistent with accepted operating criteria. This target is referred to as the firm load carrying capability of a system. The same generation system may be capable of supporting a limited amount of interruptible load on top of the firm load without violating the operating criteria. This capability is defined as the interruptible load carrying capability (ILCC) of the system. This paper presents a probabilistic technique to evaluate the ILCC of isolated and interconnected systems. The objective is to determine the amount of interruptible load and the corresponding interruption time that can maximize the expected energy supplied while satisfying the operating criteria. The operating criteria are defined using a well-being framework. Study results are illustrated using the IEEE-RTS

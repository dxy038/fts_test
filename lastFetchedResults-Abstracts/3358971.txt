This paper suggests a two-stage isolated/bidirectional dc/dc converter with hybrid-switching technique. High-frequency bidirectional resonant converter with a fixed gain can reduce the bulky transformer size by minimizing Insulated Gate Bipolar Junction Transistor (IGBT) turn-off loss due to tail current, and it forms bidirectional power flow without any control operation. Pulsewidth-modulation nonisolated converter takes in charge of bidirectional control, and its serious turn-off switching loss is alleviated using MOSFET-assisted hybrid-switching structure. The proposed scheme provides low switching loss and removes snubber circuitry so a high efficiency and a high power density can be obtained in high-voltage/high-power bidirectional applications.

In this paper we consider the downlink of an OFDM cellular system. The objective is to maximise the system utility by means of fractional frequency reuse and interference planning. The problem is a joint scheduling and power allocation problem. Using gradient scheduling scheme, the above problem is transformed to a problem of maximising weighted sum-rate at each time slot. At each slot, an iterative scheduling and power allocation algorithm is employed to address the weighted sum-rate maximisation problem. The power allocation problem in the above algorithm is a nonconvex optimisation problem. We study several algorithms that can tackle this part of the problem. We propose two modifications to the above algorithms to address practical and computational feasibility. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm with some existing algorithms based on certain achieved system utility metrics. We show that the practical considerations do not affect the system performance adversely.

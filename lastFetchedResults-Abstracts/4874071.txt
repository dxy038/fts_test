For the issues of the existing method in the selection of web service blindness and customer service evaluation incredible, this paper presents a web service selection method based on credible user recommended and QoS. Firstly, searching for recommended user from the credible user group, distinguish the current user into the new user or old user, then adopt different recommended algorithm to form a list of web services´ recommended degree, Secondly, introducing the QoS model, to provide more objective service selection and satisfy the users´ preferences on QoS technical support, Finally, considering the accuracy of service feedback, the loop should be discovered and eliminated from the selected web service composition, which is in order to improve the service executive efficiency, and make the users´ web service feedback more objective and accurate. The combination of these three processes, solved the service choice blindness and trust shortage, and effectively improved the reliability and accuracy of the service selection. The experimental results verified the validity of this method.

Context aware ubiquitous learning is pervasive and persistent, allowing learners to access education calmly, flexibly and seamlessly. The objective of context aware ubiquitous learning is to move e- learning and mobile learning a step further from learning at anytime anywhere to be at the right time and right place with right learning resources and right learning peers. In recent years, wireless sensor networks have become an evolving technology that has a wide range of potential applications in ubiquitous computing. We introduced an image of context- awareness in ubiquitous learning based on wireless sensor networks. We showed the architecture of context-awareness in ubiquitous learning in general, introduced the components of a sensor node and protocol stack of wireless sensor networks, and pointed out conclusions and open research issues with regard to context aware ubiquitous learning.

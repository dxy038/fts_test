Carl Gustav Jung was a psychotherapist and psychiatrist who founded analytical
psychology. He divides the mind into three parts consisting of consciousness,
personal unconscious and collective unconscious. Through these divisions he explains the
concept of individuation and the problem of personality division of modern man that
is the result of an unbalance between the three parts of the mind. The main
objective of this study is to apply the Jungian theories on the Iranian movie
Hamoun. The whole movie consists of what is going on in Hamid Hamoun’s mind. So
the whole events can be interpreted according to three parts of his mind. Hamid
Hamoun and his wife, Mahshid, that are the symbols of modern men suffer from the
dilemma of personality division that is the result of the imbalance between conscious and
unconscious parts of their minds. Hamid Hamoun tries to find the solution in
religious beliefs, but he doesn’t reach anything even at the cost of scarifying his existence.
At last he comes to a final self-realization in his dream that can be the symbol of reaching
Jungian unconsciousness and is saved by a person that could reach a Jungian balance by
scarifying some important things in his life.

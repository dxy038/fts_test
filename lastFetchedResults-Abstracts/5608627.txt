This paper presents a optimal control and allocation strategy for Internal combustion-Linear Generator integrated Power System (ICLGIPS), the main objective of the strategy is to improve efficiency of the system. Linear generator (LEG) works alternately as electromotor and generator during one work period, energy storage device converts and transfers energy between power source and LEG, energy conversion efficiency and transmission efficiency is vital in the device. By analyzing the system working characteristics, transfer module and conversion module of energy storage device are designed, this design program effectively reduces size and cost of energy storage device and makes the system work with greater reliability, so efficiency of the system is improved. The energy flow control scheme is designed by studying the characteristics of energy flow. Through analysis and calculation, the entire energy storage device model is build, the model is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulation results show that the optimal control and allocation strategy more effectively improve efficiency of energy flow, reaching more than 95%, meet the system requirements of environmental protection and energy saving, and have good theoretical value.

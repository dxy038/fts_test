Objective: Hippocampal insults have been observed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) induces neurogenesis in the hippocampus and enhances
the proliferation, migration and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells
(OPCs). In the current study, we have investigated the effect of FGF2 on the processes of
gliotoxin induced demyelination and subsequent remyelination in the hippocampus.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received
either saline or lysolecithin (LPC) injections to the right hippocampi. Animals received
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of FGF2 (5 ng/g) on days 0, 5, 12 and 26 post-LPC.
Expressions of myelin basic protein (Mbp) as a marker of myelination, Olig2 as a marker
of OPC proliferation, Nestin as a marker of neural progenitor cells, and glial fibrillary acidic
protein (Gfap) as a marker of reactive astrocytes were investigated in the right hippocampi
by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Results: There was reduced Mbp expression at seven days after LPC injection, increased
expressions of Olig2 and Nestin, and the level of Gfap did not change. FGF2
treatment reversed the expression level of Mbp to the control, significantly enhanced
the levels of Olig2 and Nestin, but did not change the level of Gfap. At day-28 post-
LPC, the expression level of Mbp was higher than the control in LPC-treated animals
that received FGF2. The levels of Olig2, Nestin and Gfap were at the control level in
the non-treated LPC group but significantly higher in the FGF2-t reated LPC group.
Conclusion: FGF2 enhanced hippocampal myelination and potentiated the recruitment
of OPCs and neural stem cells (NSCs) to the lesion area. Long-term application of FGF2
might also enhance astrogliosis in the lesion site.

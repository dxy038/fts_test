Three-year field trials were set up on eutric brown soil in northwestern Croatia (Zagreb) with the objective to determine the effect of plant density and nitrogen rates on the formation and size of leaf area of seed sugar beet, and on the yield and seed quality in seed production without transplanting. Investigations should also reveal how much the yield and quality of sugar beet seed depend on the leaf area index (LAI). Four plant densities of seed sugar beet were investigated after crop wintering (40 000, 80 000, 120 000, and 160 000 plants/ha) as well as three nitrogen rates (60, 120, and 180 kg/ha) applied in two identical topdressings: at the beginning of the spring growing period and immediately before shooting of inflorescence stalks. Leaf area formation was strongly influenced by weather conditions. An increase of plant density from 40 000 to 160 000 plants/ha led to a decrease of leaf area per plant. Raised nitrogen rates in topdressing caused an increase of leaf area, depending on the precipitation and soil fertility. Maximum LAI, achieved in the flowering stage, grew almost linearly with increasing plant density (LAI: 1.77Â¯4.85 m2/m2), but was statistically significant only up to 120 000 plants/ha. Raised nitrogen rates in topdressing led to a significant increase of the LAI in the stage of inflorescence stalk shooting, though not in full flowering. On the basis of this research, seed yield and germination of seed sugar beet could not be predicted regarding LAI in the flowering stage.

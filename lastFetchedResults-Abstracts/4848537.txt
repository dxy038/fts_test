Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death among humans. Rehabilitation after survival from a CVD is a long term process that includes frequent hospital visits, which could be avoided by the use of Hridaya on personal digital assistant (PDA) and mobile phones. These devices along with Hridaya could be used by the patients to report about their health to the physicians on a schedule basis who in turn can review their health conditions. List of clinical checkups would be similar in most cases of CVD and hence the objective of the study is to suggest Hridaya, a software as a service (SaaS) application, which would incorporate a decision support system along with some of these clinical routines.

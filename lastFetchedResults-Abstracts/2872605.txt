Today the world is moving towards wireless system. Wireless networks are gaining popularity to its peak today, as the users want wireless connectivity irrespective of their geographic position. Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are considered to be the special application of infrastructure-less wireless Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). In these networks, vehicles are used as nodes. In this paper, we examine and analyze the performance of Ad-hoc On-Demand (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio, Average End to End Delay, Latency and Throughput. The objective of this study is to find the best routing protocol over all circumstances. Based on our validated results, AODV performs the best among all evaluated protocols.

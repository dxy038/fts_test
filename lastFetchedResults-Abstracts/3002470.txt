We propose four-layer optimization for UMTS coverage area: (i) cell-oriented intra-SGSN layer, which is optimized RA areas covering the intra-SGSN signaling cost, paging cost and RA load balancing, (ii) RA-oriented intra-MSC layer, which is optimized location areas covering the intra-MSC signaling cost and LA load balancing,(iii) RA-oriented inter-SGSN layer, which is optimized SGSN coverage areas covering the inter-SGSN signaling cost, RNC and SGSN load balancing, (iv) LA-oriented inter-MSC layer, which is optimized MSC coverage areas covering the inter-MSC signaling cost and MSC load balancing. We first calculate the multi-objective cost functions for each layers in UMTS, namely intra-SGSN and inter-SGSN layers. We then simulate an UMTS network using the niched Pareto genetic algorithm, which deals with multiple objectives by incorporating the concept of Pareto domination in its selection operator, and applying a niching pressure to spread its population out along the Pareto optimal tradeoff surface. We also define geographical footprints, and its impact on the network cost

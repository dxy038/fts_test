What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? At present, little is known about the role of stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy in the treatment of primary renal cell carcinoma. The published evidence to date totals 126 patients worldwide. The majority of evidence is retrospective in nature. The present study adds context to the current literature by providing an overall summary of the evidence.
ive
tically assess the use of stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) for the treatment of primary renal cell carcinoma with particular focus on local control and toxicity outcomes.
s
ematic search on PubMed was performed in January 2012 independently by two radiation oncologists using structured search terms. Secondary manual searches were performed on citations in relevant publications and abstracts in major radiotherapy journals. Outcomes, techniques, biological doses and scientific rigour of the studies were analysed.

al 10 publications (seven retrospective and three prospective) were identified. A wide range of techniques, doses and dose fractionation schedules were found. A total of 126 patients were treated with between one and six fractions of SABR. Median or mean follow-up ranged from 9 to 57.5 months. A weighted local control was reported of 93.91% (range 84%-100%). The weighted rate of severe grade 3 or higher adverse events was 3.8% (range 0%-19%). The weighted rate of grade 1-2 minor adverse events was 21.4% (range 0%-93%). The most commonly employed fractionation schedule was 40 Gy delivered over five fractions.
sions
t literature suggests that SABR for primary renal cell carcinoma can be delivered with promising rates of local control and acceptable toxicity. However, there was insufficient evidence to recommend a consensus view for dose fractionation or technique. This indicates the need for further prospective studies assessing the role of this technique in medically inoperable patients.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the surgical outcome of anterior displacement of the tibial tuberosity (Maquet procedure) for reducing patellofemoral joint contact force. The in-vivo  experimental knee joint geometric data with a biomechanical model was used to do the simulation of the Maquet procedure. Six healthy young adults performed weight-bearing knee flexion-extension by ascending a one-step stair. Dynamic X-ray images of the knee were continuously recorded by a video-fluoroscopic system. These X-ray images were analysed on a computerized digitizing system to get the knee joint geometric data. Based on the continuous in-vivo  geometric data, computer surgery simulation was studied on six right knees with advancement of 3, 5,10,15, and 20 degrees of the patellar tendon insertion. Evaluation of the simulation consequences from a biomechanical view point showed that the Maquet procedure reduced the patellofemoral joint reaction force only up to 20% at 90 degrees of knee flexion angle. The patellofemoral joint reaction force had 50% reduction only when the knee flexion angle less than 20 degrees, and only when the patellar tendon was moved out by 15 or 20 degrees. This represented nearly 1 in. of the anterior displacement of the tibial tuberosity. The results also showed that the Maquet procedure would decrease up to 20% of the force transmission efficiency of the patellofemoral mechanism, which would cause the mechanical consequences of the operation to be only minor at larger knee flexion angles more than 20 degrees. These findings suggest that the Maquet procedure is only favourable to less active or older patients having small knee flexion angle activities.

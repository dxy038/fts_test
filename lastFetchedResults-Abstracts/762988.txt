The objective of this research was to discriminate four local breeds of goat in Central Java-Indonesia using multivariate analysis. Data from eight morphological traits of four goat breeds, namely Kejobong goat (JG), Etawa Grade goat (EGG), Kacang goat (KG) and Jawarandu goat (RG) originated from Purbalingga, Pur-worejo, Grobogan and Pemalang regencies, respectively, were used. One hundred and sixty six animals were used as materials, in which they were classified into two groups, namely young group ( < 1 year old) and mature group (?1 years old). The number of goats designated as male-young, male-mature, female-young and female-mature were 54, 32, 38 and 42 heads, respectively. GLM, CANDIS, PRINCOMP and DISCRIM procedures of SAS were used to compute all data observed. UPGMA of MEGA 5 was used to illustrate the distance among breeds. Results showed that body weight as reflection of body measurements in the mature group was higher in males than those in females. Males tended to be heavier than the females. The chest circumference (CC) was the most influential single variable in determining breed. KG, JG and EGG were categorized into a similar group, while KG showed farther distance in relation to the other three breeds.

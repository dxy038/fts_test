Fast broadcasting (FB) is a popular near video-on-demand system where a video is divided into equal size segments those are repeatedly transmitted over a number of channels following a pattern. For user satisfaction, it is required to reduce the initial user waiting time and client side buffer requirement at streaming. Use of additional channels can achieve the objective. However, some augmentation is required to the basic FB scheme as it lacks any mechanism to realize a well defined relationship among the segment sizes at channel transition. Lack of correspondence between the segments causes intermediate waiting for the clients while watching videos. Use of additional channel requires additional bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a modified FB scheme that achieves zero initial clients waiting time and provides a mechanism to control client side buffer requirement at streaming without requiring additional channels. We present several results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FB scheme over the existing ones.

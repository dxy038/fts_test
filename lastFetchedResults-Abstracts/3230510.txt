This paper presents direct current (DC) power flow model based static transmission network expansion planning (STNEP) to minimize the transmission investment cost. Static TNEP find out where and how many new transmission lines should be added to the network. To meet the load growth and generation patterns maintaining the system reliability, stability, and economic constraints, transmission network expansion planning problem is highly complex in nature. The objective of transmission expansion planning (TEP) was to minimize the transmission network investment cost required to meet the growing load and the added constraints. This paper presents application of a population search based algorithm named MOX optimization, is used to solve the STNEP problem without generation resizing consideration to minimize the transmission investment cost. To validate the capability of the proposed method is tested with GarverÂ´s six-bus network, IEEE 24-bus test system, and IEEE 25-bus test system and results obtained are compared with the previous published literature. It is found that proposed algorithm yields optimal results in all cases.

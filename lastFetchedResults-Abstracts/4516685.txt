In this paper, proper and detailed reliability models for the power converter are addressed to assess the reliability of the system, taking into account the effects of stresses and environment on the reliability of the components. Based on that, a system design strategy is proposed in two different ways, either through a system or components point of view. The former implies the minimization of the number of components, thus simplifying the converter structure, and the minimization of stress on the different devices and components. The latter pursues the employment of the best possible technology per available component. Finally, a reliability-oriented design for a three phase AC to DC, bidirectional power converter module is presented.

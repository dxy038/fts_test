Developmental instruction in four sustainability contexts (environmental, social, economic, technical) in an engineering design curriculum offers a strong foundation and framework upon which to build an engineering program that teaches students the necessary methodologies for designing for sustainability. Instruction in sustainability contexts described in the current paper employs a developmental approach using BloomÂ´s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, which is a way to classify instructional activities or questions as they progress in cognitive difficulty. Our objective in this paper and presentation is to detail an instructional methodology (and results of a case study and focus group assessment) that integrates sustainability instruction in four contexts into the third and fourth classes in our six-course design curriculum using a developmental approach.

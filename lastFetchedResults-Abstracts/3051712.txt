This paper proposed the model and design method of genetic fuzzy controller based on multi-agent critical evaluation to meeting different criteria. The combination of these agents applies on the controller in order to select fuzzy rules to achieve multi-objective genetic process. Moreover, this paper applies an experimental design method called uniform design to design a new crossover operator for searching a good and diverse population. Finally, through computer simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm of multi-agent evaluation genetic fuzzy control system (MEGFC), in which the proposed system is used for maximization of the control accuracy, minimization of control cost and the number of selected rules simultaneously.

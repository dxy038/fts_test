Soil surface characteristics, namely the soil moisture content and roughness, play an important role in different applications such as hydrology, agronomy or meteorology. Currently, except for RADARSAT-2 which is polarimetric sensor, the current satellite SARs allow acquisitions only with one or two polarizations. There is currently a great challenge in the use of polarimetric parameters in order to estimate surface roughness and soil moisture. Only a few studies have analysed the potential uses of polarimetric SAR data for the estimation of surface roughness and soil moisture over bare agricultural fields ([1], [2], [3] and [4]). The objective of the present study is to investigate the sensitivity of polarimetric parameters at the C-band to bare agricultural soil parameters (soil moisture and surface roughness). Indeed, the potential of polarimetric parameters in the C-band was studied little and the available SAR studies use especially high radar wavelengths as the L-band. Only the following polarimetric descriptors that were considered to be important for the characterisation of the soil surface parameters were analysed: the angle &#945;<sub>1</sub>, the entropy (H), the anisotropy (A), and the eigenvalue relative differences (SERD and DERD). These polarimetric parameters are resulting from the studies carried out with L-band polarimetric data over bare agriculture fields.

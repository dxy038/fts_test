BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE; Among all occupations, the highest rate of musculoskeletal injuries especially back pain is seen in nurses. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of back injuries in nursing personnel and to study how individual and occupational characteristics affect it.
METHODS; Following ethical approval, 1226 nurses were randomly selected from 13 hospitals in Mazandaran province in the north of Iran. Data were gathered by questionnaires included individual and occupational characteristics, prevalence of back pain, probable causes and its effects on nursing activities.
FINDINGS: Point, one month, six month, one year and lifetime prevalence of LBP (low back pain) in nurses reported 51.5%, 56.3%, 58.9%, 59.6% and 62%, respectively. Lifting heavy things was the most common cause of back injury (30.4%). Prolonged standing and rest were found to be the significant aggravating and relieving factors, respectively (57.6% and 59.2%). Absence from work because of LBP during the last month was reported 33.7% of the sample. There was a significant correlation between the type of ward and LBP (p<0.001), the highest prevalence of LBP was in emergency ward and the lowest one was in NICU and urology ward. There was also a reverse correlation between job satisfaction and prevalence of LBP in nurses (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that the magnitude of LBP amongst nursing personnel appears to be high and associated with some occupational and individual characteristics. Therefore, more resources should be allocated to prevent such an injury in nursing profession.

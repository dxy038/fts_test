In this paper, the sub-pixel motion measurement for image sequences is researched, and an improved two-dimensional distance-similarity measurement based on block matching algorithm is proposed to decrease the huge computational burden of existing strategies by reducing the searching region. Then, the normal sub-pixel motion estimation based on quadratic curve fitting is analyzed and several other fitting functions are proposed to be used in sub-pixel motion estimation. Finally, the extensively comparison experiments are conducted with respect to the motion measurement for image sequences, and the detailed analysis about influence of the objective functions, the block size, and the fitting function on the estimation precision is given.

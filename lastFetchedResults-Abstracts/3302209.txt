In this paper, we propose a distributed coordination algorithm for an electric power dispatch problem. The objective function is the amount of costs of electric generations and power flows in a power network. The constraints include the supply-demand balances and the limitations of electric generations and power flows. A multi-agent system computes the optimal solution of dispatch problem with the proposed algorithm. One agent with the algorithm is put in every area on the power network. Each agent only has knowledge of its own area and it can only feed back signals of its own and neighbors, i.e., every agent only use the local information. However the solution by proposed algorithm minimizes the global cost of entire network.

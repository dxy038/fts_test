There are certain professions and occupations needed badly by community in social life, including medicine, bakery, building, and so on, which are considered obligatory by Divine Laws to maintain order and arrangement in society.

On the other hand, it is customary to charge payment for these services, whether objective or sufficient obligations while being forbidden. But we see that this fact is a concensus among all jurisprudents, that is, asking for payment in these obligatory practices is permissible.

To justify this decree of jurisprudents on this quest, the great scholars have presented responses and justifications. This paper is an attempt to deal with the study and criticism of these reactions to answer the questions in this concern and to approach a better justification.

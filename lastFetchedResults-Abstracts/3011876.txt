The purpose of this paper is to discuss the evaluation of different alternatives for the implementation of Turkish army corps artillery ammunition supply system. The objective is to see whether the alternative systems operate properly and to select the best system design. We find that the first alternative system cannot supply the units for all phases of an eight-day battle time while the second, the third, and the fourth systems can supply and yield better results. The third system is less costly than the second and the fourth systems. However, it has the drawback of too many vehicles in the convoy (i.e. congestion) which makes it susceptible to the enemy long distance and air assaults. The fourth system is the best of all from the point of the performance it yields; but, it costs more compared to the other systems.

This paper describes recent work on electronic CDMA encoding and decoding with particular application to optical access networks. Simple and flexible generation of CDMA codes using low-cost transversal filters is shown to allow Gb/s data rates for each user in a passive optical network. The benefits of single-wavelength operation, bidirectional transmission and reconfigurability are possible with a data rate of 1.25 Gb/s per user. This is achieved using 18 Gchip/s encoding and decoding, which represents an order of magnitude improvement relative to earlier demonstrations.

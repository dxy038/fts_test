This paper addresses the data preparation process for a drill fuzzy monitoring tool. The objective is to describe how to automatically generate fuzzy variables, for a drill monitoring system, using inferred nominal values and their dispersion for each variable. Here, we focus on the knowledge discovery tasks that encompass data extraction, data cleaning, data transformation and then the construction of the fuzzy variables.

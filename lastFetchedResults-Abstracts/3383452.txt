The authors present a study whose main objective has been to explore the use of high-bandwidth multimedia communications technology for medical applications physically distributed among hospitals, that is to say an interhospital multimedia communications system. The design and development issues of a prototype are described, as well as the results of an in-field trial. From the results of this trial, a performance study has been developed for evaluating the expected communications requirements of a large-scale configuration of the system

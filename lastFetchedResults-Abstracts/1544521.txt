In this paper, a modified adaptive neural network for the compensation of deadzone is described, and simulated on a hydraulic positioning system, in which the dynamic model is separated into a series of connection of a nonlinear (deadzone) subsystem and a linear plant. The proposed approach uses two neural networks. One is the radial basis function (RBF) neural network, which is used for identifying parameters of deadzone. Based on the penalty function used in optimization theory, a multi-objective cost function with constraint is adopted to provide the best deadzone approximation. The result is used to train the other neural network for the inverse compensation of deadzone. The RBF neural network also generates the parameters of the linear plant for the design of an adaptive controller. A convergence analysis for the network training process is also presented.

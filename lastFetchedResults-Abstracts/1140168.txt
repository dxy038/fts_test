The objective of this study was to determine the dielectric properties of soy sauce, in the 0.3–3 GHz frequency range at temperatures from 5 to 70 °C. The dielectric properties of soy sauce were analyzed theoretically with the Cole–Cole relation and including the effect of ionic conductivity. The important parameters such as relaxation wavelength, static component of the dielectric constant and ionic conductivity, were determined and tabulated for various conditions. The average standard errors for dielectric constant and loss factor were 1.61 and 5.62, respectively. Dielectric loss factor was related empirically to frequency with the average standard error of 1.17. Penetration depth was estimated under various conditions and it ranged from 0.12 to 0.85 cm. The dielectric constant decreased with increasing frequency, concentration and temperature for soy sauce. The loss factor decreased with increasing frequency because of decreasing the effect of ionic conductivity.

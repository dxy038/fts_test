 The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine if laryngeal transillumination in combination with stroboscopy (strobophotoglottography; SPGG) is useful for (1) the visualization of vocal fold vibration (VFV) opening patterns, (2) the localization of initial vocal fold opening in horizontal glottal thirds (anterior, midmembranous, and posterior), (3) determination of the temporal correspondence of the so-called electroglottography (EGG)-knee and initial vocal fold separation, and, finally, (4) automatized quantitative measurements of glottal area function within endoscopic images. With stroboscopic transillumination, initial inferior vocal fold separation was detectable during the â€œclosedâ€‌ phase, where the vocal folds were still closed in the upper portion and therefore initial inferior vocal fold separation could not be visualized with usual laryngoscopy techniques. In the horizontal plane within similar fundamental frequencies in modal voice registers in two male subjects, localization of initial glottal opening depended on the voice types used (soft, normal, or pressed phonation). We found zipperlike posterior-to-anterior openings, initial midmembranous openings, initial anterior openings, as well as simultaneous initial opening of all three portions in the two healthy male adults examined. This technique proved to add temporal and spatial information to vocal fold opening patterns and extends our examination techniques to the very beginning of vocal fold opening at the inferior portion. Simultaneous electroglottogram tracking and comparison with bidirectionally illuminated stroboscopic images revealed a time-locked correspondence of the EGG-knee with the aforementioned initial inferior vocal fold separation. Bidirectional illumination combined with digital color extraction techniques allowed for image separation of subglottally and supraglottally illuminated structures. This facilitated vocal fold contour detection and automatized image processing, for example, for determination of glottal area function, and is considered to be a further step to objective automatized quantitative measurements within endoscopic images.

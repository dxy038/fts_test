Modelling, simulation, and visualisation together create the third branch of human knowledge on equal footing with theory and experiment. Model-Driven Development (MDD) has been proposed as a means to support the software development process through the use of a model-centric approach. The objective of this paper is to address the design of an architecture for scientific application that may execute as multithreaded computations, as well as implementations of the related shared data structures.

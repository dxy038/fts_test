The objective of the study is to derive, test and verify the dynamic load model parameters in TNB power system. Measurement tools used including online power quality monitoring system which record the voltage and current during voltage sag and other type of disturbances on the upstream networks. The disturbance data for the same location at different date is recorded and stored in centre server for reporting and analysis. The measurement point is at the distribution 11kV feeder with sampling resolution at 32 samples per cycle. Data processing using sample to RMS voltage and current and calculated Power (P) and Reactive power (Q). Load parameter derivation software (LMPD) from Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) USA was used to derive the load model parameters. For model testing and validation, PSSE software was used to test the model and verify the load response by simulating the similar disturbance in the system.

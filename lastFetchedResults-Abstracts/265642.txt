The objective of this work is to synthesize new and novel superacid-based lithium salts with large anions that will easily ionize in solvent mixtures and in polymer complexes providing improved conductivity and high electrochemical stability. The preparation of lithium imide salts, their solution conductivities and electrochemical stabilities are described. The preparation of solid polymer electrolyte films and their conductivities are described. Experimental data on lithium ion cells fabricated using electrolyte solutions of two representative lithium imide salts are presented.

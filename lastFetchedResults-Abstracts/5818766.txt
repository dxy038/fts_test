The document preprocessing output may affect the efficiency of the document analysis and recognition system. In order to ameliorate the efficiency of those systems, an objective evaluation of preprocessing step is essential. In this paper we propose a new framework for automatic evaluation of binarization approaches. The evaluation of binarization approaches is based on the comparison between input images and generated ground-truth. The automatic method of ground-truth generation is an improvement of a semi-automatic method. The tests was applied on two different datasets, training dataset is composed from parts of documents, the test dataset is composed from entire historical documents.

Various parameters and attributes should be controlled in order to realize such a comfortable space according the database of past usages. Information obtained form human bodies such as temperature, blood press, alpha wave and etc. can be employed to adjust the space to the best condition. The objective of the paper is to present the possibility that a space can be adjustable to human condition based on human brainwaves

This paper proposes two scheme of hybrid fiber amplifiers with each using a single-wavelength pump laser diode at around 1495 nm. The hybrid amplifier is applied in a 100 km range for both unidirectional and bidirectional transmissions. A single-wavelength pump source is used to pump both the C band Erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and L band Raman fiber amplifier (RFA). Using the concept of pump reused and pump sharing, the average gain and noise figure are 20 dB and 6.5 dB, respectively, with input power of -20 dBm.

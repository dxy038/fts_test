Hypoid mirror can get panoramic images around 360&#176;. Because of this, it can be applied to plant roots morphology monitoring and analysis system. It avoids the complex mechanical design using micro root window method to collect image, which needs to use objective and CCD camera along the tube wall of micro pipe to rotate 360&#176;. It also improves efficiency of root image collection. After collecting image, the collected image is preprocessed and calibrated. SIFT feature point matching algorithm is applied the process of image matching and joining together. Meanwhile improve SIFT on feature points matching. The speed of feature points matching increases about five times, and completely satisfy real time requirement. It provides technical reserves for independently contrivable root monitoring system in China. It also provides convenience for agricultural workers to comprehensive observations.

Background: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) have been documented
among various occupational groups in Nigeria. However, there is limited data on the prevalence
of WMSDs among call center operators (CCOs).
Objective: To determine the prevalence of WMSDs among CCOs in Nigeria and to explore
the extent to which these discomforts impact the daily work activities of the respondents.
Methods: 374 respondents who were randomly selected from 4 telecommunication companies
in Lagos State, Nigeria, participated in this study. They were asked to complete a pretested
questionnaire designed to capture the prevalence, impact and associated risk factors of
WMSDs among CCOs.
Results: 42% and 65.2% of respondents experienced at least one WMSDs in the past 7
days, and 12 months, respectively. Women and CCOs who received calls with hand-held
phones rather than headsets reported more discomforts during both 7 days and 12 months
periods. Neck, shoulder, upper back, and lower back were the most affected areas during past
7 days and 12 months. Discomforts in the neck, low back, and knees prevented most of the
respondents from performing their daily work.
Conclusion: WMSDs have a serious impact on the daily job activities of the CCOs in Nigeria.

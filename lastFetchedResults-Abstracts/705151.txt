Background: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection endemic throughout the tropics and subtropics. The global prevalence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent years and it has been recognized as a potential hazard to tourists. Objective: In this study, we analyzed the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, laboratory features and serological/virological results in a series of German travellers returning to Berlin with acute dengue virus infection. Study design: Laboratory-confirmed dengue virus infections among German travellers returning to Berlin were studied retrospectively during the period of 1993–2001. Seventy-one patients tested positive for dengue fever and were included in this study. Results: The majority of patients (77.5%) contracted the disease in South Central and South East Asia. The most important clinical characteristics were fever and prostration (100%), headache, predominantly frontal or retroorbital (86%), arthralgia (79%), morbilliform rash (66%) and myalgia (48%). The most meaningful laboratory results were: marked leucopenia (72%), thrombocytopenia (70–89%), hyponatremia (41%) and increased hepatic enzymes ALAT (41%), ASAT (45%) and LDH (62%). Dengue virus infection was diagnosed by means of a matching clinico-epidemiological history and positivity of specific serology and/or virus isolation. Hemorrhagic phenomena appeared in 10 of the 71 patients (14%), out of which one was diagnosed with DHF according to WHO criteria. All patients recovered fully. Conclusion: Pretravel advice should be given to all travellers to dengue-endemic areas. DF must be included in the differential diagnosis of patients returning febrile from tropical areas.

The non-invasive nature of laser biostimulation has made lasers an attractive alternative in medical acupuncture at the last 25 years. To get much better effect of laser acupuncture, the objective of this work was to design and build a low cost portable laser acupuncture instrument which can implement reinforcement and reduction of traditional acupuncture. According to reinforcement and reduction of traditional acupuncture and the theory of laser optics, lifting and thrusting of acupuncture, and twisting and twirling of acupuncture are implemented. The laser source is 30 mW AlGalnP laser diode with an emission wavelength of 650 nm. The MSP430 microcontroller system is used as the control center of the device.

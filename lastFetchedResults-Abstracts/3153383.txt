This paper gives an overview of the objectives and current research activities on interference avoidance in the EC funded research project ARTIST4G. It is the main objective of the ARTIST4G Work Package 1 (WP1), to build forward on the 3GPP LTE Release 8 baseline, proposing a novel fair mobile broadband technological framework in which to design innovative, practical, scalable and cost-effective interference avoidance solutions. This paper provides an overview of the fundamental classes of innovations studied in ARTIST4G Work Package 1 (WP1) and presents some performance results obtained by means of numerical simulations and test-bed measurements run in the field.

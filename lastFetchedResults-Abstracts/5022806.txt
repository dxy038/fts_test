This paper deals with an innovating Shunt active filter with PI controller for harmonic elimination. Active filter provide a viable solution to mitigating harmonic issues caused by the non linear loads. The active filter compensates the reactive and harmonic currents drawn by the non-linear loads besides power factor correction. The objective is to study different control strategies for real time compensating current. PI controller reduces the ripple voltage of DC capacitor of Pulse width modulated voltage source inverter. The switching angles can be determined using PI controller to suppress the harmonics. It is shown through simulation that the proposed active filter can achieve high overall system performance.

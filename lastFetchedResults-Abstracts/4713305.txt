It is lack of effective means to optimize the electric transmission quality in the transaction. This paper considers the electric characteristic curves of the purchase and sales sides, and builds an auxiliary model for transaction which is based on bilateral patterns technical matching. The transaction schemes which are beneficial to power grid dispatching and reserve reduction are discussed in the direct power transaction market environment. Model uses multi-objective correlation analysis as the core, clustering process as the base and information entropy as the evaluation method to construct a combined algorithm, and provide the reference for making the direct power transaction schemes which are related to the electric patterns of participants. The data collected from a power grid company is used in this paper as an example of matching analysis. It verifies the validity of the model.

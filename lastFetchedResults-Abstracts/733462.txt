Objective.
Rural women have limited exercise opportunities and significant barriers to engaging in physical activity. This study assessed the effect of a brief primary care based walking intervention in rural women.
Methods.

The participants were recruited in March, 2003 by a primary care nurse at three locations in rural Missouri. The enrolled subjects were given a pedometer, exercise videotape and provided exercise counseling at intake and four time points over 6 months. The week 1 pedometer step counts were compared with step counts at 6-month follow-up.
Results.

Of the initial 75 participants, 61 completed at least one follow up encounter. The participant's mean age was 42.5 years. At intake, the majority of women (90%) exhibited one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease; 78% were obese or overweight. Although most (62%) women reported being physically active, the mean pedometer reading was low at 6337 steps per day at week 1. Over the follow-up period, participants increased their step counts by a mean of 2573 steps per day (p < .001). Increases in step counts were seen in normal weight, overweight and obese participants.
Conclusions.

A simple walking intervention through a primary care practice was effective in increasing the short term walking rates of rural women.

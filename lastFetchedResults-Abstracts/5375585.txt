Existing models for facilitating bankruptcy prediction are not semantics-based. The objective of this work was to design an intelligent web portal to serve as service provider for bankruptcy prediction. The portal has been conceived to help users (e.g. loan managers working in banks) to detect bankruptcy. For this purpose, the knowledge of the financial domain has been represented by means of ontology, which has been used to guide the design of the application and to supply the system with semantic capabilities. Additionally, the ontological component allows for defining an ontology-guided search engine. The reasoning engine of the proposed system executes logic rules related with well-established financial variables. These rules characterize that a firm tends (or does not tend) to bankruptcy.

Objective:
Circulating endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels have been reported to be associated with vascular complications and endothelial dysfunction in nontransplanted patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ET-1 levels and major cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in renal transplant (RTX) patients with stable graft function.
Methods:
ET-1 levels were determined in 156 RTX patients and the relationship between circulating ET-1 levels and CV risk factors including age, gender, kidney function, blood lipids, diabetes, and hypertension was studied.
Results:
Circulating ET-1 levels were found to be positively correlated with creatinine (r = 0.25, p< 0.01) and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.20, p< 0.05) and inversely correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (r = −0.27, p< 0.01). Patients with high and intermediate total cholesterol/HDL-C ratios (TC/HDL-C) had significantly higher ET-1 levels when compared to patients with low ratios (7.02 ± 3.74, 6.79 ± 2.67, and 5.37 ± 3.04 pg/ml, respectively, p< 0.002). Only creatinine, HDL-C, and age >40 years were shown to be independent correlates for ET-1 levels according to multivariate analyses. Interestingly, ET-1 levels were significantly higher (+26%, p< 0.03) in RTX patients with documented CV disease, as compared to those without, when matched for age, gender, and presence of diabetes.
Conclusions:
Increased circulating ET-1 levels are associated with low HDL-C and documented CV disease in RTX. This is likely a reflection of vascular endothelial damage and dysfunction and therefore may represent an increased risk for atherosclerosis.

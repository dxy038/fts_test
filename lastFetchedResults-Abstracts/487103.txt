Objective: Cortisol is the major corticosteroid in fish osmoregulation and Persian stur­geon is one of the endangered and economical species of the Caspian Sea sturgeons; this study is one of the first to investigate the effects of Cortisol on one species of the Acipenserids species.
Materials and Methods: Samples were fixed in Bouin's solution, dehydrated, embed­ded with paraplast and subsequently sectioned. Immunohistochemical studies were performed by using IgGaS and flourescin isothiocyanate conjugated (FITC) antibodies through fluorescence light microscopy. Measurements of the chloride cells were exam­ined by Image Tools (2.0) image analysis software.
Results: In the Cortisol treatment there were 492 chloride cells per mm2 of the gill epithe­lium which was significantly (p = 0.01) higher than the control group (289 chloride cells). The lengths of chloride cells were 13.9325 ± 0.5 pm and 16.0935 ± 0.5 pm in the Cortisol and control groups, respectively; as reported, the length was significantly smaller in the Cortisol group (p = 0.02). The widths of the chloride cells were 7.718 ± 0.3 pm and 7.922 ± 0.4 pm in the Cortisol and control groups which were without any significant differences. Both the dispersion and numbers of chloride cells in four locations (on the filament, base­ment of the lamellae, interlamellar region and on the lamellae) were significantly different (p = 0.01) between the two experimental groups.
Conclusion: exogenous Cortisol can cause significant cellular and morphometric chang­es in gills of the Persian sturgeon fry for their adaptation to salinity.

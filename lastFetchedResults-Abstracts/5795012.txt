A PWM plus phase-shift control bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed. In this converter, PWM control and phase-shift control are combined to reduce current stress and conducting loss, and to expand ZVS range. The operation principle and analysis of the converter are explained, and ZVS condition is derived. A prototype of PWM plus phase-shift bidirectional DC-DC converter is built to verify analysis.

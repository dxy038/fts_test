The perceptual evaluation of audio quality (PEAQ), an ITU metric, has been developed for objective measurement of high quality audio. Previously it has been shown that the energy equalization approach (EEA), and a metric that uses EEA as a model output variable (MOV) together with standard five MOVs of the PEAQ advanced version, outperforms over PEAQ metric alone for measuring low bitrate audio quality. In this paper, we show that the latter approach also performs better than both PEAQ advanced version and EEA alone for measuring mid quality audio. Further, the use of bitrate information in our metric improves its accuracy in measuring over different audio qualities, thereby making it scalable

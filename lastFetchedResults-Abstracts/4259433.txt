Ultra-fast gaseous breakdown is an important phenomenon in pulsed power systems. This paper presents modelling and analysis of peaking switch used in Marx generator. The objective being reduction in the rise time of the output pulse it is essential to minimize the inductance of the spark gap channel. This can be achieved by smaller inter electrode gap spacing. Towards this FEMM (Finite Element Methods Magnetics) software is used for the field modelling of the switch and MATLAB for circuit modelling to observe the rise time.

<div><p class="Abstract"><strong>Objective:</strong> To identify the effects of community-based interventions on the Neonatal Health Index in one district of Tehran-Iran.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> A community and healthcare center-based study was carried out from January 2011 through September 2014. The population of the study included newborns from mothers residing in the 4<sup>th</sup> district of Tehran, Iran. Demographic data of mothers and infants were recorded in questionnaires before and after intervention. Interventions were implemented in hospitals, participants' homes, and health centers. The primary outcomes were comparison of mean birth weight, weight gain during the first 3-7 days, first week visit rate, hospitalization rate between the before and after intervention groups.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The populations in the before and after intervention groups were 274 and 250, respectively. A significant difference was seen between the gestational ages (P value = 0.007) of the two groups. Mean birth height in the first group was 50.35 ± 3.48 and in the second group was 55 ± 5.32 cm (P value = 0.04). Neonatal complications in the second group were 6.9% lower than in the first group (P value = 0.048). In the first group 41 neonates (15%) were hospitalized in the NICU while in the second group 12 cases (4.8%) were hospitalized (P value = 0.018). Seven cases (2.6%) in the first group and one case (0.4%) in the second group were resuscitated (P value = 0.0001).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The results of implementing community-based newborn care strategies witnessed at the first week postnatal visit included improvements inneonatal gestational growth, management of neonates with potentially serious illnesses, diagnosis of warning signs and neonatal care practices.</p></div>

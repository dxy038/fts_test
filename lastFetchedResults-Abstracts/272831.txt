The present communication is concerned with the control and/or optimization of a two-phase isotropic composite
under time-dependent thermomechanical loadings. A control-like problem and a structural optimization problem are
formulated using a common framework. In both cases the material properties are used as primary design variables and
no a priori assumptions are made regarding the spatial distribution of each phase. For optimal control problems, the
objective is to minimize the difference between field variables and target fields and for structural optimization problems
the objective is to minimize the product of conjugate thermodynamical variables. Within this context, it is shown that
for the minimum structural compliance problem, the optimal distribution of material properties depends on the loading
history, even though the deformations are elastic. For a simplified thermal barrier design, it is shown that the problem
requires simultaneous control of stresses and thermal energy via a multi-objective formulation

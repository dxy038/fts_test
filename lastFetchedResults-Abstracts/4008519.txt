Implantable medical devices (IMDs) have recently been receiving considerable attention for medical diagnosis and treatment. Some of the most crucial scientific challenges for implantable medical devices are related to the implantable antenna, which is integrated into the implantable medical device to allow its bidirectional communication with exterior monitoring/control equipment. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the research efforts carried out by the authors regarding the numerical design, experimental testing, and performance evaluation of implantable antennas for medical telemetry.

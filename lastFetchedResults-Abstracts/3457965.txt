This paper presents a novel approach for improving the robustness of the quantization-based watermarking scheme. Unlike the conventional approach, which quantizes the host value to the center of the objective interval, the proposed scheme offers the flexibility of determining the quantized value. Given tolerable embedding-induced distortion and the host value, the quantized value can be analytically determined in a closed-form solution, instead of being fixed at the center of the interval. To objectively compare the robustness, different watermarking schemes are implemented in the same distortion-to-noise ratio (DNR) scenario and then the probabilities of error detection are measured. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme, compared to the conventional quantization watermarking, could reduce the error probability by 0.113 when DNR is set to 0 dB, whereas the reduction is only 0.037 for the recent WuÂ´s approach. Furthermore, without the finite possible values of the watermarked data, the proposed scheme provides sufficient nondisclosure for the quantization step, whereas in the conventional quantization-based watermarking, the quantization step can be easily inferred from the watermarked data

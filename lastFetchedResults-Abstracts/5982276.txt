The planning of express road systems is basically a network design problem, and such design problems involve resource allocation and cost control from the aspect of high-level government, and an objective of minimal total traveling-time or shortest traveling-distance for lower-level users. As a result, the issue becomes a bilevel programming problem. As for medium-and long-term programming, the resources and constraints seized in hand vary in each stage, thus it is necessary that multi-stage programming be conducted; also due to the fact that the decision making level shares diversified consideration for the objectives, this issue becomes a multiobjective programming problem. This study employes multi-stage multiobjective programming to formulate the framework of a medium-and long-term development plan for express roads. An example is provided for illustration

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Phenytoin (DPH) is widely used as prophylactic in partial and generalized epilepsy and also in the treatment of status epilepticus. Since long-term use of phenytoin may affect nervous system function, this study was done to determine the effect of phenytoin on retention and retrieval of memory in mice.

METHODS: In this study, using the passive avoidance apparatus, the effect of acute and chronic DPH (IP) on memory of male and female mice were randomly investigated. The effect of acute and chronic doses of DPH on memory was determined by comparison between complete stepped down time of animals receiving DPH and blank group (receiving 30% propylenglycol) and control group (Untreated).
FINDINGS: The results of this study showed impairment in memory retention by 125 mg/kg acute dosage of DPH, although it did not change memory retrieval. Also, 50 and 75mg/kg acute dosage of DPH (for 21 consecutive days) impair memory.
CONCLUSION: Results obtained from recent study showed acute and chronic administration of phenytoin impair memory in mice.

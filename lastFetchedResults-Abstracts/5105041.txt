The major objective of this study is to determine shape dimorphism between sexes of the endemic cyprinid P. tumba from Lake Lanao, Philippines using landmark-based geometric morphometrics. A total of 84 specimens (41 female, 43 males) were analysed. Nineteen landmark points were digitized on the specimens from whom relative warp scores were derived. Discriminant function analysis and thin-plate spline showed significant difference between body shapes of the sexes with males exhibiting bigger head, shallower body and longer anal and dorsal fin base. Sexual selection co-acting with ecological selection could account for expression of such dimorphism.

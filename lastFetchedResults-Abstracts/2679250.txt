Despite emphasis of the high-level educational document on training and promotion of the fundamental qualifications to deepen common and professional identity of teachers in individual, humane, Islamic and Iranian aspects, still we lack a suitable model for training the teachers. Also lack of a comprehensive framework of qualifications of teachers in the curriculum of teacher’s training has caused disorder and ambiguity in the method of training and raising human resources in educational organizations. The main objective of this paper is to study the approach to raising qualified teachers on the basis of the educational development document of Islamic Republic of Iran to offer a suitable model. Qualitative analysis was used based on strategy of grounded theory to precisely study the text of the development document (more than 544 pages). Then, 148 statements marking the factors and conditions that prepare the grounds for qualified teachers were extracted and categorized. The results of the research are presented in three stages of open, axial and selective coding within the framework of a theoretical model, focusing on the main category (qualifications of teachers), causal conditions (goal setting and curriculum), contextual conditions (public and private institutions, organizations and departments contributing to the issue of official and public education), intermediate conditions (individual and social traits and organizational factors), strategies (professional planning and development) and consequences (total monotheistic identity). The findings of this paper can be used as a conceptual framework for planning and preparation of a curriculum for teacher’s training based on teachers’ qualifications.

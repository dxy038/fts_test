The problem of bandwidth allocation may be simply stated, independently of the target of the allocation: an amount of bandwidth must be shared among different entities. Each entity receives a portion of the overall bandwidth. Bandwidth allocation may be formalized as a Multi-Objective Programming (MOP) problem where the constraint is the maximum available bandwidth. The objectives of the allocation such as loss and power may be modelled through a group of objective functions possibly contrasting with each other. It is quite intuitive that using more bandwidth will reduce losses, but also that transmitted power will increase with the bandwidth. Which is the balance among these needs? This letter proposes an extended model for bandwidth allocation [1] and uses a modified version of a MOP-based bandwidth allocation to provide a possible solution to the mentioned balancing problems.

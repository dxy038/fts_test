This paper presents a power converter for a fuel cell electric vehicle driving system. A new bidirectional, isolated topology is proposed in consideration of the differing fuel cell characteristics from traditional chemical-power battery and safety requirements. The studied converter has the advantages of high efficiency, simple circuit, and low cost. The detailed design and operating principles are analyzed and described. The simulation and experimental waveforms for the proposed converter are shown to verify its feasibility.

In this paper, the synchronization of N-coupled fractional-order chaotic systems with ring connection is firstly investigated in detail. Based on stability criteria of fractional-order system, the synchronization of N-coupled fractional-order chaotic systems with unidirectional coupling and bidirectional coupling is achieved. Moreover, some appropriate comparisons are made to contrast to some of existing results. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

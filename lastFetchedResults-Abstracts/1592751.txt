One of the main constraints in Aloe vera production is poor information about optimum nutrients that are helpful for growth and production. The objective of this study was to optimize nutrient solution for Aloe vera cultivation in soilless culture. Therefore, to determine the best nutrients the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during 2011 in the Agricultural Faculty, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran (37 Â°16 ?N). Experimental design was a completely randomized with three replications and each replication contained ten pots. Aloe (A. vera L.) sprouts were irrigated with nutrient solution containing different level of NO3, NH4 and potassium starting from March and harvesting took place during September.  The research indicated that nutrient solution with the highest level of nitrogen increased Aloe vegetative growth without any negative effect on qualitative indices including Aloin, total phenol, total antioxidative activity and element contents; it was possible to produce the highest level of vegetative growth in Aloe vera.

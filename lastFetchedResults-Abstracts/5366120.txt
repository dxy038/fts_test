The paper presents a fuzzy heuristic algorithm to solve the job shop scheduling problem with the optimization objective of production period and deadline of critical parts. Based on classical heuristic scheduling algorithms, the two important time parameters - &#8220;Process Preparation Time&#8221; and &#8220;Remaining Processing Time&#8221; which affecting directly the sequencing of workpiece processing were quantified and applied to the fuzzy heuristic algorithm of scheduling problems. Using the fuzzy operators - &#945; and &#946;, the approach which makes Most Work Remaining (MWR) and Shortest Processing Time (SPT) more efficient are approximately equal, and also considers the conditions of machines and key processes in job shop. The results of example analysis (Roller frame in a certain company) and verification show that the optimization of job shop scheduling is not only to reduce production cycle time and operating cost, but also improve production efficiency. It is optimal and feasible for discrete manufacturing enterprise in engineering applications.

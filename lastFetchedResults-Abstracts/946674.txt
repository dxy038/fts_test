Background and Objective: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) have long been used to treat acute and chronic wounds. Very little attention has been paid to the toxicity of this nanoparticle. In this study, the possible toxicological effects of nanosilver particles, was assessed by determining the enzyme levels of liver along with hemoglobin over the period of skin wound healing in mice. 
Materials and Methods: A group of 50 Balb/c mice of about 8 weeks (weighting 24.2Â±3.0 g) were randomly divided into two groups: Ag-NPs and control groups, each with 25 mice. After creating the equal wound on the back of all animals, the wound bed was treated in the Ag-NPs group with a volume of 50 microliters from the nanosilver solution (10ppm), and in the control group with the same amount of distilled water. The experiment lasted for 21 days. On days 2, 7, 14 and 21 of the experiment the serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and hemoglobin were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test.
Results: Results showed that AST, ALT and hemoglobin levels were not significantly different between Ag-NPs and the control groups. 
Conclusion: The study suggests that treatment of wounds with silver nanoparticles may not produce toxicological effects on hemoglobin and liver function in mice (Mus musculus) as indicated by measurment of serum levels of AST and ALT enzymes.

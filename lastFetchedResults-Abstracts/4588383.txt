Molecular Communication is an emerging communication paradigm which uses biological particles to encode and transport information. In this paper we present a mathematical analysis of a molecular communication based nanonetwork which uses virus particles as information carriers. The analysis examines the reliability of a multi-path virus based nanonetwork and the effects of physiochemical properties such as diffusion coefficient and particle decay. Based on our analysis, our objective is to create nanonetworks of biological devices within a tissue to support future medical applications.

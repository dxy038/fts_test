In this paper, a new genetic algorithm (GA) method is presented to solve the optimization problem in coordination of overcurrent and distance relays. The objective function (OF) is developed in a way that in addition to coordination of overcurrent relays, the coordination of overcurrent and distance relays is achieved. Various relay characteristics are considered for each overcurrent relay and the best of them is selected by GA to fulfill optimal coordination. The proposed method is applied to a sample power network. Simulation results demonstrate that the method can obtain feasible and effective solutions and, it is a promising approach for optimal coordination in practical power networks.

Dry electro-contact discharge (ECD) dressing of metal-bonded #600 diamond grinding wheel is proposed for grinding of various granites. As compared to mechanical GC dressing, Dry ECD dressing can not only protrude fine diamond grains from wheel metal-bond without any damage, but also eliminate bond-tail behind the protruded grain. The objective is to understand how the synthetic factors including granite structure, grinding parameters and dressing method influence the ground surface integrity of multi-crystal granite such as surface roughness and surface crack appearance in contrast to homogeneous optic glass. First a micron-scale indentation experiment was carried out to display the growth mechanism of micro-cracks on polished surface, then Dry ECD dressing and mechanical GC dressing were carried out in grinding experiment, respectively, finally surface roughness and micro-surface crack were investigated in connection with granite crystal size, work speed and dressing method. It is found that in almost all cases the multi-crystal granite has always worse ground surface than homogeneous optic glass even if grinding parameter is changed. Moreover, the improvement of ground surface for granite is more sensitive to grain protrusion feature than that for optic glass. Although it is very difficult to find out obvious relationship between surface roughness and grinding parameter such as work speed, it has a good correlation with granite structure such as granite crystal size: it decreases with the increase of the granite crystal size. It is concluded that Dry ECD dressing may more greatly improve the ground surface integrity of various granites than mechanical GC dressing.

Objective
Hypothyroidism may be an exacerbating factor for primary headaches and 
migraine is one of the most common primary headaches in childhood. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment of subclinical 
hypothyroidism on children with migraine headache.
Materials & Methods  
In a quasi-experimental study, the severity and monthly frequency of 
headache of 25 migraineur children with subclinical hypothyroidism who 
were referred to the pediatric neurology clinic of Shahid Sadoughi University 
of Medical Sciences,Yazd, Iran between January 2010 and February 2011 
and were treated with levothyroxine for two months were evaluated.
Results  
Thirteen girls (52%) and 12 boys (48%) with the mean age of 10.2 ± 2.76 
years were evaluated. 
In children with hypothyroidism, the monthly frequency of headache (mean 
± SD: 17.64 ± 9.49 times vs. 1.2 ± 1.1 times) and the severity of headache 
(mean± SD: 6.24±1.8 scores vs. 1.33 ± 0.87 scores) were significantly 
decreased by treatment. 
Conclusion
Based on the results of this study, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism 
was effective in reducing migraine headaches. Therefore, it is logical to 
check thyroid function tests in migraineur  children

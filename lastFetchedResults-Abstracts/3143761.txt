We consider a multi-source mesh network of static access points wherein sources use decode-and-forward to cooperate with each other. All transmissions use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Our objective is to maximize the minimum achievable rate across all flows. We find a tight upper bound on the performance of the subcarrier-based cooperation and show that selecting a single relay for each subcarrier is optimal for almost all subcarriers. The solution to the related optimization problem simultaneously solves the relay, power, and subcarrier assignment problems. Second, unlike previous works, we also consider relay selection for the entire OFDM block. This addresses the fact that, in addition to the synchronization problems caused, it is likely impractical for a relay to only decode a subset of subcarriers. We propose three selection-based cooperation schemes to relay the entire OFDM block with varying complexity. Simulation results show that under the COST-231 channel model, the performance of the simplest scheme almost exactly tracks that of an exhaustive search.

In the highly competitive market of RFICs, components test plays a key role. In order to reduce the critical factor time to market, the main objective is to test the most products possible in the least amount of time, for the lowest cost and with the highest accuracy. Automated tests help reaching this goal, for example for intermodulation measurements, which are ones of the most important parameters when characterizing mixers and LNAs. A fully automated modular test system in industrial R&amp;D laboratory environment has been developed for RF and I/O products. This paper presents a part of this global test system and focuses on intermodulation measurements capabilities. Automatic calibration and report generation, traceability, large modularity, enhanced accuracy, multiple instruments choice, friendly interface, reuse strategy are ones of the main features of this system. Using this validated solution, the reduction of characterization time is a factor of 5. In the future, this system will be extended not only to all kind of RF measurements but also to complete tests of PLL/VCO, mixed products. A closed loop will allow comparing, in a direct flow, simulation and tests results. The perspectives of this system are thus wide opened.

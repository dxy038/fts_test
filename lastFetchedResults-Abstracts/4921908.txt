A method to control single-link flexible manipulators is proposed. The objective is to control the tip position of flexible manipulators in the presence of joint friction. Both linear and nonlinear frictions are overcome by using a very robust control scheme. The control scheme is based on two nested feedback loops: an inner loop to control the position of the motor and an outer loop to control the tip position. Robust cascade controllers are designed for the outer loop to ensure definite separation of the inner and outer loop designs

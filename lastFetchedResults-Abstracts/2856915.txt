The Smart City concept is the context in which a scalable agent architecture with emergent properties is introduced in this paper. These agents form on-demand control loops within the urban system, taking into account both the protection and the comfort of its inhabitants, at varying degrees of intelligence and abstraction of tasks and/or purpose. The resulting flexibility and scalability of the system allows expansion and contraction of the systemic environments, integration with emergency response units, protection of human lives, as well as day to day regular operations. The case study included in this paper illustrates the real-time creation of a control loop for an underground railway intersection system. The objective of forming the traffic light and rail switch control loops is first formulated, followed by the message exchange between devices in order to perform the reorganization of the system, in an agent based simulation scenario.

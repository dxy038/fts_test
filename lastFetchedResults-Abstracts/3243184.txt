In this paper, a method of actuator fault tolerant control for a class of nonlinear systems is proposed. It concerns the problem of nonlinear progressive accommodation to actuator failure. This strategy is based on the optimal nonlinear controller which obtained by solving the Generalized Hamilton-JacobiBellman Equation, and its objective to maintain the system closed loop stability when an actuator fault appear. An example is given to illustrate this approach.

The authors consider the optimal flow control problem in multirate multicast networks where all receivers of the same multicast group can receive service at different rates with different QoS. The objective is to achieve the fairness transmission rates that maximise the total receiver utility under the capacity constraint of links. They first propose necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal solution to the problem, and then derive a new optimal flow control strategy using the Lagrangian multiplier method. Like the unicast case, the basic algorithm consists of a link algorithm to update the link price, and a receiver algorithm to adapt the transmission rate according to the link prices along its path. In particular if some groups contain only one receiver and become unicast, the algorithm will degrade to their previously proposed unicast algorithm.

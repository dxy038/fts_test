Neural interfacing (NI) is an emerging field whose ambitious goal is the formation of a direct, bidirectional interface between the human nervous system and a machine. The uses for such an interface range from restoration of function to the physically disabled to augmentation of human senses and intelligence. The field of NI utilizes practices and technology drawn from many diverse and sometimes unrelated disciplines. This diversity can complicate research and education since it is often unclear what information is germane, which technologies are applicable, or where one should look to find them. Furthermore, there is a plethora of inaccurate, misrepresented, or incorrect information on the internet regarding NI. In this article a free, web-based information service is described which attempts to address the problem of finding and linking accurate NI information. This publicly accessible service (http://www.neuropunk.org) categorizes various types of resources according to their use in NI and provides search tools for intelligent retrieval. As part of its educational mission it provides explanations of various interfacing approaches, an online journal club, streaming audio, chat rooms, and newsgroups.

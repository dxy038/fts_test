Since feature extraction not only plays a key role, but also have a great effect on image analysis and registration. In this paper, we evaluate a comparative performance of three point feature extraction algorithm such as SIFT, SURF and BRISK. The experimental results show that SURF exhibited a better significant results on extracting point features and matching time, compared to SIFT and BRISK. The objective of this research is to provide a decision support which one should be chosen and acceptable among point-based image descriptors in the industrial field.

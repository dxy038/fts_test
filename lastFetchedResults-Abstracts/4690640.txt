A near-field antenna measurement set-up dedicated to teaching is presented. The experiment serves the purpose of introducing students to difficulties associated with such a measurement technique. Using a combination of the Helmholtz equation and the Fourier Transform, the far-field radiated by a simple horn antenna can be derived. Measurements can then be performed on the near-field using a complete experimental set-up driven by a Macintosh computer under the LabView environment. Transformation into the radiation pattern is then achieved by the students. The paper describes all the steps they are required to go through and the objective achieved.

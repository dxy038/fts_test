A communication is described where relay stations are moving in groups of <e1>k</e1> stations. If all <e1>k</e1> stations of a group fail, then all groups of <e1>k</e1> stations ahead of the failed <e1>k </e1> stations as well as the <e1>k</e1> failed stations are lost. The objective is to have one station reach the destination with all groups having at least one station in good condition. It is shown that this second communication system requires fewer stations on the average than the system of D.T. Chiang and R.-F. Chiang (1986). The probability distribution of the numbers of stations required in the Chiang-Chiang communication system is also examined

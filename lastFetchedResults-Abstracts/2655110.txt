The concept of sustainable entrepreneurship is emerging due to the greening of the business environment. The objective of the present study is to distinguish the influencing factors for the entrepreneurial aspirants towards the sustainable entrepreneurship. It is an empirical study that incorporates 306 respondents. These respondents are young entrepreneurial aspirants. The study consists of four hypotheses that have been tested, and it was found that eco-friendly people (EFP) are not significantly linked to sustainable entrepreneurship. Whereas, green marketing factors (GMF), changing consumer behavior (CCB) towards green products, and favorable market conditions (FMC) have a significant and positive impact on sustainable entrepreneurship.

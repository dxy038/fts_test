FACTS is the acronym for Flexible AC Transmission Systems and it refers to a group of resources used to overcome certain limitations in the static and dynamic transmission capacity of electrical networks. The main purpose of these systems is to supply the network as quickly as possible with inductive or capacitive reactive power that is adapted to its particular requirements, while also improving the transmission quality and the efficiency of the Power Transmission System. The objective of this paper is to present the criteria and conclusions of the Transient Recovery Voltage (TRV) studies realized for the installation and operation of 03 (three) Fixed Series Compensation (FSC) at Barra do Peixe 230 kV Substation, integrated at the Mato Grosso Transmission System. The simulations were accomplished through detailed representations of the power transmission system, as well as the FSCs protection and control system, using as simulation tools the programs Alternative Transient Program (ATP) and PSS&#8482; Network Torsion Machine (NETOMAC).

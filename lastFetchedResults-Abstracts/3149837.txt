The urban transit routing problem (UTRP) is broadly discussed currently, searching for better models and algorithms to make our public transportation reasonable and efficient. In this paper, firstly, conducts a brief review of the UTRP research already done in the past decades. Then a multi-objective optimization model which consisted of the perspectives of both passengers and operators is promoted for the study. Simple Multi-Objective Optimization (SMO) algorithm is used to obtain the optimal results of the promoted model applied to a simple urban transit network. And finally the optimal results are compared with previous accomplishments based on some parameters defined in the evaluation procedure.

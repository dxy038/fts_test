The work on emotion recognition and models evaluation requires large corpora with recordings of emotional voices. The objective of this paper is to show a simple technique of automatic data validation that can be used in the development of a speech corpus. The paper describes an experimental study for a speech corpus development using two collections of data for vocal emotion expression with three emotions, happiness, anger, sadness and a normal (unemotional) state. In the validation step we used two classifiers, k-NN (k - Nearest Neighborhood) and SVM (Support Vector Machines), and five different sets of feature vectors based on formants F0-F4 values, MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and PLP (Perceptual Linear Prediction) coefficients values of the speech recording. The presented method is verified by human validation process in building an emotional recognition corpus.

The gait features can reflect people´s pathological changes from one side and provide certain objective evaluation basis especially on lower limb bones, joints, muscles and ligaments. This paper puts forward a method of gait measuring based on PVDF piezoelectric sensors. By utilizing PVDF film which has the advantages of fast response, high sensitivity, good mechanical properties etc., the array of pressure sensors and signal conditioning circuit have been designed and produced. Study the human body in different conditions of her left foot force and pressure balance situation for detection of gait. Tested, this method can accurately in real time acquire people´s foot dynamic pressure distribution information.

We consider energy detection based spectrum sensing for opportunistic SU (Secondary User) transmissions in cognitive radio networks. Due to the time-varying nature of wireless fading channels and PU (Primary User) activities, the instantaneous SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) at the SU receiver changes from slot to slot in a time-slotted system. Unlike the conventional energy detector which uses a fixed value of energy threshold to detect the PU´s occurrence, we let the SU transmitter dynamically adjust the threshold according to the instantaneous SINR. Under the constraint of limiting the average interference to the PU within a target level, the objective is to maximize the SU´s average transmission rate and throughput. Our task is to determine a proper policy function for threshold control, which formulates the value of the threshold as a function of the SINR to achieve the above objective. In particular, we consider a linear policy function, which allows a higher threshold and thus more aggressive SU transmissions under a larger SINR. Simulation results show that the SU´s average transmission rate can be significantly improved using the optimized policy function.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing skin disease. Various factors have been known to cause this condition. One of the most important of which is nutrition. Research shows the important role of nutrition and breast feeding in preventing the disease and its relapses. In this study we investigated the role of breast feeding in causing atopic dermatitis. This is a case- control study carried out in Bahman 22nd Hospital in Mashhad during year 1384. The case group consisted of 60 infants under the age of 2, afflicted by atopic dermatitis and the control group consisted of 60 infants who were not suffering from any disorder. Both groups were identical in terms of the age, sex and socio- economic status. A questionnaire was used to obtain information about the participants' demographic and clinical conditions, including breast feeding and their age at the time of first use of supplementary food. The obtained data were statistically analyzed with SPSS software. 31.7% of the subjects in the case group and 48.5% of those in the control group were breast-fed. There was a significant relationship between nutrition and atopic dermatitis (X2=8.13, P=0.043). The mean age of breast - fed infants who were afflicted by atopic dermatitis was 6.39±6.03 months while it was 2.91± 2.2 in the afflicted infants who were fed with formula, So there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of their age at the onset of atopic dermatitis (t=4.2, P<0.05). Also the study showed a direct correlation between the age of infants when beginning to be fed with supplementary food and the onset of the disease (r=0.39, PO.OOl). Breast feeding only can decrease the incidence of atopic dermatitis as well as its early onset in susceptible infants; so, the supplementary food should begin after the age of 6 months for these infants.

A novel multi-objective optimal short-term power terminate planning in a multi-zone power system was presented. Both dissatisfaction degree of dwellers and economic loss were considered in this model. At first, the dissatisfaction degree function of residents was constructed; secondly, each single-objective deterministic model was solved so that its objective value was got along with the results of unit commitment and power dispatch, then the power terminate distribution strategy of peak load shifting control was analyzed and the power terminate time of peak load shifting control was selected. Finally, the multi-objective programming problem was reformulated into weighted nonlinear single objective programming problem so as to get the optimal power terminate distribution of each zone. The numerical results demonstrate that the scheme obtained from the multi-objective model can meet functions better than that obtained from the single-objective deterministic model with slight variation in the every single-objective. This method of decision making is significant for sustainable development strategy and the multi-factor justice of power distribution for peak load shifting control planning.

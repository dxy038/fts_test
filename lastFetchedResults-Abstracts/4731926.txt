Military applications require unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) to travel in an unknown, hostile environment. Hence minimizing the damage of these UAVs is crucial to any mission. The objective of this paper is to develop control algorithms that help in keeping the UAV ´safe´. Safety implies that the UAVs are not damaged or destroyed during the mission. We present two algorithms that guide the forward motion of these UAVs and illustrate how this safe flight algorithm can be coupled with other path planning algorithms.

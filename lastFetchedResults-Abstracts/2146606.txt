The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of naturally occurring amniotic fluid modified poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PDLLA) film on the culture of rat calvaria osteoblast. The characteristics of surfaces (both modified and control) were examined by contact angle measurement and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (XPS). Cell adhesion and proliferation were used to assess the cell behavior on modified films and control one. MTT assay was used to determine cell viability and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was taken to evaluate differentiated cell function. Compared with the untreated films, cell adhesion of osteoblast was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than that found on control, and osteoblast proliferation was also greater than control one (P &lt; 0.01) at the time interval of 4 and 7 days. Moreover, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity exhibited statistic difference (P &lt; 0.05) and cell viability demonstrated significant difference (P &lt; 0.01) between amniotic fluid modified PDLLA films and control one. These results suggested that amniotic fluid was a suitable material when used to modify PDLLA in order to improve its biocompatibility.

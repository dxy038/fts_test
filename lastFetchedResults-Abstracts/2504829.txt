Background: The latest studies reported that local endometrial injury is a useful method to improve the success of IVF-ICSI outcome. Objective: To assess whether local endometrial injury occurred by Pipelle in the spontaneous cycle could improve implantation rate, cleavage rate, and pregnancy outcome in the subsequent IVF-ICSI cycle in patients who had recurrent IVF failure. Materials and Methods: An endometrial biopsy was performed on day 21st in 41 patients as intervention group in this retrospective cross-sectional study. The control group contained 42 women. Results: Implantation rate was 22.5% and 10.5% in intervention and control group, respectively and this difference was found to be statistically significant (p=001). Pregnancy rate was 43.9% in the intervention group and this parameter was significantly lower in control group (21.4%) (p=0.03). Conclusion: Local endometrial injury in the nontransfer cycle increases the implantation rate and pregnancy rate in the subsequent IVF-ICSI cycle in patients who had previous failed IVF-ICSI outcome.

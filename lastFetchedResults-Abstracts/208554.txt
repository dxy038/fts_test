As a field study, this paper pursues factors and motivations
of knowledge production and productivity among
scientific elites with the highest rates of Journal article
publications according to lSI figures. Another objective
of this paper is to understand and analye the challenges
facing knowledge production in Iran regarding interactional,
communicational, nonnative and ethical spaces.
Research data were gathered through the application of a
validated questionaire and have been analyzed by
descriptive and inferential Statistics using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). According to the
main findings of the study, individual and cooperative
patterns of knowledge production arc fragmented from
each other. Knowledge production faces with challenges
associated with the lack of sustainable scientific communities
and, simultaneously, there are no significant statistical
correlations between the rate of scholars' knowledge
production and their individual and organizational normativeness.

Background and Objective
Pancreatic fistula is a common complication of distal pancreatectomy (DP). Although various surgical procedures have been proposed for DP in an attempt to decrease the high incidence of pancreatic fistula, the prevention of pancreatic fistula remains a major problem in DP. Endoscopic pancreatic stenting for the treatment or prophylaxis of such a fistula has been rarely described.
Methods

We reviewed 9 patients who underwent preoperative endoscopic pancreatic stenting for the prophylaxis of pancreatic fistula development after DP.
Results

Preoperative endoscopic pancreatic stenting was successfully performed with a 7F stent in all the 9 patients. Two patients, both with intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, developed mild acute pancreatitis after the stent placement. None of the 9 patients developed pancreatic fistula. The pancreatic stent was removed from 8 to 28 days (mean 11 days) postoperatively.
Conclusions

Preoperative endoscopic pancreatic stenting may be an effective prophylactic measure against pancreatic fistula development following DP in selected patients.

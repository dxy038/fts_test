Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we measured friction between an AFM tip and a polystyrene surface at 25 Â°C, as a function of the sliding velocity and the applied normal load, both in air and under vacuum conditions. The objective was to analyze the influence of humidity on the frictional behavior of polystyrene. Our experimental results as a function of sliding velocity revealed a logarithmic increase of the friction force in air whereas a logarithmic decrease of this force is found in vacuum. Our comparative results unveil that two different dissipation mechanisms are dominating the frictional behavior of polystyrene in air and in vacuum. We propose a tentative explanation.

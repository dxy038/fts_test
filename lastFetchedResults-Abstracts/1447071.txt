Background and Objective: Hypothyroidism is a known consequence of the external beam
radiotherapy to the neck encompassing the thyroid gland for over 40 years. The aim of this study
was to find out the incidence of hypothyroidism in patients with head and neck cancer treated with
radiotherapy, when radiation portals included whole of the thyroid gland.
Materials and Methods: This prospective non-randomized study was conducted from December
2004 to February 2006. In this regard, 39 patients with head and neck malignancies referred to
radiation oncology center of Hamedan whom treated with the external beam radiotherapy, whose
radiation portals included the whole of the thyroid gland. Thyroid function tests were done at the
beginning of treatment, one month, three months, six months, and one year after the completion of
radiotherapy.
Results: Out of 39 patients, two were excluded from the study as they had history of hypothyroid
before the initiation of treatment. The next two were excluded from data analysis because they did
not undergo regular follow-up. Of the patients attending the follow-up clinic, 31% were found to
have sub-clinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 4.5 mU/l) during a year.
Conclusion: Since a significant number of patients developed hypothyroidism following
radiotherapy on the neck, thyroid function tests should be included in the routine follow-up protocol
of such patients. Certain questions have emerged from this study, which need a large randomized
study to find out the answers.

Sharpness is one of the most determining factors in the perceptual assessment of image quality. Objective image sharpness measures may play important roles in the design and optimization of visual perception-based auto-focus systems and image enhancement, restoration and compression algorithms. Here we propose a new sharpness measure where sharpness is identified as strong local phase coherence evaluated in the complex wavelet transform domain. Our test using the LIVE blur database shows that the proposed algorithm correlates well with subjective quality evaluations. An additional advantage of our approach is that other image distortions such as compression, median filtering and noise contamination that may affect perceptual sharpness can also be detected.

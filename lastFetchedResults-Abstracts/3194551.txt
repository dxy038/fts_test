We present PipeInternet, a self-contained Information acquisition system based on integration of WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) for sensing and smartphone for monitoring. Using only the 3G module readily available in modern smartphones, we accurately profile the states of the remote pipeline by analyzing the data from sensor nodes and provide instructions without the need for additional infrastructure. We propose a redundant linear chain clustering multi-hop protocol (CCHop) for strengthening the transmission reliability, and a lightweight bidirectional time synchronization algorithm (LBSync) packed in ACK for calibrating work timeslot of node. Smartphones with android 2.2 as handy monitor and reduced smart nodes were designed to achieve an intelligent pipeline monitoring system. Field application and simulation results show the accuracy of gathering current pipeline data or alarm, and resuming program update from breakpoint by air in PipeInternet.

This paper describes an intelligent agent to facilitate bi-text mining from the Web via automatic discovery of URL pairing patterns (or keys) for retrieving parallel Web pages. The linking power of a key, defined as the number of URL pairs that it can match, is used as the objective function for the search for the best set of keys that can find the greatest number of Web page pairs within a bilingual Web site. Our experiments show that, with no prior knowledge such as ad hoc heuristics, no labelled data for training and no similarity analysis of Web page structure and content that are commonly involved in the existing approaches, a best-first search to approximate this optimization with an empirical threshold can recognize 98.1% true parallel Web pages and discover many irregular pairing patterns that are unlikely to be discovered by other approaches.

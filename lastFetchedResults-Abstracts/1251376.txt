The presented study is concerned with computationally efficient methods for solving stochastic optimization problems involving multiple equally probable realizations of uncertain parameters. A new and straightforward technique is introduced that is based on dynamically ordering the stack of realizations during the search procedure. The rationale is that a small number of critical realizations govern the output of a reliability-based objective function. By utilizing a problem, which is typical to designing a water supply well field, several variants of this “stack ordering” approach are tested. The results are statistically assessed, in terms of optimality and nominal reliability. This study demonstrates that the simple ordering of a given number of 500 realizations while applying an evolutionary search algorithm can save about half of the model runs without compromising the optimization procedure. More advanced variants of stack ordering can, if properly configured, save up to more than 97% of the computational effort that would be required if the entire number of realizations were considered. The findings herein are promising for similar problems of water management and reliability-based design in general, and particularly for non-convex problems that require heuristic search techniques.

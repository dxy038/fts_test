In this study synthesis of nicotinoyl hydrazone derivatives is investigated by introducing the nico-tinic acid hydrazide pharmacophore into several molecules and screening for antimycobacterial activity. Benzaldehyde derivatives react with nicotinic acid hydrazide to form nicotinoyl hydra-zones. The synthesized compounds were screened against M. tuberculosis H37Rv, clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and MDR clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis using the proportion test. The mini-mum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of N'-(4-methylphenyl) nicotinic acid hydrazone and N'-(4-(N,N-dimethyl)phenyl) nicotinic acid hydrazone exhibited activity between 40 and 200 ?g/mL and could be a good start point to find new lead compounds against M. tuberculosis.

Objective
To document the population-based incidence of sexual assault in Baltimore, Md, victims' alcohol/drug use, and pre-event circumstances.
Methods
Between 1997 and 1999, the city's sexual assault treatment center treated 1,038 victims (age â‰¥ 13 years). Data were extracted from forensic narratives. Analysis was restricted to frequency tables and bar graphs. Incidence was calculated based on 1998 population figures.
Results
The incidence of sexual assault among females aged 13 years or older was 117 per 100 000. Seventy percent of patients were less than 30 years old. Fifty-three percent tested positive for alcohol/drugs. Two thirds sustained physical or genital injury; 30% sustained both. The most common pre-event circumstances were walking/being followed (27%) and visiting a friend's home (24%).
Conclusion
This study revealed a high prevalence of physical/genital injury, supporting the call for an injury severity scale for sexual assault and for increased substance abuse counseling and educational/health resources to mitigate sexual assault and offer meaningful response when such crimes occur.

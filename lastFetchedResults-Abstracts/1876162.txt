Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the development and testing of a videotape intervention for sexual counseling after myocardial infarction (MI). Intervention: A videotape was developed as a research intervention for sexual counseling after MI. The concepts of sexual integrity, quality of life, and stress and coping were key concepts underpinning the intervention. This article describes the development of the videotape and its content, including considerations for planning, testing, and producing a videotape for research. The videotape intervention is currently being used in a study of patients with MI who are pretested while hospitalized and posttested at 1, 3, and 5 months after MI. Subjects in the treatment group receive the videotape to view in the privacy of their home. Control subjects receive the videotape after the 5-month follow-up period. All subjects receive the usual written and verbal instructions while hospitalized. Outcome Measures: The 5 outcome variables tested in the study with the videotape are quality of life, knowledge, anxiety, sexual satisfaction, and return to sexual activity. Conclusion: The use of a videotape intervention in the home setting provides an additional method of patient education. This approach appears ideal for this sensitive topic.

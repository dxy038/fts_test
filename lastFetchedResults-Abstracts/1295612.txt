The dial-a-ride problem (DARP) is a widely studied theoretical challenge related to dispatching vehicles in demand-responsive transport services, in which customers contact a vehicle operator requesting to be carried from specified origins to specified destinations. An important subproblem arising in dynamic dial-a-ride services can be identified as the single-vehicle DARP, in which the goal is to determine the optimal route for a single vehicle with respect to a generalized objective function. The main result of this work is an adaptive insertion algorithm capable of producing optimal solutions for a time constrained version of this problem, which was first studied by Psaraftis in the early 1980s. The complexity of the algorithm is analyzed and evaluated by means of computational experiments, implying that a significant advantage of the proposed method can be identified as the possibility of controlling computational work smoothly, making the algorithm applicable to any problem size.

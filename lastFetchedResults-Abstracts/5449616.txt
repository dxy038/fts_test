A new approximate algorithm has been developed by Wu et al. for solving fuzzy multiple objective linear programming (FMOLP) problems with fuzzy parameters in any form of membership function in both objective functions and constraints. Based on the approximate algorithm, a fuzzy multiple objective decision support system (FMODSS) is developed. We focus on the description of use for FMODSS in detail, and an example is presented for demonstrating how to solve a FMOLP problem by the FMODSS.

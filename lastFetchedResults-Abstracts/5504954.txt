The algorithm has several characteristics: high objective and subjective quality, including more than 20 dB SNR; little time delay caused by filtering and coding, because of the new decomposing subband structure of the SBC, which has been carried out with the help of a group of special IIR filters, and the coding method in which input signals are handled vector by vector instead of frame by frame; good quality shown in recovered speech in high frequency bands because of the development of a fast search VQ technique. The latter two advantages guarantee the realization of this new codex in real time with the powerful digital signal processor TMS320C25

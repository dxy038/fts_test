The objective of the paper is to automate generation of high-resolution Dispersion Nomografs for CT Analyst and to add the capability of generating the Nomografs using only high-end commodity hardware. CT-Analyst provides near-instantaneous urban plume prediction with unprecedented accuracy and ease of use. It has additional important features like backtrack from contamination reports and sensor readings to unknown, upwind source locations. These capabilities arise from using Dispersion Nomografs that are precomputed from detailed high-resolution three dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations.

Objective: To report the existence of cases of mycetoma in our setup so that treatment can be specified.Material and Methods: Clinically suspected mycetoma cases from January 1998 to December 2002 were analysed by various stains to differentiate between actinomycetes and eumycetoma.Results: In this study out of 12 cases, 6 (50%) were caused by actinomycetes, 5 (41.7%) were caused by fungii and one case was chromomycosis. The mean age was 52.5 years with a slight male preponderance.Conclusion: Mycetoma must be distinguished from chronic granulomatous disease and at the same time actinomycetes must be differentiated from eumycetoma as in all cases the treatment differs radically.

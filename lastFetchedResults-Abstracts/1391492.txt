The work describes the experimental implementation of a spatial vibration control strategy using multiple structural sensors distributed over the structure. The control strategy incorporates the spatially weighted vibration objective/performance function that needs to be minimised for achieving vibration control at certain spatial regions. Experiments have been undertaken which were focused on a rectangular panel structure with a number of accelerometers attached. An filtered-X least mean squared (FX-LMS)-based adaptive algorithm has been employed to achieve vibration control at spatial regions of interest by utilising a continuous spatial weighting function. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the spatial control strategy that can be used for controlling vibration at certain regions that are caused by tonal or broadband excitation.

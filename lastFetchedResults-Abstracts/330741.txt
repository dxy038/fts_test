Objective. The purpose of this study was to measure the polymerization shrinkage kinetics of four commercially available polymer-based temporary crown and bridge materials, including the effect of ambient temperature.

Methods. Three dimethacrylate-based materials and one monomethacrylate-based material were investigated. The polymerization shrinkage-strains were measured by using the Bonded-disk method with initial specimen temperature at both 23 and 37 °C, with values particularly noted at 5, 10, and 120 min after mixing. Five recordings were taken for each material. The progress of the setting reaction and its temperature-dependence were evaluated by the kinetic curves, and net shrinkage and total shrinkage (inclusive of expansion magnitude) of each material were compared by independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA.

Results. Most shrinkage occurred in the first 10 min after mixing although there was an early expansion especially with the monomethacylate in the first 5 min. At 120 min, the net shrinkage-strain at 23 and 37 °C of the materials used in this test ranged from 3.54 to 4.13%. The fastest setting dimethacrylate-based material and the monomethacrylate-based material showed higher shrinkage-strain than other materials. No significant differences of net shrinkage-strain were found between 23 and 37 °C, but higher shrinkage rates were measured at 37 °C than at 23 °C.

Significance. The Bonded-disk method is a suitable method for measuring temperature-dependence of shrinkage-strain of polymer-based temporary materials. The dimethacrylate-based materials are preferable to monomethacrylates for temporary restoration as judged by the magnitude of polymerization shrinkage-strain, the majority of which is apparent within 10 min from the start of mixing and may affect the clinical outcome.

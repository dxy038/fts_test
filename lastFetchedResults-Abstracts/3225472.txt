This paper is concerned with the problem of robust optimization method for coupling parametrization design of space observation system. The objective is to develop an robust optimization framework to design space observation system. An improved robust collaborative optimization (IRCO) method for complex system design using the hybrid optimization algorithm is developed, which associates genetic algorithm (GA) with tabu search (TS). The proposed method can avoid unsolvability or converging difficulty and handle uncertainty within and across disciplines more efficiently and reasonably. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.

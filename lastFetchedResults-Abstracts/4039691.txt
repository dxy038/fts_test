A new bidirectional dc-dc converter composed of two class-E resonant converters is presented in this paper. Bidirectional power flow is controlled by transistor control pulse frequency changes, with a constant break between the succeeding pulses as in quasi-resonant converters. The boost or buck mode converter operation depends on the mutual relation between the control pulses of the transistor pairs which are located diagonally in the converter bridge. The advantages of the system involve are high operation frequency (200 and 450 kHz) and zero value of the transistor switching losses. This paper includes an analytical description that is useful for the converter design. The investigations are confirmed by PSpice simulations and an experiment of a laboratory model (1.6 kW).

Objective
This study was undertaken to assess student performance and satisfaction as a preclinical obstetrics and gynecology course changed from a didactic to a problem-based format.
Study design
We prospectively compared examination scores and course evaluations given to 162 second-year medical students over 4 years: 2 years before and 2 years after the curricular change, to assess student performance and satisfaction with learning. We used analysis of variance for the analysis of student performance and likelihood-ratio test for analysis of student satisfaction.
Results
Mean examination scores increased from 79.1% to 84% after implementation of the problem-based curriculum (P< .0001). The data showed statistically significant improvement in satisfaction with course content, learning objectives, learning resources, instructional methods, and course examinations.
Conclusion
Students' satisfaction and performance in a preclinical obstetrics and gynecology course improved significantly when problem-based learning methods were introduced.

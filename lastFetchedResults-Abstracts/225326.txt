The role of the inverter-side filter used in the dynamic
voltage restorer (DVR) is examined. Using circuit analysis method,
it is shown that the selection of the filter parameters can affect the
DVR inverter rating. Furthermore, with the DVR filter-series injection
transformer combination, the loading effect of the filter on
the restorer and the primary supply system has been quantified
under normal as well as voltage sag conditions. A systematic filter
design method is then proposed, the primary objective of which is
to achieve specific harmonic performance while ensuring that the
DVR inverter rating and the loading effect are minimized. Illustrative
examples are also included.

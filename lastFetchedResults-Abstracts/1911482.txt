Gender, race, income level, and socioeconomic status (SES) are factors in the decision to diagnose and treat patients with localized and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These variables affect both health care delivery at the provider level as well as health care receipt and decision-making at the patient level. The purpose of this article is to review current literature regarding the role of socioeconomic status and patient demographics on the risk of developing, diagnosing, and treating RCC. The article will also address RCC-related treatment costs and reimbursements.

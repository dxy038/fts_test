The objective was to develop a three-dimensional coupled fluid-structure computational model of the aortic valve and root. The long-term goal is to develop a framework for quantitative noninvasive evaluation, and design of new therapeutic treatment options for aortic valve and root disease. A 3-D geometric model was developed based on MR images of normal human valves, including normal variations in collagen fiber orientation and leaflet thickness. The aortic root and leaflets were modeled with linear elastic material properties. A dynamic analysis was performed using the LS-DYNA explicit finite element package. A complete opening/closing cycle of the aortic valve was successfully simulated. Leaflet motion was consistent with that seen in intact hearts. Thus, we have developed the most advanced 3-D coupled fluid-structure finite element model of the aortic valve and root to date. Our ultimate goal is to apply such models to evaluate disease severity, determine optimal timing for intervention, and guide surgical techniques.

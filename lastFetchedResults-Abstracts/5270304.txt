This paper reports the modeling and simulation aspects of a peak current controlled power-factor-correction converter (PFC), which is widely used in switch-mode power supply applications. The main objective is to show the real behavior of this converter operating under specific conditions. Firstly, a numerical simulation based on a discrete model is used. Analysis of this model shows that chaos and bifurcations may occur along with the changing values of some system parameters. Secondly, a Power System Blockset (PSB) model using Simulink/Matlab is designed and simulation results are compared to those obtained from numerical simulation.

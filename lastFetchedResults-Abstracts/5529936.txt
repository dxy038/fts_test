In this paper, we consider the real-time implementation of recursive digital signal processing algorithms on an application-specific multiprocessor system. The objective is to devise a periodic schedule, and a fully static task assignment scheme to meet the desired throughput rate while minimizing the number of processors. Toward this goal, we propose a notion called cutoff time. We prove that the optimal periodic schedule can be found within a finite time interval bounded by the cutoff time. As such the complexity of the scheduling algorithm and the allocation algorithm can be significantly reduced

A robust algorithm for source decoding of MPEG-2 video bitstreams not entirely free of transmission errors is presented. The proposed scheme does not assume any side information from a channel decoder to assist the detection and localization of errors, i.e. it only refers to the video bitstream. Different methods are used to act on errors detected during decoding of the block and macroblock layer, to localize corrupted image regions and to replace them by error concealment are described. They are compared by objective and subjective results of decoder simulations. Furthermore, the steps necessary for robust synchronization at the slice layer and for a reliable evaluation of higher layer headers and extensions are explained

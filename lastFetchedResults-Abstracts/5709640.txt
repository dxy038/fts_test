COCOMs and G/RSSCs need the ability to rapidly, accurately, and conveniently perform mobile user objective system (MUOS) communications usage planning and to determine if a particular allocation is sufficient so as to, if necessary, negotiate an adjusted apportionment. This paper discusses the design goals of a stand-alone MUOS communication planning application that satisfies these planning objectives by executing an approach that exploits commercial-off-the-shelf 3G expertise and methods, but is tailored to the unique MUOS system constraints and requirements. The presented design rapidly determines the assignment of UHF WCDMA carrier frequencies across a set of 64 MUOS beams and provides a high-confidence level estimate of the achievable throughput for each priority (e.g., assured vs. best-effort) based on an offered traffic loading scenario.

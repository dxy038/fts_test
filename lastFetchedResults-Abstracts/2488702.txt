This paper describes a methodology to develop the interface between a nite
element software and optimization algorithm for optimization of concrete high arch dams.
The objective function is the volume of the dam. The numbers of design variables are
31 including the thickness and upstream prole of crown cantilever, thickness of the left
and right abutments, radius of curvature of water and air faces left and right by use
of polynomial curve tting and cubic spline function. The constraint conditions are the
geometric shape, stress, and the stability against sliding. Initially, a program is developed
in MATLAB in order to generate the coordinates of nodes; then, nite element software
ANSYS is taken for modeling the geometry of dam. Finally, the optimization technique is
performed by Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation algorithm. To include
dead weight of dam body, stage construction is considered. The proposed method is applied
successfully to an arch dam and good results are achieved. The results indicate that the
concrete volume of the optimized dam is reduced by an average of 21%. Compared with
the initial shape, the time of convergence in this method is very short and the method is
fairly eective. It can be applied to practical engineering design.

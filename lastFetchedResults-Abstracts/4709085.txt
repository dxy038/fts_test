This paper presents a novel shape optimal design method for the design of electromagnetic devices. The method combines the shape design sensitivity, boundary element method and the steepest descent algorithm. The shape design sensitivity formula, the total derivative of the objective function with respect to the design variable, is derived by using the implicit differentiation method and the direct 2-D/3-D boundary element method. The shape design sensitivity is used as the gradient of the objective function in the steepest descent algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the optimum shape design of tie electrostatic/magnetostatic devices in 2-D and 3-D. It is shown, through the numerical examples, that the optimum shapes are easily found with a reasonable number of iterations by the proposed method

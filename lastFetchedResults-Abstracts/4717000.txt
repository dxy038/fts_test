There is no method for providing bidirectional traffic and travel information (TTI) based on Internet Protocol (IP) to special interest group in safety using terrestrial-digital multimedia broadcasting (T-DMB). In order to solve this problem, we propose a new TPEG application protocol based on IPv6 interoperable with TPEG protocol, and introduce the TTI data server and the bidirectional TTI contents server. The receiving platform based on laptop computer is connected to T-DMB receiver and CDMA modem simultaneously, and it includes TPEG-IPv6 processing module complied with the proposed application protocol. The stability and effectiveness of the proposed TPEG-IPv6 application protocol is verified through the field test.

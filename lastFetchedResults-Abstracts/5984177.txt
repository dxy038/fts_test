The objective of the paper is to present a novel approach to detect and localize various electric power quality disturbances using wavelet transform analysis. Unlike other approaches where the detection is performed directly in the time domain, detection using wavelet transform analysis approach is carried out in the time-scale domain. As far as detection in power quality disturbance is concerned, one- or two-scale signal decomposition is adequate to discriminate disturbances from their background. This approach is robust in detecting and localizing a wide range of power disturbances such as fast voltage fluctuations, short and long duration voltage variations, and harmonic distortion

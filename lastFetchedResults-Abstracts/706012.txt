 A study of two years was carried out on apples, red delicious CV in Comeh of Semirom region. The objective of this research was to assess the effect of preharvest calcium phosphate(Senophus) spraying and summer pruning on the skin color and quality characteristics of the fruit. Study was carried  out using a complete randomized block design with 3 replications. Trees were subjected to  preharvest spraying of  0.8,1% and 1.2% senophus(calcium phosphate) and pruning on 6 and 21 of august. A control test also was carried out. Each block contained 3 trees. 15 kilo of fruit were harvested randomly from each block. Firmness, skin color, acidity, TSS, overall acceptability, bitter rot, rotting and farinaceous texture of fruit were assessed after 2 and 4 month storage at 4 ?c and 95% of humidity. Anova test based on 2 year study data indicated significant effect of applied treatments(?=1%) on all studied parameters. Skin redness increased significantly comparing to the control sample. The highest redness was observed in the 1.2% senophus spraying treatment. After 2 months of storage, firmness farinaceous texture, bitter rot and overall acceptability of fruit in senophus and summer pruning treatments changed significantly comparing to those of control sample. After 4 months of storage, there was significant difference between 1.2% senophus treatment and other treatments including the control in view point of firmness, rotting, farinaceous texture and bitter rot of the fruit. The acceptable firmness and overall acceptability were obtained by using 1% and 1.2% senophus spraying treatments.

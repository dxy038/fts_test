As the wireless systems move to third-generation (3G) and beyond, the research on joint optimization of resource allocation for the integrated multimedia teletraffic is becoming pressing. This paper aims to set up a framework for joint resource allocation in the forward link of a multi-cell wireless multimedia system. The approach we take is based on the notion of utility. That is, each user, or each class of users, is assumed to have a utility function that describes the userÂ´s monetary satisfaction, namely utility, as a function of received quality of service (QoS). We concentrate on revenue maximization, namely, the objective is to maximize the total profit generated by selling the resource to users. In addition to their scientific merit, the results are of high value to manufacturers of cellular infrastructures and network operators alike. We characterize the optimal prices and the optimal resource partition between voice and data services for an individual cell with limited power or rate. Two-cell revenue maximization has been investigated. With limited power, not all power needs to be used when the revenue is maximized.

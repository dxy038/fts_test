Summary form only given. Two-photon fluorescence and second harmonics are used to image subsurface structures of highly scattering biological tissues. Ultrashort laser pulses in the near-infrared spectra region were reflected by a dichroic beam splitter and then focused into tissue samples by an objective lens to generate a nonlinear optical signal. The generated nonlinear optical signal were collected by the same objective lens and passed through the bean splitter to a photomultiplier tube for detection.

Objective: The organotypic co-culture is a well-known technique to examine cellular
interactions and their roles in stem cell proliferation and differentiation. This study
aims to evaluate the effects of dermal fibroblasts (DFs) on epidermal differentiation
of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) using a three-dimensional (3D) organotypic coculture
technique.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental research study, rat DFs and ASCs were
isolated and cultured separately on electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) matrices.
The PCL matrices seeded by ASCs were superimposed on to the matrices seeded
by DFs in order to create a 3D organotypic co-culture. In the control groups, PCL
matrices seeded by ASCs were placed on matrices devoid of DFs. After 10 days, we
assessed the expressions of keratinocyte-related genes by real-time reverse transcriptase-
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and expression of pan-cytokeratin
protein by immunofluorescence in the differentiated keratinocyte-like cells from coculture
and control groups. Keratinocyte-like cell morphologies were also observed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Results: The early, intermediate, and terminal differentiation keratinocyte markers-Cytokeratin14,
Filaggrin, and Involucrin significantly expressed in the co-culture groups compared
to the control ones (P < 0.05). We observed pan-cytokeratin in keratinocyte-like cells
of both groups by immunofluorescence. SEM observation of the co-culture groups showed
that the differentiated keratinocyte-like cells developed a polygonal cobblestone shape,
considered characteristic of keratinocytes.
Conclusion: The 3D organotypic co-culture bilayered construct that consisted of DFs and
ASCs was an effective technique for epidermal differentiation of ASCs. This co-culture
might be useful for epidermal differentiation of stem cells for future applications in skin
regeneration.

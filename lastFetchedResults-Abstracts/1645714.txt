Inroduction & Objective:  The different researches have been done to prevent population. Ricinus communis has different properties. This study analyzes the effects of preventing castor's generating.
Material and Methods: 21 male mice from NMRI species approximately weighing 20-30 gr classified into one control group and two experimental groups. Within 30 days, the experimental groups injected as 35 and 45mg/kg body weight by castor's hydro alcoholic extract and normal saline injected to the control group. 10 days after the mice were last injected, samples taken from their blood and generating organs.The serums transmitted into laboratory for the hormones assessments and some 5 micron transversal cuts taken from their testicles, next they were painted and spermcellular classification counted. The sperm maker's diameter pipes and the germinal layer measured by 10X lens and the cells counted by100X lens. All the data were done by ANOVA statistical method and Tukey test with the p? 0.05 meaningful level.
Results: A meaningful decrease observed in seminiferous tubules diameter pipes in the 45 mg/kg concentration,germinal diameter layer in experimental groups and the number of spermatogony, primary spermatocyte, sperm and leydig in experimental groups in comparison to control group(0.05 > p). The percentage of the moving sperms, the percentage of the sperm's genetic substance and the sperms' morphology demonstrated a meaningful reduction in experimental groups and the hormones assesments.

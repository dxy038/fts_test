A very common and typical problem faced by many big companies i.e. executing multiple projects at the same time. They have a huge pool of similarly skilled human resource (experts) which needs to be allocated to different projects with different payment rates. To allocate these resources to different projects such that there is not too much variation in their average compensation over a period of time means they get an equitable pay. The above problem is considered to be hard and no polynomial-time algorithm exists to solve this optimally. This paper concerns the development of innovative approach to solve the equitable payment distribution problem. The simple and foremost solution in adoption is round robin approach. This approach has a set of limitations. The problems which are constrained with equitable distribution objective finds round robin approach a non-suitable approach. For such problems to be solved optimally needs a novel approach to the equitable payment distribution. In this paper a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based novel approach has been proposed to find the optimal solution for the equitable payment distribution.

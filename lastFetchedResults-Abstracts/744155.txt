Objective
To evaluate the rapid ventricular pacing in balloon aortic valvuloplasty to achieve balloon stability.
Material and methods

From September 2004 to July 2005, a prospective protocol was carried out: ten patients with aortic valve stenosis were treated with this method. Patient's age ranged from 3 to 16 years with mean age of 10.2 ± 4.3 years. In all cases a bipolar pacing catheter was placed in the right ventricle. Rapid ventricular pacing was initiated at the rate of 150 per minute and was gradually increased to achieve a 50% drop in systemic pressure. The balloon was inflated only after the pacing rate was reached and the blood pressure dropped. Pacing was continued until the balloon was completely deflated.
Results

The systolic gradients across the aortic valve before balloon dilatation ranged from 40 to 110 mm Hg, mean 68.5 ± 20 mm Hg. The pacing rate required to drop the pressure by 50% ranged from 170 to 250 per minute, mean 209 ± 25. Balloon stability at time of inflation was achieved in all cases with no balloon movement. The post ballooning gradients ranged from 5 to 28 mm Hg, mean 19.7 ± 8.3 mm Hg (p < 0.001). In all cases there was no change in aortograms, performed before and after balloon dilatation in aorta, except in one patient who developed grade I aortic regurgitation.
Conclusions

Rapid ventricular pacing appears to be an effective and a safe procedure to stabilize the balloon during balloon aortic valvuloplasty and is thought to decrease the incidence of aortic insufficiency.

Short-term flicker severity ( ) is an important
electric power quality index defined by the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC). results from the statistical
evaluation of flicker over short periods of time producing an
objective measure for flicker originating from various types of
sources. This paper reviews previous methods for computing
and proposes a new iterative algorithm. The algorithm is
computationally efficient and shown to comply with the IEC
standard.

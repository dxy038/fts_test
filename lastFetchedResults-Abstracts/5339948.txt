The performance of a generic pedestrian detector may drop significantly when it is applied to a specific scene due to mismatch between the source dataset used to train the detector and samples in the target scene. In this paper, we investigate how to automatically train a scene-specific pedestrian detector starting with a generic detector in video surveillance without further manually labeling any samples under a novel transfer learning framework. It tackles the problem from three aspects. (1) With a graphical representation and through exploring the indegrees from target samples to source samples, the source samples are properly re-weighted. The indegrees detect the boundary between the distributions of the source dataset and the target dataset. The re-weighted source dataset better matches the target scene. (2) It takes the context information from motions, scene structures and scene geometry as the confidence scores of samples from the target scene to guide transfer learning. (3) The confidence scores propagate among samples on a graph according to the underlying visual structures of samples. All these considerations are formulated under a single objective function called Confidence-Encoded SVM. At the test stage, only the appearance-based detector is used without the context cues. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through experiments on two video surveillance datasets. Compared with a generic pedestrian detector, it significantly improves the detection rate by 48% and 36% at one false positive per image on the two datasets respectively.

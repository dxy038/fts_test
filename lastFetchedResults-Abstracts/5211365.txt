With the rapid development of social economy, the society water consumption has increased dramatically which also lead to sharp contradiction between supply and demand, so how to allocate limited water resources reasonable has become a reality and urgent task of water management. With the author further studying the reservoir regulation theory and mechanism, the deterministic optimization is developed based on multi-objective optimizing reservoir scheduling model, using nonlinear programming as optimization algorithm for constructing the universal optimizing reservoir scheduling model. And based on multi-objective thought, it has produced a set of Pareto frontier solution set, through the temple, the application of EPing hydropower station get a series of decision-making plan, so that policymakers can choose the preference for decision-making plan.

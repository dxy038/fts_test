This paper proposes a fuzzy logic based algorithm which decides the best telescope, within a heterogeneous network, taking into account user constraints, weather forecast, visibility and statistical information from every telescope. The main objective of this algorithm is to serve the maximum number of observations as soon as possible, minimizing the reallocation process and improving the selection one. Moreover, this algorithm has been deployed into the GLORIA robotic telescope network, which is composed by 17 heterogeneous telescopes located in different countries, and also, it has been tested using an interface deployed into the GLORIA user website which has been tested by real users. Finally, using this information, a comparison between this algorithm and the previous one, is analyzed.

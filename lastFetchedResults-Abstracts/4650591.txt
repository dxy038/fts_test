In this paper, iDANS, which is a location based information dissemination platform for smartphones composing a vehicular ad-hoc network, is proposed and evaluated. The primary objective of iDANS is to disseminate and share information swiftly between vehicles within a designated area. In order to meet the demands, iDANS disseminates the information which is most relevant to the current location on a priority basis. It also makes use of devices that cannot acquire the current location accurately as relay nodes. The technical feasibility of iDANS was verified on iPhones, and simulations were done in order to verify the effectiveness of the platform. As a result of the simulations, it was verified that iDANS was up to 5.5 times more effective compared to random dissemination, in terms of disseminating more information among vehicles within a designated area.

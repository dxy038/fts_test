Introduction
 and persons facing social and economic disadvantage, are at greater risk for depressive disorders. Our objective was to describe the explanatory models of illness in depressed women, in particular, their idioms of distress, and their views of their social circumstances and how this related to their illness.

ried out a qualitative investigation nested in a population based cohort study of women's mental and reproductive health in Goa, India. We purposively sampled women who were ever-married and who had been found to be suffering from a depressive disorder on the basis of a structured diagnostic interview. In-depth interviews were carried out about six months apart exploring stressors in women's lives, a typical day in their recent lives, and their illness narratives (idioms of distress, causal models, impact of illness, help-seeking).
s
en consented to participate in the study, 28 completing both interviews. Women gave expression to their problems primarily through somatic complaints, typically a variety of body aches, autonomic symptoms, gynecological symptoms and sleep problems. There was frequent mention of overall “weakness” and tiredness. Economic difficulties and difficulties with interpersonal relationships (particularly related to marital relationships) were the most common causal models. However, women rarely considered biomedical concepts, for example, the notion that they may suffer from an illness or that their complaints were due to a biochemical disturbance in the brain. Despite the lack of a biomedical concept, most of the participants had sought medical help, typically for reproductive and somatic complaints.

ommend the use of somatic idioms as the defining clinical features, and a broader, psychosocial model for understanding the aetiology and conceptualization of the clinical syndrome of depression for public health interventions and mental health promotion in the Indian context.

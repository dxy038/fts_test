Objectives
The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between Chlamydia pneumoniae seropositivity and aortic atherosclerotic plaques in the general population.
Background

Seroepidemiologic studies suggest that C pneumoniae infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Methods

Transesophageal echocardiography was performed in 385 subjects (median age 66 years, range 51 to 101 years; 53% men), a sample of the Olmsted County (Minnesota) population. The association between C pneumoniae immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody titers and aortic atherosclerotic plaques was examined.
Results

Chlamydia pneumoniae IgG antibodies (titers ≥1:16) were detected in 287 subjects (74.5%): low titers (1:16 to 1:32) in 58 (15.1%), intermediate titers (1:64 to 1:128) in 144 (37.4%), and high titers (≥1:256) in 85 subjects (22.1%). Antibody titers were not associated with the presence of aortic plaques after adjustment for age, gender, and smoking status (p = 0.64). Compared with titers <1:16, the adjusted odds ratios for aortic plaques were 1.46 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 to 3.42) for low titers, 1.32 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.55) for intermediate titers, and 0.94 (95% CI 0.42 to 2.07) for high titers. Among the subgroup with plaques, antibody titers were not associated with the presence of plaques ≥4 mm thick (p = 0.99), plaques ≥6 mm (p = 0.49), or mobile debris (p = 0.71), after adjustment for age and smoking.
Conclusions

Chlamydia pneumoniae IgG antibody titers are not associated with the presence or severity of aortic atherosclerosis in the general population. These observations do not support a role for C pneumoniae infection in the initiation or progression of atherosclerosis.

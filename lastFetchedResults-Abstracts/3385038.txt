This paper studies optimal tracking and regulation control problems, in which objective functions of tracking error and regulated response, defined by integral square measures, are to be minimized jointly with the control effort, where the latter is measured by the plant input energy. Our primary objective in this work is to search for fundamental design limitations beyond those known to be imposed by nonminimum phase zeros, unstable poles, and time delays. For this purpose, we solve the problems explicitly by deriving analytical expressions for the best achievable performance. It is found that this performance limit depends not only on the plant nonminimum phase zeros, time delays, and unstable poles-a fact known previously-but also on the plant gain in the entire frequency range. The results thus reveal and quantify another source of fundamental performance limitations beyond those already known, which are nonexistent when only conventional performance objectives such as tracking and regulation are addressed without taking into account the control energy constraint. Among other things, they exhibit how the lightly damped poles, the anti-resonant zeros, as well as the bandwidth of the plant may affect the performance.

We study the joint reliability importance (JRI) of two components in Lin/m/Con/k/n:F systems. A Lin/m/Con/k/n:F system consists of n linearly ordered binary components, and the system fails iff there are at least m nonoverlapping runs of k consecutive failed components (n &#8805; mk). In particular, we obtain expressions for the JRI in Lin/m/Con/k/n:F systems when the components are s-independent &amp; identical, when the components are s-independent &amp; nonidentical, and when the components are exchangeable &amp; s-dependent. We present extensive numerical illustrations.

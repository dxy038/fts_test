This paper uses comparative research ways to study design methods, procedure and ideas of two-dimensional manual sketch and three-dimensional model design. Using computer methods of calling Rhinoceros<sup>&#194;&#174;</sup> software to carry on concept design, and calling Cinema 4D<sup>&#194;&#174;</sup> software to render static and dynamic design. It discovered three-dimensional model design had characteristics of linear distribution, sequence. It promulgates product design by three-dimensional model has principles of hypothesized, cycling, and crossover. The result indicates three-dimensional model design can also substitute for two-dimensional sketch in concept design stage, transforms hypothesized object to objective reality quickly, innovates structure of product design procedure.

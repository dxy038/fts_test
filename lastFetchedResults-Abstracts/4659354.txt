Migration of individuals among islands is effective in many cases in distributed parallel processing of the evolutionary computation. However, the effectiveness of migration depends on many factors such as migration frequency, migration topologies, migration scale, timing, and so on. The objective of our research is to investigate such factors for designing efficient parallel evolutionary computation. In this paper we analyzes the migration effects of the tree based island model in parallel genetic algorithms and parallel PBIL (Population Based Incremental Learning). Computational experiment shows us migration effects of the parallel evolutionary computation and influence of the migration topology and frequency.

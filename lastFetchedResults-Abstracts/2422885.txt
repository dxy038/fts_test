Electrical performance of the hybrid photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collector may improved at increased intensity of solar radiation if the system is set to extract heat from solar cells, which is cooled at the same time. The objective of this work is to study theoretically and experimentally a new configuration of the PVT system which extracts heat from the photovoltaic module. This configuration is tube and sheet integrated into a prototype and tested at the unit of applied research in renewable energy Gharda√Øa in the south of Algeria. The advantages of this hybrid collector are better heat absorption and lower production cost compared to other configurations of hybrids collectors.

The second-generation experiment is a large-scale empirical study of the development and operation of multiversion software systems that has engaged researchers at five universities and three research institutes. The authors present the history and current status of this experiment. The primary objective for the second generation experiments is an examination of multiple-version reliability improvement. Experimentation concerns have been focused on the development of multiversion software (MVS) systems, primarily design and testing issues, and the modeling and analysis of these systems. A preliminary analysis of the multiple software versions has been performed and is reported.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

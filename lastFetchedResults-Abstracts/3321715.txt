A pole-placement approach that matches identification and control objectives is proposed. The poles of the desired closed-loop transfer function are first specified. Then, a minimum-variance type of objective is considered to determine both the open-loop model and the controller. The resulting optimization problem is highly nonlinear, but it can be implemented as a sequence of three linear least-squares problems.

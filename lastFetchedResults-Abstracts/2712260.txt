Purdue´s research and education in the field of remote sensing was built upon a strong foundation of expertise in engineering, science, and agriculture. The Laboratory for Agricultural Remote Sensing (LARS) was formed in 1966 with the objective of using an interdisciplinary, teamwork approach to creating and using space-based technology for observing and managing agricultural resources. Since the 1980s, LARS has focused primarily on research and education in development of algorithms for analysis of remotely sensed data and agricultural applications. In the past decade, research has also expanded to include processing and application of LIDAR data, atmospheric remote sensing, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and signals of opportunity (SoOP). Examples of today´s research, education, and outreach at Purdue are presented in this paper.

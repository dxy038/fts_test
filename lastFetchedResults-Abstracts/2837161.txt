In the last years, surveying large regions of the atmosphere in an automatic way, for early detection of pollutant sources in urban and industrial areas, has become a strategic objective of various public health organizations. The Lidar/Dial technique has become a well-established laser remote sensing method for atmosphere monitoring. It is often used to probe almost any level of the atmosphere and to acquire information necessary to validate theoretical models about different topics of atmospheric physics. It can also be deployed for environment surveying by monitoring particles, aerosols and molecules. For these reasons, an experimental campaign for evaluating the performances of a Lidar/Dial system in detecting pollutants (particulate and/or chemical compounds) has been carried out in an industrial area in the south of Italy. In this work, a homemade Lidar/Dial system (developed and built by the authors) and the results of the experimental campaign will be presented and discussed.

The paper presents an optimal many-to-one routing scheme based on distributed ant algorithm for sensor networks. The routing scheme can achieve the objective of MOP, which jointly optimizes over the energy cost for data communication and the utilization of network resource. Furthermore, by introducing the energy-awareness mechanism, the artificial ants can obtain the ability of being aware of the unbalanced energy distribution in sensor networks, and build up the high-level-energy paths to a base station. Therefore, the robustness of the many-to-one routing structure is improved, and finally the longevity of network is increased

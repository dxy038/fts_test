Investigates a novel type of applicator which the authors refer to as a quasi-leaky-wave structure. The main objective is to achieve the localised heating of deep seated tumours by invoking leaky-wave conditions in a travelling-wave structure. Clearly the presence of a lossy material will alter the leaky-wave action somewhat, hence the term `quasiÂ´ and the physical behaviour occurring is a particular point of interest in this investigation. This applicator has the advantage that only one generator is required but there is an opportunity to change the focal heating region by altering the frequency. The approach used is to develop a finite difference time domain (FD-TD) computer program in conjunction with electromagnetic field measurements and some approximate calculations

In this study, a two-step process was developed to produce biodiesel from Calophyllum inophyllum oil. Pre-treatment with phosphoric acid modified Î²-zeolite in acid catalyzed esterification process preceded by transesterification which was done using conventional alkali catalyst potassium hydroxide (KOH). The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the reaction temperatures, reaction time and methanol to oil molar ratio in the pre-treatment step. Central Composite Design (CCD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were utilized to determine the best operating condition for the pre-treatment step. Biodiesel produced by this process was tested for its fuel properties.

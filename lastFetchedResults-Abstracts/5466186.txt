The model of the multi-objective optimal allocation of water resources with government system of water rights is a bi-level programming model. The function of water trade price is difficult to determine, and some factors are interactive such as water price, coefficient of water-saving and objective function, whose relationships are rather complex, so that it is attractive to study the model solution. In this paper, the solution to the bi-level programming model of the optimal allocation of water resources is put forward, in which the upper-level programming is solved by genetic algorithm and the lower-level programming is solved by simplex method, the values about water trade price and coefficient of water-saving are assigned via random-points in a certain range. The results show that the solution is reasonable, and it has been made great progress in ideas and methods to solve this model.

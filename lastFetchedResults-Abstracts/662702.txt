The objective of this study is to find metal ions that enhance the ozone decomposition of chlorinated organic substances in acetic acid. Although the pseudo-first order degradation rate constant for 2,4-DCP by ozone in acetic acid in addition of Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+ and Fe2+ were almost the same as that with no metal ion, the degradation rate in addition of Mn2+ and Fe3+ were 2.4 and 4.5 times as high as that with no metal ion, respectively. The presence of Fe3+ enhanced the degradation of 2,4-DCP by ozone in acetic acid because Fe3+â€“phenolate complex which have high reactivity with ozone was produced by the reaction between 2,4-DCP and Fe3+ in acetic acid.

Massive distributed generations (DGs), e.g., the small hydropower stations, accessing to the regional power network would result in the shortage of inductive reactive power, which in turn would cause the high voltage issue. An inductive reactive power optimization configuration method towards the 10kV distribution network with DGs is proposed. The methodology was conducted with the minimum of the power loss and the minimum of the voltage deviation as its objectives, and the two objectives were computed by utilizing the multi-objective particle swarm algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions. Then the fuzzy decision-making approaches are used to get the compromise solution so as to determine the reactive power compensation capacity. An actual regional network is simulated through the Matlab software, and the compared simulation results certify that the proposed method not only has a good voltage regulation effect, but also has the economy superiority in terms of reducing the total amount of the inductive reactive power compensation.

Unlike traditional drilling methods which often reduce the permeability of the rocks drastically, drilling method using laser technology increases the permeability of the rock and ultimately increases well oil production. Rock drilling  using laser technology, is a process for removal of stones in which the thermal stress  is used to break the stone into smaller pieces and removing debris and small stones left are carried out  by the standard evacuation procedures. The rock laser drilling operation depends on wave laser parameters, beam characteristics and associated gas cleaning. The main objective of this article is studying pullsednd:yag laser technology strategy, in order to increase the penetration rate and rock drilling parameters that affect the use of lasers; also at the end of this article, the use of laser technology to reduce drilling costs, is presented.

This paper describes a development program aimed at improving processing speeds by providing data processing systems with random-access memories approaching the speed of ferrite-core matrix memories, but at a cost that economically permits of mass-memory capacities. Compatible system and fabrication techniques were devised to reach the low cost objective. The paper details the system and fabrication techniques, and in addition to demonstrating low memory cost, describes small power, weight, and size characteristics that might be important in special applications.

As part of the retooling of the Applied Energy Services (AES) Huntington Beach Generating Station (AES HBGS) in 2001, a near shore beach contamination investigation was required by the California Energy Commission (CEC). The CEC commissioned the study in July 2002 to specifically investigate the impact of the AES HBGS on recent ocean postings and closures. The objective of this study was to assess whether the operation of the AES HBGS was negatively impacting water quality in the surf zone in the vicinity of Huntington State and City Beaches.

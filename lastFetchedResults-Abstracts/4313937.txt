A non-intrusive objective speech quality and intelligibility measure tailored to hearing restoration instruments is proposed and evaluated in complex listening environments. The measure builds upon the previously-proposed &#8220;speech-to-reverberation modulation energy ratio&#8221; (SRMR) by incorporating hearing impairment percepts, such as hearing loss thresholds and altered modulation frequency selectivity. Performance is assessed using speech data corrupted by additive noise, reverberation, and noise-plus-reverberation which were subjectively rated by cochlear implant and hearing aid users. Experimental results show that the developed measures outperform the original SRMR metric for hearing impaired listeners and achieve performance levels inline with existing intrusive quality and intelligibility metrics, but with the advantage of not requiring access to a clean reference signal. As such, the measure may be used to develop qualityor intelligibility-aware speech enhancement algorithms for advanced hearing restoration instruments.

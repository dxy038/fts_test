Chronic  wounds  afflict  millions  worldwide,  incurring  significant health care costs and chronic suffering. Clinicians are often unsure about treatment, resulting in poor outcomes. Objective . To determine the scope of knowledge possessed by fifth-year medical students, general practitioners (GPs) and surgical regis-trars, concerning chronic wound management. Design . Cross-sectional study.Methods. Deans of eight South African medical schools received let -ters requesting information regarding time devoted to wound-care training. Knowledge-based questionnaires were distributed to final-year students at two universities, surgical registrars at four universi-ties and GPs attending refresher courses. Results . Four medical schools replied, of whom only two offered formal teaching. 162 medical students, 45 GPs and 47 surgical reg-istrars completed questionnaires. The overall median (25th  - 75th percentiles) knowledge scores for registrars, GPs and students were 65% (55 - 70%), 55% (45 - 65%) and 45% (35 - 50%) respectively.  Whereas the scores of registrars and GPs did not differ, the student scores were significantly less.  Only 32% of registrars and 18% of GPs attained scores of 70% or more.  96% considered training to be inadequate.  Interest in wound care was only mild to moderate, with more GPs than registrars requesting literature.  Conclusions . Very little, if any, training on chronic wounds is offered in South Africa. The levels of knowledge cannot be considered ad-equate for successful treatment, nor for teaching to undergraduates. This preliminary study cannot reflect the attitudes and knowledge throughout the country. However, it is clear that there is a need for improved education about these conditions that have huge clinical and economic consequences.

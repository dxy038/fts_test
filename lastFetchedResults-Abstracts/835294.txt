An experimental study has been conducted to know the structural behaviour of a representative test specimen for a typical Prestressed Concrete Inner Containment dome with due regards to the local behaviour at the steel plate–concrete interfaces at large steam generator openings, under initial condition at prestress transfer. The primary thrust of the work has been in the objective of predicting possibilities of separation at the steel–concrete interface zones adjacent to the embedded plates of the steam generator openings of the inner containment dome. Important observations in line with the desired objectives have been made based on the results of the experiment.

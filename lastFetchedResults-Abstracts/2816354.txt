In order to save the power and minimize the interference in the intelligent mobile wireless communication networks, the software defined radio (SDR) transceiver must be controlled to minimize the transmission power. In this paper, an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based cognitive power saving controller (CPSC) is designed to adapt the power assignment to the varying inter-cell interference power, bit error rate (BER), user speed and data rate of SDR transceiver in intelligent mobile wireless networks. The BER performance of the SDR transceiver is simulated to generate the training data for the CPSC. The objective of proposed controller is to minimize the transmit power, while maintaining the BER of SDR transceiver below 10<sup>-5</sup>.

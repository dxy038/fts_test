Background: Induction of ovulation in ART is necessary for superovulation and the
side effects of superovulatory drugs are debated. Oxytocin as a natural hormone, have
receptors and is synthesized by several reproductive organs. Preovulatory presence of
oxytocin receptor mRNAs in granulosa cells indicating a role for oxytocin in follicular
development.
Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of exogenous
oxytocin injection on folliculogenesis, ovulation and endometrial growth in mice.
Materials and Methods: Forty adult female mice were divided into two groups as
control and experimental. The mice at their sterous cycle received 1 IU/gr oxytocin, in
experimental, and the same volume of solvent in control groups. Half of the mice in
each group are sacrificed at 24 hours post injection and the other half, 48 hours after the
injection. Ovarian samples fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and sections
were stained with H and E and studied using stereological techniques. The data were
analyzed with Man â€“ Whitney test.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed that the number and morphological features
of follicles at different stages were similar at 24 and 48 hours post injection in both
groups. The volumes of the ovaries were similar in both groups at 24 hour. However, at
48 hour, the volume of ovaries, corpora lutea and endometrial thickness, in
experimental group, were significantly higher than those in control group (p <  0.05).
Conclusion: According to the increased volume of corpus luteum in the experimental
group, it is concluded that oxytocin injection has a stimulatory effect on induction of
ovulation.

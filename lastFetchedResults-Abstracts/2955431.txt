Fiber optic links are increasingly finding applications in the remoting of signals to and from cellular/personal communication systems (PCS), in the distribution of cable television (CATV) signals, and in radar antenna remoting. The wide range of application requirements and frequency ranges precludes a general comparative discussion of the links used in all such applications. One key to organizing a comparative discussion is to recognize that fiber optic links are unidirectional, unlike the bidirectional coax or waveguide they are intended to replace. This fact often leads to emphasizing different technical requirements depending on the primary function the link is fulfilling. Consequently one way to organize a comparative discussion on links is to group fiber optic links into three functional categories: transmit, distribution and receive links

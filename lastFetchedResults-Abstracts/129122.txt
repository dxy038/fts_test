Introduction: Legionella species are ubiquitous in both natural and man - made water systems. These organisms spread by the inhalation or aspiration of aerosolized organisms arising from water sources such as: rivers, hot springs , air conditioning systems, cooling towers and pools.
Objective: In order to isolate and identify Legionella in therapeutic equipments and the other water sources , in Ahwaz city (Iran).
Materials and Methods: 210 samples collected from different sources, such as neonatal incubators, dental units, water bathes, cooling towers, drinking water reservoirs, hot water taps or showers and little pools in parks , were examined. Sediment of water samples were inoculated onto. selective and non-selective media such as BCYE , BMPA and MWY , before and after acidic treatment with Kcl- Hcl buffer. Isolated colonies which were suspicious of Legionella , were examined by different biochemical tests.
Results: This study resulted in isolation of 14 strains (6.6%) of Legionella, which 9 strains (64.3%) were identified as Legionella pneumophila and 5 strains (35.7%) as Legionella Spp by biochemical tests . The greatest contaminated sources were dental units ( with 19 %) and the lowest ones(2.9%) were hot water taps and showers. 2 strains of Legionella were isolated from each of examined sources, such as water bathes, hospital cooling towers and neonatal incubators.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that therapeutic equipments and different water sources such as drinking water reservoirs, were contaminated by Legionella and so, for recognition of the patients with Legionnaires' disease and determination of different serogroups of Legionella , further epidemiological investigations in this regard are recommended .

Cloud-Txn is a new broadcasting approach, which proposes the usage of the layer-division-multiplexing (LDM) to meet the requirements of the new generation digital TV services. Cloud Txn has been proposed as one of the candidate technologies for the Next Generation DTV systems. This technology is considered as an attractive alternative to the commonly used Time Division (TDM) and Frequency Division (FDM) multiplexing. Its main advantage lies in being more efficient as the RF channel is continuously used both in time and frequency, while the flexibility for each layer configuration is maintained. Nevertheless, the performance of this technique is closely related to the accuracy of the cancelation process required to decouple the multi-layered signals. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the possible error propagation due to the cancellation stage and the corresponding impact on the layers performance.

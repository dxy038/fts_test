Objective
To evaluate the remineralization of carious dentine following the restoration of an extensive lesion in a permanent molar with a high strength glass-ionomer cement (GIC).
Materials and methods

Thirteen first permanent molars, which were scheduled for extraction because of the presence of extensive caries lesions, were selected for this study. They were first restored, according to the ART technique, using encapsulated Fuji IXGP, which contains a strontium glass rather than the traditional calcium glass. The cavities were prepared with a clean enamel margin and minimal removal of the carious dentine around the walls. After a period of 1â€“3 months they were harvested and subsequently sectioned and examined using an electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Results

EPMA demonstrated that both fluorine and strontium ions had penetrated deep into the underlying demineralized dentine. The only possible source of these ions was the GIC restoration.
Conclusion

The pattern of penetration of the fluorine and strontium ions into the dentine was consistent with a remineralization process.

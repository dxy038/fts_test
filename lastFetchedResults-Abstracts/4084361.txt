Dramatic progress in computing capabilities has resulted in the synthesis and implementation of increasingly complex dynamical systems. Since such systems frequently exhibit simultaneously several kinds of dynamic behavior in different parts of the system, they are referred to as hybrid dynamical systems. Such systems frequently defy traditional modeling and analysis techniques since the different system components may evolve along different notions of &#8220;time&#8221;, including real time, discrete time, and discrete events. Most investigations of such systems to date involve ad hoc models and tailor-made analysis results. In some recent work, however, a general model has been proposed which contains most of the different classes of hybrid dynamical systems considered in the literature as special cases. At the core of this general model of hybrid dynamical system, which is defined on an arbitrary metric space, is a notion of generalized time. For this class of general hybrid dynamical systems, a variety of Lyapunov and Lagrange stability results have been established and made public in a scattering of publications and workshop records. Our objective in this paper is to present a unified overview of the more important aspects of this work

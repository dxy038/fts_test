Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis on human microRNAs (miRNAs) expression data of endometriosis tissue profiles versus those of normal controls and to identify novel putative diagnostic markers. Materials andMethods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid Medline were used to search for endometriosis miRNA expression profiling studies of endometriosis. The miRNAs expression data were extracted, and study quality of each article was assessed. The frequently reported miRNAs with consistent regulation were screened out by a meta-profiling algorithm. The putative targets of consistently expressed miRNAs were predicted by using four target prediction tools (TargetScan, PicTar, miRanda, miRDB), and gene ontology pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG and Panther pathways) of the miRNA targets were carried out with GeneCodis web tool. Results: A total of 194 related literatures were retrieved in four databases. One hundred and thirty four differentially expressed miRNAs were found in the 12 microRNA expression profiling studies that compared endometriosis tissues with normal tissues, with 28 miRNAs reported in at least two studies, and 9882 candidate genes retrieved for 13 consistently expressed miRNAs. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) and Panther pathways enrichment analysis showed that endometriosis related differently expressed miRNA targets were mainly enriched in cancer, endocytosis, Wnt signalling pathway, and angiogenesis. It showed that these differently expressed miRNAs and gene are potential biomarkers of endometriosis. Conclusion: miRNAs appear to be potent regulators of gene expression in endometriosis and its associated reproductive disorders, raising the prospect of using miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic agent in endometriosis.

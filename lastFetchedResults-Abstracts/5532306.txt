This research, presents an improved version of Bidirectional (BD) [20] algorithm to solve the problem of exact pattern matching. Fastest-Bidirectional (FBD) exact pattern matching algorithm introduced a new idea of scanning partial text window (PTW) as well with the pattern by taking Berry-Ravindran (BR) consecutive characters to take decision of moving pattern to the right of PTW. FBD algorithm compares the characters of pattern to selected text window from both sides simultaneously as BD. The time complexity of preprocessing phase of FBD algorithm is O(m+ |&#931;|) and searching phase takes O(mn/2).

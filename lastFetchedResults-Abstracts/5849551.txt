This paper presents a genetic algorithm for the solution of capacitor allocation and control problems in electrical distribution systems. From the typical load profiles the proposed technique finds optimal locations for fixed and switched shunt capacitors. The objective function variables are the energy loss at distribution feeders and the costs of the capacitor banks including installation and the voltage constraints. A simple iterative method is used to compute the power flow. The results obtained for the 282-branch test system is showed. The results indicate the efficiency of the proposed method.

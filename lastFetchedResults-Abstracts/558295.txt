Bradyrhizobium strains: ENRRI 16A, ENRRI 16C (Local) and strains TAL 169 and TAL 1371 (Introduced) were used to inoculate two guar cultivars namely, HFG-75 and Local, in split plot design with four replications in field experiment at two locations (Bara and Elsemeih, North Kordofan State- Sudan). The objective of the experiment was to study the effect of inoculation on yield attributes, proximate composition and minerals content of guar. The four Bradyrhizobium strains used, significantly (p < 0.05) increased number of fruiting branches/plant, insignificantly improved grain yield (g) and yield (kg/ha), but exerted no effect on the 100-seed weight at the two locations. Also, inoculation significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the plant height and number of pods/plant at Elsemeih and Bara, respectively. Treatment with Bradyrhizobium strains insignificantly (p < 0.05) affected moisture, ash and oil contents of the tested guar cultivars at Bara location. At Elsemeih site, moisture and oil (except for TAL 1371) followed the same trend. Exceptionally, the ash content was significantly increased. Seed protein content of the two tested guar cultivars at Elsemeih showed significant improvement conversely, to that at Bara site. As a result of inoculation with Bradyrhizobium strains, only insignificant increases in phosphorus, calcium and magnesium contents of guar seeds were observed at both Bara and Elsemeih sites. Strains ENRRI 16C, TAL 169 and TAL 1371 caused significant (p < 0.05) increase in the mean potassium content at Bara location. On the other hand, only the local strain ENRRI 16A significantly (p < 0.05) elevated potassium content. The mean sodium content of guar seeds was significantly (p < 0.05) increased due to inoculation with local ENRRI 16A and the introduced TAL 1371 Bradyrhizobium strains at Bara site, on the contrary, treatment with Bradyrhizobium failed to change sodium content at Elsemeih site

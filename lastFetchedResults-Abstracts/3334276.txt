Design and performance measures of a printed multi strip monopole antenna for ultra-wideband application are presented. The proposed antenna consist of six quarter wavelength strips of different resonating frequency combined in a manner to provide wideband width. It operates in the frequency range 2.51~10.61GHz with impedance bandwidth of 8.1 GHz. The radiation pattern is nearly Omni directional in the Azimuthal plane and bidirectional in the elevation plane and the consistency of the radiation pattern exist for almost for all frequency in the operating band.

Speech synthesizer is commonly used in human-computer interaction. In many applicational cases, the computing resource is limited while real-time synthesis is demanded. The HMM-based speech synthesis technique allows creating a natural voice quality with small footprint, but current synthesizers require the concatenation of sentence level acoustic units, which is not applicable in real-time mode. In this paper, we propose a blocked parameter generation algorithm for low latency speech synthesis which can work real-time in resource limited applications. Phonetic units at various time spans are used as blocks. The objective and subjective evaluations suggest that the proposed system produce promising voice quality with a low demand for the computing resource.

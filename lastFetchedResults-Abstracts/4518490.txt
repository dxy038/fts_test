A new method for misfire detection has been developed with the objective of providing a straightforward solution for slow turning heavy duty engines. It is shown that by evaluating the small signal of the temperature dependent resistance of a glow plug it can be deduced on cylinder individual and cycle specific misfire. The application required a special hardware setup which is presented in the paper. As a result characteristics of the glow plug signal are found which show a significant correlation to the interesting pressure signal.

A class of inverse problems in remote sensing can be characterized by <e1>Q</e1>=<e1>F</e1>(<e1>x</e1>), where <e1>F</e1> is a nonlinear and noninvertible (or hard to invert) operator, and the objective is to infer the unknowns, <e1>x</e1>, from the observed quantities, <e1>Q</e1>. Since the number of observations is usually greater than the number of unknowns, these problems are formulated as optimization problems, which can be solved by a variety of techniques. The feasibility of neural networks for solving such problems is presently investigated. As an example, the problem of finding the atmospheric ozone profile from measured ultraviolet radiances is studied

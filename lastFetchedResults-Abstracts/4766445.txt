The objective of this paper is to verify applicability of Finite Integration Technique (FIT) based simulations in the modeling of Ultra Wideband (UWB) radio channel. A printed planar UWB monopole antenna, designed for Wireless Body Area NetworksÂ´ (WBAN) on-body and off-body communications, is used in the experiments. The validation of the FIT-method is performed by comparing the simulation and measurement results in free space. The analysis was performed both in frequency and time domains. Furthermore, the channel behavior was explained with UWB antenna characteristics. The simulated and measured results are shown to have excellent correspondence both in frequency and time domain. All antenna simulations are done with Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio (MWS) software.

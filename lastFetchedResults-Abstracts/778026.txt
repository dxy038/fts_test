In this paper, the modified linearized Phillips-
Heffron model is utilized to theoretically analyze a
single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) installed with SSSC.
Then, the result of this analysis is used for assessing the
potential of an SSSC supplementary controller to
improve the dynamic stability of a power system. This is
carried out by measuring the electromechanical
controllability through singular value decomposition
(SVD) analysis. This controller is tuned for
simultaneously shifting the undamped electromechanical
modes to a prescribed area in the s-plane. The issue of
designing a robustly SSSC-based controller is considered
and formulated as an optimization problem according to
the eigenvalue-based multi-objective function consisting
of the damping ratio of the undamped electromechanical
modes and the damping factor. Next, considering its high
capability to find the most optimistic results, the Honey
Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO) algorithm is used to
solve this optimization problem. A wide range of
operating conditions are considered in design process of
the proposed damping controller in order to guarantee the
its robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed
controller is demonstrated through eigenvalue analysis,
controllability measure, nonlinear time-domain
simulation and some performance indices studies. The
results show that the tuned HBMO based SSSC controller
which is designed by using the proposed multi-objective
function has an outstanding capability in damping power
system low frequency oscillations, also it significantly
improves the power systems dynamic stability.

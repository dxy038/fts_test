Background
Based on prior success of virtual-reality (VR) trainers in imparting surgical skills, a randomized and controlled study was designed to determine whether VR training improves angled-telescope operative performance.
Methods

Third-year medical students received instruction on the use of an angled laparoscope and subsequently underwent performance assessment of angled telescope navigational tasks in an anesthetized porcine model. Subjects were then randomized to objective-based training with an angled-telescope simulator (EndoTower; Verefi Technologies, Elizabethtown, PA) versus no training, followed by reassessment of performance.
Results

Initially, there were no significant differences between VR-trained (n = 9) and control (n = 10) groups. After training, object visualization, scope orientation, and horizon error scores were significantly better in VR-trained than control groups; subject-matched improvement in orientation score was 50.9% versus 10.8% (P < .05).
Conclusions

VR training in angled laparoscope use improves operative performance of novices. These data support growing evidence that VR training is highly effective in improving surgical skills outside of the clinical setting.

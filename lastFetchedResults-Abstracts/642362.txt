Objective
We assessed the current state of undernutrition as observed in 1905 patients hospitalized in 12 Cuban health care institutions, as part of a Latin American, multinational survey similar in design and goals.
Methods

We surveyed 1905 randomly selected patients from 12 Cuban hospitals in a two-phase study. Patients’ clinical charts were audited in phase 1, the Subjective Global Assessment was used to assess patients’ nutritional status in phase 2. The study was locally conducted by a properly trained team.
Results

The frequency of undernutrition in Cuban hospitals was 41.2% (95% confidence interval = 38.9 to 43.4), and 11.1% of patients were considered severely undernourished. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) univariate relations were identified between undernutrition and patient’s age and sex. Nutritional status was a dependent of the patient’s instruction level (P < 0.05). Patients’ nutritional status was statistically associated with the presence of cancer and infection. Undernutrition was highly prevalent among cancer patients, no matter the stage of medical or surgical treatment. Undernutrition became extremely frequent after surgical treatment in non-cancer patients. High nutritional risks hospital services/specialties were identified: geriatrics (56.3%), critical care (54.8%), nephrology (54.3%), internal medicine (48.6%), gastroenterology (46.5%), and cardiovascular surgery (44.8%). Malnutrition rates increased progressively with prolonged length of stay.
Conclusion

A high malnutrition rate was observed among participating hospitals. The design and inception of policies that foster intervention programs focusing on early identification of hospital malnutrition and its timely management is suggested to decrease its deleterious effects on outcomes of health care in the participating hospitals.

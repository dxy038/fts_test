Objective: The current investigation was aimed toward evaluating the psychometric properties and confirming the stability in factor structure of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS, Endler & Parker, 1990, 1999) in a sample of Iranian undergraduate students. Method: The Farsi version of CISS and the Big Five Inventory (BFI, John, Donahue & Kentle, 1991) were administered to a sample of 419 students (166 male 235 female). The confirmatory factor analysis, convergent validity and internal consistency were used to compute the CISS's factor structure, validity and reliability, respectively. Results: similar to previous finding, high reliability for the subscales of the CISS was indicated via both internal consistency estimates and test-retest correlations. The results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed that while the three factor model in the CISS had an acceptable fit to the data, the fore factor model demonstrated a superior fit in one. Correlations between the CISS subscales and neuroticism and extraversion extended empirical support for the convergent validity of the subscales. Conclusion: These findings speak to the robustness of the CISS, in revealing its relatively stable structure, and consequently, to its potential usefulness as a valid measure of coping styles.

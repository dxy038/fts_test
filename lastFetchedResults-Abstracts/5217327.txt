In this paper, three-phase PFC rectifier topologies with sinusoidal input currents and controlled output voltage are derived from known single-phase PFC rectifier systems and/or passive three-phase diode rectifiers. The systems are classified into hybrid and fully active PWM boost-type or buck-type rectifiers, and their functionality and basic control concepts are briefly described. This facilitates the understanding of the operating principle of three-phase PFC rectifiers starting from single-phase systems, and organizes and completes the knowledge base with a new hybrid three-phase buck-type PFC rectifier topology denominated as Swiss Rectifier. In addition, analytical formulas for calculating the current stresses on the power semiconductors of selected topologies are provided, and rectifier systems offering a high potential for industrial applications are comparatively evaluated concerning the semiconductor stresses, the loading and volume of the main passive components, and the DM and CM EMI noise level. Finally, core topics of future research on three-phase PFC rectifier systems are discussed, such as the analysis of novel hybrid buck-type PFC rectifier topologies, the direct input current control of buck-type systems, the multi-objective optimization of PFC rectifier systems concerning efficiency and power density, and the investigation of the system performance sensitivity to semiconductor and passive components technology.

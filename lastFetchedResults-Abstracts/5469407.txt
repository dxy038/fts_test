Oily sludge, produced mostly in petroleum refineries and petrochemical industries, is one of the major industrial wastes that require treatment. The objective of this work was to recovery oil by washing of oily sludge with nonionic and anionic surfactant. To compare experimental results, three surfactants were used: sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS), alkyl phenol polyoxyethylene ether (OP-10) and ethoxylation alkyl sodium sulfate (Na-AES). The oily sludge is studied in the laboratory, and the composition of the oily sludge is analyzed by the weight method, the conditions of crude oil recovered are researched. At last, the washing effects of the three surfactants are showed. Washing method can be implemented as a continuous method to reduce the amounts of waste oily sludge, while recovering valuable fuel oil.

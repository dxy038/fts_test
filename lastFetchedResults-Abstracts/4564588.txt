In this paper, we compare two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms by solving bi-objective linear and nonlinear constrained optimization problems. The problems considered are three instances of a realistic crop planning problem. The multiobjective algorithms compared are a well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGAII and our own algorithm MCA. We discuss the solutions obtained and analyse the sensitivity of variables for multi-objective solutions. From our analysis, it can be concluded that there is still room for improvement in the performance of the evolutionary optimization algorithms for some of these optimization problems

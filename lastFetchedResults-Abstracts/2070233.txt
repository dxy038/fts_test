In literature, Naturalism believes that human deeds, tendencies and thoughts are derived from inner impulses and instinctive and natural drives and desires. Based on this belief, naturalists encompass all the phenomena and events within the circle of known facts which are justifiable based on scientific principles. They emphasize such cases as heredity, environment and fate as determining factors in man’s life, and believe in an objective representation of human life and its unpleasant aspects based on direct observation and without any idealizing. They propose that as scientists of natural sciences investigate on the natural events and their relevant causes, one may do just such studies on the behavior and moods of human beings in literature.
EsmailFasih is one such writer in Iranian literature in whose works traces of Naturalism can be detected. In the present dissertation, we have conducted a critical study of his major novels (KhakAshena, Sharab e Kham, Del e Koor, and AsirZaman) based on Naturalism’s percepts . Results achieved from our study have invariably proved the dominant reflection of such percepts in his works, thus proving our proposed thesis. Also of importance is the fact that heredity determinism, environment and fate are the most frequent Naturalistic parameters in Fasih’s Novels. The present study is conducted in a descriptive-analytic metod and is specially important as it is the first time that identifying naturalist parameters in the stories of Fasih hass been the subject of critical study, and he is considered as a naturalist writer.

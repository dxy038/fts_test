The &#8220;near miss accidents&#8221; system arises from a wider based project by DELAB, a joint laboratory, between ENI, one of the most important Italian petrolchemical companies, and the University of Genoa. The objective is to identify the causes leading to truck accidents enhancing the knowledge base through the data collection of near miss accidents. A system of systems engineering approach was developed where the main system components relate to the driver, the truck and the external environment conditions. The methodology which was adopted to monitor the whole system and preliminary results are illustrated.

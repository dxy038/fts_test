Six-phase matrix converters allow an all-silicon solution to the problem of changing AC power from one frequency to another. A simple model is purposed to simulate the power circuit, as well as the filters. The power semiconductors are modeled as ideal bidirectional switches and the matrix converter is controlled using a direct transfer function approach. This paper shows that it is possible to use the six-phase matrix converter to increase the maximum voltage gain.

Background and Objective: Uric acid and vitamin C take part in protection mechanisms to overcome the oxidative stress that occurs in vascular accidents.  Considering the prevalence of cerebrovascular accidents and unresolved position of these antioxidants, this study aimed to assess serum uric acid and vitamin C levels in acute ischemic stroke.
Materials and Methods: A total of 50 patients during the early 48 hours of admission for atherothrombotic stroke were compared with 50 controls.  Serum levels of uric acid and vitamin C were measured by enzymatic and calorimetric assays, respectively, and the findings were analyzed using statistical methods.
Results: Serum vitamin C levels were significantly lower in the stroke patients (0.42 ±0.13 vs. 0.5 ±0.16 µg/dl, P=0.011).  However, there was no significant differences in the serum uric acid levels between the case and control groups (4.55 ±1.97 vs. 5.09 ±1.93 mg/dl, P=0.167).
Conclusion: Estimation of vitamin C levels may be used as an indirect evidence of oxidative stress process inducing neuronal damage in acute atherothrombotic stroke, and it may be a useful tool for monitoring and optimizing future antioxidant therapies.

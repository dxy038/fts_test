Given the abundance and strategic importance of ring fiber-plants in metropolitan area networks, and the accelerating growth of Internet traffic, it is crucial to extend the existing IP-based GMPLS framework to provision dynamic WDM optical rings. Nevertheless the emerging GMPLS-based distributed lightpath establishment schemes for optical networks have been proposed and evaluated in mesh networks, but no one has been optimized for ring-based MAN. The objective of this paper is to propose a GMPLS-based signaling protocol for unidirectional rings which allows to have a global wavelength resource information without any routing protocol when provisioning bidirectional connections. Performance evaluation has been carried in ADRENALINE testbed, composed of Linux routers that emulate a GMPLS-based MAN.

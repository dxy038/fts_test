Transportation has evolved to a topic which is highly regarded in multi aspects. Partly, the contribution to its increasing complexity and everlasting significance has some correlation to the continuous rising demands of public transportation. Transportation systems are now urged to break through the boundaries using communication technology. The integration of communication and computing in the realm of transportation is coined Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The reliability of transportation systems have yet to mature as there are still problems that require support or restructuring. The current new fleets of public transport lacks of proper communication assistance which could potentially identify traffic conditions instantly. The dynamic environments of transportation regions will always pose challenges to wireless communications. Accordingly, there is a need for reliable, uninterrupted and high speed communication systems for the application in ITS. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a wireless communication protocol suitable for vehicular scenarios. The wireless communication scheme exhibits ad-hoc behavior and coupled with adaptive capabilities. Together, with multiple communication units, they are able to deliver reliable point-to-point wireless communication within a network. With good planning, the communication system can help with the improvements of the efficiency and safety public transportation systems.

The main objective of this paper is to implement a precoded Zadoff-Chu OFDM to reduce the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and for frequency offset estimation in Wireless Local Area Networks. High PAPR and Carrier Frequency Offset are major disadvantages to the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems and can significantly degrade the power efficiency at the transmitter and performance of the system respectively. From the simulation results in MATLAB, it can be proved that using this method a PAPR of 2.5dB less than that of PTS technique can be achieved and the range of frequency estimation of N/2 subcarrier spacing can be obtained.

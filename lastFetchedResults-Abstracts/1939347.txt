Inroduction & Objective: Infection with E.coli Bacterium carrying PKS genes is considered one of the causes for infection inside the body, because the bacteria carrying PKS genes will induce Histone H2AX Phosphorylation in antrocites of mice. A considerable increase in frequency of mutations is seen in cells which are exposed to toxin. Studies indicate that infection can cause the potential for mutation. Therefore, colonization of species of E.coli bacteria carrying PKS genes can cause cancer development in large intestine.
Material and Methods: In this research, we examined the existence of genetic island of PKS in E.coli bacteria taken from patients’ biopsies infected with inflammatory intestine disease and normal subjects whom have been to Digestion & Glands Clinic at Baghiatalah Hospital and the contrast between cancerous and healthy tissue was performed using a scanning electron microscope. Therefore, 20 biopsy samples of healthy people and 25 biopsy samples of intestine tissue from people infected with inflammatory intestine disease were examined in terms of microbiology and molecular structure. For this purpose, E.coli bacteria was detected by using the intestine tissue, microbiologic and biochemical approaches, then the their DNAs was extracted, and Multiplex PCR approach was used for the specific designed primers in terms of availability of genes in the PKS island, and the PCR products was examined using Electrophoresis on 2% Agarose Gel. 
Results: The results have indicated that 28% of the E.coli bacteria taken from patients’ biopsies have genetic area of PKS.

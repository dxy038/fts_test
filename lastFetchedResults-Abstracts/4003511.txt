The aim of this paper is to present an up to date review of the status of the European DIPOle (EDIPO) project - whose objective is to build a new facility to perform both DC and AC tests of large force flow superconductor samples in high magnetic background field (up to ~12.5 T) - as well as an outlook on the final commissioning of the magnet in CRPP-PSI foreseen for 2012. Concerning the actual status, the results presented focus on the recent steps carried out in the manufacturing of the magnet assembly, in particular the cold mass assembly, its impregnation and the final acceptance tests. Moreover, results are reported regarding the identification and repair of an inter-turn short carried out on EDIPO Pole 1 in the second half of 2010. As far as the commissioning of EDIPO is concerned, an up-to-date report is provided on the preparation of the facility at CRPP (e.g. mechanical structures, high temperature current leads, quench detection, control system, etc.) as well as its acceptance and final commissioning (e.g. magnet reception tests, commissioning program, etc.).

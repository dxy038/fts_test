The application of differential evolution to compute the total transfer capability in deregulated market is proposed in this paper. The objective is to maximize a specific point-to-point power transaction without system constraint violations using Differential Evolution. This algorithm is based on full ac optimal power flow solution to account for the effects of active and reactive power flow, voltage limits, and line flow limits. The real power output of generators in source area and the real power of the loads in the sink area can be adjusted to obtain the maximum transfer capability. The performance of the proposed method is tested on the modified IEEE-30 bus system and results are compared with that of Particle Swarm Optimization method and with other published results.

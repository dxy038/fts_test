A key objective of procurement is to purchase the right product from right supplier at right price in due time. In this paper, we are going to propose a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making model to address the problem of identifying right supplier in purchasing process. Fuzzy numbers are introduced to enable evaluators encompass vagueness in the evaluation process of suppliers. With the proposed model, evaluators may give ratings in fuzzy numbers to different suppliers under consideration against postulated criteria, and two indices and a aggregated index would be generated for each supplier so that suppliers can be ranked accordingly

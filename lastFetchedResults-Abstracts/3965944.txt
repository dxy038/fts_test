This short paper presents a method that makes it possible to analyze switched-capacitor (SC) networks in discrete time using compacted nodal analysis in continuous time. Our objective is to perform time-discrete analysis in the z-domain using any symbolic analysis tool (e.g. CASCA) intended for analysis of time-continuous networks in the s-domain. A new equivalent analog circuit is used to describe the switched capacitors in the s-domain with z=s instead of z=e<sup>sT</sup> which gives a simple translation between the two domains. Two SC examples are considered: an inverting amplifier and a biquad

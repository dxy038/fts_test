Background: Elicitors are biotic or abiotic molecules that have effectively stimulated the production of plant secondary metabolites in plant, cell and organ cultures. 
Objective: Opium poppy serves as one of the particular commercial source of sanguinarine, as an anticancer and antimicrobial metabolite in the pharmaceutical industry;This study was done by the aim of increasing in expression of genes involve in the synthesis ofthisvaluablemetaboliteinplantcell suspension culture.
Methods: In this study, the effects of two abiotic nano elicitors (nano TiO2 and nano-Silver), were studied on the expression of genes involve in sanguinarine biosynthesis pathway (tydc7, bbe1, DIOX2 and DBOX) at different time points (6, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours) following treatments on shoot meristem and root suspension cell cultures using Real-time PCR.
Results: All of these genes were expressedmost abundantly6 and 24 hours after treatment with nano elicitors in both root and meristem suspension cell cultures. After time all the genes expression were significantly decreased. 
Conclusion: Comparing the results of this study with the findings of other major studies on the effect of elicitors on papaver gene expression, indicated that because of the small sizes of nano particles, they may cause the rapid induction of sanguinarine biosynthesis genes expression in the shortest possible time. Nevertheless other investigations showed the highest increasing in gene expression, 48hours after elicitation. Given that, this study was conducted on callus with dedifferentiated cells from two different organs, but remarkable distinction were observed in gene expression profile in both explant tissues. In the other words the trace of cellular memory, was seen in dedifferentiated cells regards to the origin of explants.

The objective of this work is the future concept of a continuous multiphase enzyme membrane reactor to produce and extract an intermediate opioid peptide (LVVH-7) from a complex hydrolysate of bovine hemoglobin. We report in the first part of this work the production of adecolorized (heme free) fraction of intermediate peptide containing LVVH-7 in a continuous enzymatic membrane reactor. The space time of our reactor was fixed up to 2 minutes corresponding to the necessary time to generate in batch hydrolysis our intermediates peptides. The hydrolysis has been carried out continuously for 46 minutes. In the second part of this work, a solvent mixture of water butan-2-ol octan-1-ol displaying a very good extraction selectivity of LVVH-7 extraction in course of peptic hemoglobin hydrolysis has been designed and optimized. The mixture design used to optimization gave the best results for the mixture composed of 45% water, 45% butan-2-ol and 10% octan-1-ol.

In this paper, a pilot study is conducted to explore developing a human-robot interaction language that specifically targets robotic grasping. The short term goal is to help nontechnical users command and control a simple robotic arm to grasp small objects. The long term objective is to use this language to enable skill transfer of grasping skills between nontechnical users and personal service robots. The study included a small group of participants with various technical backgrounds. They were asked to use a primitive set of commands to instruct a CRS robotic arm to grasp five small objects which are typically difficult to grasp. The findings of this pilot study are presented along with further insight gathered from participant feedback.

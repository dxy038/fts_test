Central to understanding and improving requirements engineering processes is the ability to measure requirements engineering success. The paper describes a research study whose objective was to develop an instrument to measure the success of requirements engineering processes. The instrument developed consists of 32 indicators that cover the two most important dimensions of requirements engineering success. These two dimensions were identified during the study to be: quality of requirements engineering products and quality of requirements engineering service. Evidence is presented demonstrating that the instrument has desirable psychometric properties, such as high reliability and validity.

The objective of this paper is to derive quantitative measures for road user charging (RUC). Instead of using complicated sensors to measure pollutant emissions and driver behavior, this paper uses location, velocity, acceleration and time (LVAT) determined by most widely used GPS receivers together with supporting information to derive indirect quantitative indicators for emissions and driver behavior. Test results show that most of the factors relevant to RUC are highly correlated to LVAT. This should enable the implementation and operation of a simple and cost effective variable RUC scheme based on LVAT data derived from GPS measurements.

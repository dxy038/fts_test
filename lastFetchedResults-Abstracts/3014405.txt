This paper proposes a novel adaptive controller for rejecting the periodic runout of a track following system in the compact disk drives. The control objective is to attenuate adaptively the specific frequency contents of runout disturbances without amplifying its rest harmonics. Being dependent on the position of the disk, the proposed controller is applicable to both the spindle modes of constant linear velocity (CLV) and constant angular velocity (CAV) for various operation speeds. The experimental results show that the novel control strategy leads to a satisfactory performance in terms of the reduction of tracking error of compact disk drives.

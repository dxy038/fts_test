The main objective of this paper is to enhance the universityÂ´s monitoring system taking into account factors such as reliability, time saving, and easy control. The proposed system consists of a mobile RFID solution in a logical context. The system prototype and its small scale application was a complete success. However, the more practical phase will not be immediately ready because a large setup is required and a part of the existing system has to be completely disabled. Some software modifications in the RFID system can be easily done in order for the system to be ready for a new application. In this paper, advantages and disadvantages of the proposed RFID system will be presented.

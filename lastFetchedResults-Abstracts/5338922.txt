A novel three-level bidirectional converter is proposed in this paper. Compared with the traditional bi-directional converter, the voltage stress on the switch of the proposed converter is just half of the voltage on the high voltage side. The inductor of three-level bi-directional converter also can be reduced significantly, so the dynamic response can be improved. Therefore, it is very suitable for fuel cell power systems. This paper also illustrates the operation principle and implementation of the control circuit. A lkW prototype converter is built to verify the theoretical analysis.

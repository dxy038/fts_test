In order to maximize the economic interests of the client and the contractor sides, project payment schedule problem is studied about how to arrange project payment schedule fairly, especially under the condition of the affecting factors being not only single but also changing. Study of multi-objective equilibrium of multi-mode project payment scheduling problem is particularly important. There are the possible conflict of interest problems between the client and the contractor in the payment schedule during the project construction period. Optimization model of integration point is built to maximize the net present value of both sides, under the premise of the research assumptions being clear and the symbols being defined. Then by using multi-objective optimization, a mixture of Pareto and vector evaluated genetic algorithm is designed in this paper, and solve the model by writing the Matlab program. At last, solution have been carried out to verify the model by an example, getting the supply plan project schedule that the client and the contractor can choose according to the interests of both sides.

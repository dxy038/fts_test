By dividing the multiobjective optimization of the decision space into several small regions, this paper proposes multi-objective optimization algorithm based on sub-regional search, which makes individuals in same region operate each other by evolutionary operator and the information between the individuals of different regions exchange through their offsprings re-divided into regions again. Since the proposed algorithm utilizes the sub-regional search, the computational complexity at each generation is lower than the NSGA-II and MSEA. The proposed algorithm makes use of the max-min strategy with determined weight as fitness functions, which make it approach evenly distributed solution in Pareto front. This paper presents a kind of easy technology dealing with the constraint, which makes the proposed algorithm solved unconstrained multiobjective problems can also be used to solve constrained multiobjective problems. The numerical results, with 13 unconstrained multiobjective optimization testing instances and 10 constrained multiobjective optimization testing instances, are shown in this paper.

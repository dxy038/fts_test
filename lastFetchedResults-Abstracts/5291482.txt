In this paper, we present a new measure of forecast accuracy: a modified mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). As a means of establishing the goodness of fit, we set different objective functions, by implementation of a global optimization algorithm, the results of setting the objective function as modified MAPE are compared with the results of setting the objective function as MAPE, comparisons demonstrate that modified MAPE comes with lower prediction error.

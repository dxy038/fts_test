Exposure to vibration is the cause of some occupational injuries and diseases. Objective of this study was
determination of vibration exposure of tractor drivers and assessment of musculoskeletal disorder. This
cross-sectional and descriptive- analytical study was administrated to 95 tractor drivers to census method
and measuring induced vibration to the drivers was done in three axis, x, y, and z in tractors with load
(10000 liter water), without load, with 10 km/h speed, by the vibration meter instrument “Sevantek”. The
information related to musculoskeletal disorder was collected by using Nordic questionnaire. Data from
both parts was analyzed by using SPSS. In the over load tractor group and with velocity vibration 10km/h,
50% of workers were in the range of reduced comfort boundary, 39.3% in the range of fatigue decreased
proficiency boundary and 10.7% in over exposure limit. This results were in the without load tractor group
and with the same velocity, 23.8% of people were in the range of reduced comfort boundary, 42.9% in the
range of fatigue decreased proficiency boundary and 33.3% in the range of over exposure limit and waist
with 56.8% had the greatest rate of pain and ankle with 9.5% had the least amount of pain rate. Using of
many tractors in city to displace water and other applications, paying attention to the health of drivers and
checking the periodically, is needed.

As intermittent renewable generation becomes more significant in the portfolio of power generation, it becomes increasingly important to assess its impact on the generation reliability of power systems. Therefore, it is the objective of this paper to evaluate the reliability impact of wind power penetration using the basic loss of load probability and expectation concepts. To this end, reliability impacts of various levels of wind power penetration are investigated and compared with conventional fossil-based units. The results of this comparison shows that, at wind penetration levels of less than 5%, the reliability impact of the wind farm is comparable to the impact of an energy equivalent conventional unit. However, for penetration levels greater than 5%, the wind farm is less efficient in reducing the LOLE than its energy equivalent unit.

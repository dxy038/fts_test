In recent years, the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFD- and the relay communication techniques have significantly improved the important performance of radio wireless communication networks. Due to its wide and critical applications, we can also apply these techniques into the underwater acoustic (UWA) wireless networks. In this paper, we propose the power-efficiency resource allocation scheme for tradeoff between the power consumption and quality of service (QoS) of multimedia applications in a relay-based underwater MIMO-OFDM acoustic cooperative wireless networks. Our objective is to efficiently minimize the total power/energy consumption while supporting the QoS-guaranteed services for multimedia applications over underwater MIMO-OFDM acoustic cooperative wireless networks. To achieve these goals, we propose a joint optimization of source and relay network transmit power with the QoS-constraint for the relay-based MIMO-OFDM underwater acoustic cooperative wireless networks. We conduct the extensive simulations to validate and evaluate our proposed scheme, showing its superiority over the other existing schemes.

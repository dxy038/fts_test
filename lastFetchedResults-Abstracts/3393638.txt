Switched power converters today are essential for high-performance energy control in a large variety of applications. A central concern in the design of switched-mode power converters is the improvement of their dynamic behavior. The nonlinear passivity-based control (PBC) algorithms for switched converters have proven to be an interesting alternative to conventional control. The PBC objective is usually achieved through an energy-reshaping process and damping injection to modify the dissipation structure of the system. The PBC method using Brayton-Moser (BM) framework solves the tuning problems and provides practical guidelines for the structure of the injected damping. On-going research aims at extending a new control paradigm based on control-Lyapunov function to switched power converters in order to avoid the system inversion problem.

In this work, we report the synthesis and the antimycobacterial evaluation of new trans-cinnamic acid derivatives of isonicotinic acid series (5) and benzoic acid series (6), designed by exploring the molecular hybridization approach between isoniazid (1) and trans-cinnamic acid derivative (3). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the compounds 5a–d and 6c exhibited activity between 3.12 and 12.5 μg/mL and could be a good start point to find new lead compounds against multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.

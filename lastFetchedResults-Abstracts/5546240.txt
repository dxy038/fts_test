This paper proposes a monitoring system that can remotely monitor and predict changes of humidity and temperature level in the greenhouse atmosphere. The objective of the research project is to implement an agro-environmental remote monitoring system using wired sensor and issue SMS notification. The system will includes active measurements, which capable of detecting degradation level for humidity and temperature; and be equipped with an alert mechanism to notify workers about the atmosphere quality in the greenhouse so that precaution steps can be taken promptly. Hypothetical -Deductive method will be used as development methodology because it serves as the typical method in similar research field. With development of this Remote Monitoring System, it is hope that it will benefit farmers in term of bringing new technical innovation in collecting data and monitoring greenhouse.

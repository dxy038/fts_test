The ‘standard’ thick target flare model predicts the existence of strong hard X-ray emission at the footpointsof a flare loop. However, Yohkoh observations suggest that up to 20% of events with data available in three or more Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) channels show only a single source. Combining datasets from Yohkoh, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and Nobeyama Radio Heliograph (NoRH), we compare the characteristics of these single source events to double source events. The objective of this study is to determine whether these represent unresolved double footpoints, asymmetric electron deposition due to magnetic mirroring effects, or a genuine departure from the ‘standard’ model.

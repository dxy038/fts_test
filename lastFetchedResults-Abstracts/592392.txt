Background: Labor pain is an important factor in increasing mother anxiety. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on specific acupuncture points for reducing labor pain in the first stage of labor.
Materials and Methods: In this double-blind clinical trial study, 64 nulliparous healthy women who were selected based on inclusion criteria and were in their active phase of labor’s first stage, were randomly divided into 2 equal groups; according to their admittance file numbers and by lottery, the odd numbered patients were assigned to the TENS group and the even numbered to the control group. In either groups two electrodes were put on the Hegu points of both hands and two electrodes were put on the Sanyinjiao points of both feet, after cervix was dilated 4 cm. Pain scores (through visual analogue scale) were studied in both groups. Finally, the collected data were analyzed by independent t-test.
Results: The pain intensity was significantly decreased in the TENS group compared to the control group (p=0.001). Duration of the labor’s first stage in the TENS group (180 min) was significantly shorter than control group (238 min) (p=0.001). The number of labor induction with oxytocin were 16 in the TENS group (50%) and 25 in the control group (78.1%) (p=0.019).
Conclusion: Application of TENS on acupuncture points can be used as a non-medicinal and without complication method for mother and fetus to reduce pain in the first stage of labor.

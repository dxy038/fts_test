It is the objective of this paper to present unique features
that characterize power quality events and methodologies
to extract them from recorded voltage and/or current waveforms
using Fourier and wavelet transforms. Examples of unique features
include peak amplitudes, RMS, frequency, and statistics of wavelet
transform coefficients. These features are derived from well documented
theories, power engineersâ€™ heuristics gained through long
years of experience, and power quality data collected in recent
years. Converter operation, transformer energization, and capacitor
energization (which includes normal, back-to-back, and restrike
on opening energization), representing three common power
quality events at the distribution level, are presented. These examples
provide the basis for further characterization of other power
quality events.

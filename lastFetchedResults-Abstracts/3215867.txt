The challenge of single image dehazing mainly comes from the double uncertainty of scene depth and scene radiance. Approximation of the transmission, which encodes the scene depth information, is the most significant step to solve the dehazing problem. In this paper, we propose to derive an optimal transmission map under a heuristic assumption in the dehazing model. The proposed objective function guarantees to have a global optimal solution, and the obtained transmission map accurately preserves the depth-consistency of the same object. Using the optimal transmission map, our method recovers haze-free images with excellent performance.

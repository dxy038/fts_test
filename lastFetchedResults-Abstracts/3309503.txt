With the development of tourism industry, the impacts of tourism have been drawing increasingly attention. It has become an important and essential work to evaluate the impact of cultural tourism resources development. However, the conventional evaluation methods have some limitation on weight determination due to their one-sidedness. In this paper, we propose an integrated entropy weighted method to evaluate the impact of cultural tourism resources development by considering both objective and subjective weights. The proposed method is utilized to determine the optimization of design schemes which has the lowest impact on a certain development project. The experimental result on the case study shows that the proposed method can reduce the subjective preferences by the decision-makers effectively. It enhances the methodÂ´s feasibility, rationality and effectiveness to estimate the impacts of cultural tourism resources development.

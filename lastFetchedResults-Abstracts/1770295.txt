Earlier, environmental problems have been considered as technical and economic
problems. In the last decades of the twentieth century the societal dimensions of environmental
problems and environmental issues attracted more public attention. As a result of this circumstances
a new social scientific discipline, “environmental sociology” was appeared to investigate
the environmental behavior of the societies. This paper is an attempt to investigate the environmental
issue in grate Tehran and design a structural model for explaining environmental Attitude and
behavior of urban residents. To achieve this objective a conceptual model derived out from review
of literature to examine structural relations among personal factors, attitude towards environment
and environmental behavior. To examine this model, 1200 individuals of Tehran residents were
randomly chosen and interviewed about their opinion on environmental legislations, environmental
knowledge and information, environmental attitude and behavior. The results of this study show
that for Tehran residents the environment is not yet thought to be an important problem, when
compared with other social and economic issues. Overall, results of the survey show that people are
ready to spend time or to organize themselves to take part in a campaign to protect the environment,
but they believe that money for environmental protection should come from the government. The
structural model indicates that, feeling of stress, environmental information, preparedness to act
and environmental legislation have an important impact on environmental attitude and behavior.

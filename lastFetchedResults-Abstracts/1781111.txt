Objective
cribe the thyroid cancer incidence trends and geographical patterns in the Latina Province of Lazio, Italy using the population-based cancer registry.
s
racted from the Latina cancer registry all cases of thyroid cancer from 1997 to 2006. Cases were classified according to morphological type and diameter. Data for diagnostic procedures for Latina Province residents from 2001 to 2006 were extracted from the regional outpatient procedures information system.
s
l of 982 cases were diagnosed, for a standardized incidence of 8.3 and of 27.9 per 100,000 in males (n, 220) and in females (n, 762), respectively. The annual percent change (APC) was +16.7% (95% CI +7.2, +27.2) and +10.5% (95% CI +6.5, +14.6) in males and females, respectively. The increase was mostly due to papillary (n, 759) and small (â‰¤20 mm) cancers (n, 617), with no difference by age (&lt;45 years; n, 431). The APC of neck ultrasound performed was +8.7% (95% CI +0.1, +18.1) and +9.0% (95% CI +1.1, +17.4) and that of biopsy/cytology was +17.0% (95% CI +13.0, +21.3) and +16.6% (95% CI +6.2, +28.1) in men and women, respectively. The geographic pattern of biopsy/cytology was similar to that of cancer incidence but not to that of neck ultrasound.
sions
ina, the increase in thyroid cancer incidence was more rapid than in the rest of Italy, particularly for types with a good prognosis. While tumor size and histotype suggest an increase in detection instead of an increase in disease occurrence, data on diagnostic procedure reimbursements cannot provide an explanation.

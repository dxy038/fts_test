Recently, a growing community of researchers has used reconfigurable hardware systems to solve computationally intensive problems. Reconfigurability provides optimised processors for systems on chip designs, and makes easy to import technology to a new system through reusable modules. The main objective of this work is the investigation of a reconfigurable computer system targeted for real-time computer vision applications. The system is intended to circumvent the inherent computational load of most window-based computer vision algorithms. It aims to build a system for such tasks by providing an FPGA-based hardware architecture. Some preliminary results are presented and discussed.

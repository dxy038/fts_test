Compressed video bitstream is intended for real-time transmission over communication networks. However, it is very sensitive to transmission errors. Even a single bit error can lead to disastrous video quality degradation in both time and spatial domain. This quality deterioration is exacerbated when no error control mechanism is employed to protect coded video data against the error prone environments. In this paper, we present a new error detection and concealment algorithm to reduce the effects of transmission error in the video decoder.We verified that the proposed algorithm generates good performances in PSNR and objective visual quality through the computer simulation by H.324M mobile simulation set.

Computerized human motion simulation allows generation of dynamic human motions on computers. Biomechanical stresses can be estimated using the motions generated on a computer without actually collecting joint coordinate data. A two-dimensional whole-body lifting simulation model is presented in this paper. The model assumes that humans perform lifting activities based on minimization of physical work, subject to various constraints. The simulation method contains three major computation units: trajectory formation unit, dynamics of motion unit, and nonlinear optimization unit. The trajectory formation unit generates smooth polynomials representing motion characteristics of human lifting. Kinematics and kinetics are calculated in the dynamics unit. Objective and constraint functions are evaluated in the optimization unit. Optimal motions are generated by minimizing the objective function, subject to the constraints. Computation methods of the three units and simulation results are presented.

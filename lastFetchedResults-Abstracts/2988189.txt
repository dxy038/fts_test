The objective of this paper was to obtain an encoding structure that would allow the genetic evolution of rules in such a manner that the number of rules and relationship in a classifier system (CS) would be learnt in the evolution process. For this purpose, an area that allows the definition of rule groups has been entered into the condition and message part of the encoded rules. This area is called internal tag. This term was coined because the system has some similarities with natural processes that take place in certain animal species, where the existence of tags allows them to communicate and recognize each other. Such CS is called a tag classifier system (TCS). The TCS has been tested in the game of draughts and compared with the classical CS. The results show an improving of the CS performance

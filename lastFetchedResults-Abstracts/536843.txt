With the wide increase in using distributed object-oriented databases, it became important to find an efficienttechnique to store large-scale databases on the different sites. The allocation of object-oriented database involves allocationof both methods and attributes within the classes. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a new technique forallocating the distributed object-oriented database methods and attributes among N sites. The proposed technique usesgenetic algorithm to find the best allocation (optimal or near optimal) of the object-oriented database methods and attributeto the available sites. A cost function that computes the total data transfer during the execution of queries is developed. Thegenetic algorithm steps use this cost function to evaluate the possible allocations of methods. Validation of the proposedtechnique is done via simulation. The experimental results of the proposed technique depict that it has a great impact inreducing the total time required to find the best allocation and in most of the cases it reaches the optimal allocation of themethods.

The quality of care presentation is the most important and major concern in care centers, and target search in the nurses working may be effective on the quality of patients care. Yet, there are few studies about the effect of nurses' spirituality on the degree of patients’ satisfaction. Accordingly, the objective of present research is to determine the relationship between nursing staff spirituality and patient satisfaction from the cares. This is a correlation –descriptive study.  100 nurses and 100 patients hospitalized in selected hospitals of Ardabil Medical Sciences were randomly selected. Data were collected through using the spiritual wellbeing scale (swbs) and patient satisfaction instruments from nursing care. The findings showed that mean and standard deviation of satisfaction degree in hospitalized patients participating in this research was 157.2±19.5. Mean and standard deviation of spiritual wellbeing of nurses participated in this study is 101.3 ±9.3 and there is a significant relationship between the levels of nurses' spirituality and the degree of patients' satisfaction in selected hospitals of Ardebil Medical Sciences(p  < 0.05).the assessment of nurses' spiritual well being indicated that most nurses studied, had high and positive spiritual wellbeing scores, but they had received no professional training to provide the spiritual assistances to the patients. Considering that patient satisfaction is concerned with this aspect of care more than anything, so the patients' satisfaction at care centers may be increased through using the professional training in nursing, in order to develop the spiritual assistance to patients and to evaluate their spiritual needs.

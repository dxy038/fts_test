Background. The guidelines for performing a one and a half ventricle repair with pulsatile bidirectional Glenn remains controversial. This retrospective report summarizes the experience of a single institution, with an attempt at providing an answer.

Methods. Fifty consecutive patients, aged 4 months to 42 years, underwent intracardiac repair along with a superior cavopulmonary connection. Twenty-seven of the patients had had previous surgical palliation. Repair consisted of patch closure of the ventricular septal defect (n = 25), tricuspid valve repair (n = 26), reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract (n = 34), transpulmonary annular patch (n = 34), right ventricle to pulmonary artery homograft conduit (n = 4), and concomitant repair of atrioventricular canal (n = 9). Ten patients were left with a fenestration in the atrial septum.

Results. There were six hospital deaths (12%) and two late deaths (4.5%). Forty-two survivors were followed from 8 months to 116 months. Eighty-eight percent are in functional class I. Actuarial survival at 97 months was 74%.

Conclusions. Moderate right heart hypoplasia constitutes a safe anatomic category for a pulsatile bidirectional Glenn. It is advisable not to proceed with a one and a half ventricle repair if postoperative residual pulmonary artery hypertension is anticipated. Patients requiring an intricate intracardiac repair and those with concomitant right heart hypoplasia may be better suited for a Fontan type of repair to reduce the complexity of the procedure.

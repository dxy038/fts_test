Theoretical models for chemical lasers depend on a variety of assumptions and empirical data to provide closure and simplify solution of the governing equations. Among the various assumptions and empirical data built into models for chemical lasers are assumptions regarding steadiness in the time domain and geometric similarity of the computational domain. The objective of our work is to generate understanding of the temporal and spatial dependence of the physical processes underlying chemical lasers through systematic testing of the models employed in simulation of these devices. This objective is achieved through 3D time accurate numerical simulation of the chemical oxygen-iodine laser (COIL) flowfield and 2D time accurate numerical simulation of a cylinder in a crossflow at conditions representative of COIL flowfields.

Reflection has been very fashionable in all parts of teacher education for a number of years. Despite numerous articles, there is little empirical evidence that supports the view that it results in superior teaching practices, especially in EFL context. (Cornford, 2002) The objective of the present study was to explore whether there is a statistically meaningful relationship between the "reflective teaching practices" and the "learning outcomes" of the Iranian EFL students. For the purpose of this study two homogeneous groups of pre-university students were taught the same materials under similar pedagogical conditions by two teachers fundamentally different in their treatment of reflection on teaching practices.  In fact, one was a strong supporter of the reflective pedagogy, and the other a total disbeliever in its use and effect on students' learning potential. The students mean score was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the disbeliever teacher category (control group) than the mean score of students in the believer teacher category (experimental group). Also, the student satisfaction and support were more significant in the experimental group. All in all, reflective pedagogy contributed significantly to the learning/learner effectiveness. These results demonstrate for the first time the potential contribution of reflection and reflective teaching to the ease and effectiveness of learning on the part of the Iranian EFL students.

In this paper, a fuzzy genetic approach is proposed for solving a multi objective assignment problem where tasks have to be assigned to operators so as to minimize total execution time without exceeding neither a critical value of load unbalance nor a predefined interoperator communication cost. The fuzzy approach determines the priority of the objectives while the GA approach generates the best solution.

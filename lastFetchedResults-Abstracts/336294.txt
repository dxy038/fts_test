Aim
The objective of this study is to ascertain whether omission of lymphadenectomy is possible when endometrial cancer is considered low-risk based on intraoperative pathologic indicators.
Patient and methods

A total of 128 patients were deemed to be low-risk based on intraoperative evaluation, including frozen-section determination of grade and myometrial invasion. We divided these 128 patients into 2 groups, the total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH-BSO) with lymphadenectomy (LA group, n = 68) and the TAH-BSO without lymphadenectomy (non-LA group, n = 60) group. The only adjuvant treatment used was chemotherapy, and the decision to use chemotherapy was based on stage, grade, or lymphovascular space involvement. A retrospective review of the medical records was performed, and disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), operative time, estimated blood loss during operation, percentage of transfusion requirement, incidence of post-operative leg lymphedema and post-operative deep vein thrombosis were evaluated.
Results

The 5-year DFS and OS rates were 95.6% and 98.5% in the LA group, and 98.3% and 98.3% in the non-LA group, respectively, and were not significantly different. In the LA group, pelvic lymph node metastasis was observed in only 1 case. In the LA group, blood loss during operation, percentage of transfusion requirement and the incidence of post-operative leg lymphedema were significantly higher than those in the non-LA group.
Conclusion

Lymphadenectomy did not provide a significant survival advantage in the patients with low-risk corpus cancer. Additionally, some peri- and post-operative morbidities and complications were increased by the addition of lymphadenectomy. The present findings suggest that lymphadenectomy should be limited for low-risk corpus cancer.

This paper mainly investigates the problem of radio resource allocation for heterogeneous services transmission in OFDMA-based wireless networks, where the Soft QoS traffics are considered. In communication systems from the users´ point of view, utility is a good metric to describe the satisfaction of services, the objective of this paper is to improve the total utility of all the system users, and guarantee their Quality of Service(QoS). Three types of services are considered, including the Hard QoS (HQ), the Best Effort (BE) and the Soft QoS (SQ) traffics. First we analyze the utility and hard outage characteristics of the wireless services, and then we introduce a new concept, i.e., emph{soft outage} to further improve the SQ users´ performance. Afterwards, two wireless resource allocation schemes, i.e., the Hard Outage Allocation (HOA) and Soft Outage Allocation (SOA) schemes are proposed corresponding to the hard outage and the soft outage, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation algorithms can greatly improve the system performance.

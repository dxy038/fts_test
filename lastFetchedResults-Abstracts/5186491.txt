Worldwide cement consumption is currently growing with record figures and the increase of new production capacities is almost double compared to the long-term mean value. Therefore cement producers, especially from rapidly growing countries and regions with a booming construction business, are demanding cement production lines of highest capacity. The need of high capacity combined with limited space for installation and various considerations regarding operation and costs leads to the development and implementation of large-scale equipment. In order to reach this objective various hurdles had to be cleared at first. Process related issues require new design concepts, already existing designs must be checked and adjusted because of the necessary scale-up, fabrication, as well as logistics and transportation, are confronted with new challenges by the extreme dimensions and weights of the various equipment parts alone. My company has met these challenges by developing new products and putting them successfully on the market. Among these is our new vertical roller mill, which, for more than seven years now offers a highly efficient, reliable and compact raw grinding system serving high capacity modern clinker production lines. Also our new clinker cooler, as well as our modern equipment for combi-grinding facilities, represent ideal products for modern high capacity clinker production lines. Their special and unique design features secure highest operational flexibility and availability. Just recently various plants with large-sized equipment and high capacities have been commissioned, e.g. the so far worldÂ´s largest vertical roller mill for raw material grinding and a new clinker production line with a potential capacity of more than 10,000 tpd in the Middle East. Experiences gained from this give valuable feedback and know-how for the further development and installation of even bigger equipment and plants

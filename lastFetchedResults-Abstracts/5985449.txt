The main objective of this paper is to introduce a high performance natural language processing (NLP) service to fulfill the needs of researchers and users in the area of natural language computing. We consider various NLP components developed at Applied Artificial Group of C-DAC Pune, and carry out parallelization on the GARUDA grid. We demonstrate that almost linear speedup is achieved with good efficiencies. With 32 processors, we have achieved a speedup of more than 19. This allows us to offer high performance scalable NLP Web services. Further, the GARUDA grid offers high availability.

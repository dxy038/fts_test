The authors present an original scheme based on the DPCM (differential pulse code modulation) system for decreasing the redundancy contained in an image. Many computer simulations and the results can be applied to composite coding of PAL-M television signals. The basic idea is to concentrate the values before and after the quantizer to obtain a recovered image with acceptable objective and subjective quality. To achieve this target, the authors have investigated the utilization of a divider and a multiplier in the loop of traditional DPCM scheme. They obtained good performance of the scheme, taking into account the exchange between bit rate reduction efficiency and recovered picture quality

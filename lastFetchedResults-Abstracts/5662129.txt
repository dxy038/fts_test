The Glennan Microsystems Initiative is a unique public-private partnership for the research, development, and application needs of NASA and industry in micro-fabricated sensors and actuators for use in harsh environments. The Initiative couples the microsystems capabilities at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and other state universities with industry. A five-year project, the Initiative builds on existing resources in the region, and is funded jointly by NASA, the State of Ohio, industry, and others. Its major objective is to spur economic development by delivering leading edge microsystems technology to a range of manufacturing and technology-intensive companies and to NASA to meet mission requirements

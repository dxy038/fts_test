K paths ordering algorithm (KPOA) is presented for multi-protocol label switch traffic engineering. For optional paths of each ingress-egress pair, the algorithm used a learning mechanism, combined offline and online routing, and chose the LSP in terms of the residual bandwidth. The main objective of KPOA is to prevent the neglect of non-critical link which is important, and avoid choosing the overlong path, then provide an effective guarantee of QoS. The simulation shows the algorithm has improved greatly compared to both CSPF and MIRA in number of rejected requests, total bandwidth of accepted requests and computation time, is an efficient and quick routing algorithm.

Objective(s):Degradation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), as a bioactive lipid, or deregulation of its production involves in tumor progression, metastasis and chemoresistance. Since the tumor progression effects of S1P and its mechanism in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer is not fully understood, we investigated the role and one of the mechanisms of S1P in tumor progression of SKW3 and H1299 cells.
Materials and Methods: The effects of S1P on proliferation, invasion and migration was studied using MTT assay, soft-agar colony forming assay and trans-well migration assay, respectively. In order to find out the mechanisms of S1P action, the role of S1P on expression of Survivin gene was assessed by real-time RT-PCR.
Results:Our results demonstrated that although invasion was shown only in H1299 cells, low concentration of S1P, especially at 1 Î¼M, mediated proliferation and migration in both cell lines. In addition, these effects of S1P in tumor progression are S1P receptor-dependent, and Survivin plays a key role in S1P tumorigenesis.
Conclusion:Our results confirmed the involvement of S1P and its receptors in tumor progression of SKW3 and H1299. We also investigated another mechanism of S1P involved in cell survival, tumor progression, and Survivin signaling. In conclusion, data demonstrated the importance of this molecule as a target for designing new anticancer drugs such as anti-S1P monoclonal antibody for inhibiting major downstream signaling, which plays significant role in tumorigenesis.

Background: In the art of medicine, besides learning of background science, having professional skills is essential for a physician. Some studies show a feeling of dissatisfaction associated with learning professional skills in medicine graduates.

Objective: This study was performed to assess the professional skills in general practitioners of health service centers in Qazvin province.

Methods: In this descriptive study performed in 2008, the professional skills of all general practitioners working in Health Centers of Qazvin Province (I.R.Iran) including 33 medical, management and communicational skills were assessed through self-assessment method. The results were statistically analyzed, through chi square test and Phi, Cramer's V, comparison between two proportions, and contingency coefficient. P values less than 0.05 were considered as significant. Findings: Of 33 target skills in 91 general practitioners including 36 males and 55 females, lack of desirable professional skills in 16 items was found in at least half of the physicians. The skill of urinary catheterization in male and female patients, by male or female physicians, both showed significant difference (P=0.000). The relationship between the gender of physician and the skills of management of a normal vaginal delivery showed a significant difference (P=0.044) whereas such relationship between the gender and management of post delivery complications demonstrated an insignificant difference, statistically.

Conclusion: Regarding the results, revision in the contents of clinical educational courses and based on real need, increasing skills training, collecting and strict execution of "Log Book" in all clinical internship courses, establishment of "OSCE" method for assessment of skills in intern trainees, and designation of re-educative workshops for training skills in graduate physicians, are suggested.

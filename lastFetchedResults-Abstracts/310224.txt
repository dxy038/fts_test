Objective
Determine the relation of xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and the outcome of septic patients and its relation to oxidative damage and clinical parameters of sepsis severity.
Design and methods
Patients admitted over a 6-month period were enrolled. Patients were assigned to groups according to the diagnosis of sepsis (n = 8), severe sepsis (n = 28) or septic shock (n = 36). Blood samples were collected to the determination of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), protein carbonyls and XO activity.
Results
None of the studied oxidative parameters determined at the time of diagnosis were related to sepsis severity. XO activity, but not oxidative damage parameters, at the time of sepsis diagnosis was significantly higher in non-survival septic patients. In contrast, 24 h after sepsis diagnosis, XO activity was lower in non-survivors septic patients.
Conclusions
XO activity was increased in non-survivors patients and the variations in XO activity could be used for outcome prediction.

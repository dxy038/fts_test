This paper proposes a unified multi-objective fuzzy optimal power flow (UMOPF) considering total operating cost, power plants emissions, and total real power loss, with transmission line and transformer loading limits, generators ramp-rate limits, and voltage margins constraints. In the proposed UMOPF algorithm, the total system operating cost, total system emissions, including S<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>, fuzzy minimization objectives are solved simultaneously considering fuzzy line flow limit and transformer loading and generator ramp-rate limit constraints, using fuzzy linear programming (FLP). Meanwhile, the total real power loss fuzzy minimization subproblem is solved considering fuzzy bus voltage magnitude limit constraints, which is also solved by FLP. The proposed UMOPF is tested with the IEEE 30 bus system. The simulation results shown that the proposed UMOPF can efficiently and effectively trade off among total system operating cost and power plants emissions considering transmission line and transformer loading limits, and generators ramp-rate limits, with real power loss minimization considering voltage margins, in a fuzzy reasoning sense.

The definition of industry-oriented basin initial water right harmonious allocation is put forward, and the criterions of harmony analysis are constructed on the basis of system harmonious theory. Then, based on interactive decision theory, interactive objective step tradeoff coupling model is given combining interactive step tradeoff method with objective programming model, to take the knowledge on water right initial allocation of different water sectors in different regions into account, and constantly adjust the water right allocation schemes of each regional water sector in the basin, finally, new schemes of industry-oriented basin water right harmonious allocation could be gained to pass the harmony analysis, realizing industry-oriented basin initial water right harmonious allocation.

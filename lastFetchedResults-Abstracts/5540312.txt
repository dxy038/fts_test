This article presents a systematic analysis of focus functions in conventional sputum smear microscopy for tuberculosis. This is the first step in the development of automatic microscopy. Nine autofocus functions are analyzed in a set of 1200 images with varying degrees of content density. These functions were evaluated using quantitative procedures. The main accomplishment of this work was to show that an autofocus function based on variance measures produced the best results for tuberculosis images.

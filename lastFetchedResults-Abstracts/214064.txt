Reaction of 2-hydrazinocarbonyl-3-chloro-5-phenoxy-benzo[b] thiophene with different substituted phenyl isothiocyanate gave N-substituted arylthiosemi-carbazide derivatives (1a-h). 1,3,4-Thiadiazole derivatives (2a-h) were prepared by the cyclization of arylthiosemicarbazides (1a-h) with concentrated sulphuric acid. All the compounds were screened for their antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv) and antimicrobial activity against various microorganisms.

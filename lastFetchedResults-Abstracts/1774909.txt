Abstract 
Objective: The aim of this article was to review research studies conducted on home programs and to investigate the determinant factors of parental satisfaction, to summarize the available data, and to make recommendations to occupational therapists.
Methods: Databases like ‘Science Direct’ and ‘OT Seeker’ were searched for articles published from 1980 to 2011 with the keywords ‘satisfaction’ and ‘home program’. Furthermore, they were also searched for articles written by renowned OT researchers in the field, such as Gajdosic, Mayo and Novack.
Results: Studies show that many factors influence parents’ satisfaction of home programs: the family’s demographic characteristics, the mother’s attitude toward healthcare services, the program’s characteristics, the parents' perception of home programs, socio?environmental influences, characteristics of the occupational therapists providing services, the mother's attitude toward the child's disease, achievement of motor goals, parental participation in program design, the therapist’s presence in the child's home and home visits and level of family stress.
Conclusion: Parental satisfaction of a home program plays a very important role in the program’s follow-up, advancing the therapeutic goals and achievement of functional independence in children with physical disabilities. Laying greater focus on these issues can affect the results of treatment in these children. Hence therapists should aim to maximize factors leading to increased parental satisfaction and minimize its reducing factors.

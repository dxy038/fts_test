Cyanobacteria bloom occurs constantly in recent years and seriously harms the environment of people´s life. Lake Dianchi is a typical lake that has been subjected to severe eutrophication in recent years, especially in 2010. This article describes new-type, dynamic, high-quality images of Environment Satellite HJ-1 CCD applied to view cyanobacteria bloom of Lake Dianchi, ranging from November to December in 2010. One objective is to contrast the results from the methods of SIPI, RVI and NDVI to assess visual effects. Another is to improve RVI vegetation index model for better ordinal scale of cyanobacteria bloom. The results show that methods of SIPI, NDVI get better visual effects than RVI´s and pseudocolor composition´s images. This study also demonstrates that the improved RVI algorithm can stretch algae´s information for better classification.

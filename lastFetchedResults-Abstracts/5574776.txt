In the last years, some works have appeared that propose the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to obtain families of binary sequences with good correlation properties. In this paper, one of those approaches is analyzed with a double objective. First, the results obtained by GAs are compared with a set of optimal Kasami sequences, one of the best solutions known until now. Second, the convenience of considering, in the GA objective function the filtering effect of the transducers, a process that notably increases the total computing, is investigated. Finally, the performance of one of the families obtained with the GA is shown applied to a particular sensory system based on ultrasonic technology.

Survey analysis of consumers' behavior of allocating limited income to the
purchase of different goods and services is one of the important topics in economics,
which is used in economic decision making. In doing economic studies, different
methods can be used. In recent years in order to study the sensitivity of commodities
prices and the variation of real income, a great attention was given to almost ideal
demand system model. In this research, our main objective was to estimate demand
function and analysis of consumer behavior in various urban regains of Isfahan
province and average of the country in the period (1979-2005), we applied the same
technique in compound with habit formation.
The results of statistical analysis show that after the Iran-Iraq war period the
cost share of the non-food expenditure in the constant price of year 2005 were be
I.7 and 3 times the cost share of food expenditure in average of the country and
Isfahan province respectively. This indicates that in this period the economic welfare
was increasing especially in Isfahan province
Accordingly to the results ofWald Test, homogeneity and symmetry hypotheses
are rejected and habit formation is affected on consumers demand. The signs of
price elasticities were as expected for a11 commodity categories. The estimated
income elasticities indicate that in the Isfahan province the "food" and "wear
&shoes" and III the average of the country the "food" and "housing & fuel"
categories are considered as necessity and other categories are considered luxury

the main objective of this paper is to describe the developed simulation model of a determinist wire and wireless communication network for industrial applications in the real time. The means of modeling, which are based on parallel processing and data transfer for various network topologies, are discussed here. We have focused our research to WiMAX, WiFi and Industrial Ethernet communication based on Matlab mathematical dynamic models. The various types of modulations for communication data transfer are presented in this paper. The communication model shows structure of interconnection between the wire and wireless network.

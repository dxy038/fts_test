This paper first proposes a computationally efficient spatial directional interpolation scheme, which makes use of the local geometric information extracted from the surrounding blocks. The proposed error-concealment scheme produces results that are superior to those of other approaches, in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and visual quality. Then a novel approach that incorporates this directional spatial interpolation at the receiver is proposed for block-based low-bit-rate coding. The key observation is that the directional spatial interpolation at the receiver can reconstruct faithfully a large percentage of the blocks that are intentionally not sent. A rate-distortion optimal way to drop the blocks is shown. The new approach can be made compatible with standard JPEG and MPEG decoders. The block-dropping approach also has an important application for dynamic rate shaping in transmitting precompressed videos over channels of dynamic bandwidth. Experimental results show that the proposed coding and rate-shaping systems can provide significant subjective and objective gains over conventional approaches

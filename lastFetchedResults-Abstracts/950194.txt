The objective of the work reported is to study the effect of wavelength and the material removal mechanisms of a laser
process for removing copper oxide from copper. The removal of copper oxide is necessary in electronics device fabrication
in order to improve the surface wetability and so achieve a good quality solder joint. Such a laser cleaning process could be
incorporated into an existing laser soldering process. The effect of Q-switched Nd:YAG radiation at 1064 nm, 532 nm and
266 nm the first, second and fourth Nd:YAG harmonics.on the oxidised surface of a copper alloy foil was studied with
increasing fluence. The laser-treated surfaces were characterised using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy
 SEM., and static secondary ion mass spectroscopy SSIMS.. Successful oxide removal was achieved at all wavelengths
above certain thresholds that defined the lower end of the process operating window for single-pulse operation. The ablation
mechanisms involved in the removal of copper oxide from copper at 1064 nm, 532 nm and 266 nm were found to combine
both thermal and mechanical effects, the surface melting first occurring at fluences lower than those at which cleaning is
initialised. q1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Raw observations play a vital role in the meteorological and climatological studies, and using erroneous, suspected or inconsistent fields can have a crucial impact on the results. Also, without performing the quality control of meteorological data , the outcome of objective analysis may become useless, so that they can not be used as initial conditions for numerical weather prediction or climate models. Some observations received from Global Telecommunication system (GIS) include errors or inconsistencies due to different reasons. Such observational data have to be rectified or rejected before use. Here the formulation and basics of the method currently used at the forecasting center of the I.R.of Iran Meteorological Organization (IRIMO) is presented. Results show that by implementing quality control, monitoring the surface and upper air meteorological can be easily done. Also, the output of such quality control process can be used as the input to the process of objective analysis without difficulty.

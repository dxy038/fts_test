Objective: To compare lactate, bilirubin and Hemoglobin F concentrations obtained on ABL 700 series blood gas analyzers with those from laboratory methods.
Design and Method: Pooled neonatal plasma, cord blood and adult plasma samples were used for comparison of bilirubin, hemoglobin F and lactate concentrations respectively.
Results: Results obtained on the ABL 700 series compared favorably (Deming regression slopes 0.97–1.13) with those from laboratory methods. For lactate ABL (y) = 1.13 Vitros (x) –0.43 with a CI (slope) of 1.10 to 1.16, CI (int) of −0.61 to −0.28. For hemoglobin F ABL(y) = 1.11 Variant (x) –8.0 with a CI (slope) of 0.88 to 1.33, CI (int) of −25.3 to 9.3. The three bilirubin comparisons are as follows: 1) Unistat (y) = 1.10 Vitros (x) –16.12 with CI (slope) of 1.06 to 1.14 and CI (int) of −25.3 to −6.9. 2), ABL (y) = 0.97 Vitros(x) –10.16 with CI (slope) of 0.94 to 1.00 and CI (int) of −17.6 to 2.73) Unistat (y) = 1.14 (x)–4.58 with CI (slope) of 1.09 to 1.18 and CI (int) of −13.6 to 4.5
Conclusion: The ABL 700 series gave comparable results for lactate, bilirubin and hemoglobin F with laboratory methods and may be used in patient care.

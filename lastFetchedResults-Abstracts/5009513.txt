A quantitative approach is developed for modeling and analyzing objectively the perceptual performance of computer-communication networks and computer systems that involve real-time human interaction and communication with real-time streamed signals such as audio, speech, or video. The proposed ´perceptual analysis´ method is based on augmenting traditional system performance models with the incorporation of ITU-T recommended objective perceptual quality assessment methods such as PEAQ (perceived audio quality) or PESQ (perceptual evaluation of speech quality). The approach provides an avenue for including the quantitative evaluation of perceptual quality measures, such as MOS (mean opinion score), in system performance modeling. The analysis of a voice-over-IP network access link model with G.711 and G.729 multiplexed calls is presented to demonstrate a perceptual teletraffic engineering application.

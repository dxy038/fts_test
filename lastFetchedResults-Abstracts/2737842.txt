Droop schemes have traditionally been applied to the control of parallel synchronous generators in power systems. It has subsequently been brought over to the control of distributed generators (DGs) in microgrids with the same retained objective of proportional power sharing based on ratings. This objective might, however, not suit microgrids well since DGs are usually of different types, unlike synchronous generators. Other factors like cost, efficiency, and emission penalty of each DG at different loading must be considered since they contribute directly to the total generation cost (TGC) of the microgrid. To reduce this TGC without relying on fast communication links, an autonomous droop scheme is proposed here, whose resulting power sharing is decided by the individual DG generation costs. Comparing it with the traditional scheme, the proposed scheme retains its simplicity and it is hence more likely to be accepted by the industry. The reduction in TGC has been verified by experiment.

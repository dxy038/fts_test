Lateral transshipments policy of repairable spare parts among the same echelon departments has an important function to improve the availability of the weapon equipment in the multi-echelon support system. The multi-echelon inventory model with lateral transshipments was researched in this paper. In the mathematical model, the minimum value of expected backorders under the constraint of support budget was used as optimizing objective, and the model was analyzed through the simulation of a practical instance.

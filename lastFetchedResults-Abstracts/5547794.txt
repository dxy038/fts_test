OFDM has been recognized as a promising technique for providing high spectral efficiency in future wireless system. In this paper, a novel optimization technique, the Estimation Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is proposed for multi-objective optimization of OFDM systems resources. The performance and effectiveness of the optimizer are analyzed and compared with the state of art NSGA II and multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm.

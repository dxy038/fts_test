Thriving Systems Theory is an emergent design quality framework encompassing both traditional objective metrics and the subjective, aesthetics. It draws theories of design quality in physical architecture originated by Christopher Alexander, the patriarch of design patterns, into the domain of models and information systems. Thriving Systems TheoryÂ´s fifteen choice properties is an extended taxonomy of systems design characteristics that explicate the experience of satisfaction realized between observer and artifact. The properties also denote design actions that shape that experience. This paper summarizes the synthesis of Thriving Systems Theory, its applicability to information systems, its conformance to the anatomy of a design theory, and the ongoing efforts to demonstrate its contribution to the advancement of design practice.

The intake of pectin has been reported as healthful for people with risk of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover this is a known fiber able to reduce plasmatic cholesterol. But this hydrocolloid is low compatible with gels from muscle proteins. Only amidated low methoxyl pectins (ALMP) have been reported as adequate to increase mechanical properties of restructured fish products. Striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) is an abundant subutilized fish in the Gulf of Mexico. The objective of this work was to determine the effect of the degree of amidation of ALMP in the functional and mechanical properties of restructured fish products from striped mullet. Different concentration of pectin (0 as control, 10, 20, 30 or 50 g/kg) and three degree of amidation (5%, 10% or 25%) were studied. Fish pastes were incubated at 40 °C for 30 min before cooking at 90 °C for 20 min. Backward extrusion, expressible water and color of fish paste were analyzed and treated gels were characterized by changes in mechanical properties (texture profile analysis, puncture test and torsion test), expressible water and color. Results obtained suggest that ALMP with higher level of amidation increased mechanical properties and the water holding capacity of fish gels. Gels containing up to 50 g/kg of 25% ALMP showed adequate mechanical and functional properties with almost no changes perceptible in color attributes. ALMP can be used to offer to consumers healthier fish foods, which have high content in proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids and pectin and low content in cholesterol.

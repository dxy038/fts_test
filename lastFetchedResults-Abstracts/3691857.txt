The objective of this work is to enhance the mobility of small mobile robots by enabling them to link into a train configuration capable of crossing relatively large obstacles. In particular, we are building on Millibots, semiautonomous, tracked mobile sensing/communication platforms at the 5-cm scale previously developed at Carnegie Mellon University. The Millibot Train concept provides couplers that allow the Millibot modules to engage/disengage under computer control and joint actuators that allow lifting of one module by another and control of the whole train shape in two dimensions. A manually configurable train prototype demonstrated the ability to climb standard stairs and vertical steps nearly half the train length. A fully functional module with powered joints has been developed and several have been built and tested. Construction of a set of six modules is well underway and will allow testing of the complete train in the near future. This paper focuses on the development, design, and construction of the electromechanical hardware for the Millibot Train.

In this paper, the movement coupling between manipulator and spacecraft is proposed. The dynamic equations of space manipulator are established efficiently by the spatial operator algebra method. The functions of the joint variable are parameterized by polynomial interpolation method and objective function for maximum load carrying capacity is developed. In considering multiple constraints, maximum load path planning for space manipulator is achieved based on genetic algorithm. Simulations are performed in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for a 7-DOF space manipulator in point-to-point task.

A new soft-switched bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed in the paper. The proposed converter can operate with soft-switching, a continuous inductor current, fixed switching frequency, and the switch stresses of a conventional PWM converter regardless of the direction of power flow. These features are due to a very simple auxiliary circuit that is operational regardless of the direction of power flow. In the paper, the operation and design of the converter are discussed and its feasibility is confirmed with experimental results obtained from a prototype.

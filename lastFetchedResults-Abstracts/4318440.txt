Mobile Patient Monitoring Systems (MPMS) enable the patients with chronic diseases to monitor themselves during their daily lives. However, the development of MPMS is very complex. To overcome this problem, the MPMS framework was introduced as an ideal reuse technique to overcome the development complexity of MPMS. While a few studies have designed such frameworks, reusability was neither considered in the design of these frameworks nor evaluated. This is despite the fact that reusability is among the primary characteristics that distinguish successful frameworks. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the design of MPMS framework taking into account the reusability concept and to evaluate the reusability of a presented MPMS framework. To achieve this objective, the framework reusability evaluation method was used. The results show that the framework reusability is satisfied.

Background-Atherosclerosis is one of the most prevalent diseases in developed countries and is becoming an area of increasing concern in other parts of the world. Trace elements, which play a vital role in health and disease, have been the subject of several investigations concerning their role in the etiology of coronary heart disease in the recent years. Objective- In order to compare the status of serum zinc, copper, chromium and nickel as well as levels of TG, TC, LDL and HDL-C in male and female patients with atherosclerosis with normal controls, this study was performed. Methods-Serum levels of the above mentioned elements in sixty patients with angiography proven stenosis of more than 50% in the four major coronary arteries were obtained. The levels were compared with those of 30 normal controls. Results-Total mean level of serum Zn for the patients was significantly lower than that of controls (p=0.016) and a significant difference was observed in male patients as compared to male controls (p=0.006). This difference was also observed in the female study group (p<0.001). Total mean Cu was significantly higher in patients (p=0.004), and this difference was reflected in both males and females (p<0.01 and p<0.001 respectively). There was no significant difference in the levels of Ni between patients and controls (p>0.05), even though the mean level was found to be higher in patients. This result was also found to differ according to sex. Analysis of Cr revealed lower levels in the patient group as compared to controls but again this difference was not significantly different (p>0.05). TG, TC and LDL-C were elevated in patients and HDL-C was lower in our patients, but not significantly (p>0.05). Conclusion-Deficiency or suboptimal levels of micronutriants may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis.

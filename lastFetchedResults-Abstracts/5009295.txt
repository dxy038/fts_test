By understanding the process of threat assessment, the evaluation parameters, which affect threat level, have been analyzed comprehensively. Then the threat assessment of the Bayesian network model has been established. The dynamic Bayesian network reasoning method is used to estimate threat so that the objective factors and individual characteristics of different time slices of the same characteristics can correct each other. This method overcomes the subjectivity and uncertainty of expert assessment partially. Simulation results show that the threat level based on dynamic Bayesian network evaluation algorithm is an effective assessment algorithm, the results can more accurately reflect the true source of the threat level of threat.

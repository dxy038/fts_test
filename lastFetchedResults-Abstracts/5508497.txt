Wireless grids bring more challenging issues of resource allocation and task scheduling, and mobility and power management are major additional concerns in a wireless grid. Based on a proxy-based architecture, a hierarchical scheduling model is proposed to efficiently utilize the energy of wireless nodes with respect to quality of service (QoS). The first level scheduler is responsible for mapping tasks among proxy-nodes and other fixed grid nodes; the second will conduct scheduling in each proxy-centric wireless domain. Under the guidance of four principles suitable for the intermittence, the first level performs overall scheduling based on the FIFS algorithm (first input first service). After modeling a consumed power objective function, a revised min-min heuristic algorithm is enforced to the second level in order to efficiently map tasks to wireless devices. In the latter algorithm, mobile node selection is targeted to minimize the energy consumed due to communication and computation, and its last solution is evaluated to guarantee requirement for the task deadline. This research simulation suggests that the power-aware hierarchical scheduling improves energy utilization of the overall system, and also decreases the ratio of failure of scheduled tasks in wireless grids

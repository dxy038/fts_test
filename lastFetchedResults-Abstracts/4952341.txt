Convergence towards, and diversity across the Pareto-optimal front are the two main requirements when optimising a multiobjective optimisation problem (MOP) with conflicting objectives. Most established multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have mechanisms that address these requirements. However, in many-objective optimisation, where the number of objectives is greater than 2 or 3, it has been found that these two requirements can conflict with one another, introducing problems such as dominance resistance and speciation. In this study, a previously introduced diversity management mechanism is deployed within a Progressive Preference Articulation (PPA) technique to optimise an 8-objective real-world problem of aircraft control system design. This paper illustrates the effective application of the new diversity management mechanism used in conjunction with the PPA technique when optimising a multiobjective real-world engineering problem.

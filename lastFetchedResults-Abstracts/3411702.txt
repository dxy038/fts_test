A new approach to error concealment is presented which exploits both spatial and temporal information from the current and previous frames. The technique consists of two stages, motion vector estimation and enhancement of the estimated motion vector. In the first stage the proposed method estimates a replacement for the corrupted motion vector by applying dynamic weights to related motion vectors from the top, bottom, left and right sub-macroblocks. The estimated motion vectors are then enhanced using a new approach based on edge detection in the second stage. The experimental results for several test video sequences are compared with conventional error concealment methods and higher performance is achieved in both objective peak signal-to-noise ratio measurements and subjective visual quality.

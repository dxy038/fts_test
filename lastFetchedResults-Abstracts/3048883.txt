This paper deals with robust performance and transient response of H<sub>&#8734;</sub>/&#956; DIA control for magnetic suspension systems. H<sub>&#8734;</sub> DIA control is an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control problem which treats a mixed disturbance and an initial-state uncertainty attenuation (DIA) and supplies H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controls with good transients. H<sub>&#8734;</sub> DIA controller has a good initial response property, however its robust performance might be improved. We propose H<sub>&#8734;</sub>/&#956; DIA control which is to find a multi-objective controller to achieve both the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> DIA condition for good initial responses/transient responses and the structured singular value &#956; condition for robust performance. We apply this proposed approach to magnetic suspension systems, and design a robust controller, which has both good properties. Finally simulation and experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed control system design framework.

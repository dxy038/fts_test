Summary form only as follows. In porous ceramics, we control the material space structure in meso size and it will be about filtering objective virus and bacteria at lower energy, separating target gas from a mixture of gases, sifting aimed liquid from the same molecular weight liquids. We introduce the outline of several products that is, a water purification system with ceramic membrane, diesel particulate filter with silicon carbide, sodium sulfur battery with &#946;-alumina ceramics and their problems. We present several studies, that is, molecular filtering with zeolite, and a new porosity process with sol-gel for low emission to the environment.

This paper proposes a new design for in-door autonomous artificial landmark, named IR Coding. The main objective of using this design is to offer auto-calibration for mobile robot, and reduce the computational and hardware cost. Also, the design does not require any start-up configurations. Moreover, a numerical sequence can be obtained from the IR coding directly rather than computing it by the robot which is useful in detecting different kinds of error like miss-reading and missing landmark error. Furthermore, a comparison is done between other artificial landmark designs and IR coding in order to show the advantages of IR coding design.

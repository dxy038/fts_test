Combined the characteristic of simulated annealing, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm based on simulated annealing. We take the advantage of simulated annealing, improve the traditional multi-objective genetic algorithm, and avoid the premature convergence of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm improve the solution efficiency of the traditional multi-objective genetic algorithm, and avoid the premature convergence of the algorithm effectively.

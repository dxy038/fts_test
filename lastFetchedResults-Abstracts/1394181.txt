Viscoelastic damping material attached on the surface of a structure is widely used to suppress the resonance vibration in aerospace, automobiles, and various other applications. A full treatment of damping material is not an effective method because the damping effect is not significantly increased compared to that obtained by an effective partial damping treatment. In addition, the weight of the structure is increased significantly, which can cause poor system performance. Topology optimization is recently implemented in order to find an effective optimal damping treatment. The objective function is maximization of the damping effect (i.e. the modal loss factor) and the constraint is a maximum allowable volume of damping material. In this paper we compare the modal loss factors obtained by topology optimization to the ones obtained by other approaches, in order to determine which approach provides a better damping treatment (i.e. higher value of the modal loss factor). As a result, topology optimization provides about up to 61.14 per cent higher modal loss factor, as confirmed by numerical example. The numerical model for finite element analysis and topology optimization is also experimentally validated by comparing the numerical results to the experimental modal loss factors.

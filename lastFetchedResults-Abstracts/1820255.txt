Objective
ses of spheno-occipital synchondroses to direct tensile stress have not been identified before. This study was, therefore designed to evaluate expression of PTHrP, and thickness of hypertrophic zone in spheno-occipital synchondroses in response to such stress, using mouse in vitro model.
s
-occipital synchondroses together with adjacent structures were excised from fifty-five 2-day-old mice that were randomly assigned to 6 control and 5 experimental groups for 5 experimental periods (n = 5). In the experimental groups, tensile force of 0.2 g was applied across the synchondroses, using helical springs. In 5 control groups, the springs were made inactive. Both groups were then cultured for 6, 24, 48, 72 h and 7 days. Another control group was cultured without any springs for 7 days to compare with natural growth of the synchondroses from a group of five 9-day-old mice. Alcian blue-PAS staining was used to study growth of the synchondroses; immunohistochemical staining to identify PTHrP and type X collagen expression. The area of PTHrP expression and thickness of hypertrophic zone, demarcated by type X collagen expression, were measured.
s
tative analysis showed that PTHrP expression increased significantly at hour 24 of the force application in the experimental group (p &lt; 0.05), then reduced from hour 24 to 72 with a significant drop from hour 24 to 48 (p &lt; 0.01); and the thickness of hypertrophic zone significantly increased at hour 48 (p &lt; 0.01).
sions
ndings suggested that the growth of spheno-occipital synchondroses could be modified by tensile stress; and a light continuous force could enhance its growth, as evidenced by an increase in PTHrP expression and thickness of hypertrophic zone.

The main objective of this study is to investigate the impact of inflationary environment on the degree of exchange rate pass through in Iran over the period 1975-2009. For this purpose, first high and low inflation regimes has been derived using the Markovâ€“Switching model and then, the impact of inflationary environments on exchange rate pass through to export prices have been estimate using Johansen-johansen juselius cointegration technique. The empirical findings show that the environment inflationary impact has symmetric effects on the degree of exchange rate pass- through to export prices a, so that the high inflationary environment, the degree of exchange rate pass through is 0.77% and low inflationary environment, the degree of cross rates of exchange is 0.51 percent. Also, the empirical results show that marginal cost of partners and openness have a positive and negative and significant impact on the export prices in Iran, respectively. The overall conclusion is that in the high inflationary environment, the degree of exchange rates pass-through has been increased and consequently export competitiveness has declined. Therefore, the rise in exchange rates, especially in high inflationary environment there is not suitable policy for export development.

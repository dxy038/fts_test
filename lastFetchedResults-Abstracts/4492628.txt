This paper discusses and compares three types of undervoltage load shedding closed-loop controllers in terms of performances and design computational effort. The authors first describe the various controllers and identify the parameters to be optimized. Next, they present an optimization methodology applicable to all three types of controllers. This approach allows to find the controller parameters which optimize an overall performance objective. Results are presented on the Hydro-Quebec system, in which load shedding is presently planned

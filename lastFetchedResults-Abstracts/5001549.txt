This paper presents the synthesis, the implementation and the performance evaluation of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) Stop-&amp;-Go (S&amp;G) design. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is adopted, enabling hybrid control synthesis. Performance of the controller is evaluated, distinguishing between comfort of the resulting longitudinal vehicle behavior and the behavior due to traffic requirements. Comfort is related to vestibularly detectable variables, whereas required behaviour is related to visually and auditorily detectable variables. Metrics are determined to enable objective performance evaluation of an ACC (S&amp;G) system in a qualitative manner.

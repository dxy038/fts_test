Selection of supply chain partners is an important decision involving multiple criteria and risk factors. This paper proposes a fuzzy multi-objective programming model to decide on supplier selection taking risk factors into consideration. We model a supply chain consisting of three levels and use simulated historical quantitative and qualitative data. We propose a possibility approach to solve the fuzzy multi-objective programming model. Possibility multi-objective programming models are obtained by applying possibility measures of fuzzy events into fuzzy multi-objective programming models. Results indicate when qualitative criteria are considered in supplier selection, the probability of a certain supplier being selected is affected.

In this study, a novel hybrid active power filter (HAPF) with injection circuit is proposed. It shows great promise in reducing harmonics and improving the power factor with a relatively low-capacity active power filter (APF). As a project in a copper-foil factory in eastern China, the parameters design method of HAPF with injection circuit is put forward here. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to optimise the design of the output filter parameters, which can meet the requirement of the whole harmonic cancelling system better than the ones designed just by experience. This study focuses on the stability of the power system, so the resonance characteristic of the system when the passive power filter works is discussed particularly. This method can help design the other kind of filtering system for high-capacity applications. A 3600-kvar HAPF prototype with 200-kvar APF has been developed for the copper mill. Both simulation and application results have shown that the proposed HAPF is good in harmonics elimination and reactive power compensation.

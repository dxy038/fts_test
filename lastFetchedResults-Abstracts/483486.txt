Populus is a deciduous tree which covered a wide area of plantation forest and gardens. The objective of this study was separation and identification of compounds produced of pyrolysis of populous wood at fixed bed reactor under an inert gas atmosphere (nitrogen) at 300-350 oC. The pyrolysis temperature was ramped at 30 oC/s to end temperature (300 or 350 oC) and kept for 1 hour at this temperature. Separation and identification of compounds at bio-oil treated with N,o- bis (trimetil sailil) trifloeroa.setamid (BSTFA) were done by using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) technique. Five compounds were identified at 300 oC. The most important compound identified in wood at this range was 1,2 banzan dicarbocsilic acid bis (2 ethil hexil) ester. And at 350 oC was galactoronic acid. The other important compounds observed at 300 oC were pantanoeic acid and levoglocosan and at 350oC were galactoronic acid, tricosan and 1, 2 banzan dicarbocsilic acid bis (2ethil hexil) ester

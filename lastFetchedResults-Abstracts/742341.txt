Objective: To compare the safety, tolerability, and antihypertensive efficacy of valsartan with enalapril at different altitudes. Method: A total of 142 adult Colombian outpatients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were recruited in 3 cities at different altitudes (Bogotá at 2600 m, Medellín at 1538 m and Barranquilla at 100 m) and randomized in an open label fashion to receive either valsartan 80 mg once daily or enalapril 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Those patients not responding at 4 weeks received additional 1.25 mg indapamide daily during the remaining trial period. The primary efficacy variable was the change in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) from baseline to 4 weeks. Secondary efficacy variables included the change in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP). The primary criterion for tolerability was the incidence of adverse experiences. Results: Both valsartan and enalapril reduced mean SDBP and SSBP with similar efficacy, independent of altitude. Adverse events irrespective of relationship to trial drug were reported by 12 patients (18.8%) on valsartan and by 15 (23.4%) patients on enalapril. Enalapril was associated with a significantly (P<0.05) higher rate of dry cough and more cases of headache than valsartan. Conclusions: Valsartan 80 mg once daily is as effective as enalapril 20 mg once daily in reducing blood pressure, with tolerability profile at least as good as enalapril’s.

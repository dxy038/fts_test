In this paper a new approach to information storage and retrieval using cellular neural networks is developed. The objective is achieved by considering a suitable discrete-time model of these networks and by designing them so that the input information are fed via external inputs rather than initial conditions. The technique, which exploits globally asymptotically stable networks, leads to a facilitation of their hardware implementation

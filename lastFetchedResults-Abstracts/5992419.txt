This paper describes the issues involved in designing and implementing a large-scale cooperative object database server for collaborative virtual environment. Participants presented in the environment may include humans and computer artifacts. The focus of this paper is the distributing factor and communication model between nodes. In DIVINE, all objects will be decentralized and scattered among three tiers of object databases. By limiting knowledge and refining tasks for each server the network and processor workload can be reduced. The objective of the system is to provide a virtual environment for distributed computing with N+1 fault tolerant and subject to expansion without interruption of services.

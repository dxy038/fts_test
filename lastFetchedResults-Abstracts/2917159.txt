The paper presents a methodology for optimizing the design of large, complex, real-time systems in distributed and parallel processing environments. It can be used as a front-end component in a prototyping process providing increased capabilities for system engineers. The method incorporates various optimization approaches including: heuristic, probabilistic, deterministic, and hybrids. These approaches are applied to the system design structuring techniques and resource allocation techniques to perform optimization and trade-off based on the classes of rules, classes of objective functions, classes of algorithms, sets of analytical equations, and sets of probabilistic reasoning, This method optimizes the system design structure and generates a near-optimal allocation of the logical systems functions onto the implementation resources to meet the overall system requirements

The Nagaoka University of technology established the concept known as Gigaku in 1976. The Gigakuman project was created in order to help people understand the meaning of Gigaku. Starting with the design of a character, the objective of this project is to use Gigakuman, his emotions and expressions to create a link with people. This will make possible for Gigaku to be known and accepted worldwide. To portray the correct emotions in a character and to see the reactions of people to his emotions, two surveys were made. The analyzed results will help us create a character with which people can relate and bond to.

In this paper, a capital budgeting problem for preventive measures of workplace mobbing based on fuzzy 0â€“1 bidimensional knapsack model with non-financial and financial budget limits is proposed. The weights to be used as the objective function coefficients of the model are obtained from analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methodology that incorporates possible causes of workplace mobbing on criteria level, and possible preventive measures on alternatives level of AHP hierarchy. The quantification of non-financial and financial budgets as well as non-financial and financial costs is developed based on their relative weights. In deterministic model, the relative weights are directly used, whereas in fuzzy model, they are quantified. The defuzzification of the fuzzy model is proposed to be made by using t-norm and t-conorm fuzzy relations which are expected to give the most optimistic, and the most pessimistic results, respectively. The results of the hypothetical example verify the expectations.

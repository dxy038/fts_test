In conventional multibeam satellite systems, frequency and polarization orthogonalization have been traditionally employed for mitigating interbeam interference. However, the paradigm of multibeam joint precoding allows for full frequency reuse while assisting beam-edge users. In this paper, the performance of linear beamforming is investigated in terms of meeting traffic demands. More importantly, generic linear constraints are considered over the transmit covariance matrix in order to model the power pooling effect which can be implemented through flexible traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAS) or multiport amplifiers. The performance of this scheme is compared against conventional spotbeam systems based on the rate-balancing objective. In this context, it is shown that significantly higher spectral efficiency can be achieved through beamforming, while flexible power constraint offers better rate-balancing.

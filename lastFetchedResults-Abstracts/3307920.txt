In computerized tomography, one of the major problems in most optimization algorithms that use some form of regularization is to determine the weighting parameter (RP) for the regularizing component within the objective function. Typically this parameter is selected manually by some previous experimentation that involves varying the RP values, a highly time consuming process. The objective of this work was to present an iterative algorithm that dynamically optimizes RP within each iteration and eliminates the need for performing any exhaustive experimentation to find proper regularization parameter values.

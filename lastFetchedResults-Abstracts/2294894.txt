In this paper we summarize the work done at ONERA in order to develop comprehensive models for solid energetic materials in combustion. The viewpoint adopted here is to give “a hierarchy” for modeling the combustion of solid propellant without developing the mathematical descriptions. The objective is to underline the evolution of the combustion modeling at ONERA through the simplified approaches, based on simple physical and geometrical approximations of the studied phenomena, and the new approaches based on numerical simulations. The propellants that we are concerned with comprise HMX-GAP and AP particles embedded in a binder such as HTPB.

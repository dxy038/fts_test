The objective of the study was to identify factors associated with satisfaction among inpatients receiving medical and surgical care for cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary and locomotor system diseases.

Two weeks after discharge, 533 patients completed a Patient Judgments Hospital Quality questionnaire covering seven dimensions of satisfaction (admission, nursing and daily care, medical care, information, hospital environment and ancillary staff, overall quality of care and services, recommendations/intentions). Patient satisfaction and complaints were treated as dependent variables in multivariate ordinal polychotomous and dichotomous logistic stepwise regressions, respectively. Patient sociodemographic, health and stay characteristics as well as organization/activity of service were used as independent variables.

The two strongest predictors of satisfaction for all dimensions were older age and better self-perceived health status at admission. Men tended to be more satisfied than women. Other predictors specific for certain dimensions of satisfaction were: married, Karnofsky index more than 70, critical/serious self-reported condition at admission, emergency admission, choice of hospital by her/himself, stay in a medical service, stay in a private room, length of stay less than one week, stay in a service with a mean length of stay longer than one week.

The factors associated with inpatient satisfaction elucidated in this study may be helpful in interpreting patient satisfaction scores when comparing hospitals, services or time periods, in targeting patient groups at risk of worse experiences and in focusing care quality programs.

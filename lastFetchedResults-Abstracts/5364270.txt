In this paper we present an ultra low-voltage bidirectional and continuous time current mirror based on clocked semi-floating-gate transistors. The current mirror may be used with supply voltages down to 250 mV and frequencies up to several hundred MHz. The simulated data presented are obtained using the Spectre simulator provided by Cadence and valid for a 90 nm TSMC CMOS process.

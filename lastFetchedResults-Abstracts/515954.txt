Increasing urban network has both positive (accessibility) and negative (air pollution) impacts. In this research air quality is chosen as key elements with respect to their critical roles in quality of life and urban health. The overall objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model to plan appropriate locations for residential landuses and urban transportation network development to address one issue- air quality. Arak, a developing city in Iran has been chosen as a case study. Methodology of this study helps to select suitable sites for development of urban transportation network and residential zones. GIS as a powerful tool is applied for layers overlaying and interpretation of several scenarios. The results show the mathematical model, with acceptable accuracy, can be applied for the establishment of urban transportation network in proportion to residential zones. Based on the suitability maps, approximately around all main roads, there are non-suitable residential zones located in potential polluted areas. It will be dangerous for human health of residents. This research has successfully managed development of a scientific approach for current and future model development that can be employed in transportation planning and residential landuse suitability assessment at both the local and national structure plan levels.

Fiber optic deep sea telemetry opens new windows to the very remote deep sea regions, which cover 50% of the earthÂ´s surface. A novel and low cost system using analogue and digital fiber optic data transfers was installed on the German RV &#8220;SONNE&#8221; on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBW) in November 1995. The telemetry comprises 3-5 colour TV channels of 10 MHz bandwidth each. Up to 16 digital data channels provide for 19.2 kbit/s each. The bidirectional transfer is made at 1310/1550 nm wavelength in a monomode stepped index fiber with a 9 &#956;m core and a 125 pm cladding. The glassfiber runs in a coaxial copper cable which transfers power at 1000 VAC, 1.3 A, used for illumination. Preliminary performance from test cruises in 1995/96 and upgrade opportunities of this cost effective system are shown as well as the full scale potential of an all digital, high data rate (GBit/s) system and its applications, in deepsea environments and beyond

The objective of the present work is to improve the output waveform of three level inverters used in high-power applications, where the switching frequency is very low. This is achieved by maintaining the synchronization, half-wave symmetry, quarter-wave symmetry, and three-phase symmetry in the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveforms. The principles of achieving synchronization and symmetries in terms of space vectors for three level inverters are presented. A novel synchronized space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) algorithms is proposed and verified experimentally. The experimental waveforms of the inverter output voltage and motor no load current for different operating conditions of the drive are presented. The performance measure in terms of the weighted total harmonic distortion (THD) of the line voltage is computed for the linear modulation region of the drive for the proposed algorithm and compared with that of synchronized SVPWM and synchronized sine-triangle pulsewidth modulation (SPWM) technique. The comparative results show that consideration of synchronization and symmetry results in improved THD. Another significant feature of the proposed algorithm is that the symmetry and synchronization leads to self-balancing of the direct current (dc) bus capacitor voltages over every one third cycle of the fundamental

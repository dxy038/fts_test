In this paper, we have overviewed the recent works on polarization antenna designs in our research group. Three multi-polarization antennas are presented for the wireless local area networks (WLAN) diversity application. Firstly, a low-profile tri-polarization antenna is introduced for improvement of channel capacity in rich multi-path propagation environment, compared with traditional dual-polarization antennas. Considering other requirements of polarization diversity antenna, such as wide bandwidth, high ports isolation and bidirectional radiation pattern, a hybrid feeds patch antenna and a slot antenna with single compact feed are proposed. The simulated and measured results of the three antennas show the good performance in polarization diversity and the potential use of WLAN application.

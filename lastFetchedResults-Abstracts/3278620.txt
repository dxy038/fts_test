MIMO-OFDM is known for its novelty and capability for higher data rate transmission and has been an effective multicarrier transmission technique over frequency selective channels. However, its vulnerability to frequency offset (FO), has wiped out the orthogonality of the subcarriers and lead to inter-carrier interference (ICI) which degrades the system performance. The system performance will also be affected by the Inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to severe frequency selective fading (FSF) from a time delay at the receiver induced from multipath channel between transmitter and receiver. In order to overcome ICI and ISI a new subcarrier mapping (quarter) intercarrier interference self-cancellation (ICI-SC) scheme STFBC with an equalization technique is appended at the receiver to filter and compensate the ICI and ISI effects. The objective of this paper is to evaluate Pair-wise error probability (PEP) performance using a new quarter method subcarrier mapping ICI-SC scheme STFBC MIMO OFDM with added linear equalizer at the receiver for ICI and ISI reduction. The result indicates that the Pair-wise error probability (PEP) has improved better over STFBC MIMO-OFDM system by using quarter subcarrier mapping scheme (ICI-SC) with equalizer compared to existing available subcarrier mapping scheme, and efficient bandwidth with maximum diversity can be achieved.

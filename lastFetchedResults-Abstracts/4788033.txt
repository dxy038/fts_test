The paper researches Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) for anti-jam based on adaptive signal processing. The traditional adaptive processing algorithms usually obtain the partial optimum solution, but paper proposes ant colony algorithm (ACA) can find the desired solution which is a global search method. According to the theory of adaptive signal processing and minimal mean square error (MMSE) criterion, we find the objective function of ACA and found its mathematical model. We define the space of weight vector and deduce the step of ACA in detail in order to compute multidimensional weight vector of element of array antenna. The simulation results show ACA is adapt to adaptive anti-jam technology and can effectively suppress the multi-jam. By comparing with other algorithms, ACA shows the better performance of suppressing interference and protecting desired signal.

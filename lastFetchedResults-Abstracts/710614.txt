Objective
The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) in adolescents presenting for cervical colposcopy in an adolescent gynecology office.
Materials and methods
We conducted a retrospective chart review from 1999 to 2002 of the concomitant diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and VIN in our private general pediatric and adolescent practice in patients younger than 22 years of age who underwent cervical colposcopy as well as evaluation of the vulva secondary to gross and microscopic visualized lesions.
Results
Sixty-one patients underwent colposcopy for abnormal Pap smears; we found a 10% overall prevalence of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. Forty-four percent (n = 27) underwent concomitant evaluation of the vulva; from these, 22% (n = 6) fulfilled the characteristics of vulvar and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
Conclusion
In the presence of cervical cytology abnormalities, VIN may be more common than recognized and careful screening is definitely warranted.

Constructing effective material corridors is very important to optimize the regional economic environment The paper analyzes the function and effect of regional corridors of material flow. Then the relationship between the layout of regional material corridors and the improvement of timing effect are studied, with the view to the conditions with or not without constraints of capacity. The bi-level planning model is applied to finding an optimal layout of material corridors in which objective is minimizing the total timing effect, and the algorithms are developed to obtain the optimal solutions.

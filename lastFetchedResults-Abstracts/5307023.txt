Conducting concrete mix proportion design and experiment by uniform design; enabling the formula to fit with the experimental data through stepwise regression analysis; paying attention to the economic cost as the objective function; achieving the optimization of concrete mix proportion by using multiobjective programming methods. Mixing concrete by following these methods, one can reduce the cost, save energy and produce considerable practical value in projects.

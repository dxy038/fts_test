Service-Oriented Architecture is an architectural model that aims to enhance the efficiency, agility, and productivity of an enterprise by structuring services in terms of services compositions, which can be executed either synchronously or asynchronously. Such architectures should meet the main dependability requirements (e.g. high availability, high reliability). The objective of this work is to describe a software infrastructure, called WSCA-DRIP, that operates in the communication between a web serviceÂ´s clients and the web service itself, in order to implement fault tolerance techniques that make effective use of exception handling of undependable existing services. Also, the proposed solution lies in systems structuring in terms of a collaborative realization of a given function by composed web services and a fault tolerance strategy by means of cooperative exception handling. Finally, the WSCA-DRIP infrastructure will be designed to be remotely accessible via web services technology, so that it can be easily reused during the implementation of different web services-based service oriented architectures.

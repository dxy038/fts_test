Point data of weather stations are not important in and by themselves. Therefore, it is necessary_to change these point data into regional information. Undesirable distribution of weather stations and their data deficiency hinder the direct determination of the regional information, unless sufficient data in the study area could be provided. Providing extra data using the geostatistical methods is practical, scientific, simple and quick, but adopting a suitable method is the basic question. The objective of the present study is to find a suitable method to estimate monthly rainfalI in the central region of Iran. In this regard, the methods of kriging (ordinary kriging, log-kriging, co-kriging), weighted moving average (WMA, with the power of 1 to 5), thin plate smoothing splines (TPSS, with the power of 2 and 3 and with covariable) were used. Cross validation technique was used to compare these methods.
Based on the variography analysis, the range of influence of monthly rainfall in the central region is about 450 km. The results show that TPSS, with the power of 2 and with elevation as a covariable, was the most accurate method to estimate monthly rainfall. In addition, it is preferable to use the selected interpolation method in the sub-basins with homogeneous climates instead of considering the whole region.

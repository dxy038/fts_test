Energy efficiency is a very important criterion for the wireless sensor networks. The technology of data aggregation can be adopted to decrease the power costs of redundancy information and delay time. In this paper, we proposed an optimization data aggregation routing algorithm based on ant colony schema (ACAR) using agent collaboration and migration for wireless sensor networks. A number of ant-like mobile agents traverse the wireless sensor network in search of data aggregation paths between given source-destination node pairs while seeking to fulfill a set of requirements (the path objective) provided by the owner/producer of the agents. Our simulation results show that our algorithms perform well in energy efficient compared with directed diffusion protocol.

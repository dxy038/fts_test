Study Objective: To test the hypothesis that atypical cytology (ASCUS) portends ominous histologic diagnoses during adolescence.
Methods: The prevalence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) was determined in a racially diverse group of thirty-six 14- to 21-year-olds who were undergoing colposcopic evaluation of ASCUS cytology. The prevalence of 10 widely accepted risk factors for SIL was also qualified.
Results: SILs were detected in biopsies obtained from 20 (56%) of the 36 study subjects. There were 15 (39%) low-grade SILs and 5 (17%) high-grade SILs. No single risk factor or combination of risk factors distinguished subjects with SIL histology from those with more benign diagnoses.
Conclusion: The hypothesis was supported. More than half (56%) of the adolescents we studied with ASCUS cytology had SIL histology. The findings suggest that immediate colposcopic evaluation may be prudent for adolescents with ASCUS cytology that cannot be attributed to concurrent lower genital tract infections.

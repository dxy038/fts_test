This work provides a comparative report on intrinsic parallel programming (IPP) methodologies: Structured, Descriptive, and Component-based. Its main objective is lo develop an aid for programmers that will allow them to select suitable tools which will enable them to construct hardware-independent application programs. It is true that every problem addressed using parallel methods does not necessarily employ IPP methodologies. Nonwithstanding, however, the hardware-independence of IPP methods makes them particularly suitable for software development in heterogeneous parallel arid distributed systems. This comparison ranks the three programming paradigms using a pairwise method. The rating criteria is thus; maturity, adoption, implicitness, and standardization; all having equal weights. It is concluded that structured parallelism is the highest ranked methodology.

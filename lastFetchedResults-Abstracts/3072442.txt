In this paper, we propose a distributed packet processing algorithm on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network with the objective to minimize the total processing time. We consider an arbitrary P2P network comprising heterogeneous nodes interconnected via heterogeneous links. Each node on the network has its own local workload to be processed and is ready to share its extra processing power among other peer nodes upon request. We distribute the workload of a host to its peers by organizing them into an efficient resource tree. Since the key idea of this algorithm is to effectively share the available resources on the network by processing the load in a distributed manner, we refer to this approach as resource sharing distributed load processing (RSDLP) algorithm. We evaluate the performance with rigorous simulation experiments under generic system parameters.

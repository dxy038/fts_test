The objective is to propose an immune distributed competitive problem solver using MHC and an immune network and to verify its validity by means of computer simulations. Our algorithm solves the division-of-labor issues and problems for each agent work domain in a multi-agent system (MPS) by two immune functions. First, the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) distinguishes &#8220;self&#8221; from &#8220;nonself&#8221;, used in the process of eliminating states of competition. Second, the immune network that produces specific antibodies by modification of immune cells is used to produce adaptive behaviors for agents. Then, to investigate the validity of the proposed method, this algorithm is applied to the &#8220;N-th agent travelling salesmen problem (n-TSP)&#8221; as a typical case problem for multi-agent systems. The effectiveness of solving multi-agent system problems in this way is clarified through some simulations

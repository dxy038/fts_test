The objective of this study was to compare the effect of various experimental factors on the photoisomerization of nitrobenzaldehyde. The experimental factors included light source, light energy, exposure time, light path distance and the concentration of nitrobenzaldehyde. The results showed that the photoisomerization of nitrobenzaldehyde increased with increasing light exposure. Different light sources and light path distances demonstrated significant impact on the reaction rate constants and half-lives of nitrobenzaldehyde. Although the light energy of UV photoreactor was 47% lower than that of xenon photoreactor, quantum yield and UV/VIS absorption pattern confirmed the finding that the effect of ultraviolet photoreactor on nitrobenzaldehyde was similar to that of xenon photoreactor with the light path of 17 cm. It was caused by the shorter wavelength of UV photoreactor mainly on 254 nm. The product of nitrobenzaldehyde photoisomerization, nitrosobenzoic acid, was detected from samples after 5 or 10 min exposure of three light sources. The concentrations of nitrosobenzoic acid increased with the increasing of exposure time up to 20 or 60 min.

This paper presents an application of estimation of distributed algorithms to the job shop scheduling with the objective to minimize tardiness of jobs. The priority values for job selection are coded as genes and estimated by EDAs. Three kinds of methods for estimating the priorities are tested. In addition, the optimization method using the mixture of EDA and an effective priority rule for job selection is examined. Numerical experiments show that the performance of EDAs is comparable to that of a genetic algorithm using a random key coding.

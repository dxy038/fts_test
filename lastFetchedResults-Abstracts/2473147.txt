Objective
Perinatal asphyxia may result in hypoxic damage in various body organs,
especially in the central nervous system. It could induce cascade of biochemical
events leading to the cell death and metabolic changes, eventually may
increase plasma ammonia levels. The purpose of this study was to determine
the prevalence of hyperammonemia in neonates with asphyxia and to find the
relationship between ammonia levels and severity of asphyxia.
Material & Methods
In this cross-sectional study, we included 100 neonates with perinatal asphyxia
in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Ali-Asghar Hospital, Iran University of
Medical Science, Tehran, Iran in 2010-2011. All full term patients diagnosed of
asphyxia were enrolled. The relationship between plasma ammonia levels and
sex, gestational age, birth weight and severity of asphyxia were determined.
Data were analyzed using SPSS software.
Results
Fifty six percent of neonates were male. The mean gestational age was 38.0± 1.2
wk. Mean plasma ammonia level was 222 ± 100 ?g/dl and 20% of the neonates
had hyperammonemia. It was not associated with gender, gestational age, birth
weight, and asphyxia severity. Six patients died and mean plasma ammonia
levels was 206±122 ?g/dl. In this group, there was no significant relation between
plasma ammonia levels and severity of asphyxia. No significant different was
seen between plasma ammonia in dead and lived neonates.
Conclusion
According to high prevalence of hyperammonemia in neonatal asphyxia,
measurement of plasma ammonia levels, is suggested to improve management
of asphyxia.

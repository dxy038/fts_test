But until now this theory has not implemented in intellectual property (IP) management in China. Most companies use one-size-fits-all method manages it´s all kinds of IP and different technologies. Actually, in the same industry different technology has different TLC, even if one technology has different characteristics in its different life periods. The different characteristic requires different management measures. Proper management of IP should be varied with the stage of the relevant technology in the TLC underlying that IP. The primary objective of our research was to investigate a new implementation field of TLC. First, we briefly outlined the literature review in this field, then identified the periods of TLC and described the characteristics of each period in details. At last explored the special IP management methods of each period should be adopted and concludes.

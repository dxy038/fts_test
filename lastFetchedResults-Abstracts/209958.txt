Objective : Nowadays comp uter s are contr olled by hand with some
too ls like mouse and keyboard generally, so peop le that can't use
their hands aren't able La use these tools . This re search was aimed to
design a system, which help handicapped peop le to type by thei r eye
movement.
Materials & Metho ds: In this de sign, boarder between iris and sclera
which is ca lled limbus is tracked with the Infra Red transmitti ng and
receiving system. Then software will process measured values , and will
change them to proper values for moving cursor on charac ters. Si nce
changing the user , unwanted head movements can affec t on sys tem
operation , a calibration stage is considered which adjus t the sys tem in
new cond ition. The sys tem was implemented on 10 subj ects (5 women
& 5 men) and data were analyzed .
Results: Distance reso lution of system on 15" monitor's screen is abo ut
4.1 1Â±3.38 cen time ters . People with no experience can type a sentence
with 14 characters in 3:30 minute by 28% error and an experienced person
ca n type this se ntenc e in 3 minute with 13% error. So the sys tem with
rela tively high repeatab ility allows the user to communicate with computer
by his eye movements.
Conclus ion : Th is system is able to recognize 12 points on mon itor' s
screen . Eac h point is belo nging to one character. Faci lity of using the
system and no co ntact betwee n system and eye are from the benefits of
the sys tem .

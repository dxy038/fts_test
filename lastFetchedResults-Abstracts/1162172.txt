The objective of the study was to determine the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of thyme (29.4% thymol, 21.6% p-cymene) and rosemary essential oils (27.6% 1,8-cineole, 13.5% limonene, 13.0% Î²-pinene) against Brochothrix thermosphacta and to establish the feasibility of their use as components of modified atmosphere during beef refrigerated storage. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of thyme oil against B. thermosphacta is 0.05% and that of rosemary oil 0.5%. The MIC values are independent on strain and temperature of growth, however the bactericidal effects are strain dependent. The addition of any of oil at a concentration equal to 2MIC to the modified atmosphere (80% O2/20% CO2) does not significantly influence the microbial quality of meat. At the same time, such a concentration of the essential oils was considerably detrimental to the organoleptic factors.

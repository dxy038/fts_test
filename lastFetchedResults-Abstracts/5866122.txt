This paper presents the application of multi-objective optimization method for Network Expansion Planning. The Distribution Network Expansion Planning (DNEP) aims to minimize the cost and distribution loss while satisfying the constraints. The problem formulation results in combinatorial optimization problems which in practice are quite hard to solve due to their complexity. Therefore, in this paper Genetic Algorithm which is a meta-heuristics method was applied. The present study proposed the new method of multi-objective optimization methods. NSGA-II and SPEA2 is assumed to be the best method now. The proposed method introduces the concept of linkage identification genetic algorithm into that method. As a result, new method was possible to search more efficiently than existing methods.

Many supply chain problems are involved with different parameters, which are under uncertainties. One of the primary concerns on supplier selection is to handle the uncertainty under different circumstances. The primary objective of this paper is to design a model to select suppliers and to determine the amount of purchase from any supplier in the supply chain system. For this purpose, we select the most important criteria using fuzzy questionnaires where the questionnaire uses expertsâ€™ opinions in terms of linguistic values. Then, a hierarchy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on fuzzy-sets theory is proposed to rank different suppliers and using a goal programming approach, we determine the amount of order product from each supplier. The implementation of the proposed model is demonstrated using a real-world case study.

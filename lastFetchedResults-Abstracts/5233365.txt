The objective function of most placement algorithms is set only to minimize the total net length. The needs for high performance circuits have not been met by such a single objective. It is important to design placement algorithms that can satisfy requirements of timing, thermal dissipation and chip area. In a new algorithm, those factors are simultaneously optimized in a self-organizing way by means of adaptive neural semantic mapping. Experimental results are very encouraging

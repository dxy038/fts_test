The objective of this study is to investigate the problem of moisture condensation on papermaking plant envelopes in high humidity environment. In this study, orthogonal experiment method is combined with CFD simulation to explore how moisture condensation varies with governing factors, such as the thermal parameters of building envelopes, temperature and humidity distributions or ventilation and air distribution. The criteria used by our work to determine whether the condensation will occur on envelopes are to calculate the temperature differences between the inner surface and the air dew point near the envelopes. Specifically, the temperature differences have a linear relationship with the governing parameters, and a first-order linear regression equation is derived, which is validated by data from investigation and measurement. This research provides theoretical support and measurement data for solutions of the envelope condensation problems and anti-condensation design of HVAC systems in papermaking plants.

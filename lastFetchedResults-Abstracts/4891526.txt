This paper presents a method for obtaining the efficient solutions of a multiobjective linear programming problem over fuzzy linear constraints. The method is based on finding the set of maximally efficient solutions to a multiobjective linear program. This is accomplished by converting the fuzzy constraints into crisp constraints by adding a variable representing the degree of membership in the fuzzy feasible set. In addition, an objective function representing the maximization of this variable is augmented to the objectives of the original problem. An example is provided to illustrate the method

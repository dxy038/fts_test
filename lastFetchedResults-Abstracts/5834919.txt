This invited talk surveys notions related to synchronization in presence of asynchrony and failures. To the author knowledge, there is currently no textbook in which these notions are pieced together, unified, and presented in a homogeneous way. This talk (that pretends to be neither exhaustive, nor objective) is only a first endeavor in that direction. The notions that are presented and discussed are listed in the keyword list.

A multi smart robot should be able to analyze the situation faster and make appropriate decisions with minimal interference of the human in normal as well as in critical situations for performing various tasks. This is typically designed for the regions where there are high radiation emissions. The use of RFID tags makes the system work in the form of groups under a leader and they communicate among themselves. Pervasive computing provides smartness for the robot in efficient coordination, decision making, monitoring with more leadership quality and common sense reasoning. In this paper a new dynamic leadership algorithm is proposed wherein a leader is elected according to the parameters taken into account. The objective is to make the system more remote, completely independent and more robust for exchanging information with increased degree of freedom.

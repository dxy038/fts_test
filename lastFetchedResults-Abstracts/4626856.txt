MAKE-IT (Manufacturing Agents in a Knowledge-based Environment driven by Internet Technologies) is a research project whose objective is the definition and the implementation of &#8220;small&#8221; software architectures that can be taken into account as agents - which can perform simple rule-based actions while performing a quite heavy and complex coordination. The main field of application of the MAKE-IT agents is the workflow management of information in small or medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, specifically when their information system is based on the Microsoft Windows architecture

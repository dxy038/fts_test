A method of obtaining the lowest possible peak sidelobe levels, given a specified sidelobe envelope, by phase-only variation of the generator phases is presented. A generalization of earlier work by the authors, this technique involves the optimization of a piecewise differentiable objective function using the method of steepest descent to obtain desired generator phases, given prescribed excitation magnitudes. The method has been applied to both linear and planar arrays of radiators, with single-mode mutual coupling effects included to provide realistic data. Values for the various array performance indices are presented, and results indicate that introduction of sidelobe taper improves the array gain while raising the peak sidelobe level somewhat. Inclusion of mutual coupling effects alters the required phases for optimum patterns but does not significantly affect the performance indices of the array

Lymphadenitis with or without dry-type cutaneous leishmaniasis is rare. The lesion might self heal or show excellent response to antimonial therapy. Routine histopathological changes of localized leishmaniasis lymphadenitis are non-caseating to suppurative granulomata mostly in paracortical areas, some with extension to germinal centres, medullary cords and/or pericapsular spaces which have to be distinguished from other causes of lymphadenitis such as tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease and toxoplasmosis. Dense lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate was observed surrounding the necrotizing granuloma together with dense capsular fibrosis with multiple granulomata in subcapsular and pericapsular areas. Immunostaining of lymph nodes showed that a few macrophages were harbouring Leishman bodies. Dispersed Langerhans cells were also harbouring Leishman bodies in the parasitophorous vacuoles between their cytoplasmic pseudopods. In conclusion multiple noncaseating to suppurative granulomata with dense pericapsular and capsular granulomo-sclerotic changes should be considered in the differential diagnosis of leishmaniasis lymphadenitis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate bradykinin-mediated vasodilator function in small arteries from normotensive pregnant and nonpregnant women and from women with preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: Small subcutaneous arteries (approximately 250 μm luminal diameter) were dissected from biopsy specimens obtained at cesarean section from 24 normotensive pregnant women and 6 women with preeclampsia and during abdominal surgery in 15 nonpregnant women. Vascular function was assessed after arteries were mounted on a small vessel myograph. RESULTS: Preconstricted arteries from normotensive pregnant women demonstrated enhanced relaxation to bradykinin compared with those from nonpregnant women (p< 0.05), whereas arteries from women with preeclampsia showed blunted responses compared with those from normotensive pregnant women (p< 0.01). Relaxation in all groups was attenuated in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine so that it became similar in the three groups. Indomethacin had a small but significant inhibitory effect on bradykinin-induced relaxation, but this component of relaxation was no different among groups. Sensitivity of arteries to norepinephrine and sodium nitroprusside showed no significant differences in the three groups of women. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for an increase in bradykinin-mediated nitric oxide synthesis from the vascular endothelium of small arteries from the peripheral circulation of normotensive pregnant women and a relative reduction in women with preeclampsia. In turn, these changes may contribute to vasodilation in normal pregnancy and elevation of the blood pressure in preeclampsia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:1668-74.)

Analogues of S-adenosyl-l-methionine were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of the purified E. coli cyclopropane fatty acid synthase, a model for M. tuberculosis cyclopropane synthases that are potential targets for antituberculous drugs. Our results show that the presence of the adenosine moiety, in the inhibitor, is required for strong binding, but that the sulfonium charge is less important. The best inhibitors found were S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and its sulfoxides.

In this paper a new algorithm is described which aims at solving efficiently a simple plant location problem with two additional constraints. Such a problem arises in the calculation phase of an interactive decision aid process that helps the decision-maker finding the non-dominated solutions for a bicriteria simple plant location problem. The two additional constraints impose upper limits on the values of each objective function. If they are relaxed, the problem turns into a simple plant location problem, which can be solved using Dualoc by Erlenkotter (oper. Res. 26(6) (1978) 992). The algorithm developed uses a slightly modified version of Dualoc (Erlenkotter, 1978) integrated into a branch and bound procedure. The results of several computational experiments are shown, showing that the new algorithm is superior both in the computational time and memory needed, when compared with a general solver.

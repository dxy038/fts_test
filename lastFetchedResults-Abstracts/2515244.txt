For analysis, single-sample t-test (Klvmvgrvf- Smirnov test to check for normal distribution), t-test independent, one way variance and multivariate regression were used.The findings suggest that, if side walk is constructed in this area, this side walk will be in an inappropriate conditions in terms of social security.

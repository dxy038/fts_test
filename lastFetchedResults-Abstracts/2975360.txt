An <e2>L</e2><sup>2</sup>-local optimality sufficiency theorem proved for constrained optimal control problems is described here. This theorem applies to a class of structured infinite-dimensional nonconvex programs with constraints of the form, u&#8712;&#937; and h(u)=0, where &#937; is a set of Lebesgue measurable essentially bounded vector-valued functions u(&#183;):[0, 1]&#8594;<e2>R</e2><sup>m</sup> with range in a polyhedron U, and h is a smooth map of the space of essentially bounded functions u(&#183;) into <e2>R</e2><sup>k</sup>. The theorem is based on formal counterparts of the finite-dimensional Karush-Kuhn-Tucker sufficient conditions in a Cartesian product of polyhedra, a strengthened variant of PontryaginÂ´s necessary condition, and structure/continuity conditions on the first and second differentials of the objective function and equality constraint functions. Its sufficient conditions are directly applicable to nonconvex continuous-time Bolza optimal control problems with control-quadratic Hamiltonians, affine inequality constraints on the control inputs, and equality constraints on the terminal state vector, or equivalent isoperimetric constraints

Electrical and electronic technology is an important basic course for the students of non-electrical majors, such as mechanical engineering and vehicle engineering. The course features are basic, practical and advanced. In order to evaluate the learning effect of the students objectively and scientifically, the construction plan of test question database and the paper automatic generation technology for the course of electrical and electronic technology are studied. According to the teaching features of electrical and electronic technology, the construction plan of question database and paper database are put forward, the system structure and composition are analyzed. The structure of question database, paper database and template database are discussed. The system is achieved based on the development tools of Visual C++ and Access. Several key technologies, such as strategies of intelligent paper combination, access of graphics and pictures, technology of entire paper part record, and so on, are discussed. The system can implement the effective management of question database and automatic generation of paper for the course of electrical and electronic technology, and make the course teaching have more objective assessment method and lay fine base for the separation of teaching and testing of the course.

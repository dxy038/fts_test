The objective of this paper is to give an insight on the aspects considered reduce the power demand in the electrical system design and the problems faced in implementing the same during the construction of commercial and residential buildings. Energy efficient light fixtures and motors which comply with ECBC standards are widely used which results to virtuous power savings. Gearless elevators provide the required travel speed by using low power motors. Usage of extra materials has been greatly reduced by utilizing same materials for dual purpose to the maximum extent. For instance, earthing has been done as part of the building structure utilizing the reinforcement bar to create equip-potential bonding to ensure the safe operation of various critical sensitive equipmentÂ´s and safety of human too.

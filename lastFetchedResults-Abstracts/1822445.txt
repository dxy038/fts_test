Objective
ontic tooth movement (OTM) is achieved by alveolar bone remodelling induced by mechanical loading. Whilst interleukin-1 (IL-1) is directly involved in OTM, the role of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a naturally occurring IL-1 antagonist, is not completely defined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IL-1Ra on OTM.
s
hodontic appliance was placed in C57BL6 mice treated with vehicle or IL-1Ra (10 mg/kg/day). OTM and TRAP-positive osteoclasts were evaluated after 12 days of mechanical loading and the levels of cytokines on periodontal tissues were analysed by ELISA after 12 and 72 h.
s
reated with IL-1Ra showed diminished OTM and decreased numbers of TRAP-positive osteoclasts. In line with this, lower levels of IL-1β and TNF-α, and higher levels of IL-10, were observed on periodontal tissues of IL-1Ra-treated mice in relation to the vehicle-treated group.
sion
esent study suggests that IL-1Ra downregulates OTM, probably by its anti-inflammatory actions.

Aim of the paper is to investigate convective heat and mass transfer in the presence of
the volumetric rate of heat generation/ absorption, which depends on local specie concentration.
The main objective is to put forth the concept under rational and critical
discussion by the scientific community. To study such a boundary layer flow, heat and
mass transfer mixed convection stagnation point flow through porous media is taken. The
result observed satisfies the general physical laws of boundary layer flow in the presence
of the volumetric heat generation/ absorption

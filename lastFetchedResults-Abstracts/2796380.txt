Enterprise cloud computing has emerged as a promising technology, where on-demand provisioning of services like storage, infrastructure, software and platform are provided. Growing market of cloud computing, resulted in a variety of heterogeneous cloud services. This leads to a difficult problem for Cloud Service Consumer (SC) when selecting their best fitting Cloud Service Providers (SP), who can provide best quality resource at negotiated price. Thus we propose a middleware based Cloud Service Broker (SB) architecture for enterprise cloud computing. The objective of SB is to find the most suitable SP for a SC based on negotiation with Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters like price and quality. Second we propose game theory model for automatic SLA negotiation between SC and SP where CSB provides optimal value of price and quality to both the parties.

This study suggests the utilization of binary firefly algorithm (BFA) in getting the optimal power quality monitor(PQM) position in the power system. A multi-objective function is used in the optimization procedure with the system observability constraint which is determined by the concept of topological monitor reach area. The multi-objective function is made up of three functions, which are the number of monitors needed, monitor coverage index and sag propagation index. The usefulness of the proposed method has been confirmed by applying the algorithm on the IEEE 118-bus transmission system. The results prove that BFA is suitable to use in PQM positioning problem.

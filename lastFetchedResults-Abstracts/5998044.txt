The main objective of this paper is to develop PI and Fuzzy controllers to analyse the performance of instantaneous real active and reactive current (i<sub>d</sub>-i<sub>q</sub>) control strategy for extracting reference currents of shunt active filters under balanced, unbalanced and balanced non-sinusoidal conditions. When the supply voltages are balanced and sinusoidal, the all control strategies are converge to the same compensation characteristics; However, the supply voltages are distorted and/or un-balanced sinusoidal, these control strategies result in different degrees of compensation in harmonics. The p-q control strategy unable to yield an adequate solution when source voltages are not ideal. Extensive simulations were carried out; simulations were performed with balance, unbalanced and non sinusoidal conditions. Simulation results validate the dynamic behaviour of fuzzy logic controller over pi controller. The 3-ph 4-wire shunt active filter (SHAF) system is also implemented on a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS Hardware) to further verify its effectiveness. The detailed simulation and RT DS Hardware results are included.

The free availability of GPS information has truly made the location based services for the public possible. Most of the application in the current scenario is for tracking oneÂ´s own location. The objective in this paper is to design a protocol that uses the concept of GPS based location tracking and the merits of GSM based communication to track and trace a vehicle, that is remote to the user or the main server. A predictive localization algorithm is also implemented. The field tests show the accuracy of our design.

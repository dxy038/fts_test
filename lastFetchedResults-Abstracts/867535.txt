The objective of this study is to model and maximize performance of an integrated Automated Guided
Vehicle System (AGVS), which is embedded in a pull type multi-product, multi-stage and multi-line flexible
manufacturing system (FMS). This study examines the impact of guide-path flexibility on system
performance through the development of three different guide-path configurations which range from
dedicated to flexible relationships between automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and machine/assembly
station resources. The system is modelled using coloured Petri net method (CPN) and the simulation
results lead to identify the resource redundancy which can be rectified to achieve lower overall cost of
the system through the development of flexible guide-path configurations. The study is extended to seek
global near-optimal conditions for each guide-path configuration using response surface method, which
yields improvements in system throughput and cycle time along with a decrease in the numbers of AGVs.

<p> <strong>Objective:</strong> we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of celecoxib in reducing Intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus in parturient undergoing cesarean section delivery under spinal anesthesia.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> In a randomized double-blind placebo controlled study 126 women undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia (0.5% bupivacaine 12mg plus 0.2 mg preservativefree morphine )were randomly allocated to receive celecoxib 400 mg or placebo, 2 hours prior to surgery. Severity of pruritus and pain score and frequency of opioid's side effects were recorded.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> patients receiving celecoxib had significantly lower pruritus incidence and severity at 30 min,2,4 and 8 hours (40% versus 82%), but not at 12 and 24 hours postoperatively. Also there was a reduction in pain score but it was not significant (1.5±0.5 versus 1.9±0.65).Analgesic requirement was similar between two groups.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Oral administration of celecoxib significantly reduced Intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus in parturient undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. There was no significant difference in pain scores and analgesic requirement.</p>

In this paper, we present a new algorithm for removing drums from a polyphonic audio signal. The aim of this algorithm is to discard time/frequency bins which present a percussive magnitude evolution, according to a pre-defined parametric model. Special care is taken to reduce the irrelevant removal of frequency modulated signal such as the ones produced by the singing voice. Performance evaluation is carried out using objective measures commonly used by the community. Compared with four state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm shows competitive performances at a low computational cost.

The objective of the paper is to explain the process of satellite/cable/terrestrial front-end modeling and IC de-embedding using RF simulation software. A thorough process is demonstrated, including modeling the input connector, the 75 &#937; impedance traces and lumped element matching, so that we obtain a reasonable estimate of the actual S-parameter model of a tuner IC at the RF input pin. Physical models are measured on a vector network analyzer (VNA), and S-parameters are obtained and compared to the simulated model. The modeled device under test includes an SMA, or F-type, connector, 75 &#937; impedance traces, lumped element matching, and an RF IC input pin. The details of modeling errors, their impact on the model, and their resolutions are discussed.

This paper proposes a behavior-based decentralized approach for UAV formation flight. The objective of UAV formation flight is that UAVs have to fly to a specified region while maintaining the distances between UAVs. To design the controller, the coupled dynamics of multiple UAVs is considered with assumption that each UAV can share the state-information with one another. A feedback linearization rule with a diffeomorphic transfer map is derived for three degree-of-freedom point mass model. The behavior-based approach is considered to promptly react on various situations because its control input is decided based on the relative weight of each agentÂ´s desired behavior. The optimization technique is used to provide the better performance of formation flying. To verify the performance of the proposed controller, numerical simulation is performed for a waypoint-passing mission of multiple UAVs.

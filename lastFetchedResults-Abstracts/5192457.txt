We consider a class of prioritized Discrete Event Systems (DES) that involves the control of resources allocated to tasks under real-time constraints. This is motivated by power-limited wireless environments where the objective is to minimize energy consumption while guaranteeing that task deadlines are always met. We discover several structural properties of the optimal sample path of such DES. The structural properties can be used to reduce the search space of the brute-force search and may possibly lead to a more efficient decomposition algorithm. Using the structural properties, we also propose a greedy algorithm which is shown numerically near optimal.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to create a new instrument for the training of doctors in the use of forceps and to compare the trajectories of forceps blades between junior and senior obstetricians.
Study design
We equipped a simulator and forceps with spatial location sensors. The head of the fetus was in an occipitoanterior location, at a “+5” station. Forceps blade trajectories were analyzed subjectively with the 3-dimensional spatial graph and objectively based on 3 points of special interest. Each obstetrician performed 4 forceps blades placements. We compared the trajectories of junior and senior obstetricians.
Results
For senior operators, spatial dispersion was “excellent,” “very good,” or “good” in 92% of cases, whereas this was the case for only 38% of junior doctors (92% vs 38%; P< .001).
Conclusion
A new instrument has been designed to demonstrate the trajectory of forceps blades during application in a simulator. The instrument captures the difference in experience between senior and junior clinicians.

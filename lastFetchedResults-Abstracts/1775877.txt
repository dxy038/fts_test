The objective of the present study is to describe the circumstances of injurious falls leading to medical care among the elderly living in a rural community, which have never been reported comprehensively. From 1992 to 1993, an interview survey on falls was carried out every 3 months. Of the 1349 subjects aged 65 or more of Nakazato village in Japan, 1317 persons responded to the survey by a door-by-door interview. Two-hundred-and-fifty-six elderly people experienced a fall at least once during the 1-year period. One-hundred-and-twenty-four falls were recorded by 94 men and 215 falls were experienced by 162 women. In men, 16 (31.31/1000 person-year) injurious falls leading to medical care were documented. In women, 58 (75.74/1000 person-year) falls were found to be injurious. The difference in the rate of injurious falls between the sexes was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). In each sex, there was no increased rate of injurious falls with advancing age. Most of the injurious falls occurred in the daytime. As for the location of injurious falls, outdoor falls were more frequent than indoor falls in the case of men. Half of the injurious falls in women occurred indoors. Extrinsic factors largely contributed to the occurrence of injurious falls compared with intrinsic ones. Women tended to be injured in the buttocks and hip in a greater proportion than men. This study reveals the circumstances of injurious falls leading to medical care and provides useful information on preventing injurious falls among the elderly living in the community.

Although models are now routinely used for addressing environmental problems, both in research and management applications, the problem of obtaining the required parameters remains a major challenge. An attractive procedure for obtaining model parameters in recent years has been through inverse modeling. This approach involves obtaining easily measurable variables (model output), and using this information to estimate a set of unknown model parameters. Inverse procedures usually require optimization of an objective function. In this study we emulate the behavior of a colony of ants to achieve this optimization. The method uses the fact that ants are capable of finding the shortest path from a food source to their nest by depositing a trail of pheromone during their walk. Results obtained with the ant colony parameter optimization method are very promising; in eight different applications we were able to estimate the `true' parameters to within a few percent. One such study is reported in this paper plus an application to estimating hydraulic parameters in a lysimeter experiment. Despite the encouraging results obtained thus far, further improvements could still be made in the parameterization of the ant colony optimization for application to estimation of unsaturated flow and transport parameters.

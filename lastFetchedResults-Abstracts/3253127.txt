Rapid changes in communication technology coupled with problem of congestion has led to increase in research into Interoperable networks and Traffic splitting in recent years. This paper addresses the problem of traffic splitting on a &#8220;hybrid&#8221; node which consists of both WiMAX and WiFi enabled for communication simultaneously. The main objective of this simulation is to design a hybrid node that performs traffic splitting over two radio channels and identify the cases in which traffic splitting will prove efficient in transmitting data. Data traffic is routed using the AODV routing protocol, slightly modified for our network. In order to perform traffic splitting, we define a traffic splitting coefficient which denotes the percentage of data traffic split. Our simulations show that traffic splitting peaks at certain values of the split coefficients and that traffic splitting over two channels allows for higher data rates than when only one radio channel is used.

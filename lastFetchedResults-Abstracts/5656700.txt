Transmission congestion management is one of the critical and important tasks of the System Operator (SO). In this paper, congestion relief procedure has been discussed and compared with the objective of rescheduling cost minimization and proposed objective of real power loss minimization. Congestion Management (CM) is carried out by rescheduling of real power generation based on cluster / zone method utilizing Transmission Congestion Distribution Factors (TCDFs). It is formulated as an optimization problem and for solving, attractive searching features of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used. Load curtailment option is also introduced, if necessary. The proposed idea is tested in Sample 6 and IEEE 30 bus systems.

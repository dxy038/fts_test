This paper explores different techniques which can be used to assess the quality of data resulting from computational processes and algorithms. The objective is to develop a numerical index of quality that would permit establishing a direct comparison between a variety of methods and computational techniques. A short summary of previous work is included, followed by the proposal (Section III) of the index of quality based on the interpretation of statistical properties and conditions. The fourth section is composed of a sample calculation of the Statistical Index of Quality, followed by the analysis of eight sample cases (Section V). This work is part of a broader study regarding the usage of bioinspired intelligence for the analysis of human DNA.

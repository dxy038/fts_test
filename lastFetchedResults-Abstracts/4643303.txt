The global objective of the paper is to introduce a new Statistical Process Control (SPC) education technology using an interactive control chart simulator. The basis is the contemporary experience in teaching at universities and in training for the practice and from there resulting observation, that especially the regular students often lack practical knowledge about the production process while managers lack deeper insight into the SPC theory. A possibility to eliminate this deficiency is a practical activity where individuals attain knowledge and skills through personal or hands-on experiences. Function of the simulator is to enable the student to resolve typical situations encountered in the SPC. This paper presents learning objectives, the SPC simulator concept, its functions, and the manner of its use in education.

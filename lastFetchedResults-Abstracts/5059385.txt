Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a highspeed network technology that transmits various types of information across networks such as voice, video, image, data, etc. In an ATM network the basic data units, called cells, are routed through switched or permanent virtual circuits (virtual channels). A Smart Permanent Virtual Circuit is a connection that looks like a Permanent Virtual Circuit at the local and remote endpoints with a Switched Virtual Circuit in the middle. If a link carrying a Smart Permanent Virtual Circuit goes down and there is an alternate route, then the network automatically reroutes the Smart Permanent Virtual Circuit around the link. As a result of the rerouting, the network may not be able to deliver the guaranteed quality of services as it was negotiated. It may have to change the quality of service parameters negotiated for other connections. The objective of this paper is to apply Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) methodologies, &#8220;intelligent agents&#8221;, in ATM network management. The paper presents a search algorithm that helps the agents learn from previous interactions and experience. Agents can evaluate alternate paths in order to maintain as many connections as possible with the quality of service guaranteed originally

The study is a concise form of some present days researches within the Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Researches on Territorial Dynamics within the University of Bucharest, which had as main major objective to identify and to underline the instability from the natural environment, determined by coal exploitation, as well as to identify the efficient management systems in some areas located in the south-western part of Romania, Oltenia. Researches identified the major effects these economic activities have upon air pollution, slopes’ dynamic, air and soil pollution. A special importance is given to the human component within territorial systems, as population is often dislodged to other localities and this phenomenon implies many social and economic consequences. One of the most important aggressions upon natural and built environment is that related to the landscape damage, following exploiting and processing rough material in order to obtain the final product, the coal. The direct impact of mining activities upon environment may be translated by a local biodiversity decrease, even if these coal mines are rehabilitated after they’re closed. Therefore, an integrated approach is necessary and it must refer to the way of administering mines for long term, by common actions of all the implied factors (government, mining companies and the local communities). The scientific demarche of building the model of environment management in the areas affected by mining took into account the new European context, which represents a supra system imposing the strategic coordinates where the process of managing territorial instability takes place.

The objective of this study was to develop a sustained-release drug delivery system for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to improve its short half-life. 5-Fluorouracil-1-acetic acid (FUAC) was prepared and then conjugated to hydroxyethyl starch (HES) through ester bonds. The conjugates were relatively stable in acidic buffer solution at pH 5.8 and slowly released FUAC but became more sensitive to hydrolysis with an increase in the pH and temperature. The conjugates were degraded to FUAC both in human and rat plasma with half-time life of 20.4 h and 24.6 h, respectively. Both 5-FU and FUAC were released in a rat liver homogenate following a 12 h incubation of the conjugates. The pharmacokinetic behavior was evaluated in rats after intravenous injection of 5-FU, FUAC and the conjugates. The drug release data in vitro and in vivo indicated that HES is a promising carrier for the sustained-release of antitumor drugs.

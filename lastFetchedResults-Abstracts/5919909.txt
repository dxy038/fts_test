This paper presents an optimal control for an offshore energy conversion system based on reduced matrix converter concept. The advantages of the proposed methodology are reliability and optimality of the control. A linear quadratic regulator is applied hierarchically over a linearized model. Implementation of the control is very simple an is one of the most important features of this technique. Simulation results are presented using a 2 MW wind turbine and a detailed model of the randomness nature of the wind. Robustness as well as sensitivity of the response according to the weights used in the objective function are also investigated and reported.

Objective: To study whether myeloperoxidase (MPO) can provide prognostic information in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Methods: The study population consisted of 274 consecutive patients with ACS. All patients underwent coronary angiography which showed significant coronary artery disease and blood samples were collected at admission. Follow-ups were scheduled at 1, 3, and 6 months. The end point included cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Results: Patients with elevated MPO serum levels (MPO ges 72.2 AUU/L) were more likely to have diabetics and had a history of coronary events. Kaplan-Meier event rate curves with accumulative incidence of end point at 6-month follow-up in the MPO ges 72.2 AUU/L group was significantly higher than in MPO&lt;72.2 AUU/L group. Conclusions: MPO may be a powerful predictor of adverse outcome in patients with ACS.

The objective of this work is to demonstrate a generic methodology of using multi-models to develop advanced control strategies. The multi-model strategy was implemented on several advanced schemes such as Smith-Predictor using PI, Dahlin controller and generalized predictive control (GPC). Computer simulations and experimental work were conducted on nonlinear single input-single-output (SISO) systems and compared with the original forms of these advanced controllers. The practical work was conducted on controlling the temperature of a steel cylinder.

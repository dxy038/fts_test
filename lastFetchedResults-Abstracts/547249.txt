Background & Objectives: Perineal trauma is common outcome of vaginal birth, and can cause short- term and long- term problems for new mothers. Pain, blood loss, need for suturing, urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunctional and protracted pain , is of postnatal morbidity related to the genital tract trauma and is associated with greater mother and neonatal morbidity. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of perineal massage in the second stage of labor on perineal trauma. Materials & Methods: This is a Randomized controlled research. 70 nulliparous women were asked to join the study. These women who were expecting normal birth were divided randomly in control (35) and intervention (35) groups. Women in the intervention group received massage and stretching of the perineum with two fingers and use of sterile water- soluble lubricant with each contraction during the second stage of delivery. The data have been analyzed with descriptive statistical methods, using SPSS
Results: The rate of intact perineum (50 % vs 40 % p= 0/48 ) first degree tears (40% vs 50%), second degree tears (9% vs 10%) and episiotomies were similar to these of the massage and the control group. There weren 't significant differences between these kinds of traumas.
Conclusion: The practice of perineal massage in the second stage does not have any effect on the likelihood of perineal trauma rate.

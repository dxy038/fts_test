Basic: With the proposal of the smart grid strategy, there are higher requirement for the real time dispatching and unit commitment, objectively, the new generation of unit commitment should be dynamic, smart, refining efficiency and operable. The multi-objective unit commitment intelligent optimization system for unit commitment based on the power grid state recognition which this paper established is an improvement of the existing unit commitment optimization pattern. It make use of knowledge base system to it identify and classify the real time operation state of power grid, base on which it determines &#8220;the primary optimization objectives&#8221; and &#8220;the primary constraints&#8221;, meanwhile it achieves the simplification and dynamic modeling of the multi-objective problem. It does not only improve the accuracy of the multi-target model and make the model targeted, but also simplify the model and improve the computing efficiency.

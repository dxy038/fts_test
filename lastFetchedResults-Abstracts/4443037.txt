The RACE 2066 project Monet (Mobile Network) studies network issues of a third generation mobile system called the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). This paper briefly describes the main objectives of Monet, and focuses thereafter on the results achieved in three technical areas in 1992, being the first year of the project. An important objective of the Monet project is to specify the UMTS as an integrated part of the infrastructure for fixed telecommunications. A main issue in this context is the further development of the Intelligent Network (IN) concept. The IN seems to be suitable vehicle for implementing UMTS. Requirements on future IN Capability Sets are identified. Requirements for handover procedures in the UMTS are identified. Handovers will occur much more frequently and in addition they have to cater for a wide variety of advanced services, for different environments, for movements between environments, and for movements between administrative domains during calls. Related to this, and described in this paper as well, is the design of a generic Base Station System concept. Finally, the approach taken in Monet to simulate key aspects of the radio access network is explained. The emphasis lies on call simulations where active mobiles move from cell to cell, thereby causing additional signalling load on the core network

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the difference of the CT findings between the subperitoneal space of small bowel mesentery and transverse mesocolon involved in acute pancreatitis and to evaluate their clinical significance. METHODS: From January 2006 to December 2012, CT examinations of 58 patients with acute pancreatitis were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were 56 patients showing subperitoneal space of transverse mesocolon (SpST) involvement and 50 patients showing subperitoneal space of small bowel mesentery (SpSS) involvement. The CT findings of SpST and SpSS involvement were related to the CTSI of acute pancreatitis. When the CTSI was 4-5, the frequency of fluid collection in SpSS and SpST has difference (FisherÂ´s Exact Test, P=0.000). When the CTSI was 6-7, the frequency of fluid collection in SpSS and SpST has difference (X2=15.15, P&lt;;0.01). When the CTSI was 8-10, the frequency of fluid collection in SpSS and SpST has significant difference (X2=5.0, P&lt;;0.05). Conclusion: The results showed that the SpSS and SpST involvement was related to the severity of the acute pancreatitis, the latter was more important.

Introduction & Objective: The concept of self-efficacy stems from social-cognitive theory. Present research was conducted, consistent with Bandura’s Self-Efficacy Theory, with the purpose of identified correlation of nursing students’ self-efficacy with clinical performance.   
Materials & Methods: This correlation study conducted with a sample of 207 nursing students. The research instruments concluded, “Clinical Performance Self-efficacy” scale consists of four dimensions with 37 items (0-100 Likert-format) and “Nursing Clinical Performance” with 5 case scenario and 15 questions.  Validity and reliability of the scales were tested. Internal reliability of “Clinical Performance Self-efficacy” scale had ?=0.96; the dimensions Cronbach’s ? ranged from 0.90 to 0.92. Test–retest reliability with a 2-week time interval was r = 0.94. Internal reliability of “Nursing Clinical Performance” scale had ?=0.78. Test–retest reliability was r = 0.81. 
Results: Result showed that significant correlation was detected between "clinical performance self-efficacy" and "nursing clinical performance" (r = 0.425, p <  0.001).
Conclusion: Based of the percentile average of scores, self-efficacy and clinical performance of nursing students were moderate. Also, there was significant correlation between "clinical performance self-efficacy" and "nursing clinical performance" of nursing students. Therefore, non educational factors, such as self-efficacy, had an important role in students' performances, especially in clinical settings.

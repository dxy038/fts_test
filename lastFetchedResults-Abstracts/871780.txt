We study the problem of reaching a target without leaving a prescribed constraint set
for a dynamical system described by a controlled differential equation and a controlled
instantaneous reset function.We characterize all initial conditions from which the objective
can be reached. Then we characterize the value function associated with the optimal
reaching time problem. ï›™ 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Our objective was to determine the effects of needle-free (NF) versus needle injection (N) enhancement on microbial translocation of generic Escherichia coli in beef strip loins. Fifteen longissimus muscles (LM) were obtained and halved. Surfaces were inoculated with generic E. coli at a level of 106 CFU/cm2 (three replications of five strip loins). LM halves were injection-enhanced with a phosphate and salt solution with either NF or N injection. After injection, two cores were taken from each LM half and sliced cross-sectionally at depths of 2-mm (surface), 1, 3, and 5 cm. The paired samples were stomached, serially diluted, and plated. Surface samples from N-injected muscles had lower (P &lt; 0.05) E. coli counts (2.79 versus 3.23 log CFU/g for NF). Also, the 3- and 5-cm depth samples from N injection had the least (P &lt; 0.05) E. coli contamination (1.69 versus 2.12 CFU/g for NF). Although traditional N injection resulted in approximately 0.5 log CFU/g less microbial contamination at all depths, because the level of contamination was extremely high, the difference in the treatments could arguably be of little practical importance in terms of safety.

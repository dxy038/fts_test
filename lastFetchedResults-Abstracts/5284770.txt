The main objective of this paper is to summarize the state of the art of power factor correction in off-line power supply systems. The study is only focused on equipment fed from a single-phase line and it covers theoretical aspects, control strategies, power topologies and future trends. The authors cover AC-DC converters, DC-DC converters in resistor emulators, multiplier approach control, average current mode control, variable hysteresis control, one- and several-switch power topologies, and soft switching

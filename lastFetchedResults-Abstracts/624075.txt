Many real-world search and optimization problems involve inequality and/or equality constraints and are thus posed as constrained optimization problems. In trying to solve constrained optimization problems using classical optimization methods, this paper presents a Multi-Objective Bees Algorithm (MOBA) for solving the multi-objective optimal of mechanical engineering problems design. In the present study, a satellite heat pipe design, a space truss design and pressure vessel problems are considered. Multi-objective optimization using the bees algorithm which is a new multi-object obtain a set of geometric design parameters, leads to optimum solve. This method is developed in order to obtain a set of geometric design parameters leading to minimum heat pipe mass and the maximum thermal conductance. Hence, a set of geometric design parameters, lead to minimum pressure total cost and maximum pressure vessel volume. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm can find better solutions when compared to other heuristic or deterministic methods and is a powerful search algorithm for various engineering optimization problems.

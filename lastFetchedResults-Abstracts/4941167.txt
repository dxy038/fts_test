To facilitate higher bandwidth for multimedia traffic, modern routers support simultaneous multi-band communication, leading to less interference, higher capacity and better reliability. However, there is lack of quantitative evaluation to judge whether multi-band is better than single band router in realistic scenarios. Our objective is to propose a scheduling algorithm for multi-band routers and compare single band and multi-band system with different allocation policies. We have used different scheduling algorithms for multi-band routers which transmit different classes of traffic through different frequency bands, thereby achieving improved performance. By comparing multi-band and single band mobile router performances, we have found out that one of them is not always better than the other although multi-band is expected to have better performance.

This Special Issue presents a collection of papers dealing with approaches to minimality in diverse areas of language and on the basis of a variety of structures. Theories on minimal phrase-structure building, emergence of the unmarked, or underspecified lexical representations are investigated by means of experimental findings revealed in psycho- and neurolinguistic studies. The main objective is to investigate how principles of minimal structure are reflected in language comprehension and production. Thus, this Special Issue aims at establishing a link between theoretical claims and recent experimental findings.

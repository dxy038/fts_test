Changes in multimedia, magnetic materials and technologies, and engineering education during 1992 are examined. While entertainment is the main objective of much of todayÂ´s multimedia, the technology is also affecting the marketing and training disciplines, but data storage and retrieval remains a bottleneck. However, recent developments in magnetism could be revolutionary for multimedia and other storage devices, particularly magnetic media that store more to the millimeter. On the educational front, demand grew for major changes in undergraduate engineering education

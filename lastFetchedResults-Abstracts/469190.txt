Objective
The purpose of this study was to describe the effect of the problem-based learning method on student grade and on student and faculty satisfaction.
Study design
The problem-based learning method was instituted at 2 of 5 obstetrics/gynecology clerkship sites. Students and faculty were surveyed, with the use of a Likert scale, regarding aspects of satisfaction with the clerkship. Responses were compared according to problem-based learning usage. Student performance was also assessed according to problem-based learning usage, with a comparison of several grade components. Statistical analysis involved t-tests and Kendall's tau-C.
Results
For the year that was assessed, 54 of 156 students used the problem-based learning method. Mean student satisfaction responses were significantly higher for students who used the problem-based learning method. Faculty satisfaction was also significantly higher for the problem-based learning method, compared with other teaching methods. Mean scores on the National Board of Medical Examiners subject examination were higher for problem-based learning but did not reach statistical significance. Grade distribution was not significantly different for the groups.
Conclusion
The problem-based learning method was associated with improved student and faculty satisfaction and did not affect student grades negatively.

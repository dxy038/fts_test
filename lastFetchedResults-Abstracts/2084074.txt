This paper studies the semiparametric binary response model with interval data investigated by Manski and Tamer (2002). In this partially identified model, we propose a new estimator based on MTâ€™s modified maximum score (MMS) method by introducing density weights to the objective function, which allows us to develop asymptotic properties of the proposed set estimator for inference. We show that the density-weighted MMS estimator converges at a nearly cube-root-n rate. We propose an asymptotically valid inference procedure for the identified region based on subsampling. Monte Carlo experiments provide supports to our inference procedure.

Most traditional MAC protocols proposed for wireless networks assume static Network Units (shorted as NUs), which usually lead to performance degradation in mobile scenarios. In this paper, a novel hybrid MAC protocol, called MA-MAC, was presented for multi-hop mobile Tactical Data Link networks based upon the mobile characteristics of NUs. The basic point of MA-MAC is that the transmit mode of each NU can be switched between reservation and contention-based adaptively according to the mobile awareness. The design objective of MA-MAC is to reduce the high initial overhead of a creating new connection as a result of the dynamic in network. In addition, MA-MAC adopts a dynamic frame length scheme, in which each NU maintains a local frame length adjusted by a power of 2. We verify the performance of MA-MAC by simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol outperforms existing MAC protocols, like E-ASAP and MH-MAC, in terms of delivery ratio and packet delay.

The objective of this study was to determine the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in selected candidate genes with sensory and technological meat quality traits in commercial cattle. SNP in seven candidate genes were genotyped in 130 crossbred Bos taurus cattle using PCR-RFLP. Reported associations between calpastatin (CAST) and Warnerâ€“Bratzler shear force and carboxypeptidase E (CPE) and intra-muscular fat were not confirmed. However, SNP in CAST, amp-activated protein kinase, gamma-3 subunit (PRKAG3), growth hormone receptor (GHR) and stearoyl coA desaturase (SCD) genes were significantly associated with colour traits (p &lt; 0.05). The PRKAG3 SNP was additionally associated with cook loss in M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (p &lt; 0.05) and tended towards association in M. semimembranosus (p &lt; 0.1). An association with pH was identified for the SCD SNP (p &lt; 0.001). The GHR polymorphism was influential on moisture and intra-muscular fat in M. semimembranosus and protein content in both muscles (p &lt; 0.05). Only CPE was associated with sensory traits (flavour in M. longissimus, p &lt; 0.01).

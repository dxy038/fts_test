<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Although the etiology of schizophrenia is unknown, it has a significant genetic component. ‎A number of studies have indicated that neuregulin-1 (NRG1) gene may play a role in the ‎pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In this study, we examined whether the rs2439272 of NRG1 ‎is associated with schizophrenia and its negative symptoms in an Iranian population.‎</p><p><strong>Method: </strong>Rs2439272 was genotyped in 469 participants including 276 unrelated patients with schizophrenia and 193 healthy controls. The association of genetic risk with PANSS, and negative ‎symptoms was examined in the total, male and female samples. COCAPHASE and ‎CLUMP22 programs were used to compare the allele and genotype frequencies, and ‎general linear regression was used to analyze the quantitative dependent variables by the ‎selected variant.‎</p><p><strong>Results: </strong>In this study, it was revealed that the G allele of rs2439272 might be an allele with the ‎increased risk of developing schizophrenia, especially in the male participants. In addition, ‎significant differences were found between the G allele and GG genotype frequencies and ‎PANSS, and negative symptoms in the total and male participants.‎</p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Our results supported the association between rs2439272 in NRG1 gene and risk of ‎schizophrenia and its negative symptoms in an Iranian population.

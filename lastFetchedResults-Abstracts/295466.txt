This study was prospectively carried out on 880 acutely burned patients admitted to the Burn Unit of Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt, during the period from the 1 May 1995 to the 31 October 2001, with the objective to analyze the epidemiological features of burned patients in our country. The means of age and percentage total body surface area burned (TBSB) were 27.8±2.9 years and 32±5.7%, respectively. Most of the patients were city dwellers and were self-referred to the Burn Unit. There were no significant yearly variations in hospital admissions. Seasonal variations in the form of peaks in winter and spring were noticed. Females (53.1%) were more prevalent than males (46.8%). Adults (61%) superceded children (39%). Male children (42.7%) population exceeded female children (35.8%). In contrast, adult females (64.1%) surpassed adult males (57.2%). The commonest burn location was home followed by outdoors then, work locations. Females were most commonly burned at home and mainly suffered from flame and scald burns. Males were most commonly burned in outdoor and work locations than at home and mainly sustained electric and flame burns. There was no difference in the mean percentage TBSB and burn depth in both sexes. Children were mostly burned at home and were mainly victims of scald and flame burns. They had lower rates of full thickness burns compared to adults. Adults were mostly burned in outdoor and work locations and mainly sustained flame and electrical injuries. The results of this study clearly highlighted the specific epidemiological features of burned patients in our area, and thus should provide the necessary information to develop proper burn prevention programs, thereby reducing the frequency of burns and burn-related deaths.

This paper presents the algorithms enabling real-time 4-Dimensional Flight Trajectory (4DT) functionalities in Next Generation Mission Management Systems (NG-MMS), which are the core element of future Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) avionics. In particular, the algorithms are employed for multi-objective optimisation of 4DT intents in various operational scenarios spanning from online strategic to tactical and emergency tasks. The adopted formulation of the multi-objective 4DT optimisation problem includes a number of environmental objectives and operational constraints. In particular, this paper describes the algorithm for planning of 4DT based on a multi-objective optimisation approach and the generalised expression of the cost function adopted for penalties associated with specific airspace volumes, accounting for weather, condensation trails and noise models.

Since both the information which is existed in an organization and its security play a terrific and significant role in a current competitive world, a stringent planning is required for the Information Security Management System implementation project. In this paper, a planning for executing the mentioned project is proposed by considering five essential processes of project management. Since completion times of some activities are not admissible for the respective project customer, they need to be altered. Thus, a linear programming model with the cost minimization objective function is formulated. In other words, with the model and conditions proposed in this paper, no activity is forced to be eliminated for delivering the project within acceptable time and the dimensions of time, cost, quality and the scope are not sacrificed for one another and they are all noticed simultaneously. This project as it is described in this paper is planned and executed in one of Iranian leading IT-based companies.

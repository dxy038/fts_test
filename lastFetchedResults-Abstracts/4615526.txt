In this paper, we optimize probability of detection and probability of false alarm in cognitive radio network to minimize probability of error of a particular SU in a centralized cognitive radio network using Genetic algorithm (GA). Our objective is to minimize probability of error and find out optimum values of probability of occupancy detection or probability of detection and probability of false alarm. We use Genetic Algorithm to solve this optimization problem. The result is compared with Differential Evolution algorithm and it is evident from the comparison that DE finds better solution and takes much lesser number of evaluations to find optimum solution.

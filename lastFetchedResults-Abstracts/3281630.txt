In 2020, mobile and wireless traffic volume is expected to increase thousand-fold over 2010 figures. Moreover, an increase in the number of wirelessly-connected devices to counts in the tens of billions will have a profound impact on society. Massive machine communication, forming the basis for the Internet of Things, will make our everyday life more efficient, comfortable and safer, through a wide range of applications including traffic safety and medical services. The variety of applications and data traffic types will be significantly larger than today, and will result in more diverse requirements on services, devices and networks. METIS is set up by leading global players to prepare the migration towards tomorrowÂ´s multi-purpose global communication infrastructure, serving humans and things. The main objective of METIS is to lay the foundation for this future global mobile and wireless communications system, and to generate a global consensus here. In particular, METIS will provide new solutions which fit the needs beyond 2020.

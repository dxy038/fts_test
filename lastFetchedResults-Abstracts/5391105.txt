Neural networks have been applied in various new ways to the manifold problems in power systems. The great majority of neural network designs attempt to model a dynamic mapping with one neural network. Recently, attempts have been made at using system-type neural networks for distributed parameter systems, where the system dynamics is distributed over a spatial-temporal domain. In this paper, system-type neural networks is illustrated, which are designed using semigroup theory. The objective will be either to achieve extrapolation of functional patterns along one axis, or to achieve a forecasting of functional patterns in multiple axes.

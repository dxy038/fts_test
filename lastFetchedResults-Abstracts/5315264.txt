The objective of this paper is to realize a comfortable space based on alpha wave which is found to be generated more in a comfortable person. In this research the measurement of the alpha-wave to realize a comfortable space is employed. Alpha wave is different for every person. It is possible to compare the alpha wave on the different feelings of a person. But it is not correct to compare it between different persons. Room temperature is adjusted depending on the gathered and classified data per person. Factors considered for every person were age, sex, seasons, temperature, humidity, etc. A fuzzy control system is designed to control the room temperature. The development of rule tables and the design of membership functions based on the knowledge and experience of expert operators and/or on fuzzy model of a plant is considered. An efficient tuning method by means of a genetic algorithm to adjust the shape of membership functions and an optimal search procedure on a multipeak evaluation function are proposed.

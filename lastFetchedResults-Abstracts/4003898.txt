A computer-aided design approach is developed for the analysis and design of single-tuned parametric amplifiers. The voltage gain- bandwidth product (&#8730;<i>G</i>&#773;<i>B</i>) is used as a maximizing objective function for the optimum design. An 18-GHz single-tuned amplifier using a single-packaged varactor diode is designed as an illustration. The experimental amplifier exhibited a large &#8730;<i>G</i>&#773;<i>B</i> of 2400 MHz and a low noise temperature of 180&#176;K at room temperature ambient.

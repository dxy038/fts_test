This paper summarizes the preliminary aspects of a doctoral research that has been conducted at the Brazilian Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA). This research has the objective of developing the CARD-RM, a Certifiable, Agile, Reusable, and Disciplined Reference Model for airborne software. It aims to define a generic model that can be instantiated in each airborne software project, integrating agile practices, in order to improve efficiency without interference in DO-178C compliance.

The paper presents a systematic approach for mapping algorithms into optimal systolic arrays. It obtains the transformed dependency matrix (TDM) directly from the original dependency matrix (DM) so as to select the TDM that meets the desired VLSI requirements. A procedure to map any given algorithm with constant data dependence vectors into an optimal systolic architecture is also proposed. This proposed procedure is formulated as an optimization problem to obtain the TDM with a minimum cost function. Not only that the proposed optimization mapping algorithm selects the TDM that meets the desired VLSI requirements, without deriving the transformation for each TDM, it also determines the optimal TDM given the compound objective function. This approach provides an efficient method for selecting a systolic matrix

An important role still exists for the creation of surgical portasystemic shunts. Multiple techniques have been described. However, no particular one is satisfactory for all clinical situations. The objective of the present paper is to describe an alternative surgical technique for the creation of a decompressive portasystemic shunt. This technique consists of an end-to-side anastomosis between the inferior mesenteric vein and the left renal vein. In our experience, the inferior mesenteric vein to left renal vein anastomosis may be a useful portal decompressive shunt for patients with otherwise difficult peri-portal or peri-pancreatic anatomic exposures. This technique should be a useful tool in the armamentarium of surgeons dealing with patients who need portal decompressive surgical shunts.

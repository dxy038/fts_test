Reasonable effort should be made to remove all past references to this paper.<br/><br/>The presenting author of this paper has the option to appeal this decision by contacting TPII@ieee.org.<br/><br/>According to the problems of traffic flow on road, traffic status evaluation parameters and road running state, and because of relationship among road traffic flow parameters, the paper evaluates road traffic condition with AHP approach. First building evaluation levels of hierarchical structure, then giving all levels calculation formula, thus determining various index weights, next working out evaluation sets which people feel running status the change rule of results on road, eventually by means of VB6.0 designing procedures, according to the experiment result can intuitive draw urban road traffic status can be intuitively concluded. By the example analysis shows that data driven on road running state reasoning evaluation is objective and reasonable, scientific and feasible and justice and practical.

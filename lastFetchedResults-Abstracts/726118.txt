A series of 9-substituted tetrahydroacridines were synthesized by nucleophilic substitution of chloro group with different nucleophiles in 9-chlorotetrahydroacridine (2). The latter could be obtained by POCl3 mediated cyclization of the intermediate enamine, which in turn, was prepared by acid catalyzed condensation of anthranilic acid and cyclohexanone. Most of the compounds on antitubercular evaluation against M. tuberculosis H37 Rv and H37 Ra strains exhibited potent activities with MIC 6.125–0.78 μg/mL comparable to the standard drugs.

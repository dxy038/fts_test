The main purpose of this paper is to study the limitations of mainstream economic models in explaining economic decisions. Stylized facts and evidences collected from intensive studies on imperfect and unbalanced information, learning capabilities of human beings, collective decisions, gender heterogeneities, organization and management, along with new discoveries in the area of cognitive sciences on brain and mind altogether reveal the limitations of the mainsteram economics. This study introduces Cognitive Economic Model as an alternative approach for a better analysis of economic decisions, producing more propper and precise predictions, and finnally, providing effective solutions and policies. The Cognitive Economic Model tries to explore and illustrate the decision-makings and the formation of  preferences and expectations with especial attention to the cognitive process including acquiring, processing and applying information and knowledge in the human mind and brain. However, the effects of environment, institutions and the government on the cognitive process are taken into account as well. Thus, in addition to resources/facilities and prices, i.e. the conventional factors, the decisions should be analyzed with this pre-supposition that they under the influnece of how the mind and brain function in the context of real organizational and institutional environments. It means that both objective and subjective factors are deemed as decisive factors that define the decisions and behaviors. Given new developments in the cognitive sciences besides leading economic studies toward experimental researches, cognitive economics appears to turn into a major approach in economics and it has a promising future to rectify the economic problems and challenges.

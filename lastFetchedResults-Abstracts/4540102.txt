Specific features of ICs parametric optimisation problem are considered in this paper. These specific features are mainly determined by the kind of optimisation model, which consists of different types of optimisation variables, objective functions and functions of constraints. The detailed analysis of combination of different types of optimisation model parts allows us to choose proper optimisation method.

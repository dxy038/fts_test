The main objective of this paper is to design and analyze a residential photovoltaic system for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle load, in addition to regular residential requirements. This system is a combination of two subsystems which are cascaded through a DC link. First subsystem is the solar energy harvesting part with PV array, current controlled boost converter and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) system. The second subsystem is the energy storage system with battery packs and a current controlled bidirectional DC/AC inverter. All the current controllers are selected as sliding mode controller which is more robust against parametric uncertainties. A power management algorithm is introduced to control the power flow between grid and battery packs according to load profile. The operation and reliability of the system is presented for simulations within one year period.

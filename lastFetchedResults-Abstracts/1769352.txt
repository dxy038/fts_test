The objective of the present in vitro research was to investigate cardiac tissue cell functions (specifically cardiomyocytes and neurons) on poly(lactic–co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) (50:50 wt.%)–carbon nanofiber (CNF) composites to ascertain their potential for myocardial tissue engineering applications. CNF were added to biodegradable PLGA to increase the conductivity and cytocompatibility of pure PLGA. For this reason, different PLGA:CNF ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 wt.%) were used and the conductivity as well as cytocompatibility of cardiomyocytes and neurons were assessed. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy analysis characterized the microstructure, chemistry, and crystallinity of the materials of interest to this study. The results show that PLGA:CNF materials are conductive and that the conductivity increases as greater amounts of CNF are added to PLGA, from 0 S m–1 for pure PLGA (100:0 wt.%) to 5.5 × 10−3 S m–1 for pure CNF (0:100 wt.%). The results also indicate that cardiomyocyte density increases with greater amounts of CNF in PLGA (up to 25:75 wt.% PLGA:CNF) for up to 5 days. For neurons a similar trend to cardiomyocytes was observed, indicating that these conductive materials promoted the adhesion and proliferation of two cell types important for myocardial tissue engineering applications. This study thus provides, for the first time, an alternative conductive scaffold using nanotechnology which should be further explored for cardiovascular applications.

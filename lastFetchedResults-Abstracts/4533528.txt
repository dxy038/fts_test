Decision-making on bidding alliance partner is a complex multi-objective problem, and the result will directly affect the winning of BOT projects bidding. First the problem of bidding alliance partner decision-making is analyzed and operation process of bidding alliance is mainly described. Then multi-objective model of bidding alliance partner decision-making is established. As to specific tasks, entropy weight and matter-element relative analysis are put forward to optimize and solve this model. Information entropy is used to determine weights of factors, which avoids results influenced by subjective factors. Matter-element relative analysis can not only calculate the grade level of overall alliance partners, but also determine the main factorsÂ´ grade level. Therefore, this method can help the alliance leader to select the proper and powerful alliance partner and form BOT bidding alliance. Finally the case indicates the method is feasible and has certain practical significance.

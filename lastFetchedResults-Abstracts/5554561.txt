In this work, we address the energy efficiency issue for time-sensitive multiplayers games in MANET environment. We propose a simple, yet efficient, client side packets concatenation solution, which exploit the information provided by a delay version of the OLSR routing protocol. Using gameplay objective metrics and extensive experimentations we show that our proposal can significantly increase the network life duration, while improving the game fairness among FPS (First Person Shooter) players.

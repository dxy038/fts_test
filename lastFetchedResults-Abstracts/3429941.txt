Small-scale energy storage systems incorporating a battery bank have attracted special interest for load-levelling systems. Because the battery bank voltage in such systems is actually low, it is important to consider the bidirectional chopper suitable for large step-up and step-down ratios. A novel circuit topology for a bidirectional chopper acceptable for small-scale load levelling systems is presented and evaluated on the basis of analytical and experimental results.

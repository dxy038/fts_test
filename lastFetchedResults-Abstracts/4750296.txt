In data mining post-processing, rule selection using objective rule evaluation indices is one of a useful method to find out valuable knowledge from mined patterns. However, the relationship between an index value and expertsÂ´ criteria has never been clarified. In this study, we have compared the accuracies of classification learning algorithms for datasets with randomized class distributions and real human evaluations. As a method to determine the relationship, we used rule evaluation models, which are learned from a dataset consisting of objective rule evaluation indices and evaluation labels for each rule. Then, the results show that accuracies of classification learning algorithms with/without criteria of human experts are different on a balanced randomized class distribution. With regarding to the results, we can consider about a way to distinguish randomly evaluated rules using the accuracies of multiple learning algorithms.

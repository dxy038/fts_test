Since the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is increased rapidly, the disposition of WEEE has caused tremendous attention in China. The government is drafting regulation which will makes Original Equipment Manufacturers formally responsible for taking back their products. Logistics network design becomes vital for cost efficient managing WEEE in coming day. The aim of this paper is to take a detailed look at logistics network design for WEEE. Firstly, From the point of resourceÂ´s re-use, Integrated logistics network for WEEE is presented taking into account all problems about reuse of entire products, parts of products, and reclaimed materials decomposed from WEEE. Secondly, a mixed integer programming (MIP) model is presented for designing logistics network of WEEE, its objective is to optimize the logistics network infrastructure of WEEE and minimize the total costs. Finally, an illustration is given through a hypothetical example

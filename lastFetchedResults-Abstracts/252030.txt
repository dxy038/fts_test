Both iIntegrating sphere reflectometry (ISR) as well as laser polarimetry have
their advantages and limitations in their ability to determine the normal spectral
emissivity of metallic samples. Laser polarimetry has been used for years to
obtain normal spectral emissivity measurements on pulse-heated materials. The
method is based on the Fresnel equations, which describe reflection and refraction
at an ideally smooth iInterface between two isotropic media. However,
polarimetry is frequently used with surfaces that clearly deviate from this ideal
condition. Questions arise with respect to the applicability of the simple Fresnel
equations to non-specular surfaces. On the other hand, reflectometry utilizing
iIntegrating spheres provides a measurement of the hemispherical spectral reflectance,
from which the normal spectral emissivity can be derived. ISR provides
data on spectral-normal-hemispherical reflectance and, hence, normal spectral
emissivity for a variety of surfaces. However, the resulting errors are minimal
when both the sample and the reference have a similar bidirectional reflectance
distribution function (BRDF). In an effort to explore the limits of polarimetry
in terms of surface roughness, room temperature measurements on the same
samples with various degrees of roughness were performed using both ISR and
a laser polarimeter. In this paper the two methods are briefly described and the
results of the comparison are discussed.

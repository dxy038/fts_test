Objective
jective was to clarify the clinical factors that might affect the degree of hepatic parenchymal enhancement at gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
als and Methods
l of 84 patients with (n=63) and without chronic liver disease (n=21) underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging. Contrast-enhanced MR images of hepatobiliary phase (HP) were obtained at 20 min after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration. The relative enhancement (RE) of liver parenchyma at 20 min HP was calculated from region of interest measurements at each patient. Then, these results were correlated with various clinical parameters using Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the predictor of the degree of hepatic parenchymal enhancement was determined using multiple regression analysis.
s
esence or absence of chronic liver disease (P=.002), ascites (P=.005) and splenomegaly (P=.027), and the values of prothrombin activity (P=.008), total bilirubin (T-Bil) (P=.001), albumin (P=.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P=.002) and cholinesterase (P=.007) were significantly correlated with the RE of liver parenchyma at 20 min HP. Among these parameters, increases of T-Bil (P=.011 to .028) and AST (P=.018 to .049) were predictors of decreased hepatic parenchymal enhancement.
sions
c parenchymal enhancement of Gd-EOB-DTPA was affected by various clinical parameters. Impaired hepatobiliary enhancement may be predicted by routine biochemical tests, such as T-Bil and AST.

Abstract
Objective
Cardiac dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with beta thalassemia. In these patients, repeated blood transfusion, ineffective erythropoiesis and increased gastrointestinal iron absorption lead to iron overload in the body and this induced heart failure. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured in major beta thalassemia (B-Th) patients to detect the relation of serum ferritin level and left ventricular systolic function.
Materials and Methods
The present prospective study evaluated 75 patients with B-thalassemia (39 female, 36 male) aged one to 44 years old. They were treated with desferal 5 days a week for at least six months. For this study they treated by desferal 7 days a week. Left ventricular ejection fraction and serum ferritin were measured before and after intervention, and they were compared for the best treatment.
Results
The mean ejection fraction was 60.45% and 62.9% before and after aggressive therapy, which difference was significant. Serum ferritin level also was reduced after intervention. Difference between mean ferritin before and after intervention was 49.984. Serum ferritin showed negative correlation with left ventricular function.
Conclusion
Lower serum ferritin concentration with aggressive therapy was associated with better left ventricular function.

Background: It has been documented that cytokines play important roles in the induction of normal functions of the placenta. It has been hypothesized that abnormal expression of the cytokines may be associated with unsuccessful pregnancy.Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the serum levels of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and tumor growth factor (TGF-ß) in pre-term, term neonates, and their corresponding mothers.Materials and Methods: This study was performed on 100 term and 60 pre-term neonates, and also on their corresponded mothers. Serum levels of IL-17A and TGF-ß were examined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results: Our results revealed that the serum levels of IL-17A were significantly decreased in pre-term neonates in comparison to full-term neonates. However, the serum levels of IL-17A in the mothers either with pre-term or full-term neonates were not different. Also the serum levels of TGF-ß were not changed in pre-term neonates and their mothers when compared with full-term neonates and their mothers, respectively.Conclusion: Based on these findings, it can be concluded that IL-17A may play crucial roles in induction of normal pregnancies and also probably participates in normal growth of fetus.

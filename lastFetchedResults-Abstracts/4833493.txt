The generalized <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>2</sub> norm is adapted to capture requirements of satisfying time-domain hard constraints such as suspension stroke limitation, road holding constraint and actuator saturation. The peak amplitudes can then be bounded directly. The <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>2</sub> norm is used as a measure for ride comfort. This way, conflicting control objectives are specified independently in the framework of multi-objective control and solved using LMI optimization. Simulation results for a 2 DOF quarter-car model confirm a significant improvement on robust ride comfort, while it is guaranteed that suspension stroke and active force remain within given bounds and the wheel is in firm control to road, for all uncertainties considered.

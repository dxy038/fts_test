In this paper, firstly a new stable fuzzy adaptive controller based on optimal fuzzy reasoning methods is provided, whose adjustable parameters are output weights of defuzzication method. Secondly, a new method of optimal fuzzy reasoning is given, whose objective function includes rule weights. Thirdly, another new stable fuzzy adaptive controller based on the new method is provided, whose adjustable parameters are rule weights. The two kinds of fuzzy adaptive controllers include inner and outer feedback and optimization, which build a whole control scheme. The inner feedback and optimization are presented by optimal fuzzy reasoning, while the outer are presented by adaptive mechanism. In the end, simulation results show that the two methods are feasible

This study addresses the preliminary technical feasibility assessment of a mechanical apparatus for conversion of wind energy. The proposed device, designated as “leading-edge-flutter wind power generator”, employs aeroelastic dynamic instability of a blade airfoil, torsionally rotating about its leading edge. Although the exploitation of aeroelastic phenomena has been proposed by the research community for energy harvesting, this apparatus is compact, simple and marginally susceptible to turbulence and wake effects. The objective of this study was to identify a conceptual configuration that could become operational at low and medium wind speeds. Pre- and post-critical regimes are simulated; the prediction of mechanical efficiency in the absence of dissipation is also discussed.

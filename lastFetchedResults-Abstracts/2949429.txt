We consider two task assignment problems. In one case the problem is to distribute the tasks to the heterogeneous processors in such a way that the completion time of all the tasks is minimized. In the second problem the objective is to distribute tasks to the processors in such a way that the total computation time is minimized. Both the problems are known to be NP-complete. We present an approximation algorithm for the first problem with a performance bound. For the second problem we present a simulated annealing algorithm and present our experimental results.

Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) is a challenging problem for the next generation wireless systems which limits the system performance, especially for users located at the edge of a cell. In this paper, in order to achieve good user fairness, each user is given a guaranteed minimum number of resource blocks while the cell edge users were given a higher allocation priority. The resource allocation is coordinated in a way that the ICI is controlled within its acceptance limit. In addition, an adaptive power control scheme is utilized to further adjust the transmission power levels of the cell centre users. Finally, in order to achieve a balanced solution considering both user fairness and total cell throughput, a suitable power level is selected by running a hybrid objective function. Simulations show that the proposed RRM method combined with the adaptive power allocation scheme can provide considerable performance improvement compared with the existing methods.

Generic Integrated Maintenance Diagnostics (GIMADS) is a US Air Force and industry cooperative program whose prime objective is to develop and institutionalize a system-engineering, time-phased process for integrated diagnostics that meets the operational needs of the weapon system. The authors address some of the current approaches to tailoring the diagnostic requirements and then allocating them to equipment in a manner in which the design engineer can understand what is needed without being restricted as to how it is to be integrated into the total design. Consideration is also given to the verification of diagnostic design requirements and the maturation process. The GIMADS approach assures total diagnostic coverage at each design level and provides the optimum partitioning of embedded and external diagnostic equipment. The diagnostic allocation process also specifies the optimum diagnostic mix and requirements to assure that operational, safety, and maintenance needs are met. A proper design results in minimal life-cycle costs while meeting the operational and mission requirements

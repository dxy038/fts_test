The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has initiated several studies on possible missions addressing the needs of Canadian government departments for operational land and ocean applications. Three parallel studies have been completed that reviewed the requirements with an objective to identify microsatellite mission concepts. The CSA has further awarded two contracts to the Canadian industry teams to investigate the feasibility of hyperspectral imagers that are compatible with a microsatellite platform. Two different concepts of low-mass imaging systems have been proposed and studied. In order to address to the main challenges identified, the CSA has extended the two feasibility studies. This paper briefly reports the updates of the feasibility studies in the extension period and new development in the ongoing concept study of a Canadian hyperspectral mission.

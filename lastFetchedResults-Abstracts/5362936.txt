After Kazaa and Skype, Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis released Joost: a peer to peer TV client. Joost claims that it can work seamlessly and has better video quality than existing p2p video streaming applications and even approaching number of traditional TV broadcasted channels. In this paper, we present an experimental analysis of the Joost p2p television protocol. After months of packet monitoring, we have gathered valuable data traffic that is analysed. We show the results of Joost insights and describe its key components and networking model. Our objective is to analyse its management protocol, considering it like a closed-box, without any a-priori, knowledge on its internal implementation. We focused also on the peer life in the Joost network.

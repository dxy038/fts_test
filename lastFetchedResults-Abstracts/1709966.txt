BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Emotional dysregulation is often described as the central feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD). For determining relative role of this factor in symptoms of patients with borderline personality disorder, the current study was conducted to investigate the relation of emotion processing styles and alexithymia with symptoms of borderline personality disorder. 
METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted in correlation and prediction method. One hundred and fifty students of Azad University of Ardabil in 2012-2013 were selected by simple random sampling, they were being asked to respond to borderline personality, emotion processing and alexithymia individually and at classrooms. Then data was analyzed.
FINDINGS: The results showed that borderline personality symptoms have positive relationship with intrusion (r=0.35; p < 0.001), lack of attunement (r=0.21; p < 0.009), dissociation (r=0.25; p < 0.002), discordant (r=0.44; p < 0.001), suppression (r=0.19; p < 0.02), lack of control (r=0.42; p < 0.001), difficulty in identifying feeling (r=0.37; p < 0.001), difficulty in describing feeling (r=0.32; p < 0.001), external orient thinking style (r=0.17; p < 0.03) and alexithymia (r=0.36; p < 0.001). Also the results showed that 32% of variance of borderline personality symptoms was explained by emotion processing styles (F=21.13; p < 0.001) and 15% variance of it was explained by alexithymia (F=25.05; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This result show that symptoms of borderline personality disorder in general population can be predicted partly on emotion processing styles and alexithymia.

Objective: Amiodarone as an iodinated benzofuran derivative is a potent antiarrhythmic
agent currently used for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Pulmonary toxicity
is one of the complications of Amiodarone therapy. The aim of this study was to
determine the toxicity of Amiodarone for pneumocytes.
Materials and Methods: 14 male white New Zealand rabbits were divided in a control
group and an experimental group. The experimental group was subjected to intra
peritoneal injection with a single daily dose of 80 mg/kg Amiodarone for two weeks.
The control group received only normal saline. At the end of the injection period, the
two groups were anesthetized and perfused with Karnovsky fixative. The lung tissue
was removed and fixed, then prepared for light and electron microscope studies.
Morphometric studies were made on sections to find nucleus profile dimensions.
Results: Light microscope observation showed acute changes in the alveolus including
congestion of alveolar capillaries and infiltration of red blood cells (RBCs) into
the lumen of the alveoli. Electron microscope study of lung tissue revealed abnormal
inclusion bodies within type ?? & ? pneumocytes. The micrographs also showed
the presence of vacuoles in 5% of the type ?? pneumocytes. Morphometric studies
showed that the nucleus of the cells in the experimental group were smaller than in
the control group (p < 0.01).
Conclusion: These results indicate that Amiodarone administration can cause damage
to pnuemocytes and the alveolus of rabbit lung, so the effectiveness of Amiodarone
in long term treatment of heart failure patients is limited because of the development
of lung toxicity.

Objective: To evaluate the relationships between depression and ageing, nutrition, and selected
haematologic variables. Measurements: A cross-sectional study was performed in elderly institutionalized
patients (n=100) of all nursing homes in the Brazilian city of Uberl√¢ndia, with determination of the Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS) and the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scores, and selected haematologic
variables. Results: GDS had a significant negative dependence with the MNA for the entire institutionalized
population. The prevalence of depression was higher among females, but significant correlations existed between
GDS scores and erythrocytes counts, haemoglobin levels, or haematocrit values for the males only. However, a
borderline correlation existed between GDS and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values in the females.
Conclusions: Depression was associated with worsening of nutritional status and the degree of anemia of the
entire elderly population and the male, but not the female subjects. The borderline correlation observed between
the GDS and MCV for the female subjects suggests that the nutritional deficiencies responsible for the MCV
increase are a cause, and not an effect, of depression.

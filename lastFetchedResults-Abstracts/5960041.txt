Unlike traditional single objective method, hypertension design is represented as a multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, we present an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm to solve hypertension nutritional diet problems. Simulated annealing is presented to overcome deficiencies such as the poor local search and premature convergence of multi-objective genetic algorithm. The experimental results indicate that this algorithm is quite effective for hypertension design and provides powerful decision support to the design-maker.

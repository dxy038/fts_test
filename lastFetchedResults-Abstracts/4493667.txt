The primary objective of the paper is to augment the efficiency of signature process in elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), which turns out to be a bottleneck in mobile devices due to its heavy consumption of resources. An improved algorithm for strengthening the speed of verification process in ECDSA is proposed and evaluated. A comparative study of Comb algorithm with the proposed algorithm for simultaneous multiplication on the NIST-recommended elliptic curves over prime fields is done and a broad analysis of the outcomes is also carried out. Strengthening the pre-computation process with respect to the speed of execution during verification will be the crucial task of this implementation

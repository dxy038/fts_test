Sizing of particles in industrial processes is of great technical interest and therefore different physical-based techniques have been developed. The objective of this study was to review the characteristics of modern sizing instruments based on a modified fibre-optical spatial filtering technique (SFT). Fibre-optical spatial filtering velocimetry was modified by fibre-optical spot scanning in order to determine simultaneously the size and the velocity of particles. Sizing in-line instruments of Parsum GmbH use these measuring principles and may be adapted to different process conditions. Particles with sizes of 50–6000 μm and velocities up to 50 m/s may be measured by the probe system IPP 70. An overview is given to real-time sizing of particles in different technical applications: fluid-bed granulation, high shear wet granulation, Wurster coating, mixing, spray drying, crystallization and milling.

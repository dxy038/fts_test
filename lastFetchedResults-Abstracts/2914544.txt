Until recently, indirect drive methods that convert rotary motion (such as from rotary motors and gears) into linear motion have been the main methods used for linear motion systems. Recently, however, advances in office and factory automation equipment have led to the development and commercialization of direct drive systems using linear surface (SFM) motors. In this paper, the authors describe the SFMÂ´s basic structure and operating principles, show the mathematical development that supports its bidirectional control system, and report on the results of prototype drive tests

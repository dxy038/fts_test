Background and Objective: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is the most common form of the tuberculosis in HIV infected patients that can affect on progression of HIV infection .The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of HIV infection on the clinical presentation of tuberculosis.
Subjects and Methods:  We extracted the information of admitted patients in infectious ward of Razi hospital with pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis from 2004 – 2009. Outcome of this stage was 204 patients. Then we divided these patients in two groups, group 1 patients with HIV (34 cases) and group 2 without HIV infection(170 cases). Finally, we compared the clinical manifestations between these two groups. Data analysis with Chi square test and SPSS software was done. 
Results: Tuberculosis was more common in men in both groups (p < 0.001). The mean age of HIV positive patients was lower than HIV negative patients. (31.85±8.52 vs. 44.33±10.34), (p = 0.001). Fever , weakness and hemoptysis were more frequent in HIV positive patients ( %94.11 vs. %81.17 , %58.82 vs. %50.58 and %20.58 vs. %7.05) , (p=0.07, p=0.23 , p=0.01). Whereas chronic cough, sputum, weight loss and night sweating were more prominent in HIV negative patients .( %95.29 vs. %73.52 , %87.64 vs. %70.58, %71.17 vs. %38.23 and %61.76 vs. %41.17), (p= 0.03 , p= 0.04 , p=0.009 , p= 0.04 ). 
Conclusion: According to the study in these two groups it is important to consider tuberculosis in differential diagnosis of every HIV infected patient not only with cough and sputum but also with fever and constitutional symptoms.

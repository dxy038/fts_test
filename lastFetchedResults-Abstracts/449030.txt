Objective
To compare the efficacy and afety of timolol 0.5%/dorzolamide 2% fixed combination v timolol maleate 0.5% and unoprotone 0.15% given twice daily.
Deign
Propective multicenter, randomized, double-maked, croover comparion tudy.
Method
Primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertenion patient were randomly aigned to one of the treatment group for a 6-week treatment period and then croed over to the oppoite treatment. Diurnal curve teting wa performed at 8:00  , 10:00  , 4:00  , 6:00  , and 8:00  at baeline and the end of each treatment period. The run-in medicine wa timolol twice daily for 28 day.
Reult
Thirty-two patient completed thi trial. The baeline trough preure wa 24.3 ± 3.0 mm Hg, and the diurnal curve wa 23.4 ± 3.2 mm Hg. For the fixed combination the treatment trough preure wa 20.8 ± 4.1 mm Hg and the diurnal curve wa 19.6 ± 3.6 mm Hg, wherea timolol and unoprotone concomitant therapy howed a treatment trough preure of 20.1 ± 4.5 mm Hg and a diurnal preure of 19.8 ± 4.1 mm Hg. There wa no ignificant difference between treatment group at any time point, for the diurnal curve, or in the extended reduction from baeline. There wa no difference between treatment group regarding ocular and ytemic unolicited or olicited advere event. Burning, tinging, and conjunctival hyperemia were the advere event mot noted. There were no eriou advere event during thi trial.
Concluion
Thi tudy ugget that both timolol/dorzolamide 2% fixed combination and concomitant timolol maleate 0.5% and unoprotone 0.15% therapy provide imilar efficacy and afety throughout the daytime diurnal curve.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of incorporating basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-impregnated gelatin microspheres into an artificial dermis on impaired wound healing using a pressure-induced decubitus ulcer model in genetically diabetic mice.

Daily 10 h prolonged pressure at 500 g/cm2 was loaded for 2 consecutive days over the femoral trochanter tertius of mice to produce ischemic necrosis. Five days after completion of the pressure load, the necrotic tissues were resected. Then, an artificial dermis incorporating bFGF-impregnated gelatin microspheres or bFGF in solution was implanted into the wound (n=5). Mice were sacrificed at 5, 7, and 10 days after implantation, and a full-thickness biopsy was taken and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis.

All experimental animals were infected because diabetic mice have little tolerance for infection. Seven days after implantation, the incorporation of bFGF into the artificial dermis reduced infection and accelerated fibroblast proliferation and capillary formation. However, the accelerated effects were more significant with the incorporation of bFGF-impregnated gelatin microspheres than with free bFGF.

We conclude that the incorporation of bFGF-impregnated gelatin microspheres into an artificial dermis induced tissue regeneration in an artificial dermis in an impaired wound healing model.

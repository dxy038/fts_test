Lack of resources is one of the problems of todayâ€™s organizations, having a special character in each period of time. Project selection stands for the priority of projects and allocation of organization resources only for those projects that have gotten the greatest priority, and from which, due to selection and allocation, organization profit will be maximum. Different factors can have an effect, including quantitative and qualitative criteria, and projects have been selected and given priority because of them. It is worth mentioning that there is an interdependent relationship between those criteria, and taking this relationship into account can have an effect on the conditions of priority and selection. The objective of this paper is to present a systematic method that considers interdependent relations among criteria, the projects that have been given priority due to these relations and the organization resources that are allocated to projects with the greater priority.
In this paper, interdependence relations among criteria are determined using an analytic network process to find the projects that have been given priority.  In the next step, the organizations resources among the projects given the greatest priority are allocated using zero-one goal programming.
The result of the questioned model of performance in the studied organization was in the following manner: Six criteria were selected in the use of the model, and, due to expert viewpoints, the interdependence relations among the criteria were identified.  Due to taking priorities from the analytic network process, the model of zero-one goal programming is formulized in such a way that by solving this model from among seven projects, the questioned five projects have been selected, and resources are allocated from these five projects.

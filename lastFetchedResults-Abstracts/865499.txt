The development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools to assess the effect of stressors on organisms is a principal objective of environmental proteomics. This study is focused on evaluating the potential of using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) to assess stress in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).
Plasma and mucus samples were taken from fish that had previously been maintained in a range of high density conditions, together with control fish maintained under low density conditions. Samples were collected during the post-density stress period for protein profile analysis. The mass spectra were analysed to evaluate reproducibility and to search for condition specific changes in protein expression. Multivariate analysis of the peak relative intensity data indicated a segregation of the data into three entities in accordance with the density level fish had been subjected to during the density stress period. This segregation was seen in both plasma and mucus data.

Environmental pillars of sustainable development in any country. Regardless of the environment, natural and human resources have been diminished and adverse effect on the earth and even human. In mining operations is product the raw materials necessary for life and human development. With increases the pollutions the possibility of contamination of the environment healthy in human life is taken away. As such, in many countries, an environmental impact of mining operation has been studied.  In this paper, from waste foundry sand plant with the size under 50 microns in Taftan in Iran and tailings Silica sand company of Alborz with The dimensions below 100 microns is used. Annual production is Close to 50,000 tons of material.  According to the environmental problems try to remove silica materials from factory environment every month. In order to achieve this objective, wasted materials with orthophthalic unsaturated polymer resin for furnish synthetic is used, that this stone are used in building facades with different colors and sizes. All the production steps in laboratory are given in the last chapter of paper. Artificial stone obtained with compressive strength and optimal tensile strength, pressed in 99.14 mega Pascal with 3 minutes that the coefficient absorption of them is less than 0.1 percent.

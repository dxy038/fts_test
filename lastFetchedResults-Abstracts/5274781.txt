An on line partial discharge test technique on rotating machines fed by inverters is analyzed in this paper. All the research to determine the configuration of the components was developed using simulation in Matlab Simulink&#8482;. The important fact is that the entire model was made with all the components and situations that result from partial discharges on the insulation of electrical rotating machines. The model of the rotating machine is in high frequency because is fed by an inverter in order to visualize the overvoltage and partial discharge phenomena. Voltage impulse and partial discharge pulse spectra is filtering by a multipole filter before be passed through a coupling capacitor, connected to the machine terminals. Interesting results are showing in this paper to verify the accuracy of this online partial discharge testing technique. Another objective is to find out the values of components parameters before to be implemented.

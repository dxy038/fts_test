Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the causative agent of tuberculosis. The increasing incidence of multi drug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistance tuberculosis (XDR-TB) worldwide highlighted the urgent need to search for alternative antimycobacterial agents. More and more people in developing countries utilize traditional medicine for their major primary health care needs. It has been determined that pharmaceutical plant, Lagerstroemia tomentosa and Diospyros virginiana, possesses some antibacterial effect. In this study, the antimycobacterial effects of L. tomentosa and D. virginiana methanolic extracts on sensitive and resistant isolates of MTB were examined. Leaf methanolic extract was prepared using methanol 70%. Sensitivity and resistance of isolates was determined by proportion method. The effects of two different methonolic extract concentrations (20 and 40 ?g/ml) of the plants were examined against 6 sensitive and resistant strains of MTB with different patterns of drug resistance. MTB H37Rv (ATCC 27294) was set as control in all culturing and sensitivity testing processes. The results showed that L. tomentosa and D. virginiana methanolic extracts had weak inhibitory effect on different strains of MTB. The highest percentage of inhibition for L. tomentosa and D. virginiana was observed 38% and 33.3%, respectively.

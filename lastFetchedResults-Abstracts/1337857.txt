Nutrition and management modeling has been expanding rapidly in the last 30 years. Nutrition and physiology models in ruminants have used different modeling techniques ranging from simple empirical-based to mechanistic and dynamic models. The level of complexity is driven by available data and modeler objective. The two primary objectives are to serve as a research tool to help guide future research versus field-applied models. Field-applied models combine empirical and mechanistic techniques, allowing nutritionists and consultants to evaluate and predict animal performance by using inputs that can be collected on-farm and by using standard laboratory methodology. More complex dynamic/mechanistic models have been historically used to guide research. These models have tended to focus on enhancing the biochemical understanding associated with lactating cows. Regardless of methodology, modeling has improved the nutrition and feeding practices of all species in which it has been used. However, limited modeling has occurred regarding the equine. The objectives of this article are to introduce the basis for an equine model (Fancy) and outline how modeling can be used to enhance knowledge by guiding research projects. During the development of Fancy, inconsistencies related to requirement predictions were discovered. Most inconsistencies were related to data limitations; however, this illustrates where modeling can offer significant rewards. The development of a model can assist in defining these inconsistencies and data limitations. Research resources can then be better allocated to address these issues, resulting in expanding the knowledge base of the system being modeled.

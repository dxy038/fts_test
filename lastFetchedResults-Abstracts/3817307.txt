When a bandpass filter has specifications that are not geometrically symmetric, the proper choice of the constant <img src="/images/tex/110.gif" alt="K"/> in the frequency transformation <img src="/images/tex/10004.gif" alt="S = (s + K/s)"/> has an effect on the selectivity parameter of the transformed lowpass characteristic. In this note we prove that if the objective is to minimize the selectivity parameter, then the best choice of <img src="/images/tex/110.gif" alt="K"/> is the product of the two passband edge frequencies. On the other hand, for a bandstop filter, the best choice of <img src="/images/tex/110.gif" alt="K"/> in the transformation <img src="/images/tex/10005.gif" alt="S = 1/(s - K/s)"/> is the product of the two stopband edge frequencies.

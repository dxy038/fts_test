MUSES-C, a Japanese sample return mission, is targeting a small near Earth asteroid, 1998SF36, which is considered an S-type asteroid and is similar in spectroscopy to LL class ordinary chondrite meteorite (). Although this mission will bring us detailed photometric data, that is, disk-resolved bidirectional reflectance data of the asteroid, there were few bidirectional reflectance data of ordinary chondrite meteorites. For the purpose of comparison with the data obtained by the in-situ observation, we have performed measurements of bidirectional reflectance of ordinary chondrite samples.Here we summarize the result of our laboratory measurements of the bidirectional reflectance and compare them with the scattering property of 1998SF36. Although the geometric albedo of 1998SF36 is higher than the typical value of S-type asteroids, however, the laboratory data of ordinary chondrite are similar to or brighter than the model disk-resolved reflectance of 1998SF36 derived from disk-integrated ground-based data. We found in our laboratory data that there is a positive correlation between the surface roughness and the strength of the opposition effect. A stronger opposition effect in the reflectance of 1998SF36 than the laboratory data may therefore indicate that the surface of the asteroid has rougher structure than our laboratory samples.

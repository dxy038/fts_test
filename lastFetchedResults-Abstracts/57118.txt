Cellulitis caused by Escherichia coli in broilers results in substantial losses to the broiler industry in North America and Europe due to condemnations at slaughter. The objective of this study was to identify cellulitis in broilers in Sri Lanka and to characterize the E. coli from cellulitis and other colibacillosis lesions. Twenty-four farms from the low- and mid-country were selected and bacterial isolations were obtained from 241 birds. Two hundred and ninety-one gross lesions were observed in these 241 birds and 162 E. coli isolates were obtained. Cellulitis was observed in 21% of the birds. Twenty-one per cent of the birds had multiple lesions due to E. coli. The frequency of detection of other disease syndromes was 162 (67%) birds with pericarditis, 26 (11%) airsacculitis, 24 (10%) hepatitis, 12 (5%) perihepatitis, and 16 (7%) polyserositis (a combination of pericarditis, perihepatitis and airsacculitis). Serogroups O78, O2, O85 and O88 were distributed among the 32% of typable E. coli and 81% of isolates were assigned to three biotypes. Forty-four per cent of the E. coli isolates produced aerobactin and 88% demonstrated resistance to the bactericidal effect of normal chicken serum. The majority of the E. coli isolates were resistant to the antibiotics commonly used in poultry. All the E. coli isolates were non-haemolytic and 25% of the isolates produced K1 capsule. This study demonstrated the presence of cellulitis in Sri Lanka and this report describes some of the phenotypic characteristics of the E. coli isolates.

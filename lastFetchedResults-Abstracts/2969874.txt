The algebraic Riccati equation studied in this paper is related to the suboptimal state feedback H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control problem. It is parameterized by the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm bound &#947; we want to achieve. The objective of this paper is to study the behaviour of the solution to the Riccati equation as a function of &#947;. It turns out that a stabilizing solution exists for all but finitely many values of &#947; larger than some a priori determined boundary &#947;*. On the other hand for values smaller than &#947;* there does not exist a stabilizing solution. The finite number of exception points turn out to be switching points where eigenvalues of the stabilizing solution can switch from negative to positive with increasing &#947;. After the final switching point the solution will be positive semi-definite. We obtain the following interpretation: the Riccati equation has a stabilizing solution with k negative eigenvalues if and only if there exist a static feedback such that the closed loop transfer matrix has no more than k unstable poles and an L<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm strictly less than &#947;.

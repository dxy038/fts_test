This study is the extension of a work which we have already started on the miniaturization of a printed antenna by using electromagnetic band gap structure (EBG) of mushroom-like type [1]. In addition to the miniaturization, our objective in this study aims to extend the bandwidth and enhanced the gain of this antenna by design of a second EBG structure with the same mushroom-like type. Thus, we demonstrate that the EBG structures are the good candidates for the design of antennas characterised by low profile, wide band and high gain.

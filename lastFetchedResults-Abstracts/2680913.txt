The aim of a multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) is to assign resource(s) with the restricted capacity
to an execution mode of activities by considering relationship constraints to achieve pre-determined objective(s). These goals vary with
managers or decision makers of any organization who should determine suitable objective(s) considering organization strategies. Also, we
introduce the preemptive extension of the problem which allows for activity splitting. In this paper, the preemptive multi-mode resourceconstrained
project scheduling problem (P-MMRCPSP) with Minimum makespan and the maximization of net present value (NPV) has
been considered. Since the considered model is NP-Hard, the performance of our proposed model is evaluated by comparison with two
well-known algorithms: non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) and multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm
(MOICA). These metaheuristics have been compared on the basis of a computational experiment performed on a set of instances obtained
from standard test problems constructed by the ProGen project generator, where, additionally, cash flows were generated randomly with
the uniform distribution. Since the effectiveness of most meta-heuristic algorithms significantly depends on choosing the proper
parameters. A Taguchi experimental design method (DOE) was applied to set and estimate the proper values of GAs parameters for
improving their performances. The computational results show that the proposed MOICA outperforms the NSGA-II.

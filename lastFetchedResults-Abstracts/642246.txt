Objectives
Our primary objective was to determine whether hip girth could accurately predict abdominal fat and total body fat in postmenopausal women. A secondary objective was to investigate the relation between body mass index (BMI) and hip girth in postmenopausal women.
Methods

Body weight, height, girths, skinfolds, and whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric scans were obtained in 75 postmenopausal women ages 45 to 76 y. Total body fat, abdominal fat, and the ratio of abdominal fat to lean mass (F:L) were calculated from the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric scans. Equations predicting total and abdominal fat were developed for 50 subjects by using stepwise multiple regression analysis. These equations were then cross-validated in the remaining 25 subjects.
Results

Hip girth was a strong predictor of total fat (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001, standard error of the ESTIMATE = 4.9 kg) and abdominal fat (r = 0.92, P < 0.0001, standard error of ESTIMATE = 0.84 kg); with age added, the standard errors of the estimate were 3.8 and 0.8 kg, respectively. Hip girth correlated with BMI (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001). The “healthy” BMI cutoff value lower than 25 kg/m2 equated to a hip girth smaller than 100 cm and an abdominal F:L lower than 1.0. Waist girth (r = 0.83, P < 0.0001) and hip girth (r = 0.76, P < 0.0001) were good predictors of abdominal F:L.
Conclusions

Hip girth is a practical and useful predictor of abdominal and total adiposity in postmenopausal women. A hip girth of 100 cm or an abdominal F:L of 1.0 can be used as an equivalent cutoff value for the “healthy” BMI value of 25 kg/m2 in this group of women.

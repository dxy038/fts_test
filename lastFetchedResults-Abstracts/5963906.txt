The objective of this investigation was to study the feasibility of using the PFU microbial community as a biological indicator to assess the toxicity of leachates. Leachates from seven municipal solid waste landfills of various ages in Wuhan, China were used to develop short-term acute toxicity testing. Bioassays were conducted recording toxicity against PFU microbial communities as median inhibition concentrations (EC50 values) of species EC50 (S) and diversity index EC50 (DI) after 24 h and 48 h exposures. PFU microbial communities were sensitive to the leachate samples in the range of test concentrations, and the EC50s (S) oscillated between 0.82% and 4.67% after 24 h exposure, whilst the EC50s (DI) were between 0.80% and 4.71% The results showed that leachate toxicity decreased as landfill age increased. Multivariate analysis showed that toxicity was dependent on ammonia concentration (NH3-N) and chemical oxygen demand (COD).

Objective And Study Design: Ovarian needle diathermy was used in the treatment of clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Factors predictive of pregnancy in our study group included younger age, lower body weight, and surgery before 1998. Results And Conclusion: Insulin resistance and adhesions at surgery were negatively associated with pregnancy. Sixty-six percent of the study group cycled spontaneously after surgery and 50% became pregnant. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1171-3.)

The main objective of this work is to synthesize a robust static state feedback controller capable of controlling an active power filter connected in parallel to a three-phase voltage distribution system. A shunt active filter is used to improve power quality by eliminating harmonic distortion generated by non-linear loads. The open-loop system is described, in a complex frame, by a linear state space representation with complex-valued parameters. The synthesis of such controller is performed using H8 robust control based on a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach.

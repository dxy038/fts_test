Laser acupuncture is defined as the stimulation of traditional acupuncture points with low-intensity, non-thermal laser irradiation. It has been well applied in clinic since the 1970s; however, some traditional acupuncture manipulating methods still cannot be implemented in the design of this kind of instruments, such as lifting and thrusting manipulating method, and twisting and twirling manipulating method, which are the essential acupuncture method in traditional acupuncture. The objective of this work was to design and build a low cost portable laser acupuncture therapeutic instrument, which can implement the two essential acupuncture manipulating methods. Digital PID control theory is used to control the power of laser diode (LD), and to implement the lifting and thrusting manipulating method. Special optical system is designed to implement twisting and twirling manipulating method. M5P430 microcontroller system is used as the control centre of the instrument. The realization of lifting and thrusting manipulating method and twisting and twirling manipulating method are technological innovations in traditional acupuncture coming true in engineering

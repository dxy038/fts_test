Obesity is an increasing nutritional disorder in developed countries, and oxidative stress has been identified as a key factor in numerous pathologies such as diabetes, inflammation, and atherosclerosis, which are favored by obesity. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of oxidative stress in 3T3-L1 adipose cells on two parameters involved in metabolic complications associated with obesity, namely adiponectin secretion and lactate production. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipose cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of glucose oxidase. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a relevant lipid peroxidation by-product which may affect several metabolic processes in making covalent adducts with various molecules; adiponectin secretion; and lactate production were measured in response to glucose oxidase exposure. Results show an inhibition of adiponectin mRNA expression by glucose oxidase and a significant inverse correlation between 4-HNE formation and adiponectin secretion. Furthermore, 4-HNE alone inhibits adiponectin production by 3T3-L1. On the other hand, glucose oxidase and 4-HNE significantly stimulated lactate production by 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results demonstrate that adipose cells are highly sensitive to oxidative stress, with subsequent decreased adiponectin secretion and increased lactate production, two events involved in the development of insulin resistance.

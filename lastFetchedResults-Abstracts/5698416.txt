Robotic path planning with obstacle avoidance is considered. The main objective of the proposed approach is to reduce planning time considerably for "real-time" applications with obstacles of arbitrary configuration. The concept of a minimum required joint motion envelope is introduced to facilitate the representation of the joint kinematic solutions. Near minimum time trajectories are generated through a phase plane analysis. If the planned path is obstructed, then the obstacle geometry is approximated and a suitable projection is found in joint space. A modified path is finally determined to avoid the obstacles. Fuzzy logic is employed to incorporate uncertainty into the algorithmic procedure. Preliminary investigations have been carried out using a PUMA 560 and its associated workspace.

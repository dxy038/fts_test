A novel configuration of erbium-doped fibre amplifier, in which an optical circulator is used as the wavelength multiplexing device, is proposed and tested experimentally. The experimental results show that the proposed configuration is insensitive to reflections, and suitable for both bidirectional amplification and OTDR fault location.

A multi-pair two-way relaying scenario with multi-antenna mobile stations is considered. The bidirectional communications between the mobile stations are supported by an intermediate non-regenerative multi-antenna relay station. It is assumed that the mobile stations can subtract the back-propagated self-interference. Different relay transceive filter design approaches which utilize the fact that the mobile stations can perform self-interference cancellation are introduced. First, a self-interference aware MMSE transceive filter is derived. Second, a multi-antenna MMSE extension of the zero-forcing block-diagonalization based approaches is proposed and an upper bound for these approaches is given. The proposed transceive filters require less antennas at the relay station and achieve higher sum rates compared to conventional relay transceive filter approaches which do not exploit the capability of the mobile stations to perform self-interference cancellation.

Background and objective: Inflammatory acne vulgaris is treated with systemic antibiotics worldwide. Azithromycin has been advocated by some authorities. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of azithromycin with doxycycline.

Material and methods: A randomized, group matched, controlled trial was conducted in patients with acne vulgaris at the outpatient clinics of two University Hospitals, patients were randomized to receive either azithromycin 500 mg/day as a single oral dose three times per week or doxycycline 100 mg/day for 12 weeks. Topical 0.05% tretinoin lotion was prescribed for all patients. Clinical assessment was done at 4-week intervals. Facial inflammatory lesions and comedones were counted during each visit and side effects were recorded. The primary efficacy variable was change in acne lesions at 12 weeks. Secondary variables included the global response of inflammatory lesions, the patients' own assessment of their treatments, and comparison of safety and tolerability of the medications.

Results: Of 69 patients, 30 in each groups wear evaluated. Statistically significant improvement for the facial lesions was obtained in both treatment groups in each consecutive visit. The mean percentage reduction of inflammatory lesions was 84.3% for azithromycin group and 83.7% for doxycycline group; and for comedones was 69.4% and 75.1% respectively. No significant difference in primary or secondary variables was observed between two groups.

Conclusion: a combination of azithromycin with topical tretinoin had equal efficacy and a comparable safety/tolerability profile as doxycycline with topical tretinoin in the treatment of acne.

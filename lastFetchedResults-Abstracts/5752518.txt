The objective of this empirical study is to review current knowledge management (KM) practices in Thailand, and in particular to explore the knowledge sharing maturity and capability of Thai organizations and their readiness to embrace a knowledge creation culture. The survey focuses on a number of organizations drawn from an established taxonomy of organizations in Thailand using the stratified random sampling technique. The results indicate that (a) there is an established knowledge sharing culture supported by a corporate KM strategy, amongst high-tech organizations, as well as a preparedness for change to migrate to a knowledge creation culture; (b) a number of international organizations exhibit ad-hoc knowledge sharing practices as well as a growing awareness about the value of knowledge sharing and what can be termed as intangible assets; (c) a clear lack of any knowledge-oriented practice within ministry and department of public sectors. This empirical study provides a foundation to further the research and develop a framework for Thai organizations that promotes adoption of knowledge sharing practices as well as the migration from a knowledge sharing to a knowledge creation model.

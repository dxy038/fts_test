This paper presents an efficiency optimization approach for a high-voltage bidirectional flyback dc-dc converter. The main goal is to optimize the converter for driving a capacitive actuator, which must be charged and discharged from 0 V to 2.5 kV dc and vice versa, supplied from a 24 V dc supply. The energy efficiency is optimized using a proposed new automatic winding layout (AWL) technique and a comprehensive loss model. The AWL technique generates a large number of transformer winding layouts. The transformer parasitics, such as dc resistance, leakage inductance, and self-capacitance are calculated for each winding layout. An optimization technique is formulated to minimize the sum of energy losses during charge and discharge operations. The efficiency and energy loss distribution results from the optimization routine provide a deep insight into the high-voltage transformer design and its impact on the total converter efficiency. The proposed efficiency optimization approach is experimentally verified on a 25 W (average charging power) with a 100 W (peak power) flyback dc-dc prototype.

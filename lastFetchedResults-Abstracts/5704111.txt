A gauge control system for a hot strip finishing mill based on optimal regulator theory has been developed. The control objective is to minimize finisher exit strip thickness deviation resulting from temperature disturbance and other factors. A linearized mathematical model, valid for the fluctuations about the steady-state operating point, was derived. Then, the stability condition of the conventional gauge control system was derived. As a result, a novel system with greater response for interstand strip tension control was required. In order to improve the strip gauge accuracy, a multivariable compensator based on optimal regulator theory was introduced. Simulation studies and experimental results show that this gauge control system with the multivariable compensator is superior to the conventional gauge control system in terms of strip gauge control accuracy

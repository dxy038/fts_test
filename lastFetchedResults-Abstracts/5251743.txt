Power Quality information is not only an important part of AMI (Advanced Metering Infrastructure) in smart grid but also an important part of technical support system of the electricity market. In this paper, A new hierarchy model for power quality evaluation is presented to quantify and evaluate the power quality. based on subjective weighting method (Analytic Hierarchy Process, An expanded least square algorithm has been used to combine the multiple expert judgment matrixes to get the final weight vector in AHP) and objective weighting methods(Variation Coefficient Method), this paper presents a combinational evaluation method resulting in consistency between subjective and objective evaluation in the least squares sense. then bring out a improved fuzzy synthetic evaluation method based on reliability code. The proposed method can overcome the shortages of the traditional fuzzy synthetic evaluation, Case results clearly show that the proposed method is attractive and effective.

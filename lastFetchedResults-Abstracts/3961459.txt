In this paper the placement of base station within a cellular network is addressed as an optimization problem. A genetic algorithm is used as the optimization tool. This optimization issue is particularly important and critical in the multi-service environment commonly found in new generation cellular communications systems. Particularly, the goal of the algorithm presented in this work is to minimize the interference between base stations. It is shown that, by using the so proposed weighted objective function, it is possible to specify the base station locations, the cell coverage in terms of traffic and area, as well as the overlap levels between base stations. The weighted objective function is based on a preliminary analysis of the load factor for the base stations involved. The proposed algorithm is verified by means of a simulation scenario that considers a non-uniform distribution of users with different types of service. The presented results show an adequate tradeoff between the total traffic serviced and overlap level that allows transfers and minimizes the interference levels. Thus, our algorithm provides a useful tool for finding a near optimal solution for base station placement and efficiently determines number of base stations required in a cell planning procedure.

This paper introduces the fuzzy integration method of synthetic evaluation for supplier. The proposed method is an extension of the Lebesgue integration method, expands the usable area of the integration method in synthetic evaluation. We give an example to validate its practicability. In addition, we raise an idea of the approximate objective synthetic evaluation in terms of group synthetic evaluation of systems, so that we can reduce the influence of subjective biases in synthetic evaluation and make synthetic evaluation closer to the objective reality.

Bidirectional and contactless power delivery to electric vehicles (EVs) or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications can be realized through Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) technology but essentially requires a two-stage power conversion process. This paper proposes a novel matrix converter based IPT interface that requires only a single-stage power conversion process to facilitate bi-directional and contactless power transfer between EVs and the grid. A mathematical model, which predicts the behavior of the proposed system, is presented to show that both power flow and direction can be controlled through either relative phase angle or magnitude modulation of voltages produced by converters. Viability of the proposed concept is verified through simulations, and without an additional power conversion stage, the proposed matrix converter based IPT power interface is low in cost, and ideal for wireless charging and discharging of single or multiple EVs or V2G applications.

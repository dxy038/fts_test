A multivariable constrained predictive controller is briefly described. Its objective function is solved via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Apart from being a numerically robust solution technique, the approach also provides useful on-line information which can be used to enhance the stability of the closed loop system. The performance characteristics of the algorithm are illustrated by applications to nonlinear simulations of two high purity distillation columns.

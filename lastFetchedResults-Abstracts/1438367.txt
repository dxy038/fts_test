Ontological argument of Anselm is an a priori argument that proves the existence of God through the concept of existence which on the base of Plato idea it is identical with the real existence. Anselm has given two versions of this argument: one is that the concept of God is a concept that nothing greater than it can be thought, so this concept must be in the external world, otherwise it won’t be the greatest concept that can be conceived. The second one is that the concept of God is a necessary concept that its non-existence is inconceivable. So it must be in the external world, otherwise it non-existence is conceivable and it is a contradiction. Gaunilo has two objections on this argument: one is that we have no experience of the concept of God, so it is inconceivable. The second is that if this argument is correct, we must be able to prove every non-intelligible thing in the external world. The main objection of Aquinas is that Anselm believes that the external existence of God impress on becoming grater of the mental concept of God, while the concept of greatest conceivable thing  that has real existence is not greater than when it has not real existence. Objective realization of a concept in the external world has no role in becoming greater its conceptual content. The fundamental objection of Anselms’ argument is the rejection of his ideas about universal concepts, confusing between logical and philosophical necessity, confusing between concept and reality, and between primary predication and common predication, and identifying them with each other in their rules.

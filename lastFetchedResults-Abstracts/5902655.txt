In this paper, the problem of multi-objective supervised learning is discussed within the non-evolutionary optimization framework. The proposed MOBJ learning algorithm performs the search of Pareto-optimal models determining weights,width, prototype vectors, and the quantity of basis functions of the RBF network. In combination with the Akaike information criterion, the algorithm provides high quality solutions.

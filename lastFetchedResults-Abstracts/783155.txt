Objective Antidepressant utilization can
be used as an indicator of appropriate treatment for
major depression. The objective of this study was to
characterize antidepressant utilization in Canada, including
the relationships of antidepressant use with
sociodemographic variables, past-year and lifetime depression,
number of past depressive episodes, and
other possible indications for antidepressants. Method
We examined data from the Canadian Community
Health Survey (CCHS) Cycle 1.2. The CCHS was a
nationally representative mental health survey (N=
36,984) conducted in 2002 that included a diagnostic
instrument for past-year and lifetime major depressive
episodes and other psychiatric disorders and a
record of past-year antidepressant use. Results Overall,
5.8% of Canadians were taking antidepressants,
higher than the annual prevalence of major depressive
episode (4.8%) in the survey. Among persons with
a past-year major depressive episode, the frequency
of antidepressant use was 40.4%. After application of
adjustments for probable successful outcomes of treatment,
the estimated frequency of antidepressant use
for major depression was more than 50%. Frequency
of antidepressant treatment among those with a
history of depression but without a past-year episode
increased with the number of previous episodes.
Among those taking antidepressants over the past year,
only 33.1% had had a past-year episode of major depression.
Migraine, fibromyalgia, anxiety disorder, or
past depression was present in more than 60% of
those taking antidepressants without a past-year episode
of depression. Conclusions The CCHS results
suggest that antidepressant use has increased substantially
since the early 1990s, and also that these
medications are employed extensively for indications
other than depression

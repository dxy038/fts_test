OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients who have undergone heart surgery can be managed with use of rapid recovery guidelines without any subsequent increase in complication, mortality, or readmission rates.

: Retrospective study, two groups, comparative.

G: Private midwestern hospital with 690 licensed beds.

TS: Group I consisted of 312 adult patients who had undergone heart surgery in 1993 who were managed using traditional methods. Group II consisted of 303 patients who had undergone heart surgery in 1994 who were managed using rapid recovery guidelines.

E MEASURES: Complications (pneumonia and wound infections), mortality, and readmission rates.

S: Of the surgeries performed in 1994, 44% of the patients were discharged by postoperative day 4. No increase was noted in complication, mortality, and readmission rates.

SIONS: When compared to patients who were managed by traditional methods, these findings indicated that it is possible to manage adult patients who have undergone heart surgery using rapid recovery guidelines and maintain high-quality patient outcomes and level of satisfaction. In addition, cost savings and decreased resource use are added benefits.

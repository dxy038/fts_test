The objective of this research was to determine if a relationship could be found between dielectric strength and other properties of electrical insulating materials in the medium of liquid nitrogen on an empirical basis by using variables predicted by basic theory. A simple equation of the form E=A+Blog (rho<sub>v</sub>/xi<sub>r</sub> tandelta) to predict the dielectric strength of a solid insulating material in liquid nitrogen medium has been proposed. The equation requires the values of volume resistivity (rho<sub>v</sub>), relative permittivity (xi<sub>r</sub>) and loss tangent (tandelta) in the medium of liquid nitrogen, which may be obtained easily by low voltage non-destructive measurements. The values of electric strength calculated using this equation for Crepe paper, Kraft paper, varnished paper, pressboard, presspahn, mica, bakelite and asbestos are quite in agreement with the experimentally measured values. It is expected that the equations obtained will help the designers as a handy tool for quick estimation of breakdown strength of solid dielectrics dipped in liquid nitrogen.

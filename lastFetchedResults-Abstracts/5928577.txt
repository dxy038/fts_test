This paper focuses on how to associate users with serving nodes in order to achieve improved fairness and efficiency for the cellular networks enhanced with multiple relay nodes (RNs). We first formulate the generalized proportional fair (GPF) problem with the aim of providing fairness for all users served by the evolved node B (eNB) and its subordinate RNs. Routing is incorporated into the GPF problem as part of the resource allocation strategy. Assuming traditional proportional fair (PF) scheduling algorithm is executed independently at the eNB and each RN, we propose efficient PF-based routing algorithm aiming at optimizing the GPF objective, which also takes into account the impact of relay link resource allocation. Through system-level simulations, the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with both non-relaying and relaying systems with benchmark routing algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve better system throughput and fairness performance.

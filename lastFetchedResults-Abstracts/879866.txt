Introduction & Objective: Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in all  countries in the recent century and congestive heart failure (CHF) is the reason of death in most pa-tients . The most common causes of CHF are ischemic heart disease, myopathies , valvular disease and hypertension. Mortality reduction is the aim in CHF treatment. Combination of glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) has been used in  the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and chronic CHF for two decades and different results reported. The current study performed to evaluate the efficacy of GIK to accelerate resolving signs and symptoms in patients with acute CHF.
Materials & Methods: NT. pro BNP and H.s CRP are two components which increase in acute CHF and decrease after treatment. These parameters were evaluated in our clinical trial study.50 patients admitted with the diagnosis of acute CHF and EF < 40% were divided in two groups and the case group received GIK and control group placebo (half saline). Both groups received the classic treatment of CHF and the above mentioned  parameters  were measured in the  first hour and third and fifth day.
Results: Appropriate reduction in both parameters, which means good result in treatment, was observed in both groups but without statistical significant difference.
Conclusion: GIK has been used with good results in acute MI and chronic heart failure, but in order to prove better efficacy and decrease in mortality in acute CHF more research is needed.

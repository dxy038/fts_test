The National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Navy have begun development of the Interactive Marine Analysis and Forecast System (IMAFS). The system will provide forecasters, research scientists, and data managers with the means to access and integrate interdisciplinary data sets from several sources, including both archived and real-time data. The system will support NOAAÂ´s programs, including climate and global change, fisheries productivity, environmental quality, coastal hazards, and marine weather. The authors describe the objective, the rationale, the implementation, and the benefits of IMAFS

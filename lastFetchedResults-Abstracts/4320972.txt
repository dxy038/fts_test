As the DoD strives to improve the fighting effectiveness of the warfighters in the digitized battlefield, the test and training ranges require instrumentation systems that lower the cost and improve the fidelity of training exercises. A significant component of these systems consists of RF transceivers that provide the connectivity to collect and transport important test and training data. These future systems must fully integrate voice, data, video, and data transport services in a manner which makes efficient use of the limited RF spectrum. Toward this end the Technical Working Group (TWG) of the FIRST project has initiated an effort to define a modern DoD standard datalink capability to serve test and evaluation (T&amp;E) and training within the US Navy, Air Force and Army. The objective of this standardization is to improve the processes for range system integration and thereby lower the cost of range operation. This paper discusses the common solution in terms of the system need, the development approach and the performance characteristics. Expected performance enhancements include adaptable interfaces, greater mission flexibility, increased capacity and range, and lower transceiver and battery weight made available by new commercial technologies. Use of &#8220;dual mode&#8221; military/commercial technology and synergism offers the opportunity to achieve the first universal bit rate, global joint commercial military standard

Rapid growth of load utilizations in conventional electric networks leads to power demand, which is maintained using the non conventional resources. The objective of this paper is to schedule and dispatch the power using the smart grid technology (automation for distributed systems), for the usage of conventional energies as a secondary source and to develop a model using MATLAB / Simulink. The simulation consists of feedback closed loop control to perform the demand management during normal operating conditions, islanding the micro grid during the fault conditions, scheduling the load during emergency conditions and to resynchronize the system when the fault is cleared. A new structure of power system can be developed with improved reliability of delivering the power and increased efficiency to the consumers.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association of PKM2 gene with glycolytic potential and meat quality traits in three groups of fatteners – Landrace, Landrace × Yorkshire and (Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc. The present study was conducted on 243 fatteners, free of RYR1T gene, which 95 were of Landrace breed and the rest were the following crosses: 66 – Landrace × Yorkshire and 82 (Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc. It has been stated, that PKM2 gene (independently from the breed) was significantly associated with GP, lactate content, R1 indicator, pH and drip loss. The presence of TT genotype may lead to increase of GP and lactate content and results in low pH24 and pH144 and bigger drip loss measured 96 and 144 h after the slaughter. Except for the landrace fatteners, the association of the PKM2 gene with the glycogen content has not been statistically confirmed. Statistically confirmed interaction shows, that the association of PKM2 gene with glycolytic potential and glycogen content concerns mainly the Landrace pigs. Moreover, a high (almost 89%) conformability of the genotype of PKM2 gene with the RN− phenotype, can serve as an additional argument in favour of the thesis.

Objective: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by os-
teolytic bone disease which is associated with severe bone pain and pathological bone fractures. The receptor activator of nuclear factor ?B (RANK) and receptor activator of nuclear factor ?B ligand (RANKL) system has an important role in regulation of bone remodeling process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of the RANK/ RANKL molecules by the myeloma cells derived from patients and myeloma cell line U-266.
Materials and Methods: Myeloma cells derived from 7 myeloma patients and plasma cell leukemia were included into this study to evaluate the expression of the RANK/RANKL molecules by the reverse transcriptions-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method at the mRNA level. As well as human myeloma cell line U266, U937, RPMI-8866 and Hela were used as control groups.
Results: In this study we show the expression of RANK and its ligand at the mRNA level in U-266 (myeloma cell line) and plasma cells derived from patients by the RT-PCR tech- nique.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that expression of RANK and RANKL by plasma cells can contribute to induction of osteoclasts and plasma cell activation which elevates bone resorption in myeloma patients.

This paper explores how two scientific experiments in control engineering can be performed remotely over the Internet: (1) Ball and Plate system; and (2) Water Tank system. The main objective is offering students insights about identification of real processes and auto-tuning techniques. At Ghent University real-time remote access laboratories, which allow students to implement, compile and run controllers remotely from home, have been developed. Students can watch the experiment in real time and effectively use the laboratories full functionality through Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection across the Internet.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of diacylglycerol oil following long-term administration to rats. Diacylglycerol oil is an edible oil with comparable taste and physicochemical properties of several naturally occurring oils. Diacylglycerol oil can be used as a replacement for any generally used edible oil in the home and has been approved for use in cooking oil in Japan. Male and female Spragueâ€“Dawley rats were divided into four groups and fed low-fat (1.7%) basal diets containing an edible oil composed of rapeseed, corn, high linoleic safflower and high oleic safflower oils at 5.3% (control group 1); an edible oil composed of rapeseed and soybean oils at 5.3% (control group 2); diacylglycerol oil at 2.65% plus edible oil composed of rapeseed, corn, high linoleic safflower and high oleic safflower oils at 2.65% (low-dose group); and diacylglycerol oil at 5.3% (high-dose group) for 2 years. Interim sacrifices were conducted at weeks 30 and 77 and the study was terminated following 105 weeks of feeding. No compound-related effects were noted on clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, cumulative survival rates, hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights or on microscopic non-neoplastic changes. Compared to control group 2, but not control group 1, there was a significant increase in the number of high-dose group females with either benign or malignant epithelial mammary gland neoplasms. These changes were not considered biologically significant, because the tumor incidence was not similar in control group 1 and 2, and the neoplastic findings were not dose related. In summary, the two-year chronic rat study revealed no toxicologically significant or treatment-related effects of diacylglycerol oil consumption at levels of up to 5.3% in the diet.

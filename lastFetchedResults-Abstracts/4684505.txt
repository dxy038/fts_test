An operation planning system, integrating dynamic environmental forecasts and satellite Automatic Identification System sensor performance surfaces, to improve maritime traffic situation awareness is proposed and tested. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are used to optimize a network of monitoring assets with respect to a combined surveillance and piracy activity risk metric, the network area coverage and the mission cost, under given spatial and kinematic constraints. Pareto efficient solutions are provided, each representing a tradeoff among mission objectives. Tests in a counter piracy operational scenario with real-world hindcast data and sensor performance surfaces show the effectiveness of the methodology in improving surveillance efficiency.

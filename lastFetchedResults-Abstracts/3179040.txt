While ICT is necessary ingredient and catalyst for achieving global development objectives, advances in and proliferation of technology in itself cannot cause desired social and economic change to occur. Technology needs to be used and manifested intelligently and judiciously to provide for a platform and a mechanism where the initiatives and inspirations for social advances can thrive. One such model of adoption of ICT, particularly mobile technology, for developing and delivering a solution framework to address the problem of unemployment through skills development in rural India, is reported in this paper. AuthorÂ´s objective is to compile and encapsulate the experience and present this model as a replicable unit project deployable anywhere in the world by anybody.

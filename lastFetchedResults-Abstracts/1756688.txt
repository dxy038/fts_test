Objective
spectively examine the roles of diabetic macro-vascular complications and hip fracture in association with depression onset in Taiwan's elderly diabetic population.
s
esentative sample of elderly diabetic patients (n= 144,216) identified in 2000 were linked to National Health Insurance claims (2000–2007) to ascertain the diagnoses of depression in both outpatient and inpatient settings. The person-year approach with Poisson assumption was used to estimate the hazard rates. Using Cox proportional hazard regression model, we evaluated the relative risk of depression in relation to diabetic macro-vascular complications and hip fracture. The additive effects from the above medical conditions were also assessed.
s
year cumulative risk of depression was 5.08%, representing an incidence density of 8.40 per 1000 patient-years. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the elderly diabetes associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), hip fracture, and lower extremity amputation was 1.13 (1.04–1.23), 1.10 (0.91–1.34), and 1.25 (0.95–1.65), respectively. Additionally, we found that the more the complications or hip fracture, the higher the risk of depression onset in elderly diabetes.
sion
creased number of diabetic macro-vascular complications and hip fracture is significantly associated with a higher risk of depression onset in elderly diabetes. Future studies should be conducted to assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of intensive depression screening program in elderly diabetes suffering from macro-vascular complications and hip fracture.

This paper proposes a novel image fusion method based on weighted non-negative matrix factorization (WNMF) and region segmentation. Firstly, visible and infrared images are endowed different weight, and are taken as original data in WNMF analysis, by which the feature image can be extracted. Then the target regions in infrared image are segmented by region growing method and are extracted, then the pixels of the target regions replace the pixels of corresponding position in feature image. At last, the fusion image is obtained. The experimental results show that the method is better than previous ones, both in visual effect and objective evaluation criteria.

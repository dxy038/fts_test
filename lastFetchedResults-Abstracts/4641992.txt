In this paper is proposed an integrated power electronics solution able to connect a distributed generation (DG) system with a hybrid dc/ac microgrid. One of the main advantages of the proposed converter is high level of integration with reduction of one power switch, while keeping the same features of the conventional solution, such as (i) bidirectional power flow between dc and ac micro-grids, (ii) independent control in both dc and ac parts, and (iii) different operation conditions using a unique power conversion circuit. Despite proposing a new solution, this paper presents the converter models and an analysis of the converter in terms of its operation and PWM strategy, as well as the analysis of the power flow among different elements employed in the system.

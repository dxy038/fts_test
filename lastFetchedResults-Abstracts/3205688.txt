Today quality and safety are major drivers for the seafood industry. In this paper, computer vision technologies might prove highly relevant, providing objective measurements of visual attributes related to seafood quality and safety. We analyze and share our experience to develop the computer vision technologies for the sea-food industry, coupled with prediction models, for inspection of appearance (size, shape, color and texture), smell, category, bones and defects, presence of blemishes and textures on the surface of seafood products. Computer vision has been successfully adopted for the quality analysis of fish. Likewise other seafood quality and characteristics can also been examined.

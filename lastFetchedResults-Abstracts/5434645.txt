This paper presents the dynamic self-forming techniques specifically designed for mobile, wireless networks. A two-tier network hierarchy, consisting of automatically formed clusters interconnected through a self-configured backbone, is considered here. Dynamic clustering hides the intracluster topology from the units outside of a cluster, which maximizes frequency reuse, maximizes network throughput, and minimizes overall message delay. Dynamic routing exchanges routing information efficiently among clusters and provides robust routing throughout the network with minimum maintenance overhead. The proposed self-forming algorithm uses the gradient search technique to target a desirable objective function. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm converges to the intended objective function in a least-mean-squared error sense for all test cases

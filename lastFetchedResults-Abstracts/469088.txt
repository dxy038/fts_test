Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the rate of preeclampsia in pregnant diabetic women is increased in those women with early-pregnancy proteinuria of 190 to 499 mg/24 hours compared with women with proteinuria of <190 mg/24 hours.
Study design
Secondary analysis was performed with relevant data from 194 pregnant women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus whose condition required insulin and who were enrolled previously in a multicenter trial of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia. The women were assigned to 1 of 3 groups, based on the level of proteinuria at enrollment (13-26 weeks of gestation). Group 1 comprised women with <190 mg protein/24 hours (n = 94); group 2 comprised women with 190 to 499 mg protein/24 hours (n = 35); and group 3 comprised women with â‰¥500 mg protein/24 hours (n = 65). The rate of preeclampsia, according to strict predefined criteria, was then determined.
Results
The rate of preeclampsia was not increased statistically significantly in patients with early-pregnancy proteinuria of 190 to 499 mg/24 hours (7/35 women; 20%) when compared with women with proteinuria of <190 mg/24 hours (16/94 women; 17%).
Conclusion
We did not find an increased rate of preeclampsia in women with pregestational diabetes mellitus with early-pregnancy proteinuria of 190 to 499 mg/24 hours when compared with women with pregestational diabetes mellitus with proteinuria of <190 mg/24 hours.

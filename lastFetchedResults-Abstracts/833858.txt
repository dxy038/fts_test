Non-linear normal modes (NNMs) are used in order to derive reduced-order models for large amplitude, geometrically non-linear vibrations of thin shells. The main objective of the paper is to compare the accuracy of different truncations, using linear and non-linear modes, in order to predict the response of shells structures subjected to harmonic excitation. For an exhaustive comparison, three different shell problems have been selected: (i) a doubly curved shallow shell, simply supported on a rectangular base; (ii) a circular cylindrical panel with simply supported, in-plane free edges; and (iii) a simply supported, closed circular cylindrical shell. In each case, the models are derived by using refined shell theories for expressing the strainâ€“displacement relationship. As a consequence, in-plane inertia is retained in the formulation. Reduction to one or two NNMs shows perfect results for vibration amplitude lower or equal to the thickness of the shell in the three cases, and this limitation is extended to two times the thickness for two of the selected models.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the normal anatomic indices of thyroid glands in adult population of Isfahan.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, 250 postmortem thyroid glands were examined. During autopsy, the thyroid glands were excised carefully and the weight and volume of glands and their lobes were measured. Then all portions were examined visually with a magnifying glass looking for gross pathologic lesions. The specimen was also examined by palpation and homogenous glands were selected for the study.
The data were analyzed using SPSS software and independent T-Test and ANOVA, and divided into four distinct age groups (19-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50-64 years old) in both sex groups. Results: In this postmortem project, the thyroid glands of 152 men and 29 women were studied. Total mean thyroid weight and volume were 15.5± 5 gr and 15.8 ± 5 ml respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1).
Mean thyroid right lobe length, width and thickness were 4.4± 018 cm, 2.5± 0.5cm and 1.2±0.3cm respectively, the same parameters for left lobe were 4.3± 018 cm, 2.3± 0.5cm, and 1.2±0.3cm, respectively. Mean thyroid weight were higher in men comparing with women (p<0/05), except in 40-49 age group. Mean thyroid volume and weight tend to increase with age in men (p<0.05) but not in women (Table 2 and Fig. 2).
Conclusion: The results of our study seem to be similar with those countries in which iodine deficiency has been compensated. Because of presence of differences between the results of autopsy study and those of sonography study, these two different studies should be repeated synonymously in our country until we reach a standard basis for thyroid anatomic indexes which could be applied in next therapeutic iodine supplementary programs.

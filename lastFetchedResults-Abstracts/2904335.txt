A mobile receiver with angular diversity detectors in Visible Light Communication (VLC) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channels is considered. The objective is to improve the rank of the channel matrix and hence system throughput. Repetition Coding, Spatial Multiplexing and Spatial Modulation concepts are used to evaluate throughputs across multiple locations in a small room scenario. Since the receiver is mobile, the channel gains are weak in some locations of the room due to the lack of Line of Sight (LOS) paths between transmitters and receivers. Therefore we use Adaptive Modulation and Per Antenna Rate Coding (PARC) are used to improve spectral efficiency. The throughputs for fixed transmitters and receivers are compared with the oriented/inclined detectors for different cases. The results shows that for the mobile receivers, oriented/inclined detectors with Adaptive modulation and PARC provides capacity improvement when compared with the fixed and vertically oriented receivers.

Backgound and Objective: Trans-cinnamic acid (CA), a deamination product of phenylalanine in all plant tissues, is the main active ingredient used by the human from plant-containing foods. CA can inhibit the growth of various human tumor cell lines such as colorectal, leukemia, hematoma, as well as melanoma. This study aims to investigate the effect and action mechanism of CA on apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
Subjects and Methods: MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with different concentrations of CA (0, 10, 50, 100 and 200 mM) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay. Apoptosis markers including DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane measured using TUNEL and flow cytometery and Annexin V affinity.
Results: Viability assay showed that the IC50 of CA in MCF-7 cells was about 50 mM. CA at dose of 100 mM significantly induced the apoptosis after 24 h treatment as assessed by TUNEL+ cells and evidence of late apoptotic cells with Annexin V+ and propium iodide (PI+). [provide data here] [with P values]. 
Conclusion: The results showed that CA with apoptotic activity is an effective anti tumor against MCF-7 cells. CA can inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells by inducing cell apoptosis. The results can be helpful in understanding the anticancer mechanism of CA and gain further support for its safe use as an alternative and complementary drug in cancer therapy.

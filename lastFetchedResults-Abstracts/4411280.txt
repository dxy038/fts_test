Coastal zone is the triple interface of land, ocean and atmosphere. Any developmental activity along the coastal zone requires a clear understanding of the dynamic processes controlling its very existence. When most of the processes, which are common to all coastlines are quite well known, there are some localized, but important processes requiring further research for developmental planning. Mudbanks are such an inquisitive coastal phenomenon which occurs only at a few locations in the nearshore waters of the world ocean. Mudbanks, its occurrence, nature, properties and characteristics are interesting subjects from engineering point of view. The objective of the study is to provide an insight of mudbank impact on coastal morphology through a numerical modeling approach. For a better understanding of the influence of mudbanks on coastal morphology, Munambam to Chettuwa sector of Thrissur coast which is a part of Southwest coast of India is considered. In the present study the description of coastline evolution due to impact of mudbank is calculated using LITLINE module of LITPACK software package. It is observed that the occurrence, non-occurrence and migration of mudbanks influence the coastal dynamics significantly along mudbank influenced coastal stretch of Kerala.

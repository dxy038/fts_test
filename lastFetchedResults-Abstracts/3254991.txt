In this work, TEM dark-filed off-axis holography using objective lens was investigated to study strain distribution in Fin structure induced by stress liner. Compared with Lorentz lens mode holography, objective lens holography provides much more improved spatial resolution and contrast which are critical for reliable strain measurement of small structures such as FinFETs. Result was also compared with nano-beam diffraction strain measurement technique.

Numerous computer codes calculate beam dynamics of particles traversing an accelerating gap. In order to carry out these calculations the electric field of a gap must be determined. The electric field is obtained from derivatives of the scalar potential, which solves LaplaceÂ´s equation and satisfies the appropriate boundary conditions. An integral approach for the solution of Laplace equation is used in this work since the objective is to determine the potential and fields without solving on a traditional spatial grid. The motivation is to quickly obtain forces for particle transport, and eliminate the need to keep track of a large number of grid point fields. The problem then becomes one of how to evaluate the appropriate integral. In this work the integral solution has been converted to a finite sum of easily computed functions. Representing the integral solution in this manner provides a readily calculable formulation and avoids a number of difficulties inherent in dealing with an integral that can be weakly convergent in some regimes, and is, in general, highly oscillatory

In a flow-shop problem with transportation times and a single robot n jobs consisting of m operations have to be processed in the same order on m machines. Additionally, transportation times are considered if a job changes from one machine to another. We assume that unlimited buffer space exists between the machines and all transportations have to be done by a single robot. The objective is to determine a feasible schedule with minimal makespan.

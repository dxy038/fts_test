Introduction:
It has been suggested that ghrelin may play a role in growth hormone (GH) secretion to exercise.
Objective:
The present study was designed to examine the effects of a single bout of circuit resistance exercise on plasma glucose, ghrelin, GH, and c-peptide, and cortisol.
Design and methods:
Fourteen volunteer male physical education students completed a single bout circuit resistance training (10 exercises, three circuits, and at 60% of 1-RM). Blood samples were collected before, immediately after the exercise, and 24-h following the exercise protocol.
Results:
GH, glucose, and c-peptide showed a significant increase immediately after exercise and returned to pre exercise values over time. Plasma ghrelin showed a significant decrease immediately after the exercise and increased significantly 24-h following the exercise.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, a decrease in plasma ghrelin following a single bout of circuit resistance exercise indicates that an increase in GH is not related to plasma ghrelin levels. An acute exercise-induced hyperphagia during the long-recovery was considered.

Objective To study the associations between
psychiatric disorders and self-perceived problems
among adolescent boys. Method The study
population consisted of 2348 Finnish boys born during
1981 attending obligatory military call-up (79.7%
of the original sample). At military call-up in 1999, the
boys filled in the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR)
and Orientation of Life Questionnaire (SOC-13).
Information about psychiatric disorders was obtained
from the national military register during the years
1999â€“2004. Results Most of the psychopathology,
adaptive functioning and SOC scales were associated
with a variety of psychiatric disorders at follow-up.
However, when the effects of scales were controlled in
multivariate analysis, only YASR somatic problems
and SOC-13 showed an independent association with
a wide range of psychiatric disorders at follow-up.
Poor SOC-13 predicted anxiety, depression, antisocial
personality and substance use disorders. The YASR
somatic problems scale predicted anxiety, depression,
substance use, psychotic, and adjustment disorders.
Self-reported delinquency and poor competence at
school predicted substance use and antisocial personality
disorders. Conclusions Self-reports of poor
sense of coherence and somatic complaints have a
non-specific association with a wide range of psychiatric
disorders. Clinical and theoretical implications
of these findings are discussed.

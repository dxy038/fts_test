Certain parasites can cause severe diseases in shrimp. Among these, protozoa are very important. The objective of our study was to describe the signs, prevalence, and intensity of hemocytosis, a new disease in shrimp, Fenneropenaeus indicus. The experimental design included three groups, one treatment as infected shrimp or group B and 2 controls with non-infected but exposure to White Spot Syndrom Virus (WSSV) shrimp as group A and non-infected non- exposure to WSSV shrimp as group C in triplicate. The results revealed that Hemocytosis associated with a decrease in hyalinocytes and large-granulocytes (less than 8%) and a considerable increase in semi-granulocytes in group A and B in contrast to group C that Hyalinocyte increased. This infection made the shrimp susceptible to WSSV disease. It is believed that Hemocytosis causes a condition which can result in a rapid mortality among susceptible species, F.  indicus when exposure to WSSV is occurred.

We report on the subjective comparison of speech enhancement algorithms using the ITU-T P.835 standard. A Matlab toolbox, i.e. P835Tool, has been developed to comply with the ITU P.835 standard. The ITU-T P.835 methodology was designed to evaluate the speech quality along three dimensions: signal distortion, noise distortion and overall quality. The subjective comparison of five speech enhancement algorithms is presented. Results show the effectiveness of our developed toolbox for subjective comparison of speech enhancement algorithms. Furthermore, a new performance index based on subjective (ITU-T P.835) and objective (PESQ, ITU-T P.862) evaluations has been proposed

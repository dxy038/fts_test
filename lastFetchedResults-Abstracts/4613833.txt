Configuration optimization of physical prototype for 6-3-3 parallel mechanism was modeled mathematically, and then an idea of embedding finite element method in optimization algorithm was presented for solving optimizing model. In optimization design toolbox of ANSYS software, configuration optimization of the parts for the mechanism was realized by means of establishing parameterized model with parts, defining design variables, restraint and objective function. The investigation provided theoretical basis for lightweight part design with physical prototype of the parallel mechanism.

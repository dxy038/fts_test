An adaptive control method is proposed for applying &#8220;peak shaving&#8221; to the grid electrical demand of a single building, using a battery energy storage system to reduce the maximum demand. The objective is to save cost by reducing the monthly &#8220;demand charges&#8221; commonly levied on commercial power customers. Multiple demand forecasts are evaluated at every time step during each day, and combined to calculate a maximum limit to which the grid demand is controlled. Whereas prior methods apply peak shaving to every day alike, our method does not attempt to reduce peak demand below the maximum reached in the same month. The results show greater monthly demand cost reduction than a previously published method.

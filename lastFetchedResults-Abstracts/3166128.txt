We have built a computerized and automatized electromechanic System for objective isometric muscle strength measurement in any muscle group in humans. The system consists of a motorized chair; a cartesian robot, with three servocontrolled movements, handling in its end a gyratory head with a load cell that measures the strength forces; and hardware and software, based on a programmable logic controller (PLC) and a microcomputer, that control all mobile components and acquire and manage all data. The system is original and unique.

One of the tasks of the grounding system is to ensure safety for people during various fault conditions. Fatal lightning shock hazards depend on the surface potential that occurs when a lightning current is injected into the grounding system or induced in it. The main objective of the paper is to improve the grounding system of the typical HV substation. The quality of this modification is measured by the drop of the step voltage distribution and by the cost of it.

The gait acquisition is an important milestone of motor development. Structural modifications observed during this period add complexity to the process, and the child needs to use appropriate neuromuscular strategies to walk independently. The objective of this study was to document the longitudinal modifications in neuromuscular mechanisms and in functional anthropometric measures during independent gait acquisition in typically developing children. Twelve children were followed for 2 months after gait acquisition, with its initial period documented by the standardized test Alberta Infant Motor Scale. Quantification of the EMG signals of six muscles in the right lower limb allowed the calculation of the co-contraction indexes (CCI) considering pairs of antagonistic muscles, representing the hip, knee and ankle joints. The CCIs were summed up to yield a total index. Anthropometric measures were transformed into gravitational torque (mLg) values for stance and swing phases of gait. Statistical analyses included repeated measures ANOVA models with one factor (week post-acquisition) for the dependent variables mLg and normalized CCI (CCI/mLg). A significant increase was observed in the mLg during the period evaluated both in stance and swing phases (p = 0.0001). In addition, there was a decrease in the value of the normalized hip and total CCIs in both phases of gait (p < 0.05). The results revealed changes in the neuromuscular mechanisms used by typical children to deal with the demands involved in the process of gait acquisition.

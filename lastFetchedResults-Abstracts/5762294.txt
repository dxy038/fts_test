This is the second year of the minitrack. The minitrack focuses on process knowledge, i.e., the processes involved in developing models, artifacts and decisions in complex organizational problem solving. This includes research on the concepts, rationale and methods that underlie the effective capture and dissemination of process knowledge. Our objective in organizing the minitrack is to provide a continuing forum for emerging research on process knowledge, with particular emphasis on how diverse aspects of the problem can be integrated. The papers in this minitrack are briefly summerized.

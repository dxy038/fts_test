Objective
mine trends in the incidence of primary, malignant penile cancer in the United States.
s and materials
l of 1,817 men with primary, malignant penile cancer diagnosed between 1973 and 2002 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program Public-use data were used for analysis. Incidence rates were calculated by clinical and demographic variables of interest and decade of diagnosis (1973–1982, 1983–1992, and 1993–2002) using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Stat 6.1, and trends were examined using the annual percent change statistic. Additional incidence calculations were performed to examine further racial/ethnic differences.
s
erall incidence of primary, malignant penile cancer from 1973 to 2002 was 0.69 per 100,000. Incidence decreased significantly over time: 0.84 per 100,000 in 1973–1982 to 0.69 per 100,000 in 1982–1992 to 0.58 per 100,000 in 1993–2002. Incidence increased with increasing age at diagnosis. The majority of cases had squamous cell carcinomas, graded as I or II, and originated at the glans penis. Incidence of unknown grade primary, malignant penile cancer decreased significantly over the last 30 years, as did incidence of primary site penis, not otherwise specified primary, malignant penile cancer. The incidence of regional stage disease also increased over time. From 1993 to 2002, White Hispanics had the highest incidence rates (1.01 per 100,000) followed by Alaska Native/American Indians (0.77 per 100,000) and Blacks (0.62 per 100,000).
sions
erall incidence of primary, malignant penile cancer in the United States has decreased, and these rates varied by race/ethnicity. Incidence rates increased with increasing age at diagnosis, and the incidence of regional stage disease increased over time, while incidence of unknown grade primary, malignant penile cancer decreased over the last 30 years.

Objective: It is known that eustachian tubal compliance has influence on the tubal function. We applied the direct measurement method to ascertain whether or not aging and tubal diseases are related to the compliance of the cartilaginous part of the eustachian tube. Methods: We developed a method for directly measuring tubal compliance by inserting a balloon catheter, which is inflated with water, into the eustachian tube and comparing the change in balloon pressure with the balloon volume. This method is advantageous in that one can directly measure tubal compliance in the cartilaginous part of the eustachian tube. Using this method we examined tubal compliance in 16 normal young volunteer ears, 21 normal elderly volunteer ears, 11 elderly ears with patulous tube and 12 elderly ears with stenotic tube including otitis media with effusion. Results: In adults the tubal compliance increases in value with age. Tubal compliance of the elderly patulous tube was significantly higher than that of the normal elderly one, on the other hand the compliance of the elderly stenotic tube was significantly lower than that of the normal one. Conclusion: Tubal compliance was considered to be changed with aging and influence of the patulous and stenotic tubes.

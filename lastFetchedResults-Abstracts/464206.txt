OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to investigate hepatocyte growth factor levels in maternal serum and amniotic fluid during pregnancy. We also demonstrated production and secretion of hepatocyte growth factor by placenta and amnion at different stages of gestation.
STUDY DESIGN: Hepatocyte growth factor levels in maternal serum (n = 219), cord blood (n = 20), and amniotic fluid samples (n = 90) were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The secretion of hepatocyte growth factor by placenta and amnion was evaluated by measuring the amount released into the culture supernatant.
RESULTS: Most hepatocyte growth factor levels in maternal serum were below the detection limit before 10 weeks of pregnancy. Levels increased significantly thereafter and continued to increase until term. On the other hand, levels in amniotic fluid were significantly higher between 20 and 29 weeks of gestation than after 30 weeks. Hepatocyte growth factor secretion from the placental tissue per weight seemed unchanged throughout pregnancy. Its secretion from amnion was, however, approximately 300 to 400-fold higher in the second trimester compoared with that at term.
CONCLUSION: Both placenta and amnion produce and secrete hepatocyte growth factor, suggesting its role in fetal growth and the growth and differentiation of placenta.

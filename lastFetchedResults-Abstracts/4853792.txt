This article studies the classical MDS and dwMDS location algorithm. On this basis, the relaxation iteration method is introduced to replace SMACOF algorithm as optimization objective function. The results showed that the network connectivity increases with the increased communication radius, and it has a good effect that the relaxation method of positioning results in the node density from 2 to 4. The positioning performance of the relaxation method is even better than dwMDS algorithm. That is the algorithm for sparse node distribution network. And when the node density is too large the algorithmÂ´s maximum number of iterations should be limited.

Different type dynamic systems in functional work phase lose performance and itÂ´s necessary to establish normal operation level by using external influence. External influence can be defined as recovery method. In practice exists different possibilities how to resume performance of system and the main objective is to select the most efficient solution. In the article new approach for normal operation recovery selection is defined, including each recovery and recoveries complex assessment for optimal solution selection. For optimal solution choice benefit and disadvantage criteria are proposed. For practical implementation in case of medicine, arterial hypertension evaluation and pathogenesis therapy selection is described.

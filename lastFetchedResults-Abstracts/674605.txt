This paper reviews published official statistics in Kenya. It begins with a theoretical study of statistics in general and housing statistics in particular. From here it undertakes a comparative study of housing statistics in other countries especially the US for which statistical programmes are found to be comprehensive, objective oriented and rational. The review proceeds to the Kenyan scene, where in contrast, statistical programmes are found to be unfocussed, at times erroneous, irrelevant, incomplete, or stale, and generally deficient. This deficiency is observed to have serious implications for policy decision making, housing development, housing investment, capacity building, and policy analysis. In this regard proposals are made for development of statistical system for Kenya whose main feature should include a housing statistics strategy. Recommendations are also made for institutional development for housing statistics.

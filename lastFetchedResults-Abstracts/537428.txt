Objective
Proteus Syndrome is an extremely rare, sporadic and progressive disorder. We 
describe a four-month-old male baby with central nervous system manifestations 
in this article.
Clinical presentation
A four-month-old boy was admitted into our hospital with three tonic - clonic 
generalized seizure attacks which started from the day before admission. Each 
seizure attack lasted less than 10 minutes and the baby was well between 
attacks. No fever was detected. On physical examination, abnormal facial 
features, macrocrania, a wide nasal bridge, overgrowth of the right lower limb, 
macrodactyly in the third left toe, epidermal nevus on the left side of the 
abdomen and skin vascular abnormalities were detected. His developmental 
status was normal. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed left sided 
hemihypertrophy, ventricle enlargement and macrocrania on the same side.

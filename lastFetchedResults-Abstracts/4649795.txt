In this paper we introduce an efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (EMOEA) to design circuits. The algorithm is based on non-dominated set for keeping diversity of the population and therefore, avoids trapping in local optimal. Encoding of the chromosome is based on J. F. MillerÂ´s implementation, but we use efficient methods to evaluate and evolve circuits for speeding up the convergence of the algorithm. This algorithm evolves complex combinational circuits (such as 3-bit multiplier and 4 bit full adder) without too much long time evolution (commonly less than 5,000,000)

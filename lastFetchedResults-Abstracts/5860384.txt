Timetabling Problem (TP) in colleges and universities has become more important and complicated with the further reform in teaching and growing expansion of recruitment scale. In this paper, TP was analyzed, includes: timetabling objective, main influencing factors, constraint conditions and solving target. An optimized mathematical model of TP was established. The framework structure to solve TP was found. According to characteristics of TP, GA was introduced, a variety of improved schemes were designed, include: three-dimensional encoding scheme, initial population design scheme, fitness function design scheme, the optimal chromosome replacing strategy, adaptive crossover probability and adaptive mutation probability design scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed GA can satisfy multiple constraint conditions and resolve TP more effectively.

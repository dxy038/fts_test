Background and Objective: Physical and mental health has been found to be affected by occupational factors. Also coping strategies were important in the stress process. This study was aimed to evaluate the relationship of job satisfaction and coping mechanism with general health of personnel in a private petrochemistry factory in Mahshahr, Iran.
Subjects and Methods: After receiving consenting from the subjects of the study, a questionnaire package (coping skills check list, GHQ-28, job satisfaction) was completed. Out of 83 participants, 77 completed the questionnaires. Analysis of the data was carried out using SPSS version 15, and R Spearman, Pearson tests and regression analysis model were used. Results: The total score of GHQ-28 in 28.57% of the subjects' health was low and had low job satisfaction (PcO.OOl) and did not employ coping mechanism in their daily routine activities (P=0.018). While the personnel who had more job satisfaction, had higher mental health (PcO.OOl) and their coping mechanism was more logical (P<0.016).

Protecting infrastructures against natural hazards is a pressing national and international problem. Given the current budgetary climate, the ability to determine the best mitigation strategies with highly constrained budgets is essential. This papers describes a set of computationally efficient techniques to determine optimal infrastructure investment strategies, given multiple user objectives, that are consistent with an underlying earthquake hazard. These techniques include: optimization methods for developing representative events to characterize the hazard and the post-event condition of infrastructure components, a simulation model to characterize post-event infrastructure performance relative to multiple user objectives, and a multi-objective optimization algorithm for determining protection strategies. They are demonstrated using a case study of the highway network in Memphis, Tennessee.

In this paper, an assembly sequence planning (ASP) approach is proposed with a multi-objective hybrid evolutionary search algorithm, which combines a discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm and a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. Based on a special assembly sequence coding method and corresponding update strategy, the effects caused by the changes of parameters in the hybrid DPSO and SA (DPSO-SA) algorithm are investigated, and the performance of the proposed DPSO-SA algorithm is compared with the existing DPSO algorithm. Case study shows that the hybrid DPSO-SA approach can be more efficient to generate optimal assembly sequences, and can significantly increase the search capability and perform better than the DPSO algorithm.

Background & Objective: To ensure students' research experience acquisition is one of the most important goals of conducting a thesis. In such a process, evaluating students' satisfaction is one of the most significant challenges. Hence, this research was aimed to study students' satisfaction of thesis conducting process and its related factors in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Methods: In this survey, 100 medical, dentistry and pharmacy students, who were becoming graduates and were about to defend their thesis, participated. Samples were selected using stratified sampling. Data was collected using a questionnaire which its reliability and validity were already confirmed.

Results: According to the results, mean (±SD) of supervision on thesis, scientific skill development, research bases, skill development of research and thesis assessing process were 3.31 (±0.95), 3.42(±0.71), 2.26(±0.80), 3.37(±0.70), and 3.47(±0.92), respectively. The mean score of research bases was significantly less than others' (P= 0.0001). The mean score of female students' satisfaction of research bases and developing research skill was significantly higher than male students' (P= 0.026 and 0.04 respectively).

Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that the lowest students' satisfaction belonged to "scientific seminar planning", "financial support of scientific activities" and "scientific and research atmosphere"; all belonged to research bases. As research infra structure and atmosphere are important factors in research activities, they should be among priorities of higher education planning.

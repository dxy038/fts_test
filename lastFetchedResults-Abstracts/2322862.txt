Passive suspension system is used in most vehicles due to its low energy consumption and low cost in most vehicles. Therefore, today enhancing the suspension system has become a challenge for engineers. The aim of this study is to present a new method for Multi-Objective design of vehicle suspension based on the use of asymmetrical dampers (Nonlinear). Hence, It is shown that using these types of dampers with a choice of two types of coefficient, one of which is in compression and the other in expansion will lead to a more optimal design compared to those in the literature. For this purpose, vehicle was modeled using full model with eleven degrees of freedom under random road excitation, then, since the tasks of suspension system are reduction of vertical acceleration exerted on passengers, reduction of pitch acceleration of sprung mass, improving road holding and reduction of the change of four wheel work space. Therefore, the problem is defined as a Multi-Objective problem with conflicting objectives which were formulated and solved by NSGA-II algorithm. The obtained results indicated that using asymmetrical dampers leads to more efficient design compared to those methods with symmetrical dampers.

The present study was initially devised to accomplish two objectives. The primary objective was to determine the feasibility of using commercially available SAW (surface acoustic wave) oscillators to meet the stringent acceleration sensitivity requirement of 10/sup -11//g needed for state-of-the-art military applications. The second objective was to establish a performance baseline of acceleration sensitivity since there was very little preexisting data for use by system developers. However, when the acceleration sensitivity data collected for the various oscillators were correlated with the physical attributes of the oscillator circuits and SAW resonators, more general design guidelines could be inferred from the data for the production of vibration insensitive oscillators. The complete data set resulting from the shake table tests is far more comprehensive than the information provided by a manufacturer.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

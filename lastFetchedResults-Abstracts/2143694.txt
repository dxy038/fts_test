Background and Objective: Epilepsy is one of the most common diseases causing many problems in Iran.  Hence, this study was an attempt to assess the prevalence of epilepsy using meta-analysis and systematic review methods in Iran.
Materials and Methods: Nine Iranian papers published in time period of 2002 to 2010 were selected using valid keywords and searching in the SID, Google scholar, PubMed and Elsevier databases. The heterogeneity of samples was dealt with using the I2 index.
Results: In this study, the data of 7723 patients was used and nine papers were selected for meta-analysis among the published papers. The total prevalence of epilepsy was calculated to be 5% (95% confident interval (CI): (2%-8%) in Iran. The prevalence of epilepsy in central, northern and eastern areas of Iran was found to be 5% (95% CI, 2%-8%), 1% (95% CI, -1%-3%) and 4% (95% CI, 3%-11%), respectively. Somatic diseases and inheritance were the common risk factors of epilepsy with the percentage of 39% (95% CI, 15%-62%) and 26% (95% CI, 9%-42%), respectively.
Conclusion: The findings in our study indicated a 5% more prevalence of epilepsy in Iran until 2010 in comparison to similar countries; though this trend decreased with increasing age. Geographic area evidence showed a remarkable prevalence in the Center, East and North of the country and physical illnesses comprised the major risk factors.

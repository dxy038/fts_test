The objective of the study was to evaluate the antidiabetic activity of Ginkgo biloba and to probe into its mechanism of action. Methods. Albino wistar rats with streptozotocin induced diabetes were divided into 4 groups of 10 each. Gum acacia, troglitazone 36 mg/kg, Ginkgo biloba 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, were administered to group I (control), group II (standard), group III and group IV respectively. After 10 and 15 days of drug administration fasting blood sugar (FBS), blood glutathione (GSH) and serum ceruloplasmin were estimated. Results. Ginkgo biloba in a high dose of 100 mg/kg produced a significant reduction in FBS of 31% and increase in blood GSH (57.6%) that is however much less than the fall in FBS produced by troglitazone (47%). However treatment with troglitazone and Ginkgo biloba at both doses did not alter the serum ceruloplasmin levels significantly. Conclusion. The antidiabetic activity of Ginkgo biloba may be attributed to its antioxidant activity without having a role in metal ion mediated lipid peroxidation.

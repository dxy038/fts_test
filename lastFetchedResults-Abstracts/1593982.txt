In this paper, a transportation model with multiple criteria and multiple constraint levels (MC2) is formulated by using the framework of MC2 linear programming. An algorithm is developed to solve such MC2 transportation problems. In this algorithm, the traditional northwest corner rule is adopted to find an initial basic feasible solution for a given MC2 transportation problem. Then the MC2-simplex method is applied to locate the set of all potential solutions over possible changes of the objective coefficient parameter and the supply and demand parameter for the MC2 transportation problem. A numerical example is illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm in solving the MC2 transportation problems.

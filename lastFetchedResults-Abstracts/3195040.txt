This paper proposes a novel approach of cross-layer resource allocation based on Quality of Experience (QoE) for wireless video transmission. We model and formulate the cross-layer resource allocation problem in accordance with the relationship between transmission bit rate and QoE. Our objective is to ameliorate the system QoE level while guaranteeing the fairness for users. The video quality fluctuation that affects the system QoE is considered as well. The proposed algorithm designs an adaptive resource allocation approach depending on limited network resources. We use a downlink LTE system as a simulation example of a high speed downlink access system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method considerably and agreeably improves system QoE more than other algorithms.

In the frame of KOMPSAT-5 program, the Korean Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) mission to collect SAR images relevant to Korean Peninsula, Thales Alenia Space Italia (TASI) developed the SAR Payload System. The KOMPSAT-5 Payload is composed by a SAR Sensor Subsystem (SSS) including all the radar functions and a Data Link Subsystem (DLS) to store data onboard and transmit them on ground. Before of the Payload integration process, all the components have been subjected to appropriate acceptance test campaigns and, afterwards, the SSS and DLS have been verified separately to collect all the measurement data needed to compute the key performance parameters. The complete functionality of Payload has been verified after the installation of SSS and DLS on the structure of the Payload Module (PLM). Finally, following the delivery of the SAR Payload to KARI facilities, the PLM has been assembled with the Service Module, and the overall verification campaign of the Satellite has been completed in South Korea. Aim of this paper is to presents the SAR Subsystem on ground verification approach outlining the different phases of the verification process, the main objective and the results.

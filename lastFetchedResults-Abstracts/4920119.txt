The objective of the project reported is to develop and commercialize unattended lidar systems that will continuously monitor the vertical profiles of ozone and particulate matter and provide near-real-time results to investigators. The systems must be affordable in multiple units, and they must have a low operating cost, so that networks of the unattended ozone lidars can be deployed in polluted cities. Such lidars will be useful for both long-term monitoring and for intensive campaigns. The work reported is a joint project of the Electro-Optics Laboratory of the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRT) and the Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL) of NOAA

Objective
Breast duct endoscopy is increasingly used for evaluation of intraductal disease. We have investigated a new rigid instrument for ductoscopy and intraductal biopsy of pathologic lesions.
Methods

From 2002 to 2006, ductoscopy was performed in 111 women with breast cancer or pathologic nipple discharge. A rigid gradient index microendoscope (diameter .7 mm) was used for all examinations in combination with a specially developed needle for intraductal vacuum-assisted biopsy. Ductoscopy and intraductal biopsy were correlated with ductal cytology and histopathology of the resection specimen.
Results

Ductoscopy identified intraductal lesions in 41% of the patients with breast cancer presenting as red patches, microcalcifications, or ductal obstruction. Compared with patients with a normal ductoscopy, patients with pathologic ductoscopy had a significantly higher risk of extensive intraductal carcinoma (71% versus 16%, P < .05). Ductal cytology showed only a few cases with severe cytologic atypia or malignant cells in cases with ductoscopic abnormalities. Intraductal vacuum-assisted biopsy yielded diagnostic material in 89% of 36 patients with nipple discharge and papillomatous lesions. Histology of the resection specimen confirmed the diagnosis in all cases (26 papillomas, 2 in situ carcinomas, and 2 invasive ductal carcinomas). In contrast, ductal cytology showed only moderate correlation with histopathology.
Conclusions

Ductoscopy is a useful supplement for the standard radiological workup of breast cancer especially in patients with extensive intraductal carcinoma. Ductoscopic vacuum-assisted biopsy is a new and effective technique for intraductal biopsy under visual control.

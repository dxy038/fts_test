In an attempt to simulate buckling of
nonuniform coatings, we consider the problem of
an embedded crack in a functionally graded coating
bonded to a homogeneous substrate subjected
to a compressive loading. The coating is graded
in the thickness direction and the material gradient
is orthogonal to the crack direction which
is parallel with the free surface. The loading consists
of a uniform compressive strain applied away
from the crack region. The graded coating is modeled
as a nonhomogeneous medium with an isotropic
stress-strain law. Using a nonlinear continuum
theory and a suitable perturbation technique, the
plane strain problem is reduced to an eigenvalue
problem describing the onset of buckling. Using
integral transforms, the resulting plane elasticity
equations are converted analytically into singular
integral equations which are solved numerically to
give the critical buckling strain and the corresponding
crack opening displacement shapes. The main
objective of the paper is to study the influence ofmaterial nonhomogeneity on the buckling resistance
of the graded layer for various crack positions
and coating thicknesses

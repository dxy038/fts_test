ABSTRACT: While different elements including social, economic and cultural elements play a vital
role in the emergence of behavioral patterns in humans, one cannot ignore the influence of the physical
and spatial characteristics of built environment as a back ground for occurrence of anomic behavior on
committing crimes. Therefore, a series of approaches and theories such as “crime prevention through
environmental design (CPTED)” were developed. The first objective of this research is to determine
the most insecure public spaces using parameters of the first generation of CPTED approach. The other
objective is to evaluate the role of each one of these parameters in providing the aspect of security. In order
to achieve these objectives, Tehran’s Dehkade Farahzad was chosen due to existence of the evidences
indicating urban insecurities. This study is an applied type of research and the methodology used for
achieving the goals was to benefit from ANP model which specifies the level of insecurity of urban spaces
by evaluating the parameters of the first generation of CPTED approach. The methodology was performed
using documentary and field research methods and statistical population used included 5 urban experts.
The analytical results of model indicate that Tabbarok Street is the most significant urban insecure space
in the mentioned site. In addition, the results demonstrate that territory and control parameters at a value
level, activity support, image/management and maintenance, access control and intensifying the target of
crime are respectively significant in determining the site’s security level.

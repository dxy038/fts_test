Objective This study tested the hypothesis that despite
differences in setting, specifically in Padua or Montreal,
black psychiatric inpatients will have higher rates of
assigned diagnosis of psychosis than their non-black
counterparts.
Methods Data on psychotic patients admitted to the psychiatry
ward were extracted from records of general hospitals
in Padua and Montreal. Logistic regression analyses
were conducted separately for each site to determine the
relation between being black and receiving a diagnosis of
psychosis, while controlling for sex and age.
Results Most black patients at both sites received a
diagnosis of psychosis (76% in Padua and 81% in Montreal).
Being black was independently and positively
associated with being diagnosed with psychosis compared
to patients from other groups.
Conclusions Black patients admitted to psychiatry, whether
in Padua or Montreal, were more likely to be assigned
a diagnosis of psychosis than were other patients

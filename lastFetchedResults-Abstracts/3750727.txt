Clustering is an efficient method to solve scalability problems and energy consumption challenges. For this reason it is widely exploited in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications. It is very critical to determine the number of required clusterheads and thus the overall cost of WSNs while satisfying the desired level of coverage. Our objective is to study cluster size, i.e., how much a clusterhead together with sensors can cover a region when all the devices in a WSN are deployed randomly. Therefore, it is possible to compute the required number of nodes of each type for given network parameters.

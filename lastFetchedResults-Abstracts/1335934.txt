Objective: To characterize the impact of age, gender, location and individual animal variation on the composition of articular cartilage from the metacarpophalangeal joint of horses. Design: Cartilage specimens were obtained from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 28 male, female and castrated male horses ranging in age from one day to 27 years of age. Cartilage samples from the distal metacarpus, proximal first phalanx and proximal sesamoids were analyzed separately. Chondrocyte number, DNA content, proteoglycan concentration and total collagen content were determined for each animal and joint location. Results: Age and joint location had a significant effect on chondrocyte number and DNA content with higher cell counts and DNA content detected in cartilage from the youngest age groups and in cartilage from the metacarpus and proximal sesamoids. The influence of age on chondrocyte numbers was not significant in horses over two years of age. Both age and joint location also influenced total proteoglycan and collagen content. Lower proteoglycan and collagen concentrations were detected in younger horses, and cartilage from the metacarpus had lower proteoglycan and collagen concentrations than that from other joint locations. Gender did not appear to influence chondrocyte number or matrix content of equine articular cartilage. However, there was significant residual variation in cellularity, proteoglycan levels and collagen content between individual animals that could not be explained by the signalment factors considered in this study. Conclusions: Future studies examining equine articular cartilage should avoid direct morphologic comparisons between animals of different ages, and any comparisons made between individuals should be interpreted cautiously. In addition, in vitro tissue culture models should avoid the use of cartilage pooled from different animals or from different locations within the same joint.

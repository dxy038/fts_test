The optimization of building cooling heating and power (BCHP) system is helpful to improve its comprehensive performance including energetic, economic and environmental aspects. However, the optimal results are closely dependent on the initial setting parameters. This paper deduces the energy consumption of BCHP system following the electrical load and presents the optimization problem of BCHP system that includes the decision variables, the objective function, the constraint conditions and the solution method. The influences of the initial parameters, which include the technical, economic and environmental parameters, the building loads and the optimization setting parameters, on the optimal decision variables and the performances of BCHP system are analyzed and compared. The contour curves of the performances of BCHP system in comparison to the conventional separation production (SP) system, and the sensitivity of the optimal decision variables to the initial parameters are obtained.

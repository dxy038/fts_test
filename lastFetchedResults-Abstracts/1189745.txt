The aim of this paper is to investigate the stability of multiobjective nonlinear programming problems with fuzzy weights in the objective functions and fuzzy matrix parameters in the constraints and represent, in addition, the related dual problems for which the set of feasible parameters and the solvability set are studied. These fuzzy weights and fuzzy matrix parameters are characterized by fuzzy numbers. The existing results concerning the basic notions parametric space in convex programs are redefined and analyzed qualitatively under the concept of Î±-Pareto optimality. An illustrative example is given to clarify the obtained results.

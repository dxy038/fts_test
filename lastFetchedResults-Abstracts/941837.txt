Background: Mercury is a global pollutant that affects neurodevelopment of children.
Objective: The objectives were to measure and evaluate mercury concentration of children
and mothers, and its association with exposure.
Methods: A cross-sectional assessment was done using questionnaires and hair mercury
were analysed by Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrometry in the National Institute for
Minamata Disease in Japan.
Results: A total of 112 children and 111 mothers were included; mean age was 34months and
32years, respectively. 17.9 % of children and 34.2 % of mothers had concentrations greater
than 1 parts per million (ppm) as reference level. Body weight at birth, feeding methods,
maternal age, and maternal education level were significantly different in each group
(pb.05). Mean maternal hair mercury level (0.91ppm) was higher than children (0.74ppm),
and has a positive correlation between them (pb.05). 68.1% of children, 75% of pregnant
period, 63.4% of lactating period, and 78.6% of last six months have been consuming fish.
With multiple regression analysis, hair mercury levels in children aged less than 6months
had a linear relationship with body weight at birth, gestational weeks, feeding methods
(breast- or bottle- feeding) and maternal educational level. While children aged over 6
months significantly differed with gender, frequency of fish servings per week, and
frequency of maternal fish consumption in lactation period. And hair mercury levels had
inverse linear relationship with maternal monthly income in this age group. Maternal
mercury levels had linear relationship with maternal age.
Conclusion: Mercury levels in children may be affected by their mothers due to similar
dietary patterns. Further long-term large-scale and follow-up studies are needed.

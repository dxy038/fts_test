We are updating the Tevatron´s cryogenic control systems (FRIGs) to provide a more powerful, flexible and robust architecture based on Intel´s 80386 microprocessor. The objective of an individual FRIG is to: perform data acquisition and control for over 1000 dedicated data points; produce alarms in the case of abnormal functioning of equipment; run PID closed loops for the cryogenic hardware; program and run finite state machines, thus automating operations such as cooldown, warm-up and so on; and fulfil fast data logging for any particular set of parameters of interest

The main objective of this work is the proposal of a new connection admission control (CAC) algorithm guaranteeing both a high connection multiplexing level and, in particular, a good quality of service (QoS) for real-time multimedia traffic sources mapped over the service classes of the DVB-RCS standard. In this paper, we suppose a DVB-RCS system architecture using a multi-spot beam geostationary satellite with regenerative payload. We also suppose IP traffic to be carried, in return and forward directions, via DVB/MPEG-2 traffic streams instead of to the obsolete ATM encapsulation. Simulation results show that, even if the real time multimedia connections are more sensitive to the delay jitter, the agreed QoS is always guaranteed, even when the system load increases; moreover, using the proposed algorithm, a high system throughput is obtainable.

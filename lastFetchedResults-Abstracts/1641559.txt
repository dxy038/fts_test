The research objectives were to investigate the influence of gas holes on strength properties of oil well cement, and to propose improvement of aluminium powder application measure. The results showed that with increasing induced porosity the strength increases at first, subsequently decreases and then increases again. Making gas holesâ€™ diameter more uniform was beneficial for strength. According to our model, avoiding each gas hole distribution area overlapping with others could form the gas hole structure with uniform diameter. This objective can be achieved by using different particle size of aluminium powder for different swelling volume of oil well cement stone.

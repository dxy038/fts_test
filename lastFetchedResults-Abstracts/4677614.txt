We discuss methods of compensating aberrations in multiple-layer storage with common objective lens designs and introduce a new class of objective lenses that could be useful for this technology. An optical system is designed based on a Galilean telescope and a Burch-type objective. The front negative lens is moved to compensate for thickness variations. Results are shown for the residual Strehl ratio for a Burch-type lens made from Corning C05-50 glass.

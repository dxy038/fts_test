This paper evaluates and compares the performance of a DC-DC converter with dual active three phase bridges using a three-phase high frequency transformer with star-star connection (DAB3YY) and delta-delta connection (DAB3&#916;&#916;). The objective of this comparison is to evaluate the stress of the power semiconductors based on the RMS values and the sum of the current as well as the transformer apparent power. From the analysis we conclude that the leakage inductance of the transformer DAB3&#916;&#916; should be three times greater than that of DAB3YY to transfer the same power. Furthermore, it is concluded that the stress on semiconductors and apparent power are the same on both connections, demonstrating the feasibility of using the DAB3&#916;&#916;.

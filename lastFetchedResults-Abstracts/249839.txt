In this work we propose a method which combines the element-free Galerkin (EFG) with an extended
partition of unity  nite element method (PUFEM), that is able to enforce, in some limiting sense, the
essential boundary conditions as done in the  nite element method (FEM). The proposed extended
PUFEM is based on the moving least square approximation (MLSA) and is capable of overcoming
singularity problems, in the global shape functions, resulting from the consideration of linear and higher
order base functions. With the objective of avoiding the presence of singular points, the extended
PUFEM considers an extension of the support of the classical PUFE weight function. Since the extended
PUFEM is closely related to the EFG method there is no need for special approximation functions with
complex implementation procedures, and no use of the penalty and=or multiplier method is required in
order to approximately impose the essential boundary condition. Thus, a relatively simple procedure is
needed to combine both methods. In order to attest the performance of the method we consider the
solution of an analytical elastic problem and also some coupled elastoplastic-damge problems

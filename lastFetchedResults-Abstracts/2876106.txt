This paper presents minimization of total power loss, improvement in bus voltage profile and branch currents using network reconfiguration, capacitor banks and optimum number of distributed generation (DG) units placement in radial distribution system (RDS). Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine highly non-linear problem of calculating total power loss of RDS which are subjected to operational equality and inequality constraints. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated by comparing the results with Harmony search algorithm (HSA) and GA from the literature. The solution to the objective of minimization of loss is obtained using MATLAB optimization toolbox and MATLAB programming environment on standard IEEE 33-bus test system with different case studies.

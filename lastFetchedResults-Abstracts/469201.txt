Objective
We investigated the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor and homeobox a10 in endometrium that was derived from patients with concurrent ectopic pregnancies compared with nonpregnant luteal phase endometrium from the same patients.
Study design
Endometrial biopsy specimens that were obtained from women (n = 3) who underwent surgery for ectopic pregnancy were matched with biopsy specimens in a nonpregnant luteal phase from the same patients. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for leukemia inhibitory factor and homeobox a10 was performed. Polymerase chain reaction products were assayed with laser detection of nanogram quantities of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid. Ratios of each implantation marker to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard were compared for quantification.
Results
Leukemia inhibitory factor expression is increased in endometrium from ectopic pregnancy; homeobox a10 is increased in luteal phase endometrium.
Conclusion
Leukemia inhibitory factor appears to be regulated by human chorionic gonadotropin or other factors of pregnancy; homeobox a10 is regulated by ovarian steroids of the luteal phase.

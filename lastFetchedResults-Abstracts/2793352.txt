Sovereign independent studies have reflected that mobile based services will have an important influence on business and society in the future. Therefore, wireless network experts, service providers, vendors, application developers and working engineers must carefully take the inputs and considerations of various clients into minds to provide better services and attract them to mobile based services. Consequently, maximizing the mobile based services user requirements and their implication becomes a crucial and essential process for the standardization and improvement of connected systems. By following same track, the objective of this paper is to propose an optimization model of location based services (LBS) network by using some critical identified parameters. The model of optimization focuses on users satisfaction to provide experts a more effective and efficient approach for enhancing mobile based service level and fetching service requirements.

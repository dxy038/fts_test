In this paper, we propose the design and analysis of a reservation-based protocol for synchronous WDM multi-channel optical networks. The network architecture is based on a passive star topology and a new architecture for the network interface per station. The main objective of the scheduling algorithm and network interface is to maximize the performance measures by studying the problem of receiver collision phenomena at destination that multichannel nature of WDM networks introduces. We develop an analytical model based on a finite number of tunable receivers and a finite number of stations, following the “tell and go” policy for the access to communication system. Numerical results are showing the performance behavior for various number of channels, stations, and tunable receivers. Also, simulation results are presented for comparison with the results obtained by the performance analysis.

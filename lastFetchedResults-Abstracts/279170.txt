Pure invasive lobular carcinoma is more difficult to diagnose clinically and mammographically than other invasive breast carcinomas. Our objective was to document the ultrasound appearances of pure invasive lobular carcinoma, to determine whether there were any specific features when compared to similar cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, and to compare the sensitivity of ultrasound with mammography in the diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma. We report on 23 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma who were matched for age and presentation with cases of invasive ductal carcinoma. High frequency ultrasound detected lesions in 22 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma and all had features highly suggestive of malignancy. Twenty-one of 23 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma also had malignant features. At mammography, six cases of invasive lobular carcinoma were not detected. Ultrasound is as specific for identifying invasive lobular carcinoma as it is for invasive ductal carcinoma. Ultrasound was more sensitive than mammography for diagnosing invasive lobular carcinoma.

The article in order to solve Panel Furniture business of mass customizationÂ´s batch scheduling, by analyzing production processes, the article proposes parallel machine serial-batching scheduling, in reaction to the problems of flexible production lines batch scheduling. The design is an adaptive Cellular Automat variation Particle Swarm optimization algorithm, which, when used for the single objective test, is better than the current records (For comparison, 30% of the probability finds the optimal solution, using parallel machine scheduling with standard 30 set of data).

A new method of Second order PSO for a more effective capacitor sizing in radial distribution feeders to reduce the real power loss and to improve the voltage profile is proposed. The location of the nodes where the capacitors should be placed is decided by a set of rules given by the fuzzy expert system and the sizing of the capacitors is modeled by the objective function to obtain maximum savings using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The newer upgrade to PSO enables the problem to use the knowledge of past solutions into present sizing and hence a second level of optimization procedure to provide better results. A case study with an existing 15-bus radial distribution feeder is presented to illustrate the applicability of the newer algorithm.

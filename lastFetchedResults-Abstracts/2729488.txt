Constrained independent component analysis (C-ICA) algorithms provide an effective way to introduce prior information into the complex- and real-valued ICA framework. The work in this area has focus on adding constraints to the objective function of algorithms that assume a unitary demixing matrix. The unitary condition is required in order to decouple-isolate-the constraints applied for each individual source. This assumption limits the optimization space and, therefore, the separation performance of C-ICA algorithms. We generalize the existing C-ICA framework by using a novel decoupling method that preserves the larger optimization space for the demixing matrix. This framework allows for the constraining of either the sources or the mixing coefficients. A constrained version of the nonunitary entropy bound minimization algorithm is introduced and applied to actual complex-valued fMRI data. We show that constraining the mixing parameters using a temporal constraint improves the estimation of the spatial map and timecourses of task-related components.

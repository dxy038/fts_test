A power plant conceptual study (PPCS) has been launched in the framework of the EU fusion program the objective of which is to demonstrate the credibility of fusion power plant design and the claims for safety and environmental advantages and for economic viability of fusion power. A generic set of requirements, addressing in particular safety, operational and economic aspects, has been set out with inputs from industry and from utilities. Four reactor models have been identified for a complete evaluation. The model which is presented in this paper is based on little extrapolation on both physics and technology, using a water cooled divertor based on ITER technology and associated to the water cooled lithium lead (WCLL) blanket.

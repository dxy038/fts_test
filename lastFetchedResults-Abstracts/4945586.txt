The ultimate goal of subspace clustering algorithms is to identify both the subset of attributes supporting a cluster and the location of the cluster in the subspace. In this work a generic evolutionary approach to bottom-up subspace clustering is proposed consisting of three steps. The first applies a non-evolutionary clustering algorithm attribute-wise to establish the lattice from which subspace clusters will be designed. In the second step a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is used to evolve good candidate subspace clusters (CSC) through a combinatorial search w.r.t. the attribute-wise lattice from step 1. The third step then searches in the space of CSC from the population of the the first MOGA to find the best combination of subspace clusters, again under a MOGA formulation. Important properties of the approach are that a standard clustering algorithm is deployed in step one to build the initial lattice of attribute-wise clusters. This helps to decouple the computational expense of clustering using Evolutionary Computation, with the MOGA applied in steps 2 and 3 building clusters through a combinatorial search relative to the original lattice parameters. Benchmarking on data sets with tens to hundreds of attributes illustrates the feasibility of the approach.

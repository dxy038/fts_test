Objective: Because estrogens may decrease 24-hour blood pressure of postmenopausal women, we tested the effect of the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene on ambulatory blood pressure. Study Design: Postmenopausal women with osteopenia who were otherwise healthy were assigned randomly in a double blind-fashion to receive placebo (n = 16 women) or raloxifene (60 mg/d, n = 16 women). Before and after 4 months, the blood pressure of each woman was monitored every 30 minutes for 41 hours with the use of an ambulatory device. Results: Similar to the placebo outcome, the raloxifene administration did not modify 24-hour daytime(7 AM−11 PM) and nighttime (11 PM−7 AM) blood pressure and heart rate values. Day-night differences and the 24-hour rhythmic variation of mean blood pressure, which was evaluated by cosinor analysis, were also not affected by placebo or by raloxifene. Conclusion: Raloxifene does not influence 24-hour blood pressure of postmenopausal women. These data are reassuring for the cardiovascular safety of the long-term raloxifene administration.

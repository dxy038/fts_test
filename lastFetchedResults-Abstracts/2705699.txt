This paper develops a novel symmetric dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma as an ion source for environmental mass spectrometry (MS) applications. The conventional linear-type DBD plasma generator suffers the drawback of floating voltage at the plasma outlet. This paper develops an innovative symmetric T-shaped DBD plasma generator to produce atmospheric plasma with zero-floating potential for high-sensitivity MS analysis. By changing the geometric configuration and the drive phase of the symmetric T-shaped DBD plasma generator, the resulting symmetric structural design can fully cancel the floating potential and noise signal. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to compare the differences between traditional linear-type DBD and the symmetric T-shaped DBD designs using MS, spectroscopy, and some basic electrical measurements. The most suitable parameters are determined by changing the electrode design, voltage, temperature, gas flow rate, diameter, and other parameters of the plasma tube. The symmetric T-shaped design generator produces the zero-potential plasma that generates fewer ambient gas molecules to form ozone, NOx, water clusters, and other strong oxidizing molecules such that less damage to the MS samples occurs. This in turn results in a less fragmented ion signal and higher sensing performance for rapid MS applications. In addition, the proposed system can directly ionize gas, liquid, and solid samples at more than $10^{7}$ -cm$^{-3}$ ion concentration. Results show that more information-rich spectra can be obtained with the developed symmetric T-shaped DBD plasma generator compared with the typical linear-type DBD generator.

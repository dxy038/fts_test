Optimal placement of distributed generation (DG) units and proper allocation of shunt capacitors in order to loss reduction and improvement of voltage profile in distribution systems are studied in this paper. The objective function which has three important indices (active and reactive power losses and voltage profile) is minimized using genetic algorithm. Power flow is done using backward forward sweep method and simulation is carried out on a 28 bus test system. Placement of DGs and capacitors are done simultaneously in the test system. Results show a significant reduction of losses and improvement of voltage profile with presence of DG unit and capacitors.

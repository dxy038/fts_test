This paper employs a smart antenna algorithm to improve pseudonoise (PN) code chip time tracking loop (PNCTL), and analyzes its root-mean-square-chip-time-jitter (RMS) for a third generation (3G) wideband code division multiple access wireless communications system (W-CDMA). The edge effect may happen frequently in a mobile environment and causes a sudden change in the direction of arrival angle (DOA) at a receiver when a transmitter moves around a building corner. The objective of this paper is to analyze the edge effect on the RMS performance of the PNCTL with a smart antenna. This paper concludes that the smart antenna can still significantly improve the PNCTL performance even under realistic edge effect and mobile fading environments.

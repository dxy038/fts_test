In this paper, a supervised fuzzy clustering neural network (SFCNN) is introduced for constructing the garment seam evaluation system. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system could efficiently be used as an objective garment seam evaluation system with high accuracy and is robust for various structures and mechanical properties of middle-thickness cotton fabric.

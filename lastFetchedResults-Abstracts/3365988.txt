This paper presents new MRF (Markov random field) models in a bidirectional Bayesian framework for accurate motion and occlusion field estimation. With careful selection of the five free parameters required by the models, good experimental results have been obtained. The resultant computational speed is also 5.5 times faster compared with the conventional "iterated conditional mode" relaxation using the proposed fast bidirectional relaxation

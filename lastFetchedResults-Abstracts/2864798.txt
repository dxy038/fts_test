This paper proposes a spectral-spatial classification scheme for the classification of remotely sensed images, based on a new version of the recently proposed Genetic Sequential Image Segmentation (GeneSIS). GeneSIS segments the image in an iterative manner, whereby at each iteration a single object is extracted via a genetic algorithm-based object extraction method. In the previous version of GeneSIS, the candidate objects to be extracted were evaluated through the fuzzy content of their included pixels. In the present proposal, a watershed-driven fine segmentation map is initially obtained which serves as the basis for the upcoming GeneSIS segmentation. Our objective is to enhance the flexibility of the algorithm in extracting more flexible object shapes and reduce the execution time of the segmentation, while at the same time preserving all the inherent attributes of the GeneSIS procedure. Accordingly, the previously proposed fitness components are redefined in order to accommodate with the new structural components. In this work, the set of fuzzy membership maps required by GeneSIS are obtained via an unsupervised fuzzy clustering. The final classification result is obtained by combining the results from the unsupervised segmentation and the pixel-wise SVM classifier via majority voting. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated on the land cover classification of a high-resolution hyperspectral image.

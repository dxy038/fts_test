The paper presents detailed modeling and simulation of cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter with regenerative operation to meet the need of several applications like downhill conveyors, elevators and energy plants. The inverter system can operate with a bidirectional power flow and maintain the dc bus voltage steady. The control method of inverter system has been analyzed detailed. A simulation model has been built to demonstrate the inverter system and the Modulation and control techniques have been developed. The simulation result validates the proposed control method. The system has some feature such as simplifying the transformer design, independent control of the active and reactive power, precise control the dc voltage.

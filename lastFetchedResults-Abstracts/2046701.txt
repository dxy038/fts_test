Objective: Â Anchomanes difformis is a member of the plant family Araceae which is used as a diuretic but also has other medicinal applications. This study investigates the dietary effects of A. difformis on the kidneys of adult wistar rats. Materials and Methods: Sixteen rats were used and were weighed, before and after the experiment. All rats were randomly divided into four groups. All groups were treated with the following regimen for two weeks. The control group (A) was fed on feed mash and water ad libitum throughout the period. The treatment groups B, C, and D received feed mash mixed with crude extract of A. difformis in the following proportions: 25:75(g), 50:50(g), and 75:25(g), respectively. The kidneys of the experimental animals were histologically examined for morphologic changes. Results: Results showed a significant difference (p<0.05) in the kidney weight of the treatment groups compared with the control. Histological examination of the renal tissues also showed considerable lesions such as inflammation, focal cortical and interstitial hemorrhage, and fibrosis in the treated rats compared with the control. Conclusion: The current study results suggest renal toxicity with excessive consumption of A.difformis.

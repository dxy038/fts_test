A link throughput analysis is presented for a slotted frequency-hop, spread-spectrum, multiple-access packet radio network (PRN) operating in the presence of background noise. The PRN consists of an arbitrary number of radio units arranged in a paired-off topology. Forward error correction coding is used for packet protection. <e1>M</e1>-ary frequency-shift-keying (FSK) modulation is used with hard decision decoding. Expressions are derived for the link throughput in terms of the channel cutoff rate and capacity. With the objective of maximizing the link throughput, the dependency of the optimal processing gain and code rate on the population size, traffic intensity, and bit signal-to-noise ratio is examined in detail

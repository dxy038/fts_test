Wearable inertial sensors have become an inexpensive option to measure the movements and positions of a person. Other techniques that use environmental sensors such as ultrasound trackers or vision-based methods need full line of sight or a local setup, and it is complicated to access this data from a wearable computerÂ´s perspective. However, a body-centric approach where sensor data is acquired and processed locally, has a need for appropriate algorithms that have to operate under restricted resources. The objective of this paper is to give an overview of algorithms that abstract inertial data from body-worn sensors, illustrated using data from state-of-the-art wearable multi-accelerometer prototypes.

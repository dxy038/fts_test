Background and objective: The most important psychological-social effect of
computer games is their dependence and this can not only lead to financial
problems, but can also lead to the appearance of some problems in school and
in social communications with other people throughout life. Thus, the present
study was done with the aim of determining the predictive power of the theory
of planned behavior upon dependence to computer games among teenagers.
Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study 300 teenagers referring to affiliated
playing clubs that were diagnosed, in the first stage of the study to
be depended on computer games, were randomly selected. Data were collected
through a researcher-made questionnaire consistent with the theory of
planned behavior constructs and adolescents Gaming Dependence Questionnaire
(GAS). The data were analyzed using t tests, regression, Mann-Whitney,
chi-square test.
Results: Median age of participants was 15. Regression results showed that the
perceived of behavioral control (p < 0.001), attitude (p < 0.001) had predictable
insight. And prognosticated consciousness of game dependence and that they
intended to use games. Among the demographic variables, age, type of admission
to clubs played, the number of hours of play during the week and the time
referring to playing clubs, 96% of the variance in gaming dependency predictions
was for their target population.
Conclusion: The theory of planned behavior could predict the bulk of computer
games. The results suggest that the use of the theory of planned behavior, focusing
on attitudes and perceived behavioral control in educational interventions,
can bring effective results.

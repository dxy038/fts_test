Integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) are very practical method to get high precision navigation. GPS/INS data Fusion in navigation has been a research topic for decades. Usually the update time of GPS an INS is different. The update time of GPS is 20 HZ, and the time of INS is 100 HZ or higher. Since GPS and INS are mainly methods in navigation system. Techniques of fusing GPS and INS data are in high demand in navigation industry. Usually the Karman filter is used to fuse the data from GPS and INS. But the Kalman filter is model-dependent and a priori the model parameters need to be known. In this work, a generic and intelligent approach of GPS and INS data fuse using fuzzy interpolation before Kalman algorithm is proposed. First a simplified interpolation model is introduced in a ordinary GPS and INS data fusion. Second a fuzzy rule-based system is established to fuzzy interpolation with objective fuzzy method. Then the parameters of objective fuzzy system are identified, the best n-rule is determinate and the optimal rule base system is found. Finally this approach is applied on an example for a car GPS and INS data fusion, and the results are calculated with computer system to demonstrate the advantages of this approach.

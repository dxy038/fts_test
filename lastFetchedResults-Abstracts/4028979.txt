We propose a hybrid algorithm for finding a set of nondominated solutions of a multi objective optimization problem. In the proposed algorithm, a local search procedure is applied to each solution (i.e., each individual) generated by genetic operations. Our algorithm uses a weighted sum of multiple objectives as a fitness function. The fitness function is utilized when a pair of parent solutions are selected for generating a new solution by crossover and mutation operations. A local search procedure is applied to the new solution to maximize its fitness value. One characteristic feature of our algorithm is to randomly specify weight values whenever a pair of parent solutions are selected. That is, each selection (i.e., the selection of two parent solutions) is performed by a different weight vector. Another characteristic feature of our algorithm is not to examine all neighborhood solutions of a current solution in the local search procedure. Only a small number of neighborhood solutions are examined to prevent the local search procedure from spending almost all available computation time in our algorithm. High performance of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to multi objective flowshop scheduling problems

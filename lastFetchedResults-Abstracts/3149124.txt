This passage takes the environment factor as an exchange object, through the theories analysis and assumption examples on a series of H-O model, to point out the establishment of carbon emissions exchange market maybe make our country to be a cheaper tool of reducing dangerous emissions. By carrying on a research on the model in the closed situation, we know under the objective conditions our trade is in the high cost, compared degree is poor, the price is not transparent, that is very disadvantageous to economize energy and decrease emissions of our country in the long term. Therefore, China should participate international carbon emissions trade carefully, and should concentrate on reducing the negative influence that carbon emission trade brings to our country.

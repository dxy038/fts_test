Scheduling for the flexible job shop is very important in both fields of production management and combinatorial optimization. However, when we attempt to formulate job shop scheduling problems which closely describe and represent the real world problem, various factors involved are often imprecisely or ambiguously known to the analyst. Also, in the real situations, machines are not continuously available due to preventive maintenance activity. Besides, in the production system, there are many users and machines in various priorities. Often, user satisfactions, machine stability and schedule itself are in conflict. By considering the imprecise or fuzzy nature of the data in real world problem, job shop scheduling with uncertain processing time and machine available constraint is introduced. Under the fuzzy circumstance, we attempt to make a feasible solution for flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) based on a hybrid optimization approach with multi-objective which not only to minimize the makespan, but also maximize the user satisfaction and machine stability. In the experiment, we make the comparisons with some other algorithms, such as genetic algorithm, to demonstrate the hybrid approach is much better on efficient search and stability with three benchmark examples. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the impact, in term of total objective, when the proportion of machine stability is varied.

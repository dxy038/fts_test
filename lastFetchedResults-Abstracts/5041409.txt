In 1988 the United States Army Engineering and Housing Support Center (EHSC) sponsored a study of the reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) characteristics of diesel and gas-turbine power systems producing &lt;2 MW. The study included collection and examination of source data for power systems at commercial and military facilities operating in continuous or standby service. The primary objective was to obtain data reflecting the reliability improvements resulting from advances in power-plant (prime-mover) technology since completion of the last comprehensive RAM study more than 15 years earlier. An additional objective was to provide data on the major components that failed in each system, together with data on the reliability of the prime mover. A data base of system, subsystem, and component RAM data was established. These data will be useful in the design of primary and standby power systems for military or commercial facilities

This work presents bidirectional transceiver for on-chip long wires. The current signals are transmitted bidirectional on the interconnection to double the data rate. The voltage swing on the wire is reduced so that the proposed scheme consumes less power at higher data rate. Using 0.18-mum device models for simulation, the proposed scheme has 1.25-6.80 times of date rate and 37-52% reduction of power/data rate ratio than conventional driver. It also performs higher data rate at an extension of wire length

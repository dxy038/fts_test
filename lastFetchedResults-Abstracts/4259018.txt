Proposes a hybrid algorithm for finding a set of non-dominated solutions of a multi-objective optimization problem. In the proposed algorithm, a local search procedure is applied to each solution (i.e. to each individual) generated by genetic operations. The aim of the proposed algorithm is not to determine a single final solution but to try to find all the non-dominated solutions of a multi-objective optimization problem. The choice of the final solution is left to the decision makerÂ´s preference. The high searching ability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulations on flowshop scheduling problems

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is frequently associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. 18q LOH has been frequently reported in colorectal cancer and lung cancer; however, allelic loss on 18q has not been investigated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We evaluated LOH on 18q using nine microsatellite markers in 126 with conventional RCC (cRCC). LOH was observed in more than one 18q microsatellite locus in 24 cRCC (19%). We found the highest frequency of LOH (13.5%) at 18q21.3, where the DCC gene is located. We also assessed the relationship between LOH frequency and patient clinical parameters. Patients with a family history of cancer had a significantly higher frequency of 18q LOH than those without such a history (P = 0.0017). No associations were found with other parameters, including gender, tumor grade, tumor stage, smoking status, and body mass index. The results suggest that inactivation of tumor suppressor genes at 18q21.3, including DCC and SMAD4 as candidates, may be involved in the tumorigenesis of some conventional RCCs.

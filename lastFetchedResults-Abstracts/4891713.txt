The long-term goal of the USAF shared technologies program is to facilitate the development of a roadmap for technology insertion on the wide variety of legacy automatic test equipment (ATE) accumulated by the USAF over the past 30 years. A successful roadmap will provide for operation &amp; support (O&amp;S) cost reduction, preserve test program set (TPS) development investments and evolve in concert with the DoD executive agent for automatic test systems (ATS) initiatives and commercial industry and (e.g. NxTest) changes. The near term objective of this phase of the USAF shared technologies program is to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating available commercial technology into the radio frequency (RF) mobile electronic test set (RFMETS). The RFMETS was originally delivered to the USAF during the early 1990s and is used to support a variety of C-130 avionics including the APQ-170 and APQ-180 radar systems.

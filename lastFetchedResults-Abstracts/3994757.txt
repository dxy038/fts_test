An alternative to the net present value (NPV) formulation of the objective in problems involving choice between cash flows over time is presented. This approach is illustrated in an R&amp;D project selection problem. It is shown that the NPV formulation is a special case of optimizing a multiattribute value function. This special case requires restrictive assumptions about the decision-maker´s preferences over time. The authors suggest instead that multiobjective linear programming methods be used to produce a set of nondominated solutions. This methodology is analytically tractable and requires no assumptions about the decision-maker´s time preferences

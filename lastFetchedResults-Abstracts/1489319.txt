The objective of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between small heat shock proteins (sHSP) degradation and tenderness development of beef loins at different ultimate pH (pHu). A total of twelve loins (M. longissimus dorsi) from steers were obtained at 1 day post mortem. Shear force and proteolysis of each loin were analyzed at 1 and 28 days post mortem. The loins at intermediate pHu (5.8 to 6.0) showed more variation in tenderness compared to the loins at low pHu (&lt; 5.8), where few samples were still tough (&gt; 10 kgF) at 28 days. The intact sHSP20 was more pronounced (P &lt; 0.05) in the intermediate pHu loin compared to the low pHu counterpart. Further, high correlations between the degradation of both sHSP and myofibrillar proteins were observed (e.g. r = 0.94; degraded sHSP27 and degraded desmin). The result of this study suggests that the extent of sHSP degradation could be an indicator of myofibrillar protein degradation and tenderness.

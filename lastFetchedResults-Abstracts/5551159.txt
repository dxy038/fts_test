Summary form only given. The main objective of this work is to achieve high cw output in the 3-/spl mu/m wavelength range from a solid state laser. As it was shown in previously published papers, Er:LiYF/sub 4/ (Er:YLF) is an efficient 3-/spl mu/m material suitable for laser diode pumping. In the present work we have developed a cw Er:YLF laser based on an Er:LiYF/sub 4/ slab sidepumped by two diode laser bars. The side pumped slab design has the potential to scale to much higher power than end-pumped configurations.

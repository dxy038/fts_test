In a group of installed piles, the stresses applied from one pile to soil may have
overlaps with another pile which leads to the changes in bearing capacity and settlement
of each individual pile. In order to predict the performance of those piles, interaction
coecients, based on elasticity theory proposed by Mindlin, are widely applied. In this
paper, the eect of soil relative density and also toe condition on the interaction between
two similar piles in sandy soil is presented using centrifuge modeling. To achieve this
objective, 22 tests have been conducted to investigate the eect of soil relative density
and another 11 tests were performed to study the contribution of pile toe and shaft in the
interactions. The results showed that the value of soil relative density has an important
role in the coecient of interaction which has not been considered in previously reported
correlations. For this reason a modication has been proposed for the Randolph and
Wroth equation to consider soil relative density. Accuracy prediction of the new model
was compared with the Randolph and Wroth equation with the aid of dierent statistical
parameters. This comparison indicated the superiority of the proposed model over previous
methods.

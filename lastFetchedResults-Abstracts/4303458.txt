In this paper, we propose a CAD (Computer aided diagnosis) system to analyze the RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and osteoporosis by using image processing techniques from the CR images. To analyze the RA, we develop a segmentation method for phalanges in CR Image by use of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) for detection of temporal change. The temporal change is detected using the difference image between previous image and current one. The DCT is performed to emphasize the edge of the difference image. Finally, the phalanges are extracted by performing Snakes. The primary objective of this study is to segment phalanges by making temporal subtraction images. We apply our proposed technique to eight cases of CR images and satisfactory segmentation results are achieved. A new index that diagnoses the progress level of the disease of phalanges can be offered as a second opinion.

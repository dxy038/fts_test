Based on quotient space granular analysis, geohazards prognosis problem is defined as a triple, thereby prognosis identity description is accomplished. Quotient space granulation theory provides many methods which can realize from "Abstract Prognosis" to " Careful Prognosis", such as universe division, rough set quantization property division, rough topology structure division, projection division. And quotient space combination technology can be used in objective about from "Careful Prognosis" to "Abstract Prognosis", equivalence relation universe combination, Kashyap property combination and topological base structure combination, for instance. In conclusion, a new concept is given that defines general frame in consideration of time-space domain about geohazards prognosis problem and a new working mode "Trend Analysis - Regional Early Warning - Emergency Alarm" is proposed finally.

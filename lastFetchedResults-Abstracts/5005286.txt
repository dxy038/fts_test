This paper proposed an objective colour perceptual video quality metric to automatically assess the perceived quality of colour digital videos. The rationale in proposing perceptual-based metric is because peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which has been used traditionally to represent the quality of a compressed video sequence, has been found to correlate poorly with subjective quality ratings, particularly at much lower bit rates and frame rates. In this paper, computational models have been applied to emulate human visual perception based on a combination of local and global modulating factors. The proposed video quality metric has been tested on CIF and QCIF colour video sequences compressed at various bit rates and frame rates. It has been shown to give significantly better correlations to human perception than PSNR.

In this study the performance and emissions characteristics of a heavy-duty, direct injection, Compression
ignition (CI) engine which is specialized in agriculture, have been investigated experimentally. For this
aim, the influence of injection timing, load, engine speed on power, brake specific fuel consumption
(BSFC), peak pressure (PP), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), Carbon monoxide (CO),
hydrocarbon (HC) and Soot emissions has been considered. The tests were performed at various injection
timings, loads and speeds. It is used artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting and modeling the engine
performance and emission. Multi-objective optimization with respect to engine emissions level and engine
power was used in order to deter mine the optimum load, speed and injection timing. For this goal, a fast
and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) was applied to obtain maximum engine
power with minimum total exhaust emissions as a two objective functions.

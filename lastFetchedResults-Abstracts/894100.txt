Objective: The aim of current study was to examine the impact of cognitive processing and holographic reprocessing on posttraumatic symptoms improvement. Method: This semi-experimental study targeted a sample size comprising boy students at first, second and third high school grades in Uromia (N=10286). Having utilized traumatic events screening inventory and SCL-90 R on 1000 randomly selected subjects, 129 students were recognized to have experienced traumatic events. The clinical interviews were conducted on sixty who were likewise randomly selected. Then, the selected sample was randomized into three groups subjected to cognitive processing therapy, holographic reprocessing and placebo. In pre- and post-test settings, these groups responded to the traumatic symptoms checklist. Collected data were analyzed via MANCOVA and BONFRONY tests. Results: Our results indicated a significant deference among the three groups with regard to total traumatic symptoms checklist score and especially for anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and dissociation dimensions. Conclusion: according to these results, the two the rapeutic approached appeared to be equally effective in reducing total posttraumatic symptoms. However, cognitive processing was a more effective method for trauma-related depression and holographic reprocessing a more effective approach for trauma-related anxiety, dissociative symptoms and PTSD.

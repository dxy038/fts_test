Objective
To examine brain maturation in adolescent girls with borderline personality disorder (BPD) features using the P300 event-related potential.
Methods
One hundred twenty-three girls, aged 14–19 yrs, were assigned to one of 4 groups formed by the crossing of BPD features (<vs. ≥5 BPD criteria) and median age (< vs. >16.5 yrs). P300 responses were measured while subjects performed a complex visual oddball task.
Results
ANCOVAs of P300 amplitude—adjusting for variability associated with comorbid conduct disorder and depression symptoms—revealed a significant interaction. Among subjects without BPD features, aging was associated with the normal reduction in visual P300 amplitude. Among subjects with BPD features, there were no age-related changes. Additional analyses, which tested the effects of BPD features across the full age range, supported these findings.
Conclusions
The present findings suggest abnormal brain maturation among adolescent girls exhibiting features of BPD.
Significance
These results support a hypothesis of altered brain maturation in adolescents exhibiting BPD features at an early age. It is suggested that measures of brain maturation obtained during adolescence may improve our ability to predict BPD and comorbid disorders in adulthood.

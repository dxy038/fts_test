A dynamic classified work-in-process (DC-WIP) release rule is proposed to meet the requirement of multi-objective optimization for semiconductor manufacturing line with multiple orders. It is based on the fuzzy algorithm, theory of constraints and feedback control. DC-WIP consists of the determination of order priority, determination of release rate and WIP level setting. By using a simulation model with essential characteristics of semiconductor manufacturing line, DC-WIP was compared with other traditional release rules. The simulation results show that DC-WIP is prior to these rules on cycle time, WIP level and on-time-delivery rate. As a result, the whole performance of semiconductor manufacturing line is potentially improved by using DC-WIP.

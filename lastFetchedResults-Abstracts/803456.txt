Background: Since phosphorus is the vital nutrient for plants, the evaluation of phosphorous fertilizers effects on yield and quality of valerian is necessary.
Objective: In this research the effect of phosphorus solubilization bacterias as bio-fertilizers and phosphorous chemical fertilizer on quantity and quality yield of valerian was studied.
Methods: This study conducted in the research farm of Institute of Medicinal Plants (IMP) through a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete blocks design with three replications. Factors of experiment included the inoculation bio-fertilizers factor in four levels: Azotobacter, Pseudomonas, mix of both and control (without inoculation), and also the phosphorous chemical fertilizer factor as super phosphate triple in three levels: 0, 50 and 100 kg ha-1.
Results: The bio-fertilizers using had a significant effect (p?0.01) on the most of studied quantity and quality parameters. Although, the bio-fertilizers using had a negative effect on the amount of valernic acid (%), because of the increasing of root dry weight, it led to a significant rising on yield of valernic acid per hectare. Phosphorous chemical fertilizer had a significant effect on valernic acid (%) (p?0.01), yield of valernic acid (p?0.05) and yield of fresh/dry weight of root and shoot (p?0.01). Also, the result showed that maximum amount of root dry weight was obtained by using both of Azotobacter and phosphorous chemical fertilizers (100 kg ha-1).
Conclusion: Azotobacter had a positive and significant effect on yield of valernic acid and also maximum yield of valernic acid was observed by this treatment.

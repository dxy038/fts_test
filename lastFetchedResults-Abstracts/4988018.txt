There is currently considerable interest in studying the problem of routing railway wagon-flow under various circumstances. In light of the lack and unbalanced utilization of carrying capacity in railway freight, a multi-objective 0-1 programming model and its transformation into a single-objective one were presented to optimizing transportation cost and rationalizing district load, and the corresponding solution method based on Lagrangian relaxation algorithm was also introduced which was illustrated effective for large-scale problem.

Objective: To translate the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axisI disorders (SCID-I) into Persian (Farsi) and to adapt this instrument for the Iranian culture. Method: The SCID was translated into Persian using an elaborate procedure to achieve a satisfactory cross-cultural equivalent. This included forward translation by bilingual (English/Persian) translators, discussion and revision of the translation in an expert panel of bilingual mental health professionals, pilot assessment on a small sample of Persianâ€“speaking patients, back-translation into English and comparison with the original SCID. In addition, understandability and acceptability of the translated items were assessed in 299 patients in three psychiatric hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Results: Some adaptations were made to bring about cross-cultural comparability, especially with regard to conceptual differences which led to difficulties in transferring some psychiatric concepts from English to Persian. The SCID questions were generally understandable and acceptable for the Iranian patients. Conclusion: The SCID was translated into Persian in a multi-stage process to ensure a satisfactory cross-cultural equivalent.

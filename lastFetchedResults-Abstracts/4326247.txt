In September 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Authority (NHTSA) released the Interim Joint Technical Assessment Report, Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Years 2017-2025. The objective of the study is to determine the most cost-effective technology options to meet the 3 and 6% fuel consumption improvements proposed for different acceleration performances. To take into account uncertainties, three cases have been considered: low (90%), medium (50%), and high (10%). The low case represents "business as usual," while the high case is based on targets from the U.S. DOE Vehicle Technologies Program. The study, based on Argonne\Â´s Autonomie vehicle simulation tool, demonstrates that improving vehicle performance benefits the introduction of electric drive vehicles.

The issue of personalization in e-leaning platforms is surveyed, especially how to do the learning contents adaptation according to the learner\´s profile. The realization of adaptive learning scenario become more expensive in terms of development cost and times and it requires specific abilities. Besides, the educator wants to reuse existent scenario. That\´s why, he has to model his course following an educational standard. One recent "de facto" standard of educational technology is a potential solution: IMS-Learning Design. However, this standard still a complex specification and runtimes and authoring environment are harder to build especially with the two level B and C. So, our objective is to offer an adaptive scenario based on learners traces analysis. This tailorable scenario assures the individualization of the learning by allowing the learners to have their course adapted to their profile on one hand and to permit the re-use and the interoperability of these educational scenario by using IMS LD specification on the other hand.

In this work, we deal with the Wireless LAN planning problem. We study this problem and we propose to couple its two major issues: AP placement and channel assignment to treat them jointly. Here, we propose a novel fast and scalable three-phase heuristic algorithm (TPHA). Our proposal is able to resolve the defined multiobjective problem to provide (1) the efficient number of Access Points (APs) to be deployed, while (2) ensuring the coverage of all Test Points (TPs) and (3) maximizing their nominal data rate. To achieve the first objective, we propose an heuristic called MCL-ILP combining the quick decision making yields from the Markovian CLustering algorithm and the exact solution provided by the Integer Linear Programming. Hence, a TPs-based Least Interfering Channel Search algorithm (TLICS) has been proposed for channel assignment to improve the throughput at TP locations. However, the Virtual Forces-based WLAN Planing Algorithm namely VFPA considers the results delivered by the two previous algorithms as an initial solution and tries to enhance it by adjusting the APsÂ´s positions and re-assigning their operating frequencies. Computational results exhibit that our proposal is highly beneficial to designing WLANs.

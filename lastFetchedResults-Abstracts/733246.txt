Objective.
To assess whether a lifestyle intervention delivered to mothers might impact on osteoporosis preventive behaviors in their children.
Methods.

We performed a 2-year randomized controlled trial of individualized bone mineral density feedback with either an osteoporosis information leaflet, or small group education, in a population-based sample of 354 mothers from Southern Tasmania, Australia in 2000â€“02. Main outcomes were maternal report of calcium intake and physical activity change in their children.
Results.

Receiving small group education was associated with mothers' report of increasing children's calcium intake (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 3.8), as was low t-score feedback (odds ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2, 3.3). Mothers who increased their own physical activity were more often reported increasing both physical activity (odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.5, 5.0) and calcium intake in their children (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.3, 3.7). Mothers who commenced calcium supplements more often reported increasing children's calcium intake (odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.0, 6.7) but not physical activity.
Conclusions.

Both bone mineral density feedback and small group education delivered to mothers are effective at inducing maternally reported osteoporosis preventive behavior change in their children. These results require confirmation by studies with objective outcome measures.

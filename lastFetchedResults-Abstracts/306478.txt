Objective: To investigate red blood cell (RBC) and plasma fatty acids (FA) in HIV-positive patients in relation to oxidative stress and nutritional or immunologiical status. Design and Methods: FA, plasma selenium, vitamins A and E were measured in 95 patients divided into four groups according to CD4 cells. Results: Poly- and di-unsaturated FA (PUFA, DUFA) decreased and saturated FA (SFA) increased in RBC in the patients below 400/mm3 and in plasma in the patients below 50/mm3 RBC SFA correlated to CD4 cells, PUFA to MDA. Unlike vitamin E, plasma vitamin A and selenium decreased in most groups. Plasma SFA and MUFA correlated negatively to selenium and PUFA and DUFA to vitamin E. No correlation was found between PUFA and nutritional markers. Conclusion: FA seem to be modified during HIV infection by oxidative stress and disease evolution, but not by denutrition.

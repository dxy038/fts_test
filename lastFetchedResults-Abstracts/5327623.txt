Based on the concept of multi-objective optimization, the requirement for the design of un-round cross-sectioned airframe and stealthy performance combines the Pareto methodology and Genetic Algorithm, by using the selected operators which are the reproduction, niche and the Pareto set filter. Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm gives better distribution and also to improve the optimization efficiency of response surface method (RSM). Based on the N-S equations numerical method to calculate the aerodynamic performance and the application of physical theory of optics and diffraction to calculate the cross-sectional area of the scattering radar, it compromises and optimizes the objective of being non-cylindrical cross-sectioned and stealthy. Hence, optimized design results are obtained.

In this paper we consider the optimal control problem consisting of feeding in minimal time a Sequential Batch Reactors (SBR) where several species compete for a single substrate, with the objective being to reach a given (low) level of the substrate. Following [8, Gajardo et al. Minimal Time Sequential Batch Reactors with Bounded and Impulse Controls for One or More Species. SIAM J. Control and Optimization, vol. 47, Issue 6, pp. 2827-2856, 2008], we allow controls to be bounded measurable functions of time plus possible impulses. A suitable modification of the dynamics leads to a slightly different optimal control problem, without impulsive controls, for which we apply different optimality conditions derived from the Pontryagin principle and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We thus characterize the singular arcs of our problem as the extremal trajectories keeping the substrate at a constant level. We also establish conditions for which a &#8220;immediate one impulse&#8221; (IOI) strategy is optimal. Some numerical experiences are then included in order to show that those conditions are also necessary to ensure the optimality of the IOI strategy.

Objective
Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) tend to have problems in
establishing and maintaining their social relationships. Some professionals
believe this social impairment is the result of deficit in Theory of Mind (ToM).
This study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of ToM training on such
children.
Materials & Methods
A quasi-experimental method, pre- test, post-test with control group was used.
The sample included of 12 girls and 12 boys with High Functioning Autism
Spectrum Disorders (HFASD). Two instruments were used as follows: the
Theory of Mind test and the social skills questionnaire (1). The samples were
randomly placed in the experimental and control groups. The experimental
groups had 15 sessions of ToM training and the control groups had just regular
school program.
Results
The data were analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov, independent t- and twoway-
variance tests. The scores for social skills in the experimental group were
significantly more than the control group.
Conclusion
ToM training might improve the social skills of children with autism spectrum
disorders.

A discrete event process is modelled as a discrete state dynamic system which generates as output a formal language over the alphabet ??. The objective of supervision is to ensure that this output language has certain desired properties. We define the concept of a controllable language and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a supervisor to achieve a given controlled behavior. We also show that every supervisor contains an internal model of the resulting supervised behavior.

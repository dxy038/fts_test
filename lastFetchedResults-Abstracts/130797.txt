Though tuberculosis is frequently seen in the world , breast tuberculosis is still a rare disease. It may present as a breast lump with or without ulceration or discharge. Most cases are reported from endemic areas like India , Bangladesh and South Africa. Tuberculosis is also prevalent in Iran and sporadic cases of breast tuberculosis have been reported. Breast tuberculosis should always be considered in differential diagnosis of breast lumps , ulcers or sinuses. To confirm the diagnosis FNA , culture from secretions and biopsy should be performed. Satisfactory results have been obtained after simple surgical resection and antituberculous therapy.

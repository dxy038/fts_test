Objective This study examines the extent to which gender
differences in use of services in three subcultures in
Israel can be accounted for by the psychosocial differences
between women and men, and by differences in the prevalence
of common psychiatric disorders and levels of
distress.
Method A representative sample extracted from the
National Population Register of non-institutionalized residents
aged 21 or older of Israel was used in this crosssectional
survey. Data on health, use of services and socio
demographic background were collected using face-to-face
computer-assisted interviews. DSM-IV disorders were
assessed using the WMH-CIDI.
Results Gender effects in the three different subcultures
remained significant in predicting the use of services for
mental health purposes after adjustment for educational
level, family status, chronic illness, experience of violence,
presence of mental disorder and psychological distress.
Conclusion The higher rates of help seeking in women
could not be explained by psychosocial differences and are
likely related to womenâ€™s greater readiness to articulate and
communicate distress.

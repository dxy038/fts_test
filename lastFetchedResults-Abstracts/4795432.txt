Omnipresence of radio-frequency identifications (RFIDs) and their use with existing and emerging new wireless technologies have paved way for a plethora of monitoring applications in the field of oil and gas. Degradation in liquefied petroleum/natural gas (LPG/LNG) quality and pipe infrastructure can be a nuisance for the oil and gas industry, hence, we propose a human centric cyber-physical wireless monitoring system utilizing hybrid wireless technologies including RFIDs and other sensor motes to detect and prevent such hazards. The objective of this research is to allow maintainers and administrators to perceive and decide on top of the monitoring system to increase the performance and efficiency of the whole monitoring application.

The paper is a study in the usage of modern information technology (IT) in interdisciplinary teaching of notions featured in the physics and chemistry curriculum. It encompasses specifically the study of &#8220;The Ideal gas laws&#8221; and their real life application, as well as &#8220;The electrolysis of water&#8221; (8<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> grades, respectively). The crucial teaching-learning-assessment chain of lesson is comparatively analyzed within the &#8220;traditional&#8221; and &#8220;modern&#8221; lessons respectively, the last one by making use of didactical support such as: Interactive sequences of the &#8220;Elements of thermodynamics and molecular physics&#8221; (an educational software that is part of the AEL platform, a SIVECO product) and Virtual Physics Lab from the web-site http://jersey.waregon.edu. The paper consists of the following sections: * The student-oriented didactics and learning - a crucial objective towards excellence in teaching; * Specific ways of using IT means within the physics or chemistry lessons or order to make the two natural sciences interdisciplinary; * An important point is the use of ICT in the training of teachers, this paper is intended to contribute to the development of independence and team work. This &#8220;ICT Revolution&#8221; will move the stress from teaching to learning new requirements for the educational system; * Pros and cons of the real and virtual experiments.

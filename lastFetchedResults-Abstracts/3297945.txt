AlzheimerÂ´s Disease (AD) is a complex progressive brain disorder. Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered as a Preclinical stage of dementia. The objective of this paper is to perform a segmentation process on longitudinal MR images of the human brain using Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) and k-means algorithm. These techniques are used in classifying the brain tissues in to Grey Matter (GM), White Matter (WM) and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This study aims to identify the structural characteristics of GM, WM and CSF at baseline and structural changes after one year that could serve as accurate predictors of future development of MCI in the normal aging controls and AD in the MCI patients.

This study presents a new design of a multi-band filter-antenna subsystem dedicated to high-speed wireless communications at 60 GHz. The objective is to design the subsystem as a monolithic object realized with a ceramic material. The broadband antenna is composed of a conical horn acting as a primary source for illuminating a reflect-array. The 9-GHz spectrum, which covers the unlicensed 60-GHz band, is divided into four channels of 1.65 GHz. In this paper, the primary source and the four bandpass filters are designed and integrated together.

The focus of effort in ITER EDA since 1998 has been on the development of a new design to meet revised technical objectives and a cost reduction target of about 50% of the previously accepted cost estimate. Drawing on the design solutions already developed, and using the latest physics results and outputs from technology R&D projects, the Joint Central Team and Home Teams, working together, have been able to progress towards a new design which will allow the exploration of a range of burning plasma conditions, with a capacity to progress towards possible modes of steady state operation. The new ITER design, whilst having reduced technical objectives from those of its predecessor, will nonetheless meet the programmatic objective of providing an integrated demonstration of the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy. The main features of the current design and of its projected performance are introduced and the outlook for construction and operation is summarized.

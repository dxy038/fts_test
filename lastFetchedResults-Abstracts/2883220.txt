This paper investigates the modulation schemes in visible light communication (VLC) system. On-off keying (OOK), and pulse position modulation (PPM) one used widely in visible light communication, but recently some new ideas are proposed in order to realize a high performance communication system along with optimum performance in terms of power, bandwidth, capacity and data rate at acceptable complexity. This paper specifically combines the PPM and pulse shape modulation (PSM). The objective of this paper is to examine different types of pulse shaping and PPM in VLC system. From the presented analysis, it has been shown BER performance can be maintained at a higher data rates by an increase in bandwidth and the number of pulses. This scheme provides improved in system performance along with computational complexity. The BER performance of this scheme also compared to traditional (n-bit/symbols) schemes.

In this paper, a design framework of fault-tolerant wireless networked control systems (NCSs) is developed for industrial automation applications. The main objective is to achieve an integrated parameterization and design of the communication protocols, the control and fault diagnosis algorithms aiming at meeting high real-time requirements in industrial applications. To illustrate the design framework, a laboratory wireless fault-tolerant NCS platform is presented.

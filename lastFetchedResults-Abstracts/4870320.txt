The objective of this work is to demonstrate an experimental methodology based on structural intensity technique to visualize energy flow in hard disk drives with a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. Preliminary experimental results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology to locate sources/sinks and chart energy flow paths in a hard disk drive.

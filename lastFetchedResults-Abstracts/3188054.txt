Streaming media service is the representative and important service in 3G period. This paper describes the motivation, methodology, and characteristic of QualView system which is mainly used for monitoring the mobile steaming media service. QualView system is based on end-to-end QoS architecture and integrates many functions such as: end-user behavior simulation, data collection, parameter extraction, QoS evaluation, failure alarm and so on. It makes objective parameters of the network associate with the user perceived QoE by building an association model. Experiment results show it is efficient and effective in fault locating and QoS evaluation.

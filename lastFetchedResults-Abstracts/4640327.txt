An interesting concept of the usage of the capabilities of electric vehicles is the aggregation of a large number of electric cars and using the aggregated power for regulation purposes (mainly frequency regulation). This concept is called V2G (short for "vehicle-to-grid"). The power electronics used in battery chargers make bidirectional power flow possible, so EVs can be considered as storage capacity for the grid. Frequency regulation capability of aggregated electric vehicle power is investigated in this paper by means of computer simulation. Effect of under-frequency load shedding is also taken into consideration.

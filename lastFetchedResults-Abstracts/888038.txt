Abstract
Objective:The current research was done to investigate the moderating role of cognitive attribution on the relationship between big five personality factors and aggressive reaction of male students. Method:our target population was the male high school students, among which 196 subjects were selected using the simple random sampling method. Research instruments were: the 50 item- big five personality factor questionnaire, the 2 item-aggressive reaction questionnaire and three scenarios of stimulating cognitive attribution. Data were analyzed using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient and hierarchical regression analysis. Results: Our results revealed that cognitive attribution moderates the relationship between extroversion and openness to experience and aggressive reaction of male students to strange people. Simple slope analysis showed that in the cognitive hostile attributive situation, there is significantly negative relationship between extroversion and aggressive reaction of male students to stranger people (P < 0.01). However, in the cognitive hostile attributive situation, there was a significantly positive relationship between openness to experience and aggressive reaction of male students to strange people(P < 0.01). Moreover, our findings demonstrated that cognitive attribution moderates the relationship between extroversion and aggressive reaction of male students to familiar people. Simple slope analysis showed that in cognitive hostile attributive situation, there is significantly negative relationship between extroversion and aggressive reaction of male students to familiar people (P < 0.01). Conclusion:Based on our findings, personality characteristics such as extroversion and openness to experience interact with hostile attribution-related aggressive reactions among male students.

We present an approach for integrated network planning with QoS estimation in a simulation tool for use in industrial environments. The architecture is based on a wireless planning tool that uses measurements or accurate models of the environment to predict physical layer signal distribution. This tool allows the precise modeling of industrial environments including machinery, walls, and other obstacles. We integrate this tool with a simulation model for performance evaluation of sensor networking protocol. In particular, we use out model of the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol together with the accurate physical layer model to estimate the behavior of intended applications before actually deploying them. The final objective is to allow the network designer to use the toolkit for integrated QoS-oriented network planning.

The foremost objective of system designers is to develop hardware with the correct functionality in the shortest possible time. Therefore, they are keen to exploit any methodology that will help to reduce development times, increase reuse and make `right first timeÂ´ design an achievable target. This paper proposes a method that permits rapid prototyping of custom hardware for the implementation of real-time image processing systems. This methodology consists of partitioning the system into component blocks and then prototyping using a library of generic VHDL models. Each component model has a standard interface and has been simulated and synthesised to a technology-independent level. Systems can be quickly and easily constructed using this library and a model-oriented design flow. This technique permits the rapid prototyping of hardware whilst allowing the functionality and performance of the proposed system to be quickly assessed and verified throughout the design cycle

A feasibility study is described on inter-departmental exchange of CD-Rs with data formatted according to the DICOM 3.0 standard. The objective is the assessment of the DICOM v3.0 data-sets on CD-R according to the DICOM basic cardiac Profile and the review capabilities of DICOM conformant cardiac review stations. Eleven CD-Rs were assessed: six were routinely recorded at departments using the equipment from four different manufacturers, five CD-Rs were DEMO-disks issued first half 1997. Seven DICOM conformant review stations, currently in use at the Dutch cardiology departments, are tested in this study. The exchange of DICOM Cardiac cineÂ´s stored on CD-Rs appeared not to be without problems. The discussion refers to DICOM and non-DICOM properties that could play a role. A proposal for a minimal dataset for interchange is made based on Dutch daily practice

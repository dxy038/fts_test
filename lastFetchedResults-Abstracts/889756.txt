Background and Objective: Regarding side effects of acute and especially chronic inflammation and incomplete treatment of patients suffering from these side effects, the new and effective strategies are needed. For this purpose, in the present study, we scientifically evaluate an introduced folk herb Urtica dioica, for treatment of inflammation.
Materials and Methods: The Sham, control and treatment groups were subjected to four methods in order to measurement the inflammation: 1) Formalin-induced hind paw inflammation. In 2nd and 3rd methods, respectively, inflammation was induced by xylene and acetic acid application to ear and peritoneum. In the last method (chronic pain) the weight difference of cottons implanted in groin border of rats, before and after 7 days were compared in control and treatment groups.
Results: Statistical analysis has shown a significant difference between rate of inflammation in control and treatment groups. The extract in doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg could reduce inflammation produced by formalin 24.52 ± 2.2 and 22.71 ± 2.1 % respectively. However, three doses of the extract (20, 50 and 100 mg/kg) have significantly reduced the acetic acid produced peritonitis, 21.45 ± 2.4, 18.55 ± 2.2 and 27.49 ± 1.8 % respectively. Results in chronic inflammation examination showed that the extract in doses over 400 mg/kg could have dimin-ished inflammation 24.08 ± 2.1 %.
Conclusion: This study shows that alcoholic Urtica dioica extract could mark-edly reduce the chronic and acute inflammation.

As the development of collaborative applications, the parallel interactions among processes are more and more complicated and frequent. However, modeling of the interactions among many collaborative processes is a complicated and error-prone procedure. In this paper, firstly, a novel model based on Petri net, called PIPN, was proposed. PIPN is suitable to define and analyze the parallel interactions among collaborative processes. Secondly, seven parallel interactive modes were summarized according to three views of parallel interactions, which are unidirectional or bidirectional, single-point or multi-point, and synchronous or asynchronous. Then the formal definitions and control flow graphs of these modes were given. Finally, an example, called micro blog, was modeled to verify the reasonableness and feasibility of the work in this paper.

Colorectal cancer has risen in incidence to become the second commonest form of cancer in Singapore. The primary treatment is surgery but up to 50% of patients still suffer from recurrence of the cancer after surgery. Early identification of recurrence will increase the effectiveness of therapy and the survival of patients. This paper describes the CARES (Cancer Recurrence Support) System, whose objective is to predict the recurrence of colorectal cancer, using Case-based Reasoning (CBR), and supported by other techniques such as data mining and natural language processing. The CARES System employs CBR to compare and contrast between the new and past colorectal cancer patient cases, and makes inferences based on those comparisons to determine the high risk patient groups. The features and functionality of the system are described.

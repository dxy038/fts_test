Background: The ability to regulate negative emotions is necessary for the maintenance of mental health and well-being, particularly in populations routinely confronted with situations that elicit intense negative emotions. This research was done with the aim to normalize and examine the reliability and validity of Berking's Emotion-Regulation Skills Questionnaire (ERSQ).
Materials and Methods: The statistical population of this study was composed of all the students of Police University. Among them, a total of 117 people (101 male, 16 female) were selected using stratified random sampling. To achieve the study objective, the Persian version of ERSQ, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and Gratz's Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale were used, respectively. 
Results: Cronbach's Alpha of the questionnaire, for measuring reliability, was 0.93 (P  <  0.001). In order to assess the questionnaire's validity, convergent and divergent validity methods were employed. The overall index of the ERSQ revealed a high negative correlation with each of the 4 factors of the GHQ and high positive correlation with DERS. 
Conclusion: Based on the results obtained from the research, ERSQ can be applied to attain research and clinical objectives in Iranian society.

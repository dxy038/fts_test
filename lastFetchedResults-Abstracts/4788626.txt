A relay station (RS)-based cellular system deployment is considered, where multiple base stations (BS) cooperate in the BS-RS in-band transmission for the downlink. With the joint optimization of the resources allocated to the wireless backhaul and to the RS-MS access, it is possible to exploit the benefits of networked-MIMO along with combating the pathloss and shadowing effects, and thus obtain significantly enhanced spectral efficiency and coverage homogeneity. The problem is shown to be convex under conventional QoS objective functions. Suboptimal low complexity solutions are also proposed and evaluated.

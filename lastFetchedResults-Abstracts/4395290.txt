The main objective of this article is to investigate the optimized active power control of wind power plants with Direct Drive Permanent Magnet wind turbine generators (DDPMs). This research will be performed by different technical approaches such as inertia control of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs), smooth active power control by energy storage system of WTGs and Energy Management Platform (EMP) based on optimized active power control on the wind power plants with DDPMs. The technical approach shall be activated during the fundamental frequency drop of the network or will depend on the network operator´s control command for the output active power of wind power plant. In addition, investigations have been launched into the potential impact of the optimized frequency response control of DDPMs to the instantaneous power generation capacity of the WTGs. The approach on the DDPMs is implemented in the inertia response control loop based on the grid frequency error and rotor speed signals. This method is available during the different control steps of DDPMs; include Maximum Power Point Tracing (MPPT) during lower wind speeds, Constant Power Control (CPT) during wind speeds higher than its rated value and Constant Speed Control (CSC) during medium wind speeds. The approaches on the wind power plant are implemented based on the operational parameters of DDPMs and network operator´s control command in the optimised active power dispatching loop of EMP. Related simulations in the time domain and related calculations will be conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and availability of these approaches.

In this paper, a new formulation of assignment problem taking into account both operator competences and individual preferences is presented. The integration of the aforementioned factors in the objective function of the proposed formulation is described. In the current work the dependence between competence and processing time is expressed by a coefficient that represents the degree of closeness between the required and acquired competence resources levels. Both, the calculation of the closeness coefficient and the structure of the processing time function are pointed up across the sections.

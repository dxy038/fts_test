A generalized model is presented to incorporate objective (hard) and subjective (soft) hazard information in automated decision-aiding systems. The model may be used with more than one hazard, of more than one type, in a given problem. Uncertainties in state measurements, dynamics, hazard extent, and hazard severity are included, as is the consideration of the fact that different operators may have different concepts of what is an acceptable or unacceptable risk. By examining the tradeoffs created by these uncertainties, appropriate decision thresholds can be selected. Using an aviation case study, information gained from observation of aircraft behavior in the presence of weather was used to develop a model of weather as a soft hazard. This information can then be used in a decision aid to provide feedback on route acceptability.

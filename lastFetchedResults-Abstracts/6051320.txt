The current study showed that safflower yellow pigment can protect the endothelial cells, reduce the incidence of coronary restenosis, but the specific mechanisms have not been reported. Objective: To establish in vitro hemolytic blood lecithin-induced endothelial cell models of restenosis and of safflower yellow pigment on the vascular endothelial cell protection. Methods Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), divided into: (1) normal control group, (2) lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) group, (3) low concentrations of safflower yellow + lysolecithin group (HYSA: 50mg / L + LPC), (4) high concentrations of safflower yellow + lysolecithin group (HYSA: 100mg / L + LPC) (each group interventions? group name full uniform). Were observed endothelial cell proliferation, apoptosis, and supernatant nitric oxide (NO) concentration changes. Results and Conclusion: Compared with normal control group, lysophosphatidylcholine inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, reducing the NO concentration, the difference was significant (P &lt;;0.01). Safflower yellow pigment intervention lysophosphatidylcholine on endothelial cells, the enhancement of endothelial cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, NO concentration, with the normal control group and LPC group difference was significant (P &lt;;0.01). The results confirmed that the safflower yellow pigment can be improved LPC effects on HUVECs, enhanced epithelial cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, increased NO concentration.

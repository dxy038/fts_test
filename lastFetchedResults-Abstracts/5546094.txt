This paper presents simulation of a PLC-based self-tuning PI-fuzzy controller for DC motor speed control. The controller consists of two fuzzy logic blocks, main and gain tuning, respectively. The main fuzzy block acts as a speed controller, while the gain tuning block scales the output of main fuzzy. The gain tuning gets same inputs as main fuzzy (i.e. speed error and change of error). By introducing gain tuning, overshoot and settling time can be restrained. The objective of the controller is to provide stability, to reduce overshoot in response to disturbance and sudden change in reference. The performance is compared to PI-fuzzy controller. Results show improved performance.

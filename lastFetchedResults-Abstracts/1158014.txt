Hard turning has been recognized as a substitute for abrasive-based processes due to its operational flexibility, economic benefit, and low environmental impact. Besides these advantages, hard turning can induce compressive residual stresses, which increase the fatigue life of the workpiece. In this paper, we investigate the process parameters of cutting speed, depth of cut, and feed rate on inducing subsurface compressive residual stress. Using a designed experiment based on a Taguchi L9 (34) array, we varied process parameters over a feasible space. The resulting residual stresses were examined and evaluated by X-ray diffraction. Using the smaller-is-better objective function for residual stress, we then identified the optimal set of process parameters.

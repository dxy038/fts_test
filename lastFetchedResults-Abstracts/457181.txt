Background
Tuberculosis is a chronic recurrent infection and inflammation is part of the disease which may remain undiagnosed for months. Furthermore immunization with recombinant heat shock protein-65-rich mycobacterium tuberculosis increased atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic animal models.
Objective
To investigate the potential interrelationships between past tuberculosis with carotid and femoral atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic patients.
Design and setting
Case control study in a university hospital.
Patients
Two groups of hypercholesterolemic patient group (n = 147) studied in a cardiovascular prevention unit during the same quarter, age (Â±1 year) and sex-matched. The first group presented a history of tuberculosis in the past and the second group never.
Methods
Atherosclerosis was assessed by carotid and femoral external echography. Measurements of maximum plaque diameter were done in longitudinal planes, and the extent of atherosclerosis was graded according to the most severe visible changes on the scanned arteries.
Results
The frequency and the distribution of atherosclerosis was similar in the two groups, whatever the arterial site explored, carotid or femoral. None of the clinical and biological studied variables were different between the two groups of patients.
Conclusion
Past tuberculosis is not associated with increased frequency of atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolemic patients.

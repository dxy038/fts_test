Objective
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pulpal responses following direct pulp capping of mechanically exposed teeth with new dentine adhesive systems, in the preclinical model of dog teeth.
Methods

Class V cavities (approximately 2.50 mm wide, 3.00 mm long, 1.5â€“2.0 mm deep) were prepared on the buccal surface of permanent maxillary and mandibulary molars, two rooted premolars, canines and third incisors. The cavities were assigned to five experimental groups, representing one control group treated with a Ca(OH)2-based material and four experimental groups where the adhesive systems Clearfil SE Bond, Prompt-L-Pop, Etch & Prime 3.0 and Single Bond were tested. The pulpal tissue responses to dentine adhesives were assessed at post-operative periods of 7, 21, 65 days.
Results

Variable responses were recorded, which were characterized by moderate to severe inflammatory reactions, progressive extension of tissue necrosis with time and total absence of continuous hard tissue bridge formation after pulp capping with each of the four adhesive systems. Application of a Ca(OH)2-based material was characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, limited tissue necrosis as well as partial to complete hard tissue bridging.
Conclusions

It seems evident that application of dentine adhesive systems in direct contact with the mechanically exposed pulp of healthy dog teeth cannot lead to acceptable repair of the dentine-pulp complex e.g. wound healing with tertiary dentine bridge formation.

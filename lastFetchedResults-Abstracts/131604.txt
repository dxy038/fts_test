Introduction: 400000 new cases of cutaneous Leishmaniasis are reported each year and unresponsiveness to treatment of choice (Glucantim) is increasing. In cases of drug resistance, Allopurinol is prescribed as alternative therapy.
Objective: In this in vitro study Allopurinol effects were assessed on L. Tropica resistant Types. Materials and Methods: The L. Tropica Promastigote species were cultured in increasing concentrations of Glucantim to obtain the resistant type to 250 mg/ml. After cytological evaluation of all resistant types, Allopurinol effects were measured by count and by growth percentage of both wild and resistant types. The differences of these variables were then compared in and between species.
Results: Promastigotes of resistant type were decreased in dimension, their tails got thicker and shorter or even disappeared, and cytoplasm got dentate while kinetoplast moved next to nucleus. Allopurinol decreased growth percentage and the number of both resistant and wild Promastigotes. But growth percentage of resistant type was significantly less than Wild type for all Allopurinol concentrations.
Conclusion: Mechanisms of Glucantim resistance lead to morphological and growth rate changes. In agreement to precedent clinical studies the in vitro resistant type of L. Tropica Promastigotes were more sensitive to Allopurinol, although Allopurinol is effective on both wild and resistant species.

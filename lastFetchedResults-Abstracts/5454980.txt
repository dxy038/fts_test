The objective of this paper is to present a computer program developed for Windows to compute reliability indices for different customers and set of customers served by the same distribution feeder. This program deals with information obtained directly from utility database to create an equivalent network modeling and run contingency analytical simulations. The systemÂ´s average failure rates must be informed by the user, based on historical utility data, manufacturer test data or typical values. The program enables to compute penalties and annual costs of energy interruptions and compare the obtained indices with the reliability index targets set by the national regulatory agency (ANEEL) for the different sets of customers and distribution feeders under analysis. The program allows one to analyze changes in the system rates and in the topology of the electrical network and, thus, to carry out a sensitive study to verify the effect of some different protection equipment and changes in the topology of the systems, justifying investments that can improve the reliability, the power quality, and reduce costs of energy interruption and other related costs.

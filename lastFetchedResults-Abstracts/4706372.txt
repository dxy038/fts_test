This paper analyzes the topology of quantum control landscapes with dynamic symmetry, which is referred to as the optimization objective as a functional of control fields. We find that the ruggedness of the landscape, which determines the search efficiency for global optima, is dependent with the dynamic symmetry. This effect is demonstrated via the gate fidelity control landscape of a system whose controllability is restricted on a SU(2) dynamic symmetry group. We show that multiple local false traps (i.e., non-global suboptima) exist even if the target gate is realizable and that the number of these traps is increased by the loss of controllability, while the controllable systems are always devoid of false traps.

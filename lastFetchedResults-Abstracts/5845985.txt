This paper present about the fire detection of forest fire at Raja Muda Forest Reservein Kuala Selangor within the year2005 until 2009. The main objective is to detect the relationship of humidity and temperature in the effect of the recovery of the forest fire. There are some approaches to identify the effect of the vegetation recovery, Byusing Anova Method, pattern prediction and Remote Sensing techniques using images of SPOT-5 and SPOT-4 provided by Malaysia Remote Sensing Agency. The prediction focusing based on the parameter in space weather. The changing of humidity and temperature elements will give impact to the surrounding. The analysis of the humidity and temperature related to the detection of recovery is by using anova method. The relation and correlation of the humidity and temperature data provided by Malaysia Meteorology Department is proven by the change of the vegetation is observed by the change of the satellite images in the 2005 and 2011. The impact is determined by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach. The results showed the temperature is the main parameter to the effect change towards the vegetation growth through time of the area affected.

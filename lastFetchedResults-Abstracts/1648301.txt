The objective of this work indicates and discusses two mathematical models and numerical techniques for solving problems associated with wave propagation in the track and subsoil due to the passage of a train. The Thin Layer Method/Flexible Volume Method (TLM/FVM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM) are used to analyse the three-dimensional dynamic response of the free field near railway lines induced by the moving loads acting on the surface of a homogeneous or layered half-space. Both simulation models employ the substructuring approach in the frequency domain. The validity of the methods are demonstrated by comparison with results of analytical solution. An extensive numerical investigation has been carried out to show the influence of different parameters on the effectiveness of vibration reduction through open trench barriers.

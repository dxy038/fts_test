In this paper we propose a new efficient algorithm of noise suppression in color images. The new technique of multichannel image enhancement is capable of reducing impulsive and Gaussian noise and it outperforms the standard methods of noise reduction. In this paper a new smoothing operator, based on a random walk model and on a fuzzy similarity membership function of pixels connected by digital paths is introduced. The efficiency of the proposed method has been tested on the standard color images using the widely used objective image quality measures.

     The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Zilpaterol hydrochloride as a beta agonist on feedlot performance, carcass traits and some of blood metabolites in castrated Mahabadi male kid goats. Thus, 14 castrated male kid goats with 23 kg live body weight and 6 months old were used based on completely randomized design with 7 repeats per treatment for 93 days of feedlot period. The male kids were fed diets containing 15.2% crude protein and 2.35 Mcal/kg ME. In day 60 of Feedlot period, the goat kids were fed to (0.2 mg kg/ live weight) zilpaterol hydrochloride for 30 days. After 3 days of withdrawal from feedlot period, all of kids were slaughtered in industrial slaughterhouse. In this trial, Zilpaterol hydrochloride caused to increase live body weight (P < 0.05) at end of the period and decrease feed intake (P < 0.05). Zilpaterol Hydrochloride also decreased plasma glucose (P < 0.01), triglyceride and cholesterol (P < 0.05). Zilpaterol Hydrochloride increased hot carcass weight (HCW) (P < 0.05), longissimus muscles area (P < 0.01) and improved dressing percentage (P=0.07), while decreased abdominal fat (P < 0.01), heart weight (P < 0.05) and back fat thickness (P < 0.03). Thus, it seemes that using zilapterol hydrochloride can improve growth performance and carcass quality in castrated male kids.

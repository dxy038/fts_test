Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess 1-year outcomes of sacral colpopexy with the use of allograft fascia lata.
Study design
Records of all subjects who underwent sacral colpopexy with allograft fascia lata from May 1, 2001, to April 30, 2003, were reviewed. Subjects underwent pre- and postoperative evaluation of prolapse with the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system. The Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the results.
Results
Allograft fascia lata was used for 24 colpopexies during this period. No significant intraoperative or postoperative complications or graft erosions occurred. Five subjects were lost to follow-up after 3 months. Analysis was performed on the remaining 19 subjects. Prolapse of stage 2 or more in compartments Aa, Ba, Ap, Bp, and C was preoperatively 50%, 74%, 78%, 84%, and 68% and postoperatively 11%, 16%, 21%, 26%, and 5%, respectively.
Conclusion
Allograft fascia lata may be a suitable alternative to permanent mesh for sacral colpopexy, but longer-term outcomes and larger studies are needed.

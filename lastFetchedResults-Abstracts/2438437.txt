Seismic resiliency of new buildings has improved over the years due to enhancements in seismic codes and design practices. However, existing buildings designed and built under earlier codes are vulnerable and require a performance-based screening and retrofit prioritization. The performance modifiers considered are soft story, weak story, and the quality of construction, which are collated through a walk down survey. The building evaluation is performed through a pushover analysis, and performance objective are obtained through initial stiffness of the pushover curve. Using a design of experiments technique, a reliable system inputâ€“output relation has been identified and used to evaluate the performance criteria at untried design points (i.e., buildings with different modifier values). The proposed method of performance based evaluation is illustrated through consideration of the different structural deficiencies on a typical six-storey reinforced concrete building in Vancouver. Through the designed experiments, the main and interaction effects of the performance modifiers have also been studied.

The objective of the present work is to investigate, from the open literature, the recent developments in the rheology of silica and organoclay nanocomposites. In particular, this paper focuses on general trends of the linear viscoelastic behaviour of such nanocomposites. Hence, the variations of the equilibrium shear modulus and critical strain (limit of linearity), which depend on power laws of the volume fraction of particles, are discussed as filler fractal structure. In the third section, the strong nonlinearity behaviour (Payne effect) of filled polymers has been discussed in terms of filler nature. Typically two mechanisms arise to depict the linear solid-like behaviour and the Payne effect: particle–particle interactions is the dominant mechanism in fumed silica nanocomposites whereas particle–polymer interaction is the dominant one in colloidal silica nanocomposites at identical filler concentrations. However, these interactions are balanced in each nanocomposite systems by the silica surface treatments (chain grafting, silane modification) and the molecular weight of the matrix. Finally, we aim to unify the main findings of the literature on this subject, at least from a qualitative point of view.

ally report on the thixotropy and modulus recovery after a large deformation in steady and dynamic shear conditions. Following this, the nonlinear rheological properties of nanocomposite materials have been discussed. The discussion is particularly focused on the effect of flow history (transient shear experiments) on the orientation–disorientation of clay platelets. Actually, the linear and nonlinear rheological properties are consistent with a network structure of a weakly agglomerated tactoids. As far as exfoliated clay nanocomposites are concerned, the inter-particle interaction is the dominant effect in the nonlinearity effect.

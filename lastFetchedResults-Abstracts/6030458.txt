This paper, with analysis on real data of 36 high schoolsÂ´ entrance exam results, and further studies rate of 1999 in Pudong New Area, establishes a continuous Verhulst model to reveal the existence of objective laws of education, provide a quantitative basis for analysis, computation and predict the Pudong New Area senior secondary education systems. The proposed method first appeared in the fifth national seminars on the Gray Theory (1990) held by Agricultural College of Zhejiang Province, when the original sequences are apparent S-distribution. It can be accrued in dealing with the original sequence and the sequence level by Verhulst model-building, and it is the first time of using &#194;&#191;the quality of the calculation of non-continuous distribution center of mass&#194;&#191; in education scientific research for dealing with nonlinear discrete-time data.

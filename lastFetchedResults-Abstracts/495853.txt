Introduction:Root perforation diagnosis and immediate treatment of the lesion, can improve the prognosis of the treatment. Because of the limitations of radiographic method for determining proper location of the perforation, today using electronic apex locator devices was recommended for root perforation detection. Objective: Evaluate the accuracy of the Raypex5 apex locator for detecting root perforation and compare it with radiographic method.

Materials and Methods:Twenty extracted anterior central teeth with apical foramen diameter equal to file 30 or 35 were selected. The roots were perforated using a 1/2 round bur at 1/3 middel of the root. Then, actual electronic and radiographic distance to perforation were measured . Data were analyzed using ANOVA with repeated measurements.

Results:Raypex5 apex locator could detect root perforations in 55% of the cases. In these cases, no significant difference was observed between the mean electronic and actual length of the perfortion(p=0.29). There was no significant difference between the mean radiographic and actual length of the perfortion(p=0.444). There was no significant difference between the mean radiographic and electronic length. (p=0.819).

Conclusion: Raypex5 could detect root perforation in only 55% of the cases.In these cases, electronic length had no significant difference with actual and radiographic length.

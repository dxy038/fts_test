The objective of the work carried out is to study the physical layer issues of establishing a point to point link using diffused infrared radiation. The distribution of diffused infrared field for a given room (cell) geometry and transmitter LED configuration is analyzed. For a given transmitter power (i.e., base station), selected modulation scheme and for a predetermined bit error rate (BER), the area of coverage (cell size) is determined. A simulation of the trade off between the cell size and the transmitter power is carried out. Numerical results from simulation are obtained using IR source parameters (i.e., positional coordinates, emitter power, shape of the radiation pattern etc.) and the receiver parameters (positional coordinates, receiver orientation and sensitivity etc.)

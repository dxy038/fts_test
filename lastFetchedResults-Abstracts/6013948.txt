Since the way of arc-suppression coil grounding 10kV distribution network is in a high proportion. This paper study on the operation of the three types of arc-suppression coils, including phase control type, turns adjusting type, capacitive adjusting type, in 10kV distribution network. According to the typical parameters of the 10kV distribution network of 110kV substation, the EMTP-ATP was utilized to analyze the arc fault over-voltage, the arc-suppression coil dynamic response time when there is single-phase arc ground fault, and the Harmonic currents inputted to the power system. At the end, the three types of arc-suppression coil were made an objective comparison and evaluation in the aspects of the inhibition of over-voltage, dynamic response time and harmonic currents.

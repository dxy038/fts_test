Background : Finding simple , lowcost and safe way for tubal ligation is of great importance.
Objective : To compare the duration of operation, recovery and complications (up to one week) in these methods.
Methods : 281 volunteered women, for laparascopic sterilization were enrolled into a randomized clinical trial and were sterilizied by filshie-clips or bipolar electrocougulation. Duration of operation, recovery time and complication of both methods were compared. Findings : No major complications were reported in this study. However , surgery complications were observed in 4.1% of the cases. The duration of operation was 15.1 I-10.7 and 10±4.4 minutes to carry out filshie clip and bipolar electrocoagulution sterilization method , respectively. Duration of return to normal activities were 2.6± 1.74 and 1.3 ± 1.1 days , respectively. The rate of complication of these two approaches didnot have a significant difference.
Conclusion: Duration of surgery and also recovery time were significantly shorter for users of bipolar electrocoagulation method , rather than filshie clip one.

We consider the problem of rear axle regenerative braking maximization in hybrid vehicles. We focus on cornering maneuvers on low friction surfaces, where excessive braking at the rear axle might induce vehicle instability. We present and compare two predictive control approaches, where the objective is maximizing the regenerative braking and distributing the friction braking at the four wheels, while (i) delivering the braking force requested by the driver, (ii) preserving vehicle stability and (iii) fulfilling system constraints, e.g., bounds on regenerative braking set by the hybrid powertrain. We present simulation results in combined braking and cornering manoeuvres, showing that the proposed approaches are able to effectively balance regenerative and friction braking, while preserving vehicle stability.

This paper introduces a refinement of the classical sense-plan-act objective maximization method for setting agent goals, a real-time randomized path planner, a bounded acceleration motion control system, and a randomized velocity-space search for collision avoidance of multiple moving robotic agents. We have found this approach to work well for dynamic and unpredictable domains requiring real-time response and flexible coordination of multiple agents. First, the approach employs randomized search for objective maximization and motion planning, allowing real-time or any-time performance. Next, a novel cooperative safety algorithm is employed which respects agent dynamics limitations while also preventing collisions with static obstacles or other participating agents. An implementation of our multilayer approach has been tested and validated on real robots, forming the basis for an autonomous robotic soccer team

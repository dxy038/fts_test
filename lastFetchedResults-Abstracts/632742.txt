Background and Objective: Reduced blood flow due to obstruction is in most cases a primary factor in pressure ulcer formation and creation of bedsores. The aim of this study is to design and manufacture a care system for tissue under pressure, based on variations in blood flow at different depths of tissue. Materials and Methods: In the manufacture of the system two infrared light transmitters and receivers were located between 5 and 10 mm depth to measure the flow of blood at different in the under? pressure heel tissue. In addition, blood flow was evaluated in an unloaded and loaded condition, with 30 mmHg and 60.0 mmHg. Results: A total of 15 people participated with a mean age of 50. Of these 15; 9 (60%) were men and 6 (40%) were women. Primary measurement results showed different individual differences in variation of blood flow in the tissue. To study signal amplitude changes significantly influenced by external pressure the PPG, P?value was measured. It was noted that there were significant changes in PPG signal amplitude during loading both pressures of 30 and 60 mmHg. Conclusions: Further development of this system would be possible with the use of a more flexible probe and by using a stronger optical receiver and transmitter to access more depth.

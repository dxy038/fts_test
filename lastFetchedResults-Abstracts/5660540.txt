The university curriculum arrangement system, which includes teachers, classrooms, class, curriculum, time and many other factors, is both complex and key link in the universities educational management. The essence of the class arrangement system is that courses, teachers and students in the right time assign in the suitable classroom, which is a multi-objective scheduling, and complicated the combinatorial optimization problem involved many factors. In order to make sure that the course of classes can be arranged in the right time and right place, the university curriculum arrangement system is designed based on the genetic algorithm in this paper. The design scheme is presented in detail. It shows by practice that the genetic algorithm, which is of intelligence of search process, parallelism, and easy operation, could solve the class arrangement system effectively.

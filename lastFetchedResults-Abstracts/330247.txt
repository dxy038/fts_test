Objective.
Mercury vapor release from amalgams during setting significantly decreases when the amalgams are prepared with binary Hg-In liquid alloys. The objective of this study was to compare the cytotoxicity of amalgams made with experimental Hg-In alloys with that of amalgam without In and a commercial In-containing amalgam.
Methods.

Amalgam specimens were prepared by triturating a high-Cu alloy powder (Tytin, Kerr) with pure Hg or Hg-In liquid alloy containing 5, 20 or 50% In and also by triturating an In-containing high-copper alloy powder (Indiloy, Shofu) with pure Hg. After the specimens were aged for 2 wk, a cylindrical specimen of each amalgam was immersed consecutively in cell culture medium for 0–8, 8–48 and 48–72 h. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was determined by placing them in contact with Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts for 24 h, after which the succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was measured and expressed as a percentage of the Teflon negative controls. The results were statistically compared using ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05). The concentration of elements released into the extracts was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis and non-parametric multiple comparisons.
Results.

For the 0–8 h and 8–48 h intervals, the 20% In amalgam was significantly (p < 0.05) less toxic than the other amalgams, and not different from the Teflon control. Results for the other amalgams were only slightly depressed compared to the Teflon control. For the 48–72 h interval, all amalgams were essentially no different from the control. Copper was the element dominantly released into the medium from all the amalgams tested.
Significance.

For amalgam tested after aging, alloying indium to mercury did not deleteriously affect the cytotoxicity of the resultant amalgam compared to the amalgam without indium.

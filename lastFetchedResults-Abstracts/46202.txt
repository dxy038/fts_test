In this paper the authors consider a histological muscular component from the point of view of systems theory. Of the smooth and striated types of muscular fibres, the latter have a structural component that permits them to contract. Unlike the visceral striated and cardiac fibres, movements in the skeletal striated fibres are predominantly voluntary. An overlapping of certain fibre components—specifically a sliding movement of the filaments of which the fibre is composed—causes a variation in the overall size of the fibre and therefore of the muscle. The distances covered, whether in contraction or lengthening, vary according to the type of fibre from 1.8 to 3.8 (mu)m, but depend only on the capacity of some filaments to slide over other filaments, with filament size itself remaining unchanged. Our objective is to obtain a metric of this system that will permit us to obtain some idea of the degree of variation in these distances. In future projects it will be possible to extend this theory to other involuntary muscular tissue movements (myocardial tissue, e.g.), in an endeavour to develop a mathematical approach to the study of myocardial processes damaged by electrical conduction problems.

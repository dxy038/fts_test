The objective of this study is to investigate environmental contamination derived from metalliferous mining activities. In the study area, the Dalsung Cu–W mine, soils, various crop plants, stream waters, sediments and particulates were sampled in and around the mine and analyzed for As, Sb and Bi by ICP-AES with a hydride generator. In addition, soil pH, cation exchange capacity, loss-on-ignition and soil texture were also measured. Concentrations of As, Sb and Bi in surface soils sampled in the mine dump sites averaged 2500, 54 and 436 μg g−1, respectively. Relatively lower concentrations, however, were found in soils from alluvial and high land sites and household garden sites. Arsenic, Sb and Bi contents in plant samples varied depending upon their species and parts, with higher concentrations in spring onions, soybean leaves and perilla leaves and lower levels in red peppers, corn grains and jujube grains. These results confirm that elemental concentrations in plant leaves are much higher than those in plant grain. Elevated levels of As, Sb and Bi were also found in stream sediments sampled in the vicinity of the mine and decreased with distance from the mine. Concentrations in stream water samples ranged from 0.8 to 19.1 μg As l−1 and from 0.3 to 8.4 μg Bi l−1; all the samples contained less than 1.0 μg Sb l−1. Because of very low particulate loading at the time of sampling, the metal contents in particulates were very low (<8.2 μg As l−1,<0.22 μg Sb l−1 and 2.8 μg Bi l−1. This may be mainly due to the low solubility of those elements under moderately acidic and oxidizing conditions of the mining area.

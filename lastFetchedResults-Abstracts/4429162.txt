Web service composition (WSC) has become core service-oriented computing technology. It is important for business process to construct a complex one with multi-dimensional QoS assurance. But there exist some problems, such as evaluation for QoS properties of service is not full-scale and the criteria is not clear, the weight for each QoS metric doesnÂ´t consider both subjective sensations and objective facts. In this paper we propose a model to provide multi-dimensional QoS support in service selection and replacement. We define a utility function as the evaluation standard, which aggregates all QoS metrics after normalizing their values. Then we use subjective-objective weight mode (SOWM) to set the weight of each QoS metric. Also we propose a heuristic algorithm on the multi-choice, Multi-dimension 0-1 knapsack problem (MMKP) using the rule-library. Finally we test the efficiency of the algorithm and the results prove it is predominant compared with other algorithms.

At present, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mine countermeasure (MCM) surveys are pre-planned by operators using ladder or zig-zag paths. Such surveys are often conducted with side-looking sonar sensors whose performance is dependant on a number of environment factors, as well as lateral range from the AUV track. This research presents a sensor driven online approach to seabed coverage for MCM. A method is presented where paths are planned adaptively using a multi-objective optimization. Information theory is combined with a new concept coined branch entropy based on a hexagonal cell decomposition. The result is a planning algorithm that often produces shorter paths than conventional means and is also capable of accounting for environmental factors detected in situ. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and in water trials conducted on the IVER2 AUV show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

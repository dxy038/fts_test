In this paper, a new method is proposed for the continuation power flow in power systems. The objective of the continuation power flow is to draw PV curves through tracing the power flow solution for the change of loads. The use of P V curves is useful for monitoring static voltage instability problems in a way that the margin to the bifurcation point is evaluated quantitatively. This paper proposes a preconditioned continuation power flow method with linear and nonlinear predictors to reduce the computational effort. The proposed method is based on a preconditioned iterative method for solving a set of linear equations in the Newton-Raphson (N-R) method. This paper makes use of the ILU(p) as the preconditioner and generalized minimum residual (GMRES) method as the iterative method. The proposed method is successfully applied to the IEEE 118-node system.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of upper vaginectomy for the treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN).
Study design
We conducted a retrospective review. Between August 1, 1985 and April 30, 2004, 105 patients were identified who had undergone upper vaginectomy for VAIN.
Results
Thirty-six patients had previously been treated for VAIN. Mean operative time and estimated blood loss were 55 minutes and 113 mL, respectively. Ten percent had intraoperative complications. Twenty-three (22%) patients had negative findings on final pathologic examination, and invasive cancer was found in 13 (12%) patients. Four patients had postoperative complications. Follow-up was available in 52 patients; 46 (88%) remain without recurrence at a mean follow-up of 25 months.
Conclusion
In our patients, upper vaginectomy was efficacious for the treatment of VAIN. The procedure led to the diagnosis of occult invasive cancer in 12% of these women.

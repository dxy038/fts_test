Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is the therapy of choice for selected patients suffering from drug-refractory congestive heart failure and presenting an interventricular desynchronization. CRT is delivered by an implantable biventricular pacemaker, which stimulates the right atrium and both ventricles at specific timings. The optimization and personalization of this therapy requires to quantify both the electrical and the mechanical cardiac functions during the intraoperative and postoperative phases. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of the calculation of features extracted from endocardial acceleration (EA) signals and the potential utility of these features for the intraoperative optimization of CRT. Endocardial intraoperative data from one patient are analyzed for 33 different pacing configurations, including changes in the atrio-ventricular and inter-ventricular delays and different ventricular stimulation sites. The main EA features are extracted for each pacing configuration and analyzed so as to estimate the intra-configuration and inter-configuration variability. Results show the feasibility of the proposed approach and suggest the potential utility of EA for intraoperative monitoring of the cardiac function and defining optimal, adaptive pacing configurations.

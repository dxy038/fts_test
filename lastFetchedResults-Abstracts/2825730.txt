The paper presents UNICOM, a project based on HLA (High Level Architecture) that aims at providing: (i) flexible communication services to the entities populating a Moon base simulated scenario and (ii) a real-time 3D visualization of this scenario by connecting the MA&#776;K RTI (Run Time Infrastructure) and Unity 3D. UNICOM has been developed in the context of the 2014 edition of the Simulation Exploration Experience (SEE), an event organized by the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO), in collaboration with NASA and other research and industrial partners, with the objective to promote the adoption of the HLA standard and compliant tools by involving university teams in the distributed simulation of a Moon base. The paper aims also to share the experience of the University of Calabria Team in participating to the SEE initiative so to encourage and guide the participation of new teams to the next editions of this exciting event.

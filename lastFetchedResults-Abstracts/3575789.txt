Theoretical and experimental evaluation of the objective signal-to-noise performance of component video signals is described. Using a mathematical model, an expression for the component video-signal-to-noise ratio, called the display-signal-to-noise-ratio (DSNR), is derived for Gaussian white noise input. Using this model the signal-to-noise performance of 100% saturated primary and secondary colors are analyzed for a PAL-I video system. In order to verify the theoretical results, an electronic color video circuit was implemented. Using this simulator, objective noise impairments in 100% saturated primary and secondary colors have been determined

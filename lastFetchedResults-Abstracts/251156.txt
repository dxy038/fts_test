We study the ‘classical’ topology optimization problem, in which minimum compliance is sought, subject
to linear constraints. Using a dual statement, we propose two separable and strictly convex subproblems
for use in sequential approximate optimization (SAO) algorithms.
Respectively, the subproblems use reciprocal and exponential intermediate variables in approximating
the non-linear compliance objective function. Any number of linear constraints (or linearly approximated
constraints) are provided for. The relationships between the primal variables and the dual variables are
found in analytical form.
For the special case when only a single linear constraint on volume is present, we note that application
of the ever-popular optimality criterion (OC) method to the topology optimization problem, combined
with arbitrary values for the heuristic numerical damping factor   proposed by Bendsøe, results in an
updating scheme for the design variables that is identical to the application of a rudimentary dual SAO
algorithm, in which the subproblems are based on exponential intermediate variables. What is more, we
show that the popular choice for the damping factor  =0.5 is identical to the use of SAO with reciprocal
intervening variables.
Finally, computational experiments reveal that subproblems based on exponential intervening variables
result in improved efficiency and accuracy, when compared to SAO subproblems based on reciprocal
intermediate variables (and hence, the heuristic topology OC method hitherto used). This is attributed
to the fact that a different exponent is computed for each design variable in the two-point exponential
approximation we have used, using gradient information at the previously visited point. Copyright q 2007

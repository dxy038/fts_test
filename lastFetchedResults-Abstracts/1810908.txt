Background
esent cross-sectional study was carried out among 136 quartz stone grinders with the objective of studying the peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the associated epidemiological factors.
s
iew technique was used to record demographic characteristics and occupational history on a predesigned proforma, which included questionnaires regarding demographic, occupational and clinical characteristics. This was followed by complete medical examination and measurement of PEF using Spirovit SP-10. The study included 75 (55.1%) male and 61 (44.9%) female silica-exposed workers. The mean age of the subjects was 31.77 ± 9.99 years whereas the mean duration of exposure was 2.74 ± 1.65 years. The mean PEF was found to be 5.16 ± 2.1 L/min.
s
 present study the PEF was significantly reduced in those having respiratory morbidity on both unadjusted and adjusted analyses.
sions
uggests that along with the restrictive pathology caused by free silica dust, obstructive changes are also encountered in silica-exposed workers.

The objective of this study was to evaluate duodenocecostomy in horses performed through a ventral midline laparotomy and report its influence on body weight, glucose absorption, serum components, and characteristics of jejunum, cecum, and large colon histology. Four horses were submitted to the duodenocecostomy technique through a ventral midline laparotomy with animals in dorsal recumbency under inhalation anesthesia, followed by abdominal exploration. A side-to-side anastomosis was performed between the duodenojejunal flexure and the base of the cecum with two simple continuous suture lines of the serosal and muscular layers. The size of the opening created was approximately 2 cm in diameter. The mucosa layer was not sutured. After 30 days, animals were submitted to a second laparotomy to check the patency of the duodenocaecal fistula. During both laparotomy procedures, excisional biopsies of different segments of the gastrointestinal tract were performed. Information on physical examination findings, results of hematologic and histopathologic evaluations, and oral glucose absorption test were recorded. The horses did not have significant weight loss from baseline, and absorption curve of glucose did not significantly vary from baseline. Only triglycerides had significant alterations. Histologic evaluation of jejunum, cecum, and large colon did not show alterations of intestinal structure and morphology. We concluded that the proposed technique, principally in relation to the fistula size and not suturing the mucosa layer, allowed partial or total occlusion of the fistulae without the necessity of a second surgery and avoided the permanent bypass of ingesta and weight loss.

A compositional method for hierarchical fuzzy control over the user-defined set of initial conditions is presented. The control system is found by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The inverted pendulum system is selected as an example of a dynamical system and used to test the proposed method. The pre-defined set of initial conditions includes dynamical and static conditions of the system. Control system is designed as a three-layered hierarchical fuzzy logic structure. The test results showed that the proposed method has a relatively high success rate in terms of the number of initial conditions from which the system is controlled to TR. The best achieved result was 94.5% success rate. The proposed compositional method can be applied to a wide range of dynamical systems.

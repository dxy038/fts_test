Objective(s):To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the contributions of GST genetic variants to the risk of diabetic retinopathy in an Iranian population. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether sequence variation in glutathione S-transferase gene (GSTM1 and GSTT1) is associated with development of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) Iranian patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 605 subjects were investigated in this case-control study; Study groups consisted of 201 patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR), 203 subjects with no clinically significant signs of DR and a group of 201 cases of healthy volunteers with no clinical evidence of diabetes mellitus or any other diseases. The GSTM1 and GSTT1 were genotyped by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (multiplex-PCR) analysis in all 404 T2DM patients and 201 healthy individuals served as control. Results: Increased odds ratio showed that GSTM1-null genotype had a moderately higher occurrence in T2DM patients (OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.01â€“2.04; P=0.03) than in healthy individuals. However, the frequency of GSTT1 genotype (OR=1.41; 95% CI=0.92-2.18; P=0.09) was not significantly different comparing both groups. Although, regression analysis in T2DM patients showed that GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes are not associated with T2DM retinopathy development. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes might not be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus retinopathy in the Southern Iranian population. However, further investigations are needed to confirm these results in other larger populations.

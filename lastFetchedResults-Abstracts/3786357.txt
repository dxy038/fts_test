This paper describes the development of a computerized Thermal Performance Diagnostics Expert System (TPDES) designed to assist performance engineers at nuclear power plant. The TPDES is the second phase product of the ChinShan plant performance Monitoring, Analysis and Diagnostics Expert System (CS-MADES) project. The objective of this system is to serve as a powerful tool in diagnosing the heat rate degradation problems found in nuclear power plant through man-machine intercommunications. The whole system framework was developed on a personal computer to provide an integrated, user-friendly and menu-driven environment in meeting the operatorÂ´s requirements. Moreover, it can be actuated either in Chinese or English mode. Some visible benefits have been gained so far through the prototype system installed at the Chinshan nuclear power station. It is believed that TPDES could successfully reduce lost megawatts and save maintenance cost through the early detection of thermal performance deviations

Forty-five children who underwent distal hypospadias surgery were assigned to group one (n=23) received caudal bupivacaine (0.25%) 0.5 mg kg-1 and midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1 before the surgical incision, and group two (n=22) who received caudal bupivacaine (0.25%) 0.5 mg kg-1 and midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1, after the surgi¬cal incision. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl and maintained with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide. Postopera¬tive pain was rated on objective pediatric pain scale. Analgesic requirement was higher in the second group.

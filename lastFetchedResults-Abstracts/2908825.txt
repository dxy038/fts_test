Finding the correlation among Quality of Experience (QoE) for video, measured Quality of Service (QoS) parameters in the network, and objective video performance metrics is a challenging task. This paper provides some analysis results on this issue. Our motivation is that streaming media content gets dominant position in the global traffic mix within the next few years. With the evolution of personal devices, demand for High Definition (HD) resolution contents is dynamically increasing. Traversing real-time media across public packet-switched networks is a complex task, especially if quality of service should be sustained. The issue gets more complicated when the traffic is forwarded through heterogeneous infrastructures. Media content with various resolutions and bit rates show different sensitivity to transmission anomalies. Our paper investigates the correlation between subjective quality assessment (i.e., Mean Opinion Score, MOS evaluation), measured QoS parameters (packet loss, jitter) and objective video performance metrics (Video Quality Metric - VQM, Structural Similarity - SSIM, Peak Signal Noise Ratio - PSNR) in the context of real-time HD video streaming (i.e., IPTV and MobileTV). In twelve scenarios, packet-level perturbations were emulated in our laboratory testbed during the transmission of short video sequences with three different resolutions (480p, 720p and 1080p). Later the videos were evaluated using subjective and objective assessment methods.

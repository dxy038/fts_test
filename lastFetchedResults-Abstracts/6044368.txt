Fuzzy logic control (FLC) has been successfully used in many applications. The design of a FLC has mostly relied on an expert or used ad hoc techniques. For this reason the robustness of FLC has only been shown via testing or simulation. Recently, work developed at Tennessee Technological University (TTU) proved that it is possible to design a FLC that guarantees the system robustness to parameter uncertainties. In addition, this design is systematic and does not require an expert. Instead, it uses available information contained in the system model and interprets the uncertainties in the system as a source of fuzziness. The objective of the paper is to implement this new design methodology to provide real time control and use it to control one joint of an IBM 7540 robot arm. Experimental results of the performance of this controller are presented

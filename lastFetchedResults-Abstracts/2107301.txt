Objective(s):P In vitro chemosensitivity and resistance assays (CSRAs) are a promising tool for personalized treatment of glioblastoma multiform (GBM). These assays require a minimum of 1 to 2 g of tumor specimen for testing, but this amount is not always accessible. We aimed to assess the feasibility and validity of utilizing stereotactic biopsies of GBM in CSRAs. Materials and Methods: Single cell suspension was prepared from 1 g weight explants of the established xenograft tumor of GBM. Also, primary culture was carried out on 35 mg weight specimens, as a surrogate for stereotactic biopsies. Then, chemoresponse profile of cells obtained by direct cell disaggregation and primary culture was determined using temozolomide and carmustine by clonogenic assay[AGA1]Â . Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the cytotoxicity of temozolomide and carmustine between cells obtained from both methods. Conclusion: This work supports the feasibility of using stereotactic biopsies of GBM in CSRAs.

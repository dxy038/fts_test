Summary form only given, as follows. Simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) capability is enabled by the recent development of a transmit-isolating photonic receive (TIPRx) link that functions both as the first-stage LNA in the receive front end and as an RF circulator, enabling a bidirectional interface to an antenna while isolating the receive chain from the transmit signal by 40 dB over bandwidths spanning multiple decades. This paper describes the TIPRx and issues involved in implementing a single-aperture STAR system.

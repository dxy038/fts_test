An approach is proposed which improves the quality and speed of manual loop shaping. Loop shaping is an iterative and creative controller design procedure where the control engineer uses frequency response function (FRF) data of the plant to shape the open loop response such that it satisfies stability, performance and robustness specifications. The advantage compared to automated controller design methods is that the control engineer can exploit all available a priori knowledge and expertise about the plant during the design process. As an assisting tool in manual loop shaping, we add a global optimization method, i.e. a genetic algorithm, where the objective function resembles as good as possible what the control engineer wants. As a result, the tuning process is substantially accelerated. The approach has been implemented in a Matlab-based control tuning tool showing good results

To improve the shift quality of the automatic transmission (AT). The oil pressure changing rule need be researched deeply, which was done in this paper by modeling and simulating using ITI-SimulationX software. This paper completed the optimized design of clutch by using the fuzzy theory and main objective method with optimization toolbox of MATLAB. The wet multi-plate clutch is commonly used. According to clutch design formula, the optimal design mathematic model was set by choosing average energy loss in sliding friction surface at the end time of bonding, the max power loss per area as the optimized object, and turning clutch torque capacity calculated as a whole into a constraint condition. Also the dynamics implementation simulation model with multi-disciplinary dynamic simulation software platform SimulationX was set. Through this model, the changes of the relative thermal index could be truly reflected after optimized, and the operation characters of clutch were heightened.

In this paper, a prototype of a multifunctional bidirectional three-phase voltage-source zero voltage soft-switching converter with a single resonant DC busline linked snubber (RDCS) or three bridge arm linked auxiliary active resonant commutation snubbers (ARCS) is presented for battery and/or electric double layer capacitor energy storage systems (BESS). The operating principle of the active resonant snubber-assisted soft-switching converter circuit and digitally controlled multifunctional converter system including active rectifier and inverter operation modes are described and evaluated herein for BESS. The effectiveness of the soft-switching bidirectional converter system is proved on the basis of simulation analysis

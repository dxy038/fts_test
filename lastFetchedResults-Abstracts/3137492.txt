This paper considers a supplier-retailer chain problem, in which the retailer knows the distribution of the demand, while the supplier only knows the distribution interval of the demand. The supplierÂ´s objective is to optimize his competitive ratio. We find that the retailer orders more if he faces stronger market, and bears less overage risk than in the classical newsvendor problem.

Objective(s): Electrical inhomogeneity between ischemic and non ischemic myocardium is the basis of arrhythmia which occurs following coronary artery occlusion. The leakage of potassium from the ischemic region to the non ischemic region is very effective in the generation of these arrhythmias. The aim of this study is to research the effect of ATP-dependent potassium (KATP) channel blocker (glibenclamide) and opener (pinacidil) on ischemia induced arrhythmia in the presence of small and large infarct sizes. Materials and Methods: In this study Sprague-Dawley male rats of 8-9 months of age were used. Ischemia was produced by the partial ligation of left coronary artery ramus descending (PL) for smaller infarct and complete ligation of this artery (CL) for larger infarct for 30 min. The arrhythmia score which was calculated from the duration and type of arrhythmia was significantly higher in animals which had a larger infarct area than the animals which had a smaller infarct. Results: Glibenclamide increased the rate of arrhythmia in animals having smaller infarct but not in animals having larger infarct. Pinacidil did not affect the occurrence of arrhythmia in either group. There was a significant difference in the infarct size and risk of infarct zone between animals which had small and large infarct sizes. The effect of glibenclamide and pinacidil on the arrhythmias differed depend on decrease of infarct size. Conclusion: Glibenclamide is not effective to decrease ischemia induced arrhythmia in the presence of small and pinacidil in large ischemic zone.

This paper presents a method to determine material of an unknown sample object. The main objective of this study is to design a database for specifying material of an object. We produce the database for different materials which is subjected to different forces. For this purpose we use a polyvinidilene fluoride (PVDF) sensor which is a piezoelectric material. Also we study the effect of changing place of sensor on our study. The detailed design was performed using finite element method analysis. Furthermore, if we have an object which we do not know its material by use of this database we can find out what this object is and how much its YanoungÂ´s modules is. This study will be suitable for medical purposes especially minimally invasive surgery.

The main objective of this paper is to analyze the design of existing charging systems in electric cars and the incorporation of a newly developed alternative system for charging the batteries. Currently, the major problem faced by electric cars is the limited travel range and the extent of time required in fully charging the batteries. In this proposal, the alternative charging system can be an in-built system of the electric car for charging the batteries at the time of running. This system can act as a dual system of which the batteries can be charged using an AC power supply source while the car is at rest mode and can be charged by using the power supply reclaimed from the motors fixed on the shaft of the car.

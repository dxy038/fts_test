Objective: To report on a case of post-denervation muscle hypertrophy in an unusual distribution. Case report: A 52-year-old patient with severe flaccid paraparesis after polio developed unilateral C-6 radiculopathy that resolved with conservative treatment. Within 2 years marked hypertrophy, stiffness and pain in the muscles in the affected myotome developed. EMG discovered abundant complex repetitive discharges (CRD) within hypertrophic muscles. On biopsy, true hypertrophy of muscle fibers and some group atrophy was found. Steroid treatment relieved the symptoms and significantly suppressed the CRD. The possible causative role of CRD for hypertrophy in partially denervated muscle is discussed.

This article looks at the role that photonics, particularly microwave photonics, can play in realizing 5G networks. We first focus on several general disruptive technologies needed for 5G cellular networks, such as small-cell architectures, utilization of the millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, and the implementation of massive multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems at mobile base stations. We then consider the extent to which microwave photonic techniques and technologies may contribute to achieving these disruptive technologies and therefore the ultimate goals of a 5G network. Our objective here is to open discussions about the optimal technologies for the implementing 5G networks and to determine whether their goals are achievable in the near future.

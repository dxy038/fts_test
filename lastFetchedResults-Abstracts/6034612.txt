This paper describes the research work on the selection of a strategy of measurements for a receiving system. The approach is based on the feedback interconnection between two dynamical systems. First, a state estimator where the observation equation is a nonlinear map between the state variables of the target and the receiving system. This mapping depends on some external variables and on the relative position of the sensors with respect to the target. Second, a controller of the receiving system with the objective of minimizing some functions of the covariance of the state estimation error. A detailed description of this active estimator is presented in the case of a receding horizon observation interval

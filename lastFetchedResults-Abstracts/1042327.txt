Nucleate pool boiling analyses were performed using experimental results previously obtained at sub-atmospheric pressure and analytical results formerly proposed by the authors of this paper. The main objective was to reveal the differences between bubble growth behavior at atmospheric pressure and sub-atmospheric pressure. A secondary objective was to show the effect of the system pressure on bubble growth behavior. Experimental data were correlated using the non-dimensional characteristic radius and time scale parameters proposed in a previous study. The growth behavior at sub-atmospheric pressure was noticeably different from that at atmospheric pressure during saturated nucleate pool boiling.

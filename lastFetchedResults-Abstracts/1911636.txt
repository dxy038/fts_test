Renal cell carcinoma therapy has changed in a very significant way in the last few years. Up to 5 new agents have been developed, improving the results previously achieved with cytokine therapy. Bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, and everolimus are now part of the therapeutic arsenal for this illness. Particularly, this has been the first tumoral type in which inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has proved its efficacy in phase III trials, either as first-line therapy for poor prognosis patients (temsirolimus, CCI-779) or as second-line therapy after failure of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (everolimus, RAD001). In this paper, we review the basis for mTOR inhibition in RCC, and discuss the results of the trials involving temsirolimus and everolimus for the treatment of this disease.

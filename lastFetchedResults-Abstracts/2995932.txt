An analysis of propagation of SPORT antennas placed over the International Space Station (ISS) is presented. This analysis has been done using GTD/UTD techniques, and the main objective is to study the effect that the rotation of the panels of the station has over the radiation pattern. An analysis of the coupling between pairs of antennas on board of the station and an study the cross-polar component also has been done.

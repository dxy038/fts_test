This is a study report promoting reuse of mass produced electronics devices by introducing reciprocity between nodes of the industrial value chain. Where resource potentials are raised among the value chain and increase their values each other with smooth bidirectional sending of devices to be reused. And reciprocal electro-mechanical schemes to reuse printed circuit board is discussed in order for the bidirectional mass-manufacturing industry to be successful. Schemes of replacing deteriorated and out-of-dated parts and function blocks are discussed also on necessary parts information and on relating rights aspect. Case studies are of lighting devices and home power controllers.

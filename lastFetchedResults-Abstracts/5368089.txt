The objective of this paper is to investigate and confirm the critical success factors for e-business implementation from the e-business process perspective. We develop a critical success factors (CSFs) framework which is composed of six constructs. It is applied to investigate and confirm the CSFs in three traditional e-business processes (e-procurement, e-ordering and CRM). From a survey of 34 enterprises practicing e-business processes, we use weighted factor analysis and fuzzy integrated judgment to study the impact of six constructs on three types of e-business processes and to identify the critical success factors in each process. This research provides a scientific basis for implementing e-business strategies to improve and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of e-procuring and e-ordering, and strengthen customer relationship management.

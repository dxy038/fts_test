Power system nodal voltage regulation based on the direct self-tuning pole-assignment approach is proposed. Firstly the power system model is re-parameterized so that the regulated nodal voltage is expressed by a recursive equation in which aggregate parameters function of the unknown coefficients of the regulator polynomials appear. Afterwards, a constrained recursive least-squares (CRLS) algorithm with variable forgetting factor is adopted to estimate at each step the vector of the aggregate parameters. The final phase has the objective to determine the regulator polynomials starting from the estimated vector. The results of a numerical simulation are finally reported to show the applicability of the proposed design

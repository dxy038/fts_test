
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is often accompanied by lipid abnormalities, which contributes significantly to cardiovascular (CV) complications, morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of methanol extract of Teucrium orientale on the serum levels of glucose and lipids in streptozotocin diabetic rats. 
METHODS: In this research 32 male albino rats, with body weights of 200- 240 g were randomly allocated into four groups: [control group (without streptozotocin (STZ) and extract treatment), diabetic group (STZ injected, extract untreated), health treated group (extract treated) and diabetic treated group (STZ injected, extract treated) with 8 rats per group. Methanol extracts were administered at a dose of 200 mg kg-1 by gavage over a 21-day period. Afterwards, the serum levels of glucose and lipids were evaluated. 
FINDINGS: The results indicate that the administration of T. orientale resulted in a significant decrease in serum triglycerides in diabetic treated group (81±7.28) compared to the diabetic control group (93± 6.05), was significantly decreased (p < 0.01). Significant reduction in serum triglycerides, non-treated diabetic group (38.25±6.54) compared to non-diabetic control group (56.25±6.54) was observed (p < 0.05). There was also significant decrease in serum levels of glucose (p < 0.01), cholesterol (p < 0.05), and LDL (p < 0.05) and significant increase in serum level of HDL (p < 0.05) comparison with diabetic group.
CONCLUSION: These results show that oral administration of T. orientale with STZ-induced diabetes (STZ-groups), a marked hypoglycemic effect was seen in treated diabetic rats. Feeding animals with T. orientale leads to appropriate changes in blood lipid profiles.

Applying a novel non-dominated sorting differential evolutionary algorithm (NSDEA) procedure to a DC power flow based multi-objective transmission expansion planning (MOTEP) model, this paper aims to develop a Reference Grid Performance Assessment Model that can be used as a benchmark when evaluating investment proposals for the transmission upgrade. Investment cost, line rental cost and amount of load curtailment are considered in the optimization as the three objective prerequisites. In addition, the static MOTEP problem has been investigated in both green field and expansion planning problem with and without generation rescheduling considerations. The proposed model was applied to a realistic 46-bus South Brazilian system. Simulation results show the accuracy, outstanding convergence performance in finding the optimal solution, simple implementation as well as satisfactory computation time of the proposed solution technique.

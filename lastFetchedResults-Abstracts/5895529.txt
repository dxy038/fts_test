This paper first reviews the operation of a multi-source, multi-storage tank water supply system. A new method for scheduling electric pumps in such a system using a genetic algorithm (GA) approach is then developed. The objective of the scheduling problem is to ensure that the volume of water required by the water distribution system is adequately provided by the pumps in the system whilst minimising the cost incurred in the use of electrical power by the pump motors in the system. The algorithm takes into account the characteristic curves, the efficiency curves and the flow limits of pumps in the system and the system characteristic curves. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by an application example

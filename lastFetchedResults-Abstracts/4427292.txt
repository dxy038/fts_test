Performance evaluation of multiple-bus multiprocessor systems is usually carried out under the assumption of uniform memory reference model. The objective of this paper is to study the performance of multiple bus multiprocessor system in the presence of hot spots. Analytical expressions for the average memory bandwidth and probability of acceptance of prioritized processors have been derived. Two new phenomenon, coined as bumping and knee effect, have been observed in the acceptance probabilities of the processors. The results are validated by simulation results

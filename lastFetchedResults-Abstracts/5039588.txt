A competitive implementation of customer relationship management (CRM) in retail banking requires business processes aligned to the value contribution. The objective of this paper is to derive a reference process on macro-level from industry best practice and validate its applicability in a survey. Furthermore, we introduce a new method for evaluating existing business process implementations with respect to the business value, as measured by the value of the customer base as relevant overall key performance measure. Comparing the individual company process and the reference process, in-house and external experts can evaluate the gaps by using the decision calculus method. This allows a clear recommendation on the prioritization of potential process modifications and quantifies their effect in terms of business value.

The heavy metals pollution is a big problem for the large parts of the world.  Lead is a heavy metal with high toxicity that Inhibition of germination and retardation of plant growth are commonly observed due to it toxicity. The very important role of salicylic acid (SA) in response to different stress and modification and decline damages due to stress has established in different studies. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of different concentration of salicylic acid on enhancement characteristics of  Brassica napus L. cv. Opera under lead stress. The experimental design was factorial arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replications. Treatments were combination of 7 levels application of  Lead, separately (0, 0.25,0.5, 0.75 ,1 , 1.5 & 2  mM) and 2 concentrations of salicylic acid (5 & 10 ?M). The results revealed that increase of lead concentrations, reduced root and shoot length, leaf area, root and shoot dry weight, root and shoot fresh weight and application of salicylic acid significantly increased studied traits(p < 0.01), but on shoot dry weight was not significantly effect (p < 0.05). Generally salicylic acid applications improved plant growth parameters of Brassica napus L.

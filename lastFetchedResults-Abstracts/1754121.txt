Malaria is well known in Georgia since ancient times, causing national disasters with associated significant mortality and economic losses. By 1970 Georgia managed to reach complete and sustained elimination of the disease as a result of comprehensive anti-malaria measures undertaken in the country. However from the mid-1990s, economic collapse following disintegration of Soviet Union causing breakdown of important public health networks including anti-malaria preventive and control infrastructure resulted in gradual increase of malaria cases in the country with a peak of 437 and 474 cases in 2001 and 2002, respectively. From 2000 two major anti-malaria efforts were carried out by National Center for Disease Control and Public Health, WHO and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and as result of comprehensive and collaborative work in 2010 the level of zero cases of local mosquito-borne malaria transmission was achieved and the country entered the elimination phase.

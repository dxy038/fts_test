Dynamic frothability index (DFI) is a characteristic of any frother, which presents useful information about the frothing properties. The objective of this study is to introduce a prediction model for estimating the DFI values for the ‌‌‌‌‌dual-frother blends. The proposed model uses the DFI values for the frothers and the mole ratio for the weaker frother to calculate the DFI values for the blends. Frothing properties of a number of solutions were measured using a pneumatic column froth-meter, and were described in terms of the froth retention time and DFI values. The model reliability was confirmed by comparing the experimental and predicted DFI values for different frother blends including n-butanol/methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), ethanol/MIBC, iso-amyl alcohol/MIBC, and poly propylene glycol (PPG)-250/MIBC, with high determination coefficients ( >  95%). A reference chart was also proposed for a rapid estimation of the DFI value for a frother mixture.

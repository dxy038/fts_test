The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of peanut husk (Arachis hypogaea L.) as a fiber–peanut mixture to produce fiberboards for general purposes. For panel production, the addition of peanut husk at various percentages to the wood fiber was the only variable. Panels produced utilizing peanut husk were compared to panels produced using 100% wood fiber. The chemical properties of peanut husk; holocellulose and lignin content, alcohol–benzene, hot and cold water, and dilute alkali (1% NaOH) solubility, were also determined. Results indicated that panels could be produced utilizing up to 30% peanut husk without affecting the usability of the panels. It was not possible to meet the minimum IB strength standards when peanut husk was added to the mixture. Higher additions resulted in panels having lower elastic and rupture moduli than the minimum requirements according to TS-EN standards.

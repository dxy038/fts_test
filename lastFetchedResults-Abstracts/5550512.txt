Power sector deregulation and its impact on power systems performance is investigated. The introduction of distributed generation in networks by independent power producers (IPPs) is bound to have a significant effect on network losses, voltage profile and loading limits. Earlier studies showed that the contribution to network losses by additional generating sources depends on the location of the generator. This paper presents an optimisation model to achieve loss minimization through constrained power flows and optimal siting of distributed generators in a multi-bus distribution network. The main objective is to minimize the line losses subject to generation revenue, transmission constraints (P, Q, V) and consumer demand. Calculated results of technical loss computation and network performance, and those obtained from software simulation are compared and discussed.

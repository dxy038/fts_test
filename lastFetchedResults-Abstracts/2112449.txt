We report on the synthesis and growth of large grain polycrystalline ingots of Ga1−xFexSb (0.0001≤x≤0.0075) for the first time using the vertical Bridgman method. The objective has been to study the feasibility of the growth process for this material and to study the properties of the grown material. XRD studies confirmed the formation of the material and optical absorption studies gave information about the semiconductor bandgap and its variation with iron concentration.

Objective To analyze the vocal tract morphometry of women with vocal nodules (VN) compared with normal subjects by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at rest position. Study Design Prospective study. Methods The present research included 20 young adult women, aged 18â€“40 years: 10 dysphonic patients with VN and 10 normal subjects. All participants were tested using MRI; 12 measurements of the vocal tract were performed: nine in median sagittal section and three in axial section. Results The 12 measurements were smaller in the dysphonic group; statistical significance was obtained for three parameters: in the sagittal plane, the laryngeal vestibule area was significantly smaller in the dysphonic group, with Pآ =آ 0.012âˆ— (âˆ— = statistical significance); in the axial section, the distance between the right and left vocal processes of the arytenoidsâ€™ cartilages and the distance between the anterior commissure of the glottis and the laryngeal posterior wall were also significantly lower in the dysphonic group, with Pآ =آ 0.036âˆ— and 0.010âˆ—, respectively. Significant differences in the vocal tract morphometry of individuals with VN were observed compared with normal subjects, at rest position. Conclusions Results obtained from this study suggest that patients with VN may present a constantly increased tension of the laryngeal muscles, even at rest; moreover, reduced anterior-posterior dimension of the larynx may be a morphological characteristic of patients with VN.

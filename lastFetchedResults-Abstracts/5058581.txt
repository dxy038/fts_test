The concept of FM (like Chirp) pulsed RADARs is associated with several problems. The problem of balancing transmitted Chirp Parameters, in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) imaging, between output image quality and hardware resources is one of the core problems. The objective of this paper is to perform a tradeoff analysis between image quality of synthetic aperture RADAR and the utilized hardware resources on the basis of simulations and calculations performed on different values of transmitted chirp parameters. The paper concludes how to reduce the hardware resources of a particular mission by calculating the optimal image quality considering the smallest object of interest.

The objective of this study was to increase the wear resistance by covering the chisel ploughshare produced from low-alloy steel with three different hard facing electrodes. Comparative wear tests on a regular share and three kinds of hardfacing with electrodes were conducted in the field and laboratory. These three different hardfacing electrodes, which are designated EH-600, EH-350 and EH-14Mn, were used for hardfacing. The wear rate in the laboratory and in field tests was found to be significantly different statistically. When the cost is taken into consideration; EH-600 and EH-350 have been found to be the best hardfacing electrodes.

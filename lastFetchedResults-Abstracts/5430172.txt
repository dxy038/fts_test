In November 1967, the National Data Buoy Development Project was established by the United States Coast Guard. The primary purpose of this organization was to verify and standardize the design and performance of environmental data buoys by establishing an extensive network of sophisticated buoys capable of delivering a wide variety of data, supplemented by smaller buoys of simpler design for special user needs. In 1972, user needs were reevaluated and the program was redirected to be more responsive to these needs. Consequently, the goal of establishing a network of multipurpose buoys was discarded. In January 1973, the project was designated the NOAA Data Buoy Office (NDBO) and was sanctioned by the National Weather Service as a prime user of data. A major NDBO mission is to develop the technology required to gather and report environmental data from marine areas on an accurate, reliable, and synoptic basis. The provisioning of this data would enable improved weather forecasting, including warnings of impending catastrophies. The essential ingredient in meeting the objective involves the deployment of a number of buoys moored in various gulfs and oceans. This paper will review the evolution of sensors, electronics, and communication hardware applicable to NDBO programs. We will also present an overview of our major programs so that buoy technology can be better appreciated in terms of the NDBO missions.

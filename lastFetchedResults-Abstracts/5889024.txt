A joint link scheduling and optimal resource allocation scheme for wireless personal area network based on visible light is proposed. In this paper, the case for combining the PHY and MAC (medium access control) into a single cross-layer platform is performed. Proposed joint scheduling and rate allocation (JSRA) algorithm utilizes the throughput maximization constraint and channel-state information to jointly control the medium access and rate allocation. In the visible light communication (VLC) network, one link´s data rate impacts on its neighbors and this impact decays with distance and field-of-view (FOV) interaction. The objective of JSRA algorithm is that, each link can determine the feasibility of improving its data rate by utilizing the channel´s signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can jointly control the scheduling and rate allocation effectively to increase the total system´s average throughput and spectral efficiency.

Results: Research findings showed that total mean of DREEM score for students was 108.52 out of 200. Students of theoretical courses were more satisfied with learning environments than the training students. This is statistically significant (P=0.003). There was no statistical difference between female and male students. There is a significant relationship between nursing, midwifery and paramedicine(P=0.01).

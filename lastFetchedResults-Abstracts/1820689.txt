Objective
e recently reported that flow rates of whole saliva in young healthy humans correlate positively with salivary gland sizes. The low rate of salivary secretion in xerostomia patients may be related to the small size of the salivary glands. To investigate this possibility, relationships between salivary secretions and salivary gland sizes were investigated in unknown-etiology xerostomia patients and healthy controls.

zes of the three major salivary glands in seven xerostomia patients and seven age- and gender-matched healthy controls who have no previous disease history and prescription medication related to xerostomia, were measured by use of a magnetic resonance imaging technique. The salivary glands of all subjects failed to show any pathological aspects in magnetic resonance images. The flow rates of unstimulated and chewing-stimulated whole saliva were also measured.
s
ates of unstimulated and chewing-stimulated whole saliva and the sizes of the parotid and submandibular glands were significantly lower and smaller in xerostomia patients of unknown etiology when compared with healthy controls. In addition, salivary flow rates per size of the combined three major salivary glands were also significantly lower in the xerostomia patients of unknown etiology.
sions
aller salivary gland size in xerostomia patients of unknown etiology may be one of the causes of the reduced salivary secretion. The secretion rates as a function of gland sizes were also lower, and so it is likely that functional impairments of the salivary gland are also present in patients with xerostomia of unknown etiology.

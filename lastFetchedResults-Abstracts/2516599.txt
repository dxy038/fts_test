Background and Aim: &nbsp;In 1995 the new plan (system) of hospital administration plan/scheme (fee for service) was communicated. According to this plan a proportion (percentage) of the hospital income would be allocated to the hospital staff as a fee for service; the remaining would, after deducting other expenditures, be allocated for the autonomy of the hospital. Based on the plan/scheme, the Supervisory Board will consist of two main committees, namely, the High Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board for the Centers (hospitals). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Supervisory Board in the new system of hospital administration plan in selected teaching hospitals of Esfahan, Iran in 2014.

Materials and Methods: This was a qualitative research. Eleven individuals were selected by targeted sampling and interviewed using semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis method was used to analyze the data.

Result: Based on the thematic analysis results, the main source of weakness in the underlying and structural factors (developing programs and the implementation phase) was the Hospital Administration Supervisory Board in the new system.

Conclusion: It can be concluded that the most notable findings in this study are weaknesses in the underlying and structural factors (developing the program) and weak underlying and structural factors (implementation of the program). The findings will help health policy-makers to develop suitable strategies and a plan of action to minimize weaknesses of the new fee for service scheme/plan.

Power system oscillation is one of the major problems in power system operation. If not damped, these oscillations can grow and decrease transmission capacity of the lines which may cause interruption in energy supply. Several methods for damping of these oscillations are reported in literature. Traditionally, these oscillations have been damped by power system stabilizers. Recently, FACTS devices such as static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), static var compensator (SVC) equipped with a power oscillation damper (POD) have been also efficiently used for damping oscillation. It should be noted that, the main objective of FACTS-controllers is to enhance voltage stability and increase power flow transfer capability the transmission network. This paper proposes application of the residue factor method to obtain the best location for STATCOM and SVC for damping oscillations. The residue factor used is related to the critical oscillatory modes. Also presented in this paper is a comparison of SVC and STATCOM for the enhancement of oscillations damping. IEEE 14-Bus test system was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. From the simulation results it is seen that STATCOM has more ability in damping oscillation when compared to SVC.

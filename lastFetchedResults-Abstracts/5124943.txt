This paper deals with a state of art about the most non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) methods. These methods allow identifying consumption of the electrical loads. In the context of sustainable development, this is of growing interest and rapid evolution subject in recent years. The objective is to manage energy consumption by the determination of the operating schedule of individual appliances. These approaches have been developed to simplify the collection of energy consumption data. This technique for gathering appliance load information doesnpsilat require placing sensors on individual appliances, and hence an intrusion into the energy consumerpsilas property. This paper proposes an overview of the most popular methods and describes their advantages and disadvantages. It opens new perspectives which are under development in our laboratory. Our goal is to reduce the complexity of monitoring appliances and to find the most efficient method for identification.

This paper proposes a predictive input voltage controller in cascade with PI input current and output voltage controllers to provide unity displacement factor whilst maintaining constant amplitude of the 20-kHz output voltage of AC-AC series resonant parallel loaded converter. The proposed system has fast response, using high frequency resonance, soft switching (zero current switching) and bidirectional power flow. Experimental results of a 2.5-kW 20-kHz prototype are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy

Ontologies, as sets of concepts and their interrelations in a specific domain, have proven to be a useful tool in the areas of digital libraries, semantic web, and the like. But large-scale analysis of ontology usage is constrained primarily in specific domain, like medical, scholarly artifact, biosciences, where knowledge presentation is structured and easier to understand. The application of ontologies in the domain of humanities, especially history, however, is rare since the extraction from knowledge of history is hard. In the current paper, we introduce an ontology based visualization model to integrate ontology in historical knowledge searching. Particularly, this period of history is related with Kuomintang and Early Communist Periods of China. The objective is assisting knowledge representation and knowledge inference for the purpose of knowledge management.

This paper proposes single-phase and three-phase non-isolated bidirectional converters in order to interface dc and ac variables. Such power electronics solutions guarantee: (i) bidirectional power flow between dc and ac converter sides, (ii) independent control in both converter sides, (iii) high level of integration, and (iv) implementation of two functions by using a unique power conversion stage. Despite proposing new power converter solutions, this paper presents an analysis of the converters in terms of PWM strategy, dc-link capacitor variables, and suitable control approach. Simulation and experimental results are presented as well.

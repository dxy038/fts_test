In this paper the optimal solutions of the following two decoupled problems are given on the basis of the model presented in Part I:(i) The capacitor (var) problem: determination of the locations, sizes and the real-time control of n ON/OFF switched and fixed shunt capacitors, (ii) The regulator (volt) problem: determination of the locations and real-time control of minimum number of voltage regulators. The objective in both problems is to minimize the peak power and the energy losses and to provide smooth voltage profile along the distribution system with lateral branches. For the first time, the nonlinear costs of installation of the capacitors are incorporated into the capacitor problem.

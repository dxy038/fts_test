Based on analysis of the source cepstrum, to obtain accurate spectrums, we used the high-precision HHT edge spectrum to calculate the cumulative cepstrum equence to eliminate the random noise caused by media in path, and further normalized the above sequence to eliminate part impacts of different epicentral distance and magnitude. On above basis, we used sub-cluster statistical theory to quantitative simulating above sequence of natural and earthquake to establish the analog equation of source identification. By Large number of experiments and preliminary analysis, r<sub>1</sub> value of fundamental solution of sub-cluster statistics equation can be used as a quantitative identification indicators of explosion earthquake. Based on a number of samples of natural and explosion earthquakes in recent years, we carried out the HHT cepstrum analysis and quantitative recognition to give the specific criterion of quantitative identification of explosion earthquakes. Preliminary results show that the identification method and quantitative criteria have good recognition performance from the quantitative simulation of sub-cluster statistical theory based on normalized and cumulative sequence of the HHT cepstrum. Through comprehensive analysis and further discussion, it is think that the above parameter and quantitative criteria with simple and intuitive, quantitative and objective are not strict requirements on sample size, suitable for different regions with the strong applicability, especially suitable for small sample areas.

Objective
This study investigated EEG abnormalities in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD).
Methods
Fifteen AD/HD subjects and 15 control subjects participated in this study. All subjects were between 14 and 17 years of age. The EEG was recorded from 19 electrode sites and was analysed to provide estimates of both absolute and relative power in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. Theta/alpha and theta/beta ratio coefficients were also calculated.
Results
Across the scalp, AD/HD subjects were characterised by greater absolute delta and theta activity, and an increased theta/beta ratio compared to controls. No group differences were found for either absolute or relative alpha, or absolute beta. However, AD/HD subjects demonstrated a reduction in relative beta activity in the posterior regions.
Conclusions
The AD/HD group showed significant deviations from normal CNS development, in particular in posterior regions. This supports previous suggestions that individuals with an EEG profile that is not indicative of a maturational lag are more likely to have AD/HD during adolescence.
Significance
This is the first study to investigate EEG abnormalities in adolescents with AD/HD during an eyes-closed resting condition.

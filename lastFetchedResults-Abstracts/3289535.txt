Based on the analysis and evaluation of supply chain risk, this paper establish a supply chain risk management decision model, the model considered three goals of risk loss, risk probability and risk management costs. With risk management costs added to the model, the risk management process is overcoming the traditional shortcomings of management costs be ignored. By using genetic algorithm, this multi-objective optimization problem is solved and we can get a good convergence of the optimal solution. Finally, the analysis of the credibility of the results obtained, that the decision model has a certain degree of effectiveness and practicality. Multi-objective genetic algorithms provides an effective way to solve multi-objective optimization problem of supply chain risk management, has a certain academic and applied significance.

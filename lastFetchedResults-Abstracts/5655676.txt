This paper deals with the evolution of distribution networks towards the smart grid paradigm, with a twofold focus. The first focus is on discussing the role of information technologies and specific aspects of data representation for generation, demand and storage patterns gathered from the field. The second focus refers to highlighting the formulation of specific objective functions for distribution system optimization incorporating new issues emerging from todayÂ´s trend towards exploiting decentralized resources.

In the present paper a systematic development of higher order accurate time stepping schemes which
exactly conserve total energy as well as momentum maps of underlying finite-dimensional Hamiltonian
systems with symmetry is shown. The result of this development is the enhanced Galerkin (eG) finite
element method in time. The conservation of the eG method is generally related to its collocation
property. Total energy conservation, in particular, is obtained by a new projection technique. The eG
method is, moreover, based on objective time discretization of the used strain measure. This paper is
concerned with particle dynamics and semi-discrete non-linear elastodynamics. The related numerical
examples show good performance in presence of stiffness as well as for calculating large-strain
motions

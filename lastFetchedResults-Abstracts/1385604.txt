The objective was to determine the effects of early exercise on the articular cartilage and subchondral bone at specific sites of the distal third metacarpal and metatarsal bones of 12 young Thoroughbred horses allowed free choice exercise at pasture. Six of the horses had additional controlled exercise 5 days per week from mean age of 21 ± 20 days of age (range: 3–83 days) until 17.1 months of age. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to quantify viable and non-viable chondrocytes. Proteoglycan scoring and modified Mankin scoring was performed and subchondral bone mineral density measured by computed tomography. The number of viable chondrocytes was significantly greater in the conditioned group, which also had a higher Safranin O/Fast Green (SOFG) score than did the group which could exercise only at pasture. There was no difference in mean bone mineral density between groups, nor was there relationship between subchondral bone mineral density and chondrocyte viability. The apparent beneficial effects of early conditioning exercise may support the use of exercise to optimise development of articular cartilage in young individuals.

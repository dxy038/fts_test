Background and Objective:Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease in adults that its early diagnosis and proper treatment has high importance and analysis of type and antibiotics resistance of isolated bacteria from urine of adult of different sex and ages can help in choosingof antibiotics in empirical therapy.
Materials & Methods:Data of patients (gender, age, kind of admission and isolated bacteria) with bacterial positive urine culture during three months in 2013 at Pars Hospital, Tehran, Iran, were studied and analyzed by SPSS software. Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolates to cotrimoxazole, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin and nitrofurantoin, were also determined by the standard disk diffusion method according to CLSI recommendation.
Results:A total of 1123 urine isolates were collected. Studied patients were often female and outpatients (78.3% and 88.7%, respectively). Escherichia coliwas themost common isolate (50%), followed by Streptococcus agalactiae(22.9%), Klebsiellaspp. (8.5%), Enterococcus spp. (7.6%), coagulase negativeStaphylococci (3.7%) and Staphylococcus aureus (2%). Statistically significant differences were seen in distribution of some bacteria regarding demographic characteristics of patients. Highest resistance rates have shown to cotrimoxazoleand ampicillin (56.9% and 55%, respectively) among isolated bacteria.
Conclusion:The results show a relationship between demographic characteristics of Iranian patients and type of isolated bacteria from urineand high resistance to common antimicrobial agents.

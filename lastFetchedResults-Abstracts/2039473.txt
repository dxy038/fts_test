Abstract 
According to some linguistic theories, there is a natural relation among phones (phonemes), the concept and the meaning. The objective of this study is to clarify the role and the concept of phones in literature and poetry. It is believed that phones (phoneme) along with other elements like; words, lines and the music of poetry can be effective in conveying the meaning and the emotion of a poet. To do so, Hafiz`s lyrics have been selected and studied. Among them, some couplets of having unusual repetition of phones (phonemes) are extracted and their functions have been investigated. As a result, the repetition of phones (phonemes) played five major roles in poetry: 1. the conveying of meaning, 2. the emphasis on main meaning, 3. the conveying of emotion, 4. the increasing of music and 5. Making the cohesion.

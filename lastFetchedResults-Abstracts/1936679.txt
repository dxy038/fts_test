Biofuels are being promoted as sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels both from energy supply perspective as well as a technical option to respond to climate change. Various crops are grown throughout the world to supply feedstocks for the production of biofuels. In sub-Saharan Africa, Jatropha curcas is considered to be the most suitable feedstock for production of biodiesel. Zimbabwe is a tropical country with suitable growth conditions for Jatropha. Since 2005, the production of Jatropha has gathered momentum in the country. The plan for production of Jatropha has concentrated on boosting production areas. Not much attention has been given to technical issues that are important in optimizing the yield and quality norms of Jatropha seed. This paper discusses technical interventions at two levels of the value chain that are required to optimize production of Jatropha in the country as a commercially viable energy crop. Emphasis is placed on the need to supply elite planting materials to optimize seed yield and seed quality as well as consider suitable agro-techniques required to establish the Jatropha plantations. Given that the longevity of Jatropha trees is 50Â years, the objective is to establish plantations based on improved germplasm rather than rely on wild type germplasm.

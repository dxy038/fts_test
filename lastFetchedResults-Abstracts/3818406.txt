A microcomputer-based time optimal control algorithm for a current source dc-dc converter is presented. The optimal control strategy for our system is shown to be bang-bang or maximum effort. The closed-loop bang-bang control was tested on a 22.4-kW energy transfer system. This system was the prototype ofÂ´an inductor-converter bridge (ICB) at Argonne National Laboratory. The ICB is used for bidirectional (two-quadrant) energy transfer between two large superconducting coils. The system test setup and operation is presented in some detail. The test results of the control systein are presented. The difference between the ideal and actual test results is analyzed in terms of accuracy, noise effects, quantization error, and instrumentation dynamic response. The results of this analysis are used for a systematic component specification of a microcomputer based bang-bang control system to achieve a required accuracy.

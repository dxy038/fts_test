The use of a bi-directional buck-boost cascade converter in electric vehicles allows the suitable control of both motoring and regenerative braking operations. Based on the bidirectional buck-boost cascade converter, the random pulse width modulation (RPWM) scheme is implemented to reduce the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI). Compared with the fixed frequency PWM (FPWM), the proposed RPWM scheme can suppress the peaky EMI as well as provide the bidirectional power transfer capability. Simulation and experimental results are given to support the validity.

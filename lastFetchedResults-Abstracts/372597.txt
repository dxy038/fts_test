Angiogenesis is a complex multistage process involving multiple factors and numerous cells. The use of the Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) assay is well documented as a method to investigate angiogenesis. This technique is ideal for screening samples, but requires an objective analysis technique. The angiogenic response of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was used to confirm that computer-based image analysis was able to quantify angiogenesis. Image analysis was used on samples of increasing porosity of PLLA to determine the effect of pore size on angiogenesis. Another effect also noted was that of an inflammatory response co-incident with angiogenesis. The difference in pore size made a difference to both angiogenesis and inflammation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used with primers for TNF-Î± to demonstrate and measure the presence of an inflammatory response.

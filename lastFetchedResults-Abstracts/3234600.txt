There is a growing demand for systems that support independent living into advanced age. Technologies that monitor changes in the amount of time older adults spend in bed have the potential to detect critical changes in mobility and support earlier health intervention. Although under mattress sensors have been used previously, processing algorithms were designed for short term monitoring. The objective of this paper was to develop an algorithm and determine optimal sampling rate to obtain bed occupancy characteristics over the longer term. Under mattress sensors were installed in the home of an older adult and data collected over a 3 month period. A processing algorithm was developed to extract bed occupancy information including time in bed, number of bed exits and time of first morning exit. Data were compared using various sampling rates and processing times. Findings indicate that the ideal down sample time for the application was 5 seconds (0.2Hz) and that computational time requirements could be reduced significantly without sacrificing the ability to accurately measure bed occupancy. Features of bed occupancy were plotted and patterns discovered which may be of interest to health clinicians and sleep researchers.

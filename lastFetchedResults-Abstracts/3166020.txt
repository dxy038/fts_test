The objective of this paper was to improve the control of non-bacterial initial transients in impedancimetric growth curves based en spectral impedance analysis of the culture cell-broth set. The total reactive component, Xt = 2 Xi, and the total resistive component, Rt 2 Ri + Rm, (subindices i and m refer respectively to "interface" and "medium"), were represented in an (X, R) diagram with frequency as parameter. Separation and regrouping of these cnoproente were obtained by application of War burg\Â´s Laws. Consistent transients, originating in minute direct currents from the circuitry, were found to distort the growth pattern. These results assist in the design of the overall system and clarify the road to the bacterial identification problem.

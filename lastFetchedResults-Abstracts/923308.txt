Dramatic changes have taken place in China's energy sector over the past decade. These changes have important implications for energy consumption, trade, production and regulatory policies in China and beyond. The objective of this paper is to review some of the key issues associated with deregulation and growth in China's energy sector. Specifically, the paper presents a survey of recent reforms in this sector; it also analyses the impact of deregulation on energy policy, ownership, foreign investment and trade, and sheds some lights on the sources of growth in China's energy sector.

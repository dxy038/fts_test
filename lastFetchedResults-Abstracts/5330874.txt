Electrical power supply to serve critical facilities are of high importance in todayÂ´s world. Instead of building a large electric power system, an intelligent Micro Grid (MG) can be considered as a promising power supply alternative for those critical facilities. This study presents the development and controlling of a laboratory scale MG which consists of several Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as Solar PV, Diesel Generator, Micro Hydro model, Battery Bank with a bidirectional inverter and critical and non-critical loads. Controlling of the MG is done by using distributed autonomous control strategies and Multi Agent System Architectures. It can operate in a grid connected mode as well as autonomous mode when it is isolated. The whole system was simulated using MATLAB and the simulation results and practical results were compared when MG is operated in different scenarios. The effectiveness of this controlling method is discussed in this paper.

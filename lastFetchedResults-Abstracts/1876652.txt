Objective
udy assessed health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients before and after cardiac surgery.

as a prospective repeated-measures observational study.
g
udy took place in a 650-bed tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia.
s
was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item health survey (SF-36) and the 15 Dimensions of Quality of Life questionnaire before surgery, at hospital discharge, and 6 months postdischarge.
s
ipants were representative of the cardiac surgery population. Scores for several concepts deteriorated at hospital discharge when compared with presurgery. There were significant improvements in health status at 6 months postdischarge when compared with previous measures for the majority of SF-36 and 15 Dimensions of Quality of Life questionnaire concepts, although mental health and social functioning demonstrated significant deterioration. SF-36 scores were substantially lower than population norms, but similar to previous studies of patients undergoing cardiac surgery except for mental health.
sion
oration in health status at hospital discharge when compared with presurgery status reinforces the need for further patient care and support after discharge. All dimensions improved after 6 months, except mental health. This information can guide patient expectations regarding rehabilitation posthospitalization, and cardiac surgical services should implement and evaluate formal “outreach programs” for these patients.

In this paper, a technology mapping algorithm is proposed for heterogeneous FPGAs. The technology mapping problem is first formulated as a flow network problem. Then, an algorithm based on the min-cost max-flow algorithm is presented to select a proper set of feasible LUTs for various objectives. The objective, the total area composed of LUTs and routing area, are discussed in the paper. This algorithm has been tested on the MCNC benchmark circuits. Compared with other existing LUT-based FPGA mapping algorithms, the algorithm produces better characteristics.

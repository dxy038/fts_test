Unconventional emergency occurs unexpectedly, therefore the response system for unconventional emergency has distinct difference from classical emergency event. In order to solve unconventional emergency response problem, chance constraint response utility model (CUUM) and chance constraint response multi-objective programming model (CUMM) are developed. This paper has examined the emergency missions of unconventional emergency response, and analyzed the unconventional emergency response decision, mainly about resources and capabilities allocation. Then uncertain vector of unconventional emergency situation is generated, functions of response-decision-variableÂ´s capability are introduced. This research hopes to support the emergency response system to short response decision time and increase the response quality and efficiency by using CUUM and CUMM.

The control objective in many robot manipulator applications is to command the end-effector motion to achieve a desired response. To achieve this objective a mapping is required to relate the joint/link control inputs to the desired Cartesian position and orientation. If there are uncertainties or singularities in the mapping, then degraded performance or unpredictable responses by the manipulator are possible. To address these issues, an adaptive tracking controller is developed in this paper for robot manipulators with uncertainty in the kinematic and dynamic models. The controller is developed based on the unit quaternion representation so that singularities associated with three parameter representations are avoided.

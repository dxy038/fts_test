The Health Delivery Practice with additional innovative technologies become a key ingredient in health care industry. However, under the complex and dynamic environment, predictability, reactivity and accuracy are considered as inherent features of risk management. During the runtime monitoring system, risks are largely observed due to changes in environmental conditions, physical damages and other technical failures. The aim of the research is to provide a risk management based early warning system using runtime monitoring for the healthcare industry for a better performance. The main objective of this research is to propose a novel technique for predicting and mitigating possible risks during runtime. That is, by using runtime monitoring along with neural networks using Java based applications. The present work explored a new technique in which early warning system is developed to identify and mitigate the best solutions for the newly identified risks in runtime using neural networks.

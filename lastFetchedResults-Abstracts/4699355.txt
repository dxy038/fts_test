Traditional monitoring and early-warning system can only be used for a specific type of road disasters, caused that administrative department needs to run multiple monitoring and early-warning systems for different types of road disasters; and once the type of monitoring data changed, the original program needs to upgrade, or can not continue to use. The objective of this paper is to present a new method of monitoring and early-warning information storage based on semi-structured data (RDMEDOM), which can solve the above problems. RDMEDOM achieved the storage of monitoring data by using semi-structured data so that can handle any type of road disasters and all types of monitoring data. In this paper the data of soil slop and bridges in Changchun was selected as the case study examples. Results show that the proposed method is efficient, stable and extensible.

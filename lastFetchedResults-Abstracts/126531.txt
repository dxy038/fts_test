Objective: This experiment was designed and administered to study the effect of cognitive exhaustion and emotional intelligence on cognitive problem sloving performance. Method: In this controlled trial, 120 male and female students who scored between one standard deviation above and below the mean emotional intelligence on the Trait Meta Mood Scale (TMMS) were selected from 408 examinees, and were randomly assigned to 8 groups of 15 participants. The experiment consisted of two phases: In the first phase, participants in the control and experimental groups were exposed to controllable and uncontrollable discriminative tasks. In the second phase, for comparison, the groups were exposed to problem solving tests. Data analysis was done using the three-way ANOVA test. Results: Performances of the subjects with different emotional intelligence were not similar. That is, the higher the emotional intelligence, the better performance on problem solving tasks. There was no difference between boys and girls regarding their level of emotional intelligence. Problem- solving in female subjects was more influenced by cognitive exhaustion (compared to males). The problem - solving ability in the subjects with cognitive exhaustion was not a function of their level of emotional intelligence. Conclusion: Considering the findings, it seems necessary to focus on the role of variables of cognitive exhaustion and emotional intelligence in the studies of individuals' performance in solving cognitive problems.

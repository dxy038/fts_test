Both varistor-type bidirectional selector (VBS) and ultrathin NbO<sub>2</sub> device with threshold switching (TS) characteristics were investigated. A highly non-linear VBS showed superior performances including high current density (&gt;;3&#215;10<sup>7</sup>A/cm<sup>2</sup>) and high selectivity (~10<sup>4</sup>). Ultrathin NbO<sub>2</sub> exhibits excellent TS characteristics such as high temperature stability (~160<sup>o</sup>C), good switching uniformity, and extreme scalability.

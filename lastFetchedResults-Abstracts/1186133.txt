The objective of this paper is to propose a generalized technique called numerically integrated modified virtual crack closure integral (NI-MVCCI) technique for fracture analysis of cracked plates under combined tensile, bending and shear loads. NI-MVCCI technique is used for post-processing the results of finite element analysis (FEA) for computation of strain energy release rate (SERR) components and the corresponding stress intensity factor (SIF) for cracked plates. NI-MVCCI technique has been demonstrated for 4-noded, 8-noded (regular and quarter-point) and 9-noded (regular and quarter-point) isoparametric plate finite elements. These elements are based on Mindlin’s plate theory that considers shear deformation. For all the elements, reduced integration/selective reduced integration techniques have been employed in the studies. In addition, for 9-noded element assumed shear interpolation functions have been used to overcome the shear locking problem. Numerical studies on fracture analysis of plates subjected to tension–moment and tension–shear loads have been conducted employing these elements. It is observed that among these elements, the 9-noded Lagrangian plate element with assumed shear interpolation functions exhibits better performance for fracture analysis of cracked plates.

Semantic web service technology has a high potential for integrating heterogeneous applications. Web service capabilities are impossible to be used without having a precise service discovery mechanism. The increase in the precision of this mechanism depends upon taking QoS specification of services in service discovery process into account. Since using linguistic quantities in non-functional attribute description is popular, fuzzy logic is appropriate for being used in representation of non-functional attribute description. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based framework is proposed which allows publication and subscription of semantic web services alongside with maintaining its consistency with standard UDDI and application of fuzzy synthetic evaluation and multi-objective decision-making algorithms. This framework allows increasing the consistency of interpreting request and service by natural language process (NLP) and thesaurus approaches on one hand and deferring interpretation time of non-functional aspects of published service on the other hand. Moreover, the proposed framework does not try to decrease subjectivity of discovery/publication request and attempts to find the most matched service to consumer´s subjective request by separately taking individual consumer´s preferences into account.

This paper considers the rate control problem with the objective of maximizing the total user utility. It focuses on the inelastic traffic and removes restrictive assumptions on utility function. We propose a simple distributed algorithm using PSO (particle swarm optimization) for achieving the optimal rates. In our algorithm, the network communicates to the user the number of congested links on the userÂ´s path, and the user adjusts its rate accordingly, taking into account its utility function and the network congestion feedback. Numerical example shows that our algorithm converges to the optimum rates.

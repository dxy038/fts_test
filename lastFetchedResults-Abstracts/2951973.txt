Deals with the control of a class of linear hybrid systems which consist of two, in general coupled, subsystems one being continuous-time while the second one is digital. Both subsystems are driven by continuous time and sampled values of a control input. The description of the overall system is given through an extended hybrid system, which is purely discrete at sampling instants, which has two, in general, coupled continuous-time and discrete-time substates. The control objective has a double nature and it consists of the achievement of separate continuous-time and discrete-time model-matching objectives with respect to two predefined stable reference models

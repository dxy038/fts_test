In traditional methods of Performance-Based Design (PBD), the structure is usually designed to satisfy the performance criteria in an iterative manner. The objective of this research is to define and formulate the PBD problem as an optimization model and to develop a computer-based method for finding Optimal Performance-Based Design (OPBD) of Reinforced Concrete (RC) Frames. First, a definition of the optimization model is provided and explicit relations are then derived for the objective function and constraints of the problem utilizing a nonlinear sensitivity analysis with respect to design variables and the convex approximation method. To solve the optimization problem thus obtained, the dual method is utilized. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed method.

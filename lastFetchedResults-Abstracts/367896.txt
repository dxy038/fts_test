Immediate finishing is a highly desirable property of restorative materials. In general, the resin composites, the polyacid-modified resin composites and resin-modified glass-ionomers are finished immediately after light-curing. For the conventional glass-ionomers a waiting period of 24 h is recommended. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether immediate finishing and application of cyclic loading under water spray on resin-modified glass-ionomers, a conventional glass-ionomer, a polyacid-modified resin composite and a resin composite are reflected in their Young's modulus and fatigue resistance after 1-month wet storage compared with a control group that could mature untroubled for 1 month. From this study, it could be concluded that there is a material-dependent response on immediate finishing. For the conventional glass-ionomer, the waiting period of 24 h is highly advisable. The resin composite suffered more than the other test materials. A second statement is that one must be cautious by the extrapolation of findings obtained on quasi static tests (Young's modulus) towards dynamic properties (flexural fatigue limit).

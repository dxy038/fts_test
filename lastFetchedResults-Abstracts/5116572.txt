A sensor-based motion planning system for a robot arm manipulator must include these four basic components: sensor hardware; real-time signal/sensory data processing hardware/software a local step planning subsystem that works at the basic sample rate of the arm; and a subsystem for global planning. The objective of this work is to develop the fourth component, a real-time implementable algorithm that realizes the upper, global level of planning. Based on the current collection of local normals, the algorithm generates preferable directions of motion around obstacles, in order to guarantee reaching the target position if it is reachable. Experimental results from testing the developed system are also discussed

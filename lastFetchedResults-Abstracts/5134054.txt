Intelligent bionic leg (IBL) controlled by magneto- rheological (MR) damper is an advanced prosthesis. The conception and research purpose of IBL are expatiated. The bionic design of IBL is introduced and kinematics equation is given. Then optimization principle, objective function and constraint are discussed. Optimization design using processed data of human normal gait is done. The result indicates that IBL can simulate normal personÂ´s gait well.

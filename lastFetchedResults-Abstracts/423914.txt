Design options for the development of health information systems are evaluated. The health examination survey is found to be an appropriate method for meeting data needs for health planning, program design, and evaluation activities in developing countries. The model proposed is a national cross-sectional prevalence survey employing both interviews and physical examinations to produce a health status profile of a countries population. Examination data are objective, internationally comparable, and not dependent upon reports of clinical encounters in the population. Limitations inherent to health examination surveys are reviewed in reference to their potential in developing countries. Not all countries may be able to conduct health examination surveys; criteria are presented to assist in evaluation of the feasibility of application in specific countries.

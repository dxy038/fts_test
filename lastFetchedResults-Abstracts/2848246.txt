Contouring control can provide precision machine tool control an effective method, and many methods have been proposed to date. Direct drive of linear motor is the inevitable demand and trends for improving CNC processing speed and precision. XY table contouring systems involve competing control objective of maximizing accuracy while minimizing traversal time. To meet high-speed, high precision and complex contour machining requirement, a model predictive controller is presented. The new controller is successfully implemented in real time on an XY table, and can meet the requirement of high precision control. simulation results show the contouring control method gets a performance improvement.

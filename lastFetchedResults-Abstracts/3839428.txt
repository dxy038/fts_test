In software technology, the need for measurement is well recognised, but it is proving difficult to devise measures that are unique, meaningful, objective and representative. A method is given for characterising inherent properties of static Prolog code and assigning to them values by measurement. The principal aim is to demonstrate that a model-based approach to measurement helps to ensure the quality of measures. The authors propose a model of the data entities in Prolog program texts, together with the model of the constructors that combine them into complete programs. The model-based measurement system presented characterises data entities by a six-tuple, and composes six-tuples to yield measures of complete programs or their parts. Model-based measurement ensures that the meaning of the measures is explicit

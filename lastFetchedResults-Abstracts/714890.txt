This paper presents a two-stage hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with setup and assembly operations. The proposed study of this paper considers one kind of product with a quantity of demand where each product is made by assembling a set of different parts. At first, the parts are manufactured in a two-stage hybrid flow-shop and then the parts are assembled into products on assembly stage. Setup operations are needed when a machine starts processing the parts or it changes items. The considered objective is minimizing the completion time of all products. Since the problem is classified as NP-hard class, a combinatorial algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm is a three-step procedure where we use heuristic, genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), NEH and Johnsonâ€™s algorithm. Three lower bounds are presented and improved to evaluate the proposed algorithms. An extensive computational experiment is conducted to compare the performances of the proposed algorithms.

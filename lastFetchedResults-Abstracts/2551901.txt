Abstract The move toward modernism along with the cultural globalization and the rise of consumer culture make fashionism and also permanent surveillance and focusing on the visible characteristics of the body a common phenomenon in contemporary societies.Nowadays, modern people with the use of fashionable things and through paying extreme attention to cloth and appearance construct personal images of themselves and also send messages about their identities to others. The present research focusing on styles of clothing and women&#039;s attitudes toward fashion aims to explain causes and motivations which lead women to use fashionable clothes and also attempts to identify their typology. The research method is qualitative and its data has been collected by semistructured interviews. The results of data analysis display three distinct types of women&#039;s clothing each has different characteristics. Of course, this division doesn&#039;t mean exact bordering and these three types somehow interplay with each other. The findings show that women&#039;s increased tendency for using fashionable clothes should be assessed mostly in relation to both subjective and objective factors as well as the dialectic relationship of agency and structure. Keywords: fashion, fashionism, styles of clothing, women, adaptative fashion, deconstructive fashion, eclectic fashion.

A collection of slides from the authors\Â´ conference presentation is given. The authors present an approach for describing IN (intelligent network) services and for analyzing interactions between them. The presented approach was created in the scope of EURESCOM project P509 "Handling Service Interaction in the Service Life Cycle". EURESCOM is a consortium founded by European Public Network Operators (PNOs) in order to perform R&amp;D in pre-competitive areas of telecommunications. The main objective of P509 was to provide the PNOs with a consistent and comprehensive approach for interaction handling in the whole service life cycle. As a prime result, P509 has created the concept of the Service Interaction Handling Process (SIHP). The SIHP is a business process that is responsible for detecting interactions between services and finding optimal resolutions for them. In order to work eEciently the SIHP has to be run separately from the service creation process. In the context of the SIHP a Filtering sub-process is executed before the actual detection and resolution of the interaction cases is carried out. The task of the Filtering sub-process is to filter out service combinations that are unlikely to cause an interaction and thus to provide the subsequent Detection sub-process of the SIHP with a reduced set of service combinations that need further investigation.

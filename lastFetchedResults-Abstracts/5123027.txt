This paper presented a genetic - fuzzy logic based Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller (GFPID) for automatic generation control of two area thermal-thermal power system. Genetic algorithm has been applied to simultaneously tune PID gains, membership functions and control rules of FPID controller to minimize the frequency deviations of the system against the load disturbances. An objective function to minimize the overshoot and settling time of the frequency deviations has been proposed. The results have also been obtained with another objective function of minimizing tie line power flow deviations along with change in frequency with bias factor. The results have been computed for two area thermal-thermal power system. The results obtained with two objectives have been compared. The results have also been obtained with Zeigler-Nicholas method for comparison.

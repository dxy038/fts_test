A new Image Quality Metric (IQM) dedicated to image in-painting evaluation is proposed in this paper. This objective measure is computed by combining some structural and salient features related to the specific goals of inpainting purposes. The main perceptual characteristics used in this approach are the visual coherence and the visual saliency. The proposed Inpainted Image Quality Assessment is evaluated trough some experimental results. It is shown that the proposed metric is consistent with the perceptual evaluation of image inpainting results.

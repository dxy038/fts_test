Detecting proteins in human blood holds the promise of a revolution in cancer diagnosis. Also, the ability to perform laboratory operations on small scales using miniaturized (lab-on-a-chip) devices has many benefits. Designing and fabricating such systems is extremely challenging, but physicists and engineers are beginning to construct such highly integrated and compact labs on chips with exciting functionality. This paper focuses on the presentation of the requirements of the information technology layer in such an integrated platform been developed in the LOCCANDIA project. LOCCANDIA is a specific targeted research project (STREP) funded under the 6th framework program of the EC. Its ultimate objective is to develop an innovative nano- technology based (lab-on-a-chip) platform for the medical- proteomics field. The paper presents the main engineering aspects, challenges and architecture for creating an Integrated Clinico-Proteomic Environment. The environment will be used to monitor and document the analysis and discovery chain and to allow the physician to interpret the digital spectrogram data delivered by the mass spectrometer, for diagnostic purposes.

Advances in the power electronic technologies estimate that about 50 - 60 percent of the electric power in industrialized countries is flowing through some kind of power electronic systems (non-linear loads) and the percent is growing up. These loads distort the supply voltage as well as supply current from its pure sinusoidal form. The main objective of this paper is to analyze power harmonics present in the power system due to non-linear loads in an educational institution. It concerns with the power quality survey of harmonics for various non-linear loads by using power quality analyzer CA 8332 at Powerhouse. The measured values can be used to design an active filter for harmonic control.

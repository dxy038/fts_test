Being an important discussion in epistemology, self-evidents are of unique importance in epistemological views expressed by epistemologists. Since such perceptions are not to be acquired therefore they can be stable foundations for acquiring other kinds of knowledge. To know the details of self-evidents, saves one from committing epistemological errors and helps him answer most of the doubts raised concerning self-evidents. The present writing explains two different but mostly ignored senses of self-evidents (and naturally two senses of speculative perceptions) comparing some of their characteristics with each other.  
     Noting the difference between these two senses of the term (which we call self-evident in more general sense and self-evident in more particular sense) is necessary to determine different kinds of self-evidents. For example some prepositions were considered as self-evident by previous philosophers while they are no longer considered as self-evident today.
Our objective is to show that the differences on the number of self-evidents are to a large extent not real and thus they can be ironed out on further reflections.

Background & Objective: Osteoporosis is a metabolic disease which results from gradual destruction of bone mass. Prevention of osteoporosis should be started from childhood by getting adequate calcium and doing weight-bearing exercises. Participating of mothers in health education interventions is likely to promote longer-lasting health behaviors in their daughters. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of simultaneous education of mothers and daughters on osteoporosis preventive behavior among high school female students. Methods & Materials: In this interventional study, 400 female students were randomly selected via a two-phased sampling method. At first stage, four schools were sclccted randomly. At the second stage, 400 students were divided randomly into two groups. Their osteoporosis preventive behaviors were measured using a two-sectioned questionnaire: demographic section, and osteoporosis preventive behaviors assessment section. The first group participated in the educational programs with their mothers and the other group participated without their mothers. The educational program had two sessions, each one lasted 45 minutes. The second stage of the study was performed three months later. Data analysis was carried out using /-test and chi squared test.
Results: Results showed that in both groups, osteoporosis preventive behaviors scores increased significantly after intervention. It was higher in case group (^<0.001). Eating behavior was significantly different in two groups (/M).003).
Conclusion: Results showed that simultaneous educational program for mothers and daughters promotes eating behavior in the girls.

Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) is an impressive invention in wireless technology due to its capacity to resolve spectrum scarcity crisis. It takes benefit of the underutilized licensed spectrum band to create effective or useful consumption of overall frequency spectrum band. The best spectrum is selected in an opportunistic manner, shared with other users with no violation to licensed users. Dynamic network requires deep study of routing in mobile CRNs .In Mobile CR adhoc Networks, to face the issue of routing problem one of the prominent approaches is clustering. Clustering is an evolving research in CRN, which assures better system performance as reduced delay, increased throughput, reduced communication overhead and improved bandwidth. In this study, Energy Efficient Cluster based Routing protocol is proposed, which works in distributed manner in mobile CR adhoc network. The objective of routing protocol is to provide efficient energy level to network nodes; so that it can relief the problem of energy consumption that arises due to packet generation and formation of cluster. Route recovery is built to recover the path locally when it is failed due to primary user activity and temporary disconnection occurs between communicating nodes. Estimation of network performance is carried out in ns2 simulator.

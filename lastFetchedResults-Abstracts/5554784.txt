The objective of this work was to address this question through temperature and frequency dependence measurements of the FMR linewidth for a range of x<sub>N</sub> values that span the structural transition point. The linewidth data, as well as static magnetization data, show clear changes at x<sub>N</sub> =7 at.%. Taken collectively, these results indicate that the change in the loss is structure related. The FMR measurements were made on sputtered, nominally 50 nm thick Fe-Ti-N films. Preparation details are given. The linewidth measurements were made with broadband stripline and shorted waveguide techniques for temperature and frequency ranges of 9-294 K and 2-36 GHz.

In this paper we present a model to control the instruments and experiments in a remote laboratory using a low cost control architecture. This model is based on a LAN network and a control methodology through reusable drivers. The objective is to obtain a software control architecture independent of the hardware of the laboratory, so each institution can deploy its own solution according to the available devices and with minimal restrictions regarding to the hardware of the lab.

The objective of the present work is to understand the vertical electric field stimulation of the bacterial cells, when grown on amorphous carbon substrates in vitro. In particular, the antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli are studied using MTT assay, live/dead assay and inner membrane permeabilization assays. In our experiments, the carbon substrate acts as one electrode and the counter electrode is positioned outside the culture medium, thus suppressing the current, electrokinetic motions and chemical reactions. Guided by similar experiments conducted in our group on neuroblastoma cells, the present experimental results further establish the interdependence of field strength and exposure duration towards bacterial growth inactivation in vitro. Importantly, significant reduction in bacterial viability was recorded at the 2.5 V/cm electric field stimulation conditions, which does not reduce the neural cell viability to any significant extent on an identical substrate. Following electrical stimulation, the bacterial growth is significantly inhibited for S. aureus bacterial strain in an exposure time dependent manner. In summary, our experiments establish the effectiveness of the vertical electric field towards bacterial growth inactivation on amorphous carbon substrates, which is a cell type dependent phenomenon (Gram-positive vs. Gram-negative).

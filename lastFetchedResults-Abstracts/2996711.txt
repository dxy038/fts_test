Our objective is to provide a framework of automated tools and techniques for reducing operational and maintenance costs in the NASAÂ´s Deep Space Network (DSN). The focus of our technology application is fault diagnostics and prognostics for ground systems during DSN tracking operations. The domain chosen to demonstrate our capability is the new DSN full spectrum processing array configuration located at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC) which is monitored by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)

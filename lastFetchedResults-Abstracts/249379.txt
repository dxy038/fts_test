This paper presents an improved weighting method for multicriteria structural optimization. By introducing
arti=cial design variables, here called as multibounds formulation (MBF), we demonstrate mathematically
that the weighting combination of criteria can be transformed into a simpli=ed problem with a
linear objective function. This is a uni=ed formulation for one criterion and multicriteria problems. Due
to the uncoupling of involved criteria after the transformation, the extension and the adaptation of monotonic
approximation-based convex programming methods such as the convex linearization (CONLIN)
or the method of moving asymptotes (MMA)are made possible to solve multicriteria problems as
e?ciently as for one criterion problems. In this work, a multicriteria optimization tool is developed
by integrating the multibounds formulation with the CONLIN optimizer and the ABAQUS =nite element
analysis system. Some numerical examples are taken into account to show the e?ciency of this
approach

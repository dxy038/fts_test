Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) has been under development for electric system applications for some time. Large units (&#10878;10 MWh) have been designed for electric load management. Small systems (&lt;10 MW) have been designed for power quality enhancements. Small systems, in particular, can provide momentary carryover on a distribution network, thus avoiding outages in customers´ electric supply. The price of today´s small units is relatively expensive. The objective of this study was to evaluate possible cost reductions of small SMES devices to determine long-term feasibility for use in utility systems

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons are ubiquitous in the urban atmosphere and one of the most
atmospheric pollutants to be identified as suspected carcinogens .The objective of this study was to
compare particulate PAH profiles from several sites across Tehran. Atmospheric concentrations of
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Tehran were evaluated to study particulate PAH profiles in
different sites. The particles size distributions were unimodal with a fine mode diameter (PM<0.49 ىm).
Five sites were selected in residential areas and one site in rural area for representing various situations
and role of motor vehicles in producing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Organics on the filter were
extracted with acetonitrile and a group of 16 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons was selected for
evaluation. PAH identification was done by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Total PAH
concentration associated with particles collected on the six-stage cascade impactor stages and after-filter
in different sites ranged between 0.132 to 234.3 ng/m3. The mean concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbons, collected on each stage were: 4.17 ng/m3 for PM10-7.2 ىm, 5.69 ng/m3 for PM7.2 - 3 ىm,
11.95 ng/m3 for PM3 - 1.5 ىm, 9.18 ng/m3 for PM1.5-0.95 ىm, 2.82 ng/m3 for PM0.95-0.49 ىm and 47.91 ng/m3
for PM < 0.49 ىm respectively.

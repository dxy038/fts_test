This paper assesses the coding performance of several state-of-the-art 3D wavelet coders and compares them with newly proposed compression methods exploiting quadtree and block-based coding concepts, layered zero-coding principles and context-based arithmetic coding. The discussed wavelet-based coding algorithms produce losslessly compressed embedded data streams, supporting the desired progressive data transmission functionality. Moreover, objective and subjective quality evaluations on various medical volumetric datasets show that the newly proposed algorithms provide competitive lossy and lossless compression results compared to the state-of-the-art.

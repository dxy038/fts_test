This paper studies routing algorithms of the multihop lightwave systems based on the bidirectional de Bruijn graph. Three different routing methods are proposed and performance results are obtained in terms of the mean path lengths, network throughput and delay performance. The study shows that the performance of this type of topology is desirable and comparable to other types of multihop systems. It may be considered as a candidate for metropolitan area networks

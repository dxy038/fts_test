In this paper, an antenna by microstrip line feed with non-symmetric open slot operates in wireless communication. This work design and perform characteristics of array structure. The antenna is designed for working at 3.1GHz to 12 GHz and covers multi band IEEE802.16 WiMAX IEEE802.16 (3.5/5.5GHz) and WLAN IEEE802.11a (5.5GHz) and bidirectional radiation pattern. The Simulation and design optimization are done by using Moment Method (MoM). Simulation of the results are given and compared with those antennas operation as same band. ItÂ´s VSWR&lt;;2, bandwidth &gt; 9GHz, frequency range of the proposed antenna is about 3.1GHz to 12GHz uses FR4 substrate (low cost).

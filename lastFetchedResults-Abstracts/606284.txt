The objective of this paper is to design a system to classify Persian speech acts. The driving vision for this
work is to provide intelligent systems such as text to speech, machine translation, text summarization, etc. that are
sensitive to the speech acts of the input texts and can pronounce the corresponding intonation correctly. Seven speech
acts were considered and 3 classification methods including (1) Naive Bayes, (2) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and (3)
Tree learner were used. The performance of speech act classification was evaluated using these methods including 10-
Fold Cross-Validation, 70-30 Random Sampling and Area under ROC. KNN with an accuracy of 72% was shown to
be the best classifier for the classification of Persian speech acts. It was observed that the amount of labeled training
data had an important role in the classification performance.

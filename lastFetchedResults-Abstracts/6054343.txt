We have proposed and demonstrated an upstream transmission scheme with improved power budget for DWDM millimetre-wave fiber-radio systems. An SOA in conjunction with an AWG simultaneously amplify the down link RF subcarriers and optical carriers appearing at odd and even numbered ports of the AWG respectively, thus improving the carrier-to-sideband ratio in the downlink. Optical carriers at even numbered ports are re-used for upstream transmission thereby providing laser free BSs. Our experimental results shows that proposed scheme can be a practical solution for future bidirectional WI-DWDM transmission systems.

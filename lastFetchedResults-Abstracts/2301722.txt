In this paper, the coupled thermo-mechanical (TM) processes in the ؤspِ Pillar Stability Experiment (APSE) carried out by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) were simulated using both continuum and discontinuum based numerical methods. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) finite element method (FEM) and 2D distinct element method (DEM) with particles were used. The main objective for the large scale in situ experiment is to investigate the yielding strength of crystalline rock and the formation of the excavation disturbed/damaged zone (EDZ) during excavation of two boreholes, pressurizing of one of the boreholes and heating. For the DEM simulations, the heat flow algorithm was newly introduced into the original code. The calculated stress, displacement and temperature distributions were compared with the ones obtained from in situ measurements and FEM simulations. A parametric study for initial microcracks was also performed to reproduce the spalling phenomena observed in the APSE.

The general objective of the DESIBEL project is to investigate new methods for deep sea intervention that could be used in the future to deploy, supply, operate and recover benthic laboratories. Four concepts were investigated and partially tested at sea: an active docking system with a mobile hook (LOMOS), an active docking system with a special ROV (REMORA), a versatile scientific ROV (VICTOR 6000), a new free swimming vehicle (SIRENE). This paper summarizes main results and at sea feedbacks, with a special emphasis on SIRENE and VICTOR trials

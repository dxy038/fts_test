The objective of the paper is to present the concept of using selected computational intelligence methods in conjunction with discrete event simulation (DES) models of chosen logistics processes. A review of the recent literature in the scope of applications of discrete event simulation methods indicates that researchers who use these methods more and more often employ techniques from the area of computational intelligence, especially in cases when the phenomena, processes or systems modeled feature complexity, uncertainty or non-linearity. The issues discussed in the paper refer to modeling selected logistics processes at the company that produces electricity and thermal energy.

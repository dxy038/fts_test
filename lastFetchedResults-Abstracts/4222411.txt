Distributed antenna systems (DAS) are studied in order to improve the coverage area of wireless communication systems under transmit power constraint. In order to reduce the computational complexly among clusters, in DAS, it is imperative to control the inter-cluster interference in a decentralized way. In this paper, a distributed power control among clusters for single-user DAS based on Foschini-MiljanicÂ´s algorithm is proposed. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to mitigate the interference among clusters and satisfy the desired SINR at each mobile station (MS). In the algorithm, first signal power after MRC at MS in a cluster is calculated, then the transmit power of the BSAs in the corresponding cluster is updated according to the predefined transmit power ratio. In addition, the convergence condition is derived, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through computer simulations.

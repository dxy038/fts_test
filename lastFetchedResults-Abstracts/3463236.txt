Neural network applications to aircraft automatic landing control are presented. Conventional automatic landing systems (ALSs) can provide a smooth landing, which is essential to the comfort of passengers. However, these systems work only within a specified operational safety envelope. When the conditions are beyond the envelope, such as turbulence or wind shear, they often cannot be used. The objective of this paper is to investigate the use of neural networks in ALSs and to make these systems more intelligent. Current flight control law is adopted in the intelligent controller design. Tracking performance and robustness are demonstrated through software simulations. This paper presents five different neural network controllers to improve the performance of conventional ALSs based on a modified learning-through-time process. Simulation results show that the neural network controllers can successfully expand the safety envelope to include more hostile environments such as severe turbulence

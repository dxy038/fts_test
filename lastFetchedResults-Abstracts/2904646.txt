In this paper, we investigate the Energy Efficiency (EE) - Spectrum Efficiency (SE) tradeoff issue in an OFDM-based cognitive radio (CR) network. A multi-objective resource allocation problem is formulated, where we try to maximize the EE and the SE simultaneously. The Pareto optimal set of the formulated problem is characterized by analyzing the relationship between the EE and the SE. To find a unique globally optimal solution, we proposed a unified EE-SE tradeoff metric, based on which the original optimization task is transformed into a single-objective problem that has a D.C. (Difference of two Convex functions/sets) structure. Then an efficient barrier method is developed, where we speeds up the time-consuming computation of Newton step by exploiting the structure of the D.C. programming problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Our general problem formulation sheds some insights on how to design an energy- and spectrum-efficient CR system.

It is imperative that any soil improvement technique can considerably aect
the soil media mechanical behavior. However, considering the recent researches, it can
be concluded that a combined study on the eect of cement treatment on soil-geotextile
interfacial shear strength parameters has almost been neglected. Thus, the main objective
of this study is to ll this research gap with the main focus on a selected site in Shiraz
city, Iran. In this regard, shear strength parameters of untreated and cement treated soil
samples have been acquired by traditional and modied direct shear tests apparatuses. The
results indicate that at high cement contents, the soil-geotextile interfacial shear strength
increases with an observed behavior similar to over consolidated soils. While up to 1% of
cement treatment did not improve the properties, adding 5% and 10% of cement increased
both friction angle and cohesion of the soil considerably. Complementary microscopic
evaluation of the interface indicated that the interfacial soil-geotextile shear strength is
highly dependent upon the soil particles size distribution and specially its nes content.
Finally, the numerical modeling of an illustrative reinforced soil structure revealed that
knowing the state of stress is a prerequisite to any selection of the soil improvement zone.

Describes and illustrates a framework for modeling avionics software performability. The model captures the dependencies and interactions between performance and dependability in avionics software systems and permits the investigation of operational software behavior and tradeoffs between performance and dependability. Simple examples are presented which indicate how the performability models can provide insights into design considerations that are not easily attained without a unified approach. The preliminary results show that performability modeling can provide answers that form the basis for objective, quantitatively derived decisions for designs and operational aspects of avionics software

Objective
rpose of the present study was to develop a treatment model for cognitive behavioral interventions focusing on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) based on the model of perpetuating factors introduced by Vercoulen et al. [Journal of Psychosomatic Research 1998;45:507â€“17].
s
is purpose, we reanalyzed the data of a previously conducted randomized controlled trial in which a low intensity cognitive behavioral intervention was compared to a waiting list control group. Structural equation modeling was used to test a treatment model in which changes in focusing on symptoms, perceived problems with activity, and sense of control over fatigue were hypothesized to mediate the effect of our intervention on fatigue severity and disability.
s
 final model, which had a good fit to the data, the effect of treatment was mediated by a decrease in perceived problems with activity and an increase in sense of control over fatigue.
sion
ndings suggest that cognitive behavioral interventions for CFS need to change the illness perception and beliefs of their patients in order to be effective.

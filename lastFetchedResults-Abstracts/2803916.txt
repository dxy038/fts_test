The growth of vehicle electrification will make the electric power systems to face new challenges as the load profile changes. Charging the EVs will increase the electricity demand and may cause new peaks. However, the nature of this new type of load offers flexibility that can be used to achieve a variety of goals, including a reduction of the charging impact or cost. The objective of this paper is to present a control algorithm that can be utilized by a commercial building manager for scheduling and managing the EV charging demand. The control algorithm uses Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) interactions to either reduce the buildingÂ´s peak demand, or reduce the daily electricity cost for the building manager. Based on real data from the National Travel Survey of 2010, a realistic EV fleet is assumed, and the effectiveness of the algorithm is examined for different charging/discharging rates and V2B levels.

The objective of this study is to develop an error estimator that accurately predicts relative eigenvalue errors in finite element models reduced by Guyan reduction. We present a derivation procedure for the error estimator, in which Kidder’s transformation matrix for Guyan reduction is employed. We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed error estimator through various numerical examples: rectangular plate, cylindrical panel, hyperboloid panel, and shaft–shaft interaction problems.

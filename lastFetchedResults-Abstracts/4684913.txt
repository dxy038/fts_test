In recent years, several applications of modeling are proposed for the purpose of virtual classroom by authors active in this area. Considering one of them, the authors of this paper studied the possibilities and difficulties of introduction of model based distance learning into every day higher education practice. They surveyed some important issues and methodological elements of virtual classrooms in comparison with demands of higher education for teaching procedures, programs, and materials. The main objective was to reveal specific circumstances that allow definition of model objects appropriate for this special modeling. The paper is organized as follows. It starts with an introduction to virtual teaching procedures in Internet environment. Following this, local and global views of virtuality are discussed and main advantages of virtual education are noticed. Then application purposed evaluation of the cited course model is given. Finally, possibilities for implementation of virtual classroom in higher education practice are concluded.

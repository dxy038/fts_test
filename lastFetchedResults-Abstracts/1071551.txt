Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) minced (SCM), as ready-to-cook and high nutritious product, can successfully introduce to consumers and significantly dissolve current problems of limited demand for whole/fresh market. Short shelf-life is a most important barrier to developing industrial production of minced fish. Application of Hurdle technology with minimally processing to improve storage life of fresh seafood has become increasingly popular. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of lowring temperature (3-5 oC), Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) (50:5:45 for N2:O2:CO2) and Green Tea Extract (GTE) (1000 ppm) with Aerobic packaging (AP), on the chemical and sensory changes of SCM during refrigerated storage. Total polyphenolic compounds in GTE was measured 14.33±0.88 ?g/ml. Results of Peroxide Value showed that all treatments can effectively protect SCM against primary oil oxidation after 4 days. Using MAP and/or GTE treatments reduced the Free Fatty Acids (FFA) formation ratio, because, in contrast with AP treatment, FFA increased significantely (P < 0.05), only after 16 days storage. Thiobarbitoric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) of AP samples in 16th days was 2.51±0.21 mg that was upper than rejection level. Effects of GTE treatment on TBARS increasing was not significantly different compared with AP. pH trends were ascending and GTE and MAP treatments had no significant effects on pH increasing. According to sensory evaluation, MAP had higher total quality score compared with GTE treatment and showed no significant difference with MAP+TE during storage, suggested that MAP more effectively retards and/or inhibits microbial growth in refrigerated SCM.Combined treatment (MAP+GTE) was selected as an effective method that can extend the shelf-life of SCM up to 4 days at refrigerated storage.

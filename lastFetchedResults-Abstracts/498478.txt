Climate is the significant factor in development of tourism section activities. Therefore, the main objective of this study is investigation of climatic condition impacts during the year on tourism and recreational activities in Marvdasht. Hence, the total monthly precipitation and average of temperature, hours of sunshine, wind speed, relative humidity, minimum relative humidity and maximum temperature data of Dorodzan Dam synoptic station for 18 years statistical period (1987-2006) were used as well as the number of tourists who visited Achaemenian historical complex during 10 years statistical period (1997-2007). For analyzing the effect of these parameters on tourism activities, Tourism Climatic Index (TCI) was used. The results revealed that winter months (Jan, Feb, March and December) are not suitable for tourism activities because of the precipitation and low temperatures but spring and fall months (April, May, October and September) have the best conditions for tourism activities in Marvdasht. Also, June, July and August are not desirable for tourists because of high temperatures. According to the results, there is a significant positive correlation between the number of the tourists and average air temperature, hours of sunshine and wind blow parameters, while there is a negative correlation between number of tourists and humidity and precipitation.

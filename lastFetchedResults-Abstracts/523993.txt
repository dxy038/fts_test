Objective: This study was performed to determine the effects of solder fume on liver
serum markers and vascular elements in rats
Materials and Methods: A total number of 48 rats were randomly divided into experi- mental (n=30) and control (n=18) groups. Based on exposure time, each group was further divided into 2, 4 and 6 weeks of exposure subgroups. Rats in the experimental subgroups were placed in an exposure chamber and exposed to solder fume for one hour per day. The concentration of metal fumes and gases in the exposure chamber were measured daily by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Blood and liver samples were collected from all rats in the experimental and control subgroups to determine the concentration of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase,  aspartate ami- notransferase, as well as total and conjugated bilirubin levels. Histological examinations of specimens were performed under a stage-micrometer calibrated microscope. Results: Despite some alterations in enzyme and bilirubin levels between control and experimental  groups, the differences  were not statistically  significant.  However, his- topathological examinations of liver tissues revealed significant differences in the di- ameters of cross sectioned sinusoids of rats in the 4-week experimental and control subgroups (p < 0.001). Furthermore, there were significant differences in the diameters of cross-sectioned central venules of all experimental and control subgroup members (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that although solder fume in the acute phase of exposure of up to 4 weeks does not significantly change liver serum marker enzymes, it can greatly increase the  diameters of cross-sectioned hepatic sinusoids and the central venule.

Background and Objective: Self-directed learning readiness and learning styles are two important learning process characteristics. Individual learning must be considered in order to design and implement effective training. Therefore, this study was performed in order to determine the relationship between learning styles and self-directed learning readiness of nursing students.
Materials and Methods: All nursing students of Zanjan University of Medical Sciences were enrolled in a cross-sectional study in the second semester of the academic year in 2014. Data gathering instruments included 3 questionnaires of demographic features, Fisher`s self-directed learning readiness scale, and the Kolb's learning styles inventory. Data was analyzed by SPSS 16 using descriptive and interferential statistical methods.
Results: The mean scores of overall SDLR were 157.39Â±15.59 and students' learning styles was assimilator (9.54%). The total average readiness of SDL (P=0.039), self-management scope (P=0.031) and the scope of self-control (P= 0.021) had statistically significant differences in students with different learning styles. 
Conclusion: Considering these factors would be worthwhile in nursing education and in promoting nurses' training with regard to the lack of interest in the nursing field and dropping out of the course and profession.

Composite materials reinforced by fibers with enlarged ends are known to have significantly better strength and toughness than those reinforced by flat-end fibers. The objective of this study is to develop an analytical model to determine the importance of deformation of the enlarged end on the reinforcement performance of ellipsoidal enlarged-end fibers. The resisting pullout load of the fiber is composed of a component due to interfacial bond at the fiber/matrix interface and a component due to mechanical anchorage at the embedded enlarged end of the fiber. The component due to mechanical anchorage at the enlarged end is due to both mechanical interlock and deformation of the enlarged end. In the past, little has been done to account for the deformation of the enlarged end. To account for this component of the mechanical anchorage resistance at the embedded enlarged end, a spring component is introduced to connect the embedded fiber with the enlarged ellipsoid. Analytical solutions were derived to predict the effects of the rigid enlarged end shape on the pullout load and stress distribution. These solutions were then compared to finite element solutions. It is shown that the shape of enlarged end has a significant influence on the stress distribution of the short fiber. Specially, the model demonstrates that the enlarged ends deform significantly for some shapes and are not effective for long fibers.

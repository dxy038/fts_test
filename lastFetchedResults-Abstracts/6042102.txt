It is the intent of this paper to present both a broad overview of the total field of interference prediction and an analysis of past and current results obtained from specific prediction efforts. The broad overview portion of the paper consists largely of a discussion of the philosophy and purpose behind interference prediction efforts. The format of this overview will be an analysis of current system and equipment level problem areas conducted to establish (1) the areas in which interference predictions provide useful results, (2) why such predictions are necessary, (3) the primary objectives of interference prediction efforts, (4) the major factors involved in constructing accurate prediction models, and (5) the need for evaluation efforts to support prediction results. An analysis of past and current interference prediction efforts will be presented from a critical, but constructive, point of view. The efforts analyzed will include those intended to model equipment emissions and susceptibility thresholds based on limited spectrum signature data; system models involving a source, antenna, propagation factors, siting effects, and a receptor; environmental models concerned with relatively large geographical areas populated with many emitter-receptor combinations; etc. Based on the purpose, objective, and need for interference prediction in a broad sense and the detailed analysis of specific prediction efforts, needed developments, and improvements for the future are presented.

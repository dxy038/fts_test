In this research we approach to select most appropriate suppliers utilizing qualitative and
quantitative factors and order them lot size of product to supply and distribute them in
several period of time. to meet the objective of this research, a supplier selection multicriteria

decision making model is developed using QFD, AHP and mathematical
programming methods. this proposed model consist of two phases: qualitative and
quantitative. in qualitative phase, the potential suppliers are evaluated by means of
qualitative criterion and the result is the numerical weight of each supplier. These normalized
weights are deployed in purchase value function in quantitative phase. The ultimate goal of
this research is not reducing the cost alone, but to reduce the cost to the level that customer
satisfaction is provided.

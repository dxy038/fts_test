This paper present a study of casting compounds used in the electrical industry, especially in manufacturing and repairs of electric rotary machines. The basic types of casting resins and their basic application in the electrical industry are described. This paper focuses on electrical and mechanical properties of selected casting resins. The chosen diagnostic system should give an objective point of view on this usage of chosen casting compounds. The measurements of selected properties of chosen materials were performed. The materials are compared from the point of dielectric properties (reading of polarization and depolarization currents, volume resistivity, dissipation factor and breakdown voltage), flexural and tensile strength. At the end obtained results are discussed.

Method

Review of recent literature and authorâ€™ clinical and laboratory tudie.
Reult

Imaging technologie uch a confocal canning laer ophthalmocopy, canning laer polarimetry, and optical coherence tomography provide objective and quantitative meaurement that are highly reproducible and how very good agreement with clinical etimate of optic nerve head tructure and viual function. tructural aement provided by imaging complement optic dik photography in clinical care and have the potential to identify relevant tructural efficacy endpoint in glaucoma randomized clinical trial. A with other technologie, imaging may produce fale identification of glaucoma and it progreion; thu, clinician hould not make management deciion baed olely on the reult of one ingle tet or technology.
Concluion

Although optic dik tereophotography repreent the tandard for documentation of glaucomatou tructural damage in practice and reearch trial, advance in computerized imaging technology provide ueful meaure that ait the clinician in glaucoma diagnoi and monitoring and offer coniderable opportunity for ue a efficacy endpoint in clinical trial.

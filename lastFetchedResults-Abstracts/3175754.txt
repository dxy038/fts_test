Steering trapezoid mechanism of heavy truck is optimized applying Monte Carlo method. Movement precision during vehicle steering course is adopted as objective, and kingpins distance, axles distance, bottom angle of trapezoid mechanism and length of steering arm are defined as design variables, and minimum transmission angle and maximum angle error are considered as restriction condition. Results of deterministic optimization method and Monte Carlo optimization method are compared. The results show that movement precision based on Monte Carlo method is assured when design variables are little varied.

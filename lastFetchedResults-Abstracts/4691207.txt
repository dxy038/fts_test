Product configuration solution is a critical problem significantly affecting production efficiency, cost and the lead time. It plays an important role for enterprises to sharpen their cutting edge under mass customerization manufacturing mode. But configuration optimization without considering assembly sequencing is difficult to get global optimization. In this paper, a new multi-objective genetic algorithm for product configuration optimization based on assembly sequencing is proposed to meet the manufacturing requirements by considering impactive cost, lead time, inventory storage and assembly sequencing. It extends the products configuration optimization from design stage to assembly manufacturing stage. By means of this research, the valid solutions for products configuration optimization can be offered to the decision makers effectively.

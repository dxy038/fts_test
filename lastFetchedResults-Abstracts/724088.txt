Novel 6,8-difluoro-1-alkyl-5-amino-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-{4-substituted piperazin-1-yl}-quinoline-3-carboxylic acids, with the substituents at 4th position of piperazine being -[2(pyridine-4-carbonyl) hydrazono]propyl and -2 [(pyrazine-2-carbonyl) amino] ethyl, were synthesized and evaluated in vivo against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in Swiss albino mice. Test compounds exhibited activity comparable to that of sparfloxacin (survival rate, reduction of splenomegaly and reduced tubercular lesions) at a dose of 200 mg/kg.

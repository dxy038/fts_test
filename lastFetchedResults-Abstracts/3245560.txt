This paper reports on a study whose objective is to explore the potential and compare the performance of intelligent adaptive control methods. Specifically, the performance of PID plus an adaptive neural network compensator (ANNC) is compared with the performance of a fuzzy adaptive PID controller. The application is position control of a pneumatic gantry robot. Both controllers were carefully tuned to provide a fair comparison. Experimental results were collected for the tracking of a sine wave. Both adaptive controllers were found to improve tracking performance over fixed gain PID by upwards of 70%. However, the tuning procedure for the fuzzy controller is judged to be more intuitive in nature and hence, more practical than that for ANNC. The fuzzy adaptive controller uses a novel rule set that is reduced in size from that used in previous studies.

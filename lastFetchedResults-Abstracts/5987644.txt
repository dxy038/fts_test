The problem of embedding the watermark robustly within a host signal is discussed. The host signal is the image segments generated as described in our pervious related works [1-2]. Both the image segments and watermark are transformed into the discrete wavelet domain based on our above mentioned work. The image and watermark wavelet coefficients are then fused together. The integrated system takes into account the characteristics of the Human Visual System (HVS). Two keys are required for security due to the wavelet parameterization. The objective of the proposed system is to be adaptive and take into account the natural characteristics of the host image segments as well as providing security without affecting the robustness of the watermark.

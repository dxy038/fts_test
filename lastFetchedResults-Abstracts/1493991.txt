The Sanjiang Plain has become an intensive area of land use/cover change in China. However, little is known about the effect of cultivation on soil microbiological properties in this freshwater marsh ecosystem. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of cultivation on mineralizable, microbial biomass, and total C in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) was 4346 ± 309 mg kg−1 in undisturbed marsh and 229 mg kg−1 in soil cultivated for 15 years. Undisturbed marsh soil had the highest microbial quotient (3.64%), which declined with increasing cultivation time (R2 = 0.97, p &lt; 0.01). Metabolic quotient increased with increasing cultivation time. Soil C mineralization in undisturbed marsh was 3.5 times that in soil cultivated for 1 year, and was 12 times that in soil cultivated for 15 years. Cultivation strongly affected measured soil microbiological properties.

Alternative fuels and corresponding alternative automotive technologies have been seen in recent years as major potential contributors to head towards a sustainable transport system. The core objective of this paper is to investigate the perspectives of different alternative automotive technologies in a dynamic framework till 2050 in comparison to fossil fuel driven conventional cars from a technical, ecological and economic point-of-view. The technologies considered in this paper are: conventional and hybrid internal combustion engine, compressed natural gas-, flex-fuel-, battery electric- and fuel cell-vehicles. The most important results and conclusions of this analysis are: (i) The energetic improvements up to 2050 will lead to substantial reduction of energetic losses mainly in Tank-to-Wheel part of the energy service provision chain; (ii) By 2050 the total driving costs of all analyzed fuels and powertrains could almost even out; (iii) The major uncertainty regarding battery electric- and fuel cell- vehicles is how fast technological learning will take place especially for the battery and the fuel cells.

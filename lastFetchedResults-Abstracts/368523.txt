The objective of this study was to investigate the moisture absorption, physical–mechanical and bioadhesive properties of hot-melt extruded hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) films containing polymer additives. These additives included polyethylene glycol (PEG) 5%, polycarbophil 5%, carbomer 5%, Eudragit E-100 5%, and sodium starch glycolate (SSG) 5%. Relative humidity (RH) and temperature parameters of the films studied included 25°C at 0, 50, 80 and 100% RH, and 40°C at 0 and 100% RH, stored for 2 weeks. Tensile strength and percent elongation were determined on an Instron according to the ASTM standards. The bioadhesive properties of the HPC/PEG 3350 5% film and the polycarbophil 5% containing films, with and without PEG, were investigated in vivo on the human epidermis. Although all films studied exhibited an increase in percent water content as the percent RH increased, the SSG containing film exhibited an almost three-fold increase in percent water content compared to that of the HPC/PEG film. The temperature storage condition of 40°C/100% RH (versus 25°C/100% RH) increased the percent water content of the SSG containing film. Percent elongation was highest for films containing polycarbophil 5% (without PEG). In addition, the HPC film containing polycarbophil 5% exhibited a greater force of adhesion and elongation at adhesive failure in vivo, and a lower modulus of adhesion when compared to the HPC/PEG film. A novel approach to determine bioadhesion of films to the human epidermis is presented.

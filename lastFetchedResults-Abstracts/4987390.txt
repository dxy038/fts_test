In this paper, we study energy management algorithms for job scheduling. In our model, each job has a release time, a processing time, a reward, and a deadline. The objective is to maximize net profit, defined as the difference between the total reward achieved by completing jobs by their deadlines and the total energy consumption accrued during this course. The net profit model generalizes the well-studied minimum-energy model (Irani and Pruhs, ACM SIGACT News 2005, Baptiste et al. ESA 2007). For the net profit model, we discuss the hardness of the general case and design polynomial-time algorithms for a few important variants.

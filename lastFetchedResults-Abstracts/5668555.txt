Objective: To identify the thin layer of quercetin in Berchemia lineata and set up its content determination method. Methodology: To identify the quercetin in Berchemia lineate by adopting TLC (thin-layer chromatography); and to determine the content by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). The chromatographic column is Diamonsil ODS Cm (4.6 mm &#215; 250 mm, 5 &#956; m) and the mobile phase is acetonitrile - methanol (5:1) A: 0.1% phosphoric acid solution B (Gradient: 0-30min, 20-60%A). The flow velocity, detection wave length and the column temperature are 0.85mL/min, 360nm and 30 &#176;C respectively. Results: TLC (thin-layer chromatography) can identify the quercetin. The quercetin shows a good linearity within the range of 0.69 &#956; g~4.83 &#956; g, r=0.9998(n=7) and the average recovery rate is 99.8% (RSD: 1.27%, n=6). Conclusion: This method is simple, convenient and accurate and it could be used to control the quality of Berchemia lineate medicinal materials.

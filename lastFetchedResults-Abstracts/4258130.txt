In this paper we discuss a real-life problem in rail crew rostering. Specific emphasis is placed on the requirements of advanced approaches in rostering and the usage of optimization-based decision support. The modeling of the rostering problems is discussed including the treatment of constraints, the consideration of preferences, and the formulation of several objective functions. The specific solving method of the problem using an evolutionary algorithm and visualization and navigation tools for decision support are sketched briefly and some preliminary results are shown. Finally, some conclusions are presented.

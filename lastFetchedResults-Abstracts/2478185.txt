Abstract
Objective: The aquaporin5 (AQP5) is an integral membrane protein that plays an important role in maintaining water homeostasis in the lung. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of interval training on AQP5 levels in the lung of Male Wistar rats during puberty.
Methodology: 30 three-week male Wistar rats with average weight of 68Â±9 g were randomly divided into three groups included; the base, control and training groups. The training group ran on treadmill for 6 weeks (6 per week, 30 minutes each session at a speed of 15 to70 meters per minute). AQP5 levels were measured by ELISA methods. Analyzed is done with two-way ANOVA and LSD test at P < 0.05.
Results: Results showed significant differences between AQP5 levels of control, base and training groups (P < 0.05). While, there were no significant differences between AQP5 levels of control and base groups . Furthermore, six-weeks interval training increased AQP5 levels of lung tissue in exercise group compared to the control group by 229.03 and 284.9 percent.
Conclusion: It seems that an Increased interval training can improve the of epithelial cell performance and protect the AQP5 level changes during the puberty, and improve lung liquid homeostasis.

This letter reports the bonding of a small, thin-film GaAs-based emitter onto a larger silicon detector to realize spatial colocation of the emitter and detector. These colocated devices enable single fiber bidirectional communication between the two analog/digital silicon circuits that contain the emitter/detector pairs. Bidirectional communication between two of these circuits is demonstrated with a single plastic optical fiber.

In order to enhance the practicality of digital watermarking, watermark perceptibility and robustness must be ensured. Taking human visual system characteristics into account fully, a digital watermarking multi-objective optimization based on multi-wavelet method is proposed. It utilizes Sa4 multi-wavelet to embed digital watermark, chooses intermediate frequency in embedding digital watermark adaptively according to the size of every energy mass, and uses multi-objective optimization method based on genetic algorithm to optimize and adjust the embedded depth to obtain optimal effect. Experiments show the new algorithm we proposed not only is robust to attacks, but also ensures the quality of watermarking-embed image.

Detection of magnetic domain walls is described using a 200 kV transmission electron microscope to obtain deflection patterns, or distributions of electron beams around the undeflected beam in the focal plane of the objective. A technique by which domain walls may be distinguished with high angular resolution is described. Two sets of photographs, showing defocused images of domain walls and the corresponding deflection patterns, are presented. Characteristics of the deflection patterns are described, and patterns are reconstructed into domain walls. The resulting domain wall structures of the Fe evaporated samples are more complicated than had previously been believed.

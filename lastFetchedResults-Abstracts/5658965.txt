Nowadays SiGe HBTs are surpassing even the fastest III-V production devices in the high-speed orbit. In this paper a comprehensive course of action to model the power gain of High Frequency 100 nm SiGe HBT is depicted with the help of S and Y- parameters. In this effort, the issues entailed in simultaneous optimization of f<sub>max</sub> are addressed as well as measurements of power-gain are carried out. This gain of the SiGe HBTs is advanced to those of III-V semiconductor devices. A corroboration of objective validity of the modeling scheme and the extraction of parameter is accomplished in the form of S-parameters. These results have been validated using a viable numerical device simulator ATLAS from Silvaco International.

Objective To estimate the excess costs
associated with bipolar disorders in Australia, based on
prevalence (using the Mood Disorder Questionnaire
(MDQ)) and associated excess burden-of-illness costs.
Methods Using data from the 2004 South Australian
Health Omnibus Survey (HOS), a weighted cross-sectional
survey of 3,015 adults, excess costs were estimated
from health service utilisation. Results There
was a 2.5% lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorders,
delineated by the MDQ. Those persons (MDQ positive)
reported a significantly greater use of services and a
poorer health status and quality of life than those who
were MDQ negative. Using the service provision perspective,
excess costs of bipolar disorders in Australia
were approx $3.97â€“$4.95 billion. Conclusions These
results from an Australian population demonstrate the
significant economic burden of bipolar disorders. Our
findings emphasise the need for further evaluation of
the cost-effectiveness of different treatments, or alternative
means of reducing the burden borne by individuals,
the health system and the general community.

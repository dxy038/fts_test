Abstract: Recently, Efficiency and reliability improvement of electrical distribution systems have been received a great deal of attentions. Protective and switching devices are one of the most important parameters for improving the system reliability. In most researches carried out about optimization of allocation of protective and switching devices, single objective function has been used. Since by using the single objective function, all indices are not satisfied, in this paper, a novel approach based on multi-objective function has been proposed. The introduced objective function including system average interruption frequency (SAIFI) and total cost. By applying the proposed method, both of mentioned indices are optimally satisfied. The multi-objective optimization has been applied to a typical distribution system. The obtained results in comparison with current condition of system and results of single objective function indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

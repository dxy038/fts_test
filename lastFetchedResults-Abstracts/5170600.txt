The design and construction of an S-band space-fed phased array antenna are presented. The antenna is a major unit of the MARS (Meliorated Advanced Radar System), an S-band, space-fed phased array, multifunction, mobile radar system designed for pointing defense. A prototype scaled-down MARS space-fed array antenna was designed an built with 254 radiation elements. The crucial objective of this program was to demonstrate the feasibility of producing a low-cost, high-performance, easy-to-maintain, electronically phased array antenna. The critical components have been well developed and tested.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

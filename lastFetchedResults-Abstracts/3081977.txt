We propose a simple nearly-optimal heuristic algorithm for multicast tree construction in static ad hoc networks. The objective is to deliver a data packet from a source node to a set of destination nodes with a sequence of transmissions so that the sum of given transmission-related costs is minimized. Also a brute-force enumeration method is described to obtain optimal solutions to the problem in unit cost case. Performance of the algorithms is compared against existing methods by simulations.

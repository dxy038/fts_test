Nowadays there are many people affected by hearing impairments. The cost of assistive listening devices leaves out of reach for many people a technological solution. In the search of an economical alternative, low-cost DSPs arises as a good choice. However, it could be difficult to decide which has the best cost - effectiveness trade off among all devices offered in the market. The main goal of this work, then, is to determine the memory requirements of three noise reduction methods. It is done in order to select the algorithm that uses fewer resources, which will be implemented on a hearing aid device based on a low-cost DSP. This assistive listening device through digital signal processing techniques can get the basic features of a high-end assistive listening device. Objective experiments are performed to analyze the performance of the implemented system..

The objective of this paper is to analyze Southern Regional Grid of India(SRGI). The main focus is to stabilize SRGI from the worst possible fault scenario, for which a comprehensive study of SRGI is done with the help of PSAT. The power system is reviewed with main focus on stability and power system modeling. The main concern is to maintain integrity of the system during disturbance so that whole system remains intact with all the parameters bounded within limits. Transient stability of the system is thus thoroughly studied and appropriate measures are suggested during occurrence of any disturbance. Primary contributions of this work include transient state analysis of the system for evaluation of the effects of limitations on system stability, analysis of worst case scenario, and provision of appropriate measures to avert such a scenario, with the help of advanced controllers such as TCSC(Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator), AVR(Automatic Voltage Regulator).

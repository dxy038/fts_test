This paper examines and proposes an intelligent solution for 11controlling of water level in a dynamic water distribution system. Principle objective of the controller is to provide required water quantity with a required minimum head while keeping the motor in its most efficient region. In order to achieve these objectives, a prototype of water level control system has been built and an intelligent fuzzy logic control algorithm is developed. Water level of the tank is fixed by an intelligent algorithm. This algorithm will predict the optimal water level which needs to be maintained. Fuzzy algorithm is developed and tuned using Simulink embed into micro-controller and their performances are compared.

In this work, we study the bidirectional broadcast channel with common and confidential messages and establish the capacity-equivocation and secrecy capacity regions. This problem is motivated by the concept of bidirectional relaying in a three-node network, where a relay node establishes a bidirectional communication between two other nodes using a decode-and-forward protocol and thereby efficiently integrates additional common and confidential services.

This paper aims to present the objectives and potential applications for the cooperative shadowing systems and the corresponding algorithms for the specific tasks. A definition of a cooperative shadowing system is given. The main objective of this system is still to maintain the desired formation. Differing from other cooperative formation tasks, a co-linear relative position configuration of agents is required to achieve the objective. Decentralized control strategies are preserved. Different characters of the agents are discussed and the relative controllers are developed for each agent character. A speed-only approach is proposed for the applications with agents having turning rate constraints. Relative bearing is the only parameter measured for control purposes. A series of tasks are designed and implemented for evaluating the performances of controllers. Simulation and experimental results are provided and analyzed for improvements and further developments.

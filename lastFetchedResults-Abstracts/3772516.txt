With the use of a comprehensive spectral and spatial computer model, the authors analyze the performance that can be expected in fluorophosphate (FP) glass erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) with 800 nm band pumping. Due to the smaller excited state absorption, the fluorophosphate host glass shows about a 4 dB advantage in small signal gain (SSG) over alumino-silicate EDFAs with bidirectional pumping, and nearly double the output signal power under similar conditions.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

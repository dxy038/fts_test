Objective: To evaluate frame constructs, surgical technique, postoperative care, complications, treatment duration, and outcome of circular external fixation (CEF) for treatment of 30 antebrachial and crural angular deformities in dogs.  Study Design: Retrospective study. Sample Population: Twenty-seven dogs with limb deformities. Methods: Medical records of dogs that underwent surgery with CEF for angular deformities were examined for kind of deformity, frame configuration, surgical technique, treatment duration, complications and outcome. Results: Thirty angular deformities in twenty-seven dogs were corrected using CEF. The mean time of external fixation was 72 days (median ± SD, 65 ± 27 days). Minor and/or major complications were recorded in 26 out of 30 cases. Functional and cosmetic outcomes were considered excellent in 14 cases (46.2%), good in 14 cases (46.2%), and fair in two cases (6.6%). Radiographic outcomes were considered excellent in 14 cases (46.2%), good in 15 cases (49.5%), and fair in one case (3.3%). Conclusion: Although complications were present in 26 out 30 cases, the functional and radiographic outcomes of circular external fixation was considered excellent or good in 92% of cases treated for limb deformities. Clinical Relevance: CEF is an effective treatment modality for antebrachial and crural angular deformities and bone lengthening in dogs. Progressive correction is required for severe angular deformities and lengthening, thus reducing the risk of vascular and/or neurological damage to soft tissues. Complications are frequent, but can be successfully managed in most instances.

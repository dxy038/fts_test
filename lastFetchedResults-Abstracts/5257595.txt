This paper presents design and planning methods for the development of renewable energy microgrids in remote systems using the sustainability philosophy as guiding framework. The development of microgrids brings a new paradigm in energy consumption of end-users, thus it is required to build a strong social agreement among a microgridÂ´s stakeholders. Consequences and possible scenarios for stakeholder engagement are discussed. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm is proposed to balance the diverse and often conflicting technical, economical, environmental and social goals related to energy sustainability.

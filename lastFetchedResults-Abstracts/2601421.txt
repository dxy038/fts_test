Introduction:Mycobacterium bovis is the principal cause of bovine tuberculosis in bovids. In the present work, isolation, identification and genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTbC) isolates collected from slaughtered reactor (tuberculinepositive) cattle in Qum province using RFLPPGRS are addressed.
Materials and methods: From January 2012 to February 2013, major head and trunk lymph nodes from a total of 30 carcasses originating from reactor cattle were collected at Qum abbatoir. These were all cultured on gycerinated and pyruvated LowensteinJensen slopes and incubation at 37Â°C 812 weeks. Slopes bearing acidfast bacterial growth were subjected PCRIS6110 in searching for MTbC isolates. The identified MTbC complex isoltes were strain typed by RFLPPGRS.
Results: Totally, PCRIS6110 experiment detected MTbC in 21 specimens. Genotyping these by RFLPPGRS resulted characterization of 3 different genotypes.
Discussion and conclusion: Isolation of MTbC bacteria from tuberculinated cattle of Qum province raises public health concern due to the likely transmission of infection to human subjects. Identification of three RFLPPGRS types between the 21 collected isolates from Qum is a reflection of coexistence of different MTbC strains and genetic diversity in the region, the extent of this diversity however, remains to be assessed by further epidemiological works. Taking the current level of genetic diversity between MTbC bacteria in Qum into account, reconsideration of the existing testandslaughter scheme seems necessary.

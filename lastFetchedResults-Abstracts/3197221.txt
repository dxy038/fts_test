Launched in June 2010, TanDEM-X is an interferometric mission with the main goal of providing a high-resolution, global and unprecedentedly accurate digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth by means of single-pass X-band SAR interferometry. Despite its usual quasi-monostatic configuration, TanDEM-X is the first genuinely bistatic SAR system in space. During its monostatic commissioning phase, the system was operated in pursuit monostatic mode. During that time, some pioneering bistatic SAR experiments with both satellites commanded in non-nominal modes were conducted with the main purpose of testing the performance of both space and ground segments in very demanding scenarios. In particular, this article includes results of the first bistatic acquisition and the first single-pass interferometric (mono/bistatic) acquisition with TanDEM-X, addressing their innovative aspects and focussing on the analysis of the experimental results. Even in the absence of essential synchronisation and calibration information, bistatic images and interferogramswith similar quality to pursuit monostatic have been obtained. Some months later, with TanDEM-X already in its operational DEM-acquisition phase a further challenging bistatic acquisition carried out in cooperation with DLRÂ´s airborne radar F-SAR has been carried out. The objective was to acquire fully polarimetric interferometric data with a high range of available bistatic angles. A dedicated commanding of both TanDEM-X and F-SAR was required, including irregular sampling schemes, partially missing bistatic echo reception and bistatic synchronisation, which pose a number of technological challenges in SAR data processing before the calibrated bistatic SAR images are obtained. This article reports about these two set of experiments.

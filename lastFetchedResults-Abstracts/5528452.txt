In radar literature, the sidelobes reduction techniques using synthesis of some proper nonlinear FM (NLFM) laws represents a major scientific research direction. Accordingly, in order to assure the sidelobes suppression, the main objective of this paper is to present an adequate synthesis algorithm of some NLFM laws based on stationary phase principle. The achieved experimental results confirm a significant sidelobes reduction (i.e., more than -40 dB) without necessity to apply some weighting techniques. Finally, the analysis of the synthesized NLFM laws by ambiguity function tool was also discussed.

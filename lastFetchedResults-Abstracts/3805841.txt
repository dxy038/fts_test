This paper describes a class of the mixed H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimisation with model-matching problems. The sensitivity and stability margin objectives are integrated in the model-matching design, respectively. Both approaches give a means of directly accessing the sensitivity/robustness objectives through a trade-off on the perfect model-matching objective. These applications to the known H<sub>&#8734; </sub> theory thus deal with important objectives such as multivariable interaction, which cannot be easily captured in the existing mixed sensitivity design

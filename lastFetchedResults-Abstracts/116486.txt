The correct planning of rural buildings results from the analysis of several interconnected factors, some related to the function that the building will perform, others to the relationship between the building and the environment. The planning process should first find the best location for the development in order for it to fit into the environment, considering the availability both of suitable conditions and of facilities needed for the building and the activities that will be done inside it. This research suggests a methodological framework for the location of a dairy processing plant that is intended to improve the current standards of the pit-cheese industry of Sogliano al Rubicone (Emilia Romagna region, Italy) by centralizing the processing of milk into cheese at a single processing site, to be constructed within an area defined as the investigation coverage area. Location planning considered several parameters separately and then combined them according to methods found in the technical and scientific literature and using the authorsâ€™ personal expertise. Production sites and trends in raw material inflows were determined, and town planning constraints, morphological and land use criticalities, and infrastructure were analyzed. Suitable sites obtained with this method were listed according to the results of calculations regarding the transport of milk on the road network. The proposed framework, which is subject to be integrated, improved, and modified in its different parts, led to the results in an objective and transparent way by means of its modular structure, and its methodological approach proved to be satisfactory and of general validity.

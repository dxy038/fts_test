The need for efficient and accurate processing of DICOM medical images has increased recently due to the distribution systems with diagnosis and treatment planning. The objective of this work is to develop a tool for the clinician and researcher for processing and analyzing DICOM images starting from a series of scintigraphic dynamic renal images. Tracing the regions of interest of kidneys by hand is time-consuming. Instead, the goal is a semi-automatic segmentation technique which finds the desired regions automatically. This can be done using fast marching methods. Thus, our system can automatically generate entire curves of renal function to determine the relative function. This tool is a step forward in the field of medical image processing, waiting to receive expert advice.

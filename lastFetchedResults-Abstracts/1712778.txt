Novel electron-optical components and concepts aiming at improving the throughput and extending the applications of a low energy electron microscope (LEEM) have been developed. An immersion magnetic objective lens can substantially reduce eâ€“e interactions and the associated blur, as electrons do not form a sharp crossover in the back-focal plane. The resulting limited field of view of the immersion objective lens in mirror mode can be eliminated by immersing the cathode of the electron gun in a magnetic field. A dual illumination beam approach is used to mitigate the charging effects when the LEEM is used to image insulating surfaces. The negative charging effect, created by a partially absorbed mirror beam, is compensated by the positive charging effect of the secondary beam with an electron yield exceeding 1. On substrates illuminated with a tilted beam near glancing incidence, large shadows are formed on even the smallest topographic features, easing their detection. On magnetic substrates, the magnetic flux leaking above the surface can be detected with tilted illumination and used to image domain walls with high contrast.

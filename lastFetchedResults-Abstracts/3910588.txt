A new design method for regulator problems for singularly perturbed systems is proposed in this paper. In contrast to previous papers using the Riccati equation approach and composite controls, a direct control without any Riccati equation is presented. It is applicable to solving a regulator problem for time invariant and time-varying systems with unconstrained controls as well as with constrained controls. The approach is based on a version of the Tikhonov theorem in L<sub>2</sub> for solutions of singularly perturbed systems to be proved in the paper and some techniques of sensitivity analysis for optimization with strictly convex objective functions

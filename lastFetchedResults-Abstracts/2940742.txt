Simple, robust CMOS circuitry for implementation of bidirectional analog pulse delay lines is presented. These nonlinear, active delay lines are able to propagate and regenerate an analog voltage pulse in either direction and exhibit electrical characteristics similar to axonal membrane and dendritic trees in biological neurons. The key characteristic of the bidirectional pulse generation components is the implementation of an inhibition or refractory period

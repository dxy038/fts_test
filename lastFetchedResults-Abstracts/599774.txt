
Introduction: In restorative dentistry, selecting the
proper material is an important factor for clinical
success. The objective of this study was clinical
evaluation of survival time of three tooth color materials
in primary anterior teeth. Methods: In this
interventional clinical trial study, 94 deciduous anterior
teeth (36 teeth in boys, 58 teeth in girls) belonging to 3-
5 year old children in Pediatric Department of Mashhad
Faculty of Dentistry, Iran were selected. Selective
dental materials included compoglass, glass-ionomer
Fuji II LC, and composite resin. The data were analyzed
with Kaplanâ€“Meyer and Log rank test. Results:
compoglass had the highest survival time in comparison
with composite and glass-ionomer. Nine months
retention rate for teeth restored with compoglass,
composite resin and glass-ionomer were estimated:
95%, 21%, and 12.5%, respectively. Conclusion:
Compoglass can be a suitable material for anterior
primary teeth restoration

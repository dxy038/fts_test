In this paper, an objective method for the evaluation of mental stress has been proposed using physiological sensors. Brain and autonomous nervous system are believed to be affected by stress. It will be useful to measure the changes of physiological signals in these parts to evaluate stress. Stress stimuli which should be used in physiological studies to evolve stress has very crucial role in generating good results. Correlation of results from multiple sensors data can enhance the accuracy of results and can provide a common metric to evaluate mental stress.

Background: We prospectively examined quality of life (QOL) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with nephrectomy followed by heat shock protein peptide complex 96 (HSPPC-96) vaccine, a nontoxic, active, specific immunotherapy. Materials and methods: QOL and intrusive thoughts were measured in 36 patients with newly diagnosed stage IV renal cell carcinoma at the start of treatment, 3 weeks later on the final day of treatment, and at follow-up 1 month later. At each assessment, patients completed the RAND 36-Item Health Survey and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). Results: Mixed model analyses revealed a significant improvement over time in the Physical Component Summary score (p&lt;0.0001) and no significant change over time in the Mental Component Summary score or the IES scores. In comparisons with other populations, at the 1-month follow-up assessment, patients reported significantly worse QOL than the general population on the physical dimensions and similar QOL on the psychosocial and emotional dimensions, a similar QOL to that in patients with type II diabetes, and a significantly better QOL on four dimensions than that in patients with congestive heart failure. Conclusion: QOL remained stable or improved during treatment with the HSPPC-96 vaccine.

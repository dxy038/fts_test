The over-constrained airport gate assignment problem was considered, and genetic algorithm was implemented to solve the problem. The objective was to minimize the total walking distances, where the flights which were assigned to apron were punished. In order to enhance the search efficiency, initial solutions had good schemata. The optimum assignments satisfy the number of flights assigned to apron is minimum, and those flights have least influence on objective. Finally, MATLAB is proposed to implement the algorithm

A massively parallel computer is being built in a collaboration between IBM, German and Italian universities and FZ Juelich. Each computing node consists of an enhanced Cell processor and a network processor which provides 6 bidirectional communication links. The communication links are based on 10 GBit Ethernet technology. The computer will be used for QCD calculations, but other applications are considered.

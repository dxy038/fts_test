The World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) World Health Report 2010, “Health systems financing, the path to
universal coverage,” promoted universal health coverage (UHC) as an aspirational objective for country health
systems. Yet, in addition to the dimensions of services and coverage, distribution of coverage in the population,
and financial risk protection highlighted by the report, the consideration of the budget constraint should be
further strengthened in the ensuing debate on resource allocation toward UHC. Beyond the substantial financial
constraints faced by low- and middle-income countries, additional considerations, such as the geographical
context, the underlying country infrastructure, and the architecture of health systems, determine the feasibility,
effectiveness, quality and cost of healthcare delivery. Therefore, increased production and use of local evidence
tied to the criteria of health benefits, equity, financial risk protection, and costs accompanying health delivery
are needed so that to highlight pathways and acceptable trade-offs toward UHC.

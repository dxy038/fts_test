In this paper, the mean flowtime and the makespan objectives are simultaneously investigated in a single product, m-machine, flowshop system. For this purpose, an efficiency frontier approach is applied and an optimal algorithm for generating all efficient solutions is developed. A comprehensive computational experiment is performed for analyzing the tradeoff between the two objectives and evaluating the proposed algorithm performance. The most-balanced-solution, MinMax, is defined and recommended as a desirable alternative for either the flowtime or the makespan optimal solutions. Results show that when the system is optimized for either the mean flowtime or the makespan, a significant loss in the nonoptimized objective value is observed. On the other hand, adopting the MinMax solution obtains a close to optimal solution in both objectives.

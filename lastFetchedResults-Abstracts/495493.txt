This paper addresses the age groups as one of the new sources of social
inequality and stratification and the way in which differences in cultural
orientation as the outcome are taking. The main objective of the paper is
to examine the differences or contradictions of values and attitudes of the
mentioned groups. To this end, we examined the previous researches
according to qualitative meta-analysis method. The results verified that
the assumption of the existence a gap between the young and the adult is
not real. However, despite the similarities between the fundamental
assumptions and end values of age groups, their approaches towards
obtaining these values and instrumental orientations are noticeably
different. In fact, it can be claimed that some of the structural changes are
apparently caused by the spread of learning involving all social and age
groups, whereas some others have been int1ucnced by special young
groups.

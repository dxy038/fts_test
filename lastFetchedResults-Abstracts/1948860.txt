We examined the influence of fibrous fractions of biomass on biochemical methane potential (BMP) with the objective of developing an economical and easy-to-use statistical model to predict BMP, and hence the biodegradability of organic material (BD) for biogas production. The model was developed either for energy crops (grass, maize, and straw) or for animal manures, or as a combined model for these two biomass groups. It was found that lignin concentration in volatile solids (VS) was the strongest predictor of BMP for all the biomass samples. The square of the sample correlation coefficient (R2) from the BMP versus lignin was 0.908 (p &lt; 0.0001), 0.763 (p &lt; 0.001) and 0.883 (p &lt; 0.001) for animal manure, energy crops and the combined model, respectively. Validation of the combined model was carried out using 65 datasets from the literature.

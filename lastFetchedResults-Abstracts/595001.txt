Objective: To record the experience of a non-hernia specialist general surgeon with the Tension Free Mesh Hernioplasty.Material and Methods: Of the total, 67 (70%) cases were performed under local anaesthesia; the remaining 29 (30%) had general anaesthesia. This is a prospective study of 96 men that underwent the Lichtenstein Tension-free mesh hernioplasty, from February 1997 to February 2000, a total period of three years. The study was conducted at the surgical department of Khyber Teaching Hospital. Results: After a minimum follow-up period of 2 years, not a single recurrence was noted. The overall sepsis rate was 3%, and residual neuralgia was recorded in 2% cases. No prosthesis required removal.Conclusion: The study confirms the safety and efficacy of the TFM Hernioplasty as a treatment modality for inguinal hernias. Furthermore the study also reveals the fact that similar results to those reported by the Lichtenstein Clinic can be reproduced in the hands of the "real world" of general surgeons.

Background: Lung disorders are important for prognosis of connective tissue
disease (CTD). Thus, chest radiography, High Resolution Computed
Tomography (HRCT) of the chest and ultrasonic echocardiogram are suggested
after the diagnosis of these conditions. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate chest HRCT findings in patients with CTD.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, we evaluated
HRCT findings in patients with (CTD) hospitalized in Imam Reza Hospital in
Mashhad from 2006- 2011. Patientsâ€™ age, sex, type of rheumatic disease and
HRCT results were collected and analyzed by SPSS version 16.0 software.
Results: out of 75 patients (78.67% females, 21.33% males with a mean age of
41.6 years), 56% had respiratory symptoms. Scleroderma was the most common
disease (38.6%) followed by rheumatoid arthritis (26.6%) and systemic lupus
erythematosus (14.6%). Interstitial tissue involvement of the lung was the most
frequent finding in patients with scleroderma, dermatomyositis, polymyositis
and Sjogren's syndrome (48.3%, 57.1%, 60% and 66.7%, respectively). Pleural
thickening was the most common finding in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
(45%). Pleural effusion was the most frequent finding in patients with systemic
lupus erythematosus (45.4%). Lymphadenopathy and bronchiectasis had the
lowest prevalence (1.3%).
Conclusion: Our data shows that interstitial tissue involvement, pleural
thickening and pleural effusion are common in patients with rheumatic
diseases which is consistent with some previous studies.

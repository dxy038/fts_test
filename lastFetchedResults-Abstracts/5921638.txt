Because of the existence of complexity and indetermination in the merger &amp; acquisition (M&amp;A), so as to achieve the ultimate objective of mergers and acquisitions, there must be a clear understanding about the self-organization and synergy of the M&amp;A system. This paper conducts a research and makes a comprehensive evaluation for the merges bargain indetermination from the angle of complexity science. In the process of studying, beginning with the M&amp;A involvers, trading environment and trading market, we analyze the uncertainty of the system, and then create a structure diagram for the uncertainty, and apply the complex theories to carry on a comprehensive evaluation.

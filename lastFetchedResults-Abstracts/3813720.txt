The applicability of switched-capacitor (SC) components to the design of nonlinear networks is extensively discussed in this paper. The main objective is to show that SC\Â´s can be efficiently used for designing nonlinear networks. Moreover, the design methods to be proposed here are fully compatible with general synthesis methods for nonlinear <img src="/images/tex/23.gif" alt="n"/> -ports. Different circuit alternatives are given and their potentials are evaluated.

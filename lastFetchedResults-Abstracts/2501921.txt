Energy, economic and environmental analysis have been employed in order to optimize optimal (nominal)
capacity of a combined cooling, heating and power system in a water sports complex. Design parameters
are nominal capacity and number of gas engines and their partial load, heat capacity of boiler and cooling
capacity of electricity and absorption chillers. These parameters are optimized either in the scenarios of
possibility of selling electricity (SS) or impossibility of selling scenarios (SNS). Design parameters are
optimized using genetic algorithm and a multi criteria objective function that is called relative annual
profit (RAB). Next, how to select optimal capacity of gas engine has been investigated economically,
saving fuel and controlling the pollutants (CO, NOx, and CO2). Optimization results illustrate that two
gas engine with capacity of 130 kW and 150 kW have the maximum value of objective function in the
scenarios of possibility of selling electricity, while in the impossibility of selling scenarios the maximum
value of goal function is for on 120 kW gas engine. In addition, the results reveal that payback periods
on investment are increased (decreased) when two similar capacity are chosen in the cases of SS (SNS).
Moreover, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are decreased (increased) in the scenarios of SS (SNS).

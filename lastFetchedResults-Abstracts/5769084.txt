Robotics in hostile environment are affected by the effects of the total gamma dose on microcomputing electronic components. A dose of 1000 grays is expected particularly for the CMOS technology. A test equipment adapted to these components is developed in order to investigate their irradiation hardness assurance. Test after irradiation, test on line and nominal running test on line methods are described. Different results obtained for numerous components are presented to compare the methods and to determine which components have reached the objective

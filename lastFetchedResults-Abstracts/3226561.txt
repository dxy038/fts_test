This paper analyzes the performance of dc motor by using series input dc voltage sources. Bidirectional switches are employed to the series input dc voltage sources (MLI). Bidirectional switches are employed to the MLI to reduce the cost of the system. By applying the output of multilevel inverter to dc motor, its characteristics are described. In order to verify the results MATLAB/Simulink is preferred. The circuit of dc motor with series input dc voltage sources is designed by using simulink.

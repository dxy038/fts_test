This paper deals with a flight envelope protection control scheme. The objective of the flight envelope protection controller is to prevent the pilot or flight control system from making control inputs that would force the aircraft get out of the flight envelope. The main contribution of this paper is to modify the dynamic trim algorithm using the 1<sup>st</sup> order differential term. To verify the performance of the proposed controller, numerical simulations are performed for the velocity restriction of non-linear aircraft model.

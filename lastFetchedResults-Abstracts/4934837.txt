Transport problems in Bangkok are characterized by: long queues of waiting vehicles with unpredictable journey times, low level of public transport services, high traffic incidents creating long delays, poor road hierarchy, and high levels of suspended particulates and carbon monoxide emissions from vehicles.

The relief of traffic congestion is no longer the primary policy objective but rather concentration has shifted to address the adverse effect on the community of poor air quality and excessive levels of noise in urban areas.

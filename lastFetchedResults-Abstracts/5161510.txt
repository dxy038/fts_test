Among the reasons for the Mobile TV based on DVB-H has not had a success similar to conventional TV are: the inability of the DVB-H to support bidirectional service consumption, time to hop from one channel to another, the low average time on the use of mobile TV, the few devices that support the standard. This paper presents a content recommendation system based on collaborative filtering as an alternative to the problem of channel hopping; the recommender is framed within the Architecture for Mobile TV services and has been evaluated within the &#8220;virtual academic communities&#8221; of the project: ST-CAV at the University of Cauca.

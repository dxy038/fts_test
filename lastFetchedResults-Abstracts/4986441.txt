The objective of this investigation is to explore the feasibility of obtaining body surface Laplacian maps (BSLMs) using an array of unipolar electrodes. Body surface Laplacian maps (BSLMs) were investigated over the anterolateral chest of 12 healthy human subjects. 150 unipolar disk electrodes were used to record the potentials over the chest. The Laplacian ECG was estimated from recorded potentials using a 5-point finite difference estimation algorithm. Multiple areas of positive and negative activities were observed in all subjects. Consistent occurrence of sequential activities was observed in nearly all subjects. More spatial detail was observed in the BSLMs as compared with the potential maps in all subjects. The present results demonstrate that the present protocol provides an easy-to-use method to measure the BSLMs over the anterolateral chest in man

Objective: This study was undertaken to determine whether obstetric factors affect the concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 in the amniotic fluid. Study Design: We prospectively collected amniotic fluid samples from 109 women at various stages of pregnancy and labor and determined matrix metalloproteinase 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 concentrations by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent sandwich assay systems. With multiple regression analysis we evaluated relationships between amniotic fluid matrix metalloproteinase 9 concentration and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 concentration and the following factors: gestational age, presence of labor, cervical dilatation, membrane status, presence of clinical chorioamnionitis, and microbial colonization of the amniotic fluid. Results: The detectable presence of amniotic fluid matrix metalloproteinase 9 was independently associated with intra-amniotic infection, labor, cervical dilatation, and spontaneous rupture of membranes. Chorioamnionitis and amniotic fluid matrix metalloproteinase 9 concentrations were correlated with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 levels. Conclusions: Intra-amniotic infection, advanced labor, and rupture of membranes before the onset of labor were independently associated with the presence of matrix metalloproteinase 9 in the amniotic fluid. Both pathologic and physiologic processes appear to produce shifts in the balance between degradation and synthesis of the extracellular matrix. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:159-64.)

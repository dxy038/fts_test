Disposal of sewage sludge is an increasingly expensive and environmentally sensitive problem throughout the world. Preparation of activated carbon from sewage sludge offers an attractive re-use alternative to the traditional disposal routes. The objective of this research work was to compare anaerobically digested sewage sludge (DS) and undigested sewage sludge (US) as source materials in the preparation of activated carbons. Prior to the preparation the properties of the two types of sewage sludges were determined and compared. Subsequently the sludge samples were activated with 5 M ZnCl2 solution and thereafter pyrolysed at heating temperature of 650°C for 2 h with the heating rate of 15°C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The produced activated carbons were characterised by surface area and porosity analysis, CHN elemental composition and ash contents determination, and aqueous phase phenol adsorption tests. The results indicate that in comparison with the DS, the US had a higher carbon content and lower ash content, and accordingly yielded a better activated carbon with a higher BET surface area, pore volume, carbon content and phenol adsorption capacity.

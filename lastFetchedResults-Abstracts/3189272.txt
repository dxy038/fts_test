Visual discomfort has been the subject of considerable research in relation to stereoscopic displays, but remains an ambiguous concept used to denote a variety of subjective symptoms potentially related to different underlying processes. In this paper, we firstly studied the hue and saturation influence quantitatively on stereoscopic images combining the characters of human visual system (HVS). According to the results of subjective assessment, the comfortable matching and difference maps of hue and saturation were defined and the universal applicability of the maps was verified. The accurate rate of whether one stereoscopic image was comfortable according to the maps was more than 92%. The experiment method can provide a base for the subjective and objective assessment of binocular image pairs.

The paper presents an interactive fuzzy satisfying method for solving a multi-objective VAr planning problem by assuming that the decision maker (DM) has imprecise or fuzzy goals for each of the objective functions. Through the interaction with the DM, the fuzzy goals of the DM are quantified by eliciting corresponding membership functions. If the DM specifies the reference membership values, the minimax problem is solved for generating a corresponding global noninferior optimal solution for the DMÂ´s reference membership values. Then, by considering the current values of the membership functions as well as the objectives, the DM acts on this solution by updating the reference membership values. The interactive procedure continues until the satisfying solution for the DM is obtained. The minimax problem can be easily handled by the simulated annealing (SA) approach which can find a global optimal solution even for the solution space which is nonconvex and the objective functions which are nondifferentiable. Results of the application of the proposed method are presented

Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) is detrimental to human health and is of great concern in biomedical research. Studies on the effects of long term low-dose radiation on biological systems are limited. Thus, the main objective of our NASA funded project is to develop a fully automated miniature device that can be used both terrestrially and during deep space flight to identify, isolate and analyze cells damaged by low doses of radiation. In collaboration with CFDRC, we have developed a prototype microfluidic cell sorter and have identified robust low dose radiation specific markers in endothelial cells using whole genome and customized microarrays. Recently, we have validated fourteen cell surface markers in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells exposed to different low doses (0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 2Gy) of IR by real-time RT-PCR. Our results show over expression of markers such as ACTA-2, CD-68, FSCN-1, ITGA-2, ITGA-3, KRT-19, MMP10 and VCAM-1 at low-doses of IR. Studies are underway to evaluate the efficacy of these markers in sorting cells exposed to IR in our proprietary microfluidic cell sorting device. This device, we believe, would greatly aid in NASAÂ´s efforts to monitor possible radiation related hazards to the astronauts in the outer space.

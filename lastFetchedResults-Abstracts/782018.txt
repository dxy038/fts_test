The objective of this study was to evaluate the LH and ovulatory response of dominant and
subordinate dairy does following the introduction of males. A behavioral study was carried
out to determine the individual success index (SI) of 35 anestrous does according to
their ability to dominate other females. The 8 highest-ranking (highest SI) and the 8 lowestranking
does (lowest SI) in terms of dominance were separated from the rest of the herd
and placed together in the same pen, where a male was later introduced. Blood samples for
plasma LH determinations were obtained fromthe 16 females at 30 min intervals from 0 to
6, 12 to 18 and 33 to 39 h after the introduction of the male, using an intravenous catheter.
After day 8, plasma progesterone was also measured daily in order to determine the occurrence
of ovulation. None of the does showed LH pulses during the sampling period prior
to the introduction of the male. The dominant does showed significantly (p < 0.05) more
LH pulses (2.0±0.18 ng/ml vs. 1.2±0.25 ng/ml) and a higher mean plasma LH concentration
(0.25±0.03 ng/ml vs. 0.14±0.03 ng/ml) than the subordinate goats during the first 6 h
of exposure to the male. There were no differences in LH pulsatility or concentrations at
other times. The frequency of goats that ovulated tended to be greater in high-ranked than
low-ranked does (87% vs. 37%). It could be concluded that the immediate LH response to
the presence of the male (number of LH pulses) is higher in the dominant, compared to the
subordinate goats, and this is associated with a higher number of dominant goats ovulating
in response to the male effect.

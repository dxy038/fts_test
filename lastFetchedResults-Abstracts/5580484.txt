As EU directives require that all administration should perform their procurement processes electronically by 2010, an open-source application framework for building electronic public procurement (ePP) solutions was developed within the ELLECTRA-WeB project. As a part of this project the FYR of Macedonia adapted the ePP solution to support the public procurement lifecycle. This paper presents an assessment of the customized ePP solution for the FYR of Macedonia with a well-defined evaluation framework that follows the user through the phases of electronic procurement procedures. The objective of the study is to present the results of applying different evaluation methods to determine the quality, functionality and efficiency of the ePP solution that meet EU requirements.

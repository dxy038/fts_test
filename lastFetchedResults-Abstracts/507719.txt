OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of Lipoprotein (a) in diabetic patients comparing to control group. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on the patients referred to Endocrinology Clinic of Bu Ali-Sina Hospital in 2009. 180 subjects including 90 diabetic and 90 healthy subjects as control group enrolled in this study. All diabetic patients had glycemic control. We measured serum FBS, TG, cholesterol, LDL, HDL and serum Lp (a) in both groups. Data were analyzed by T-test and chi-square.
RESULTS: BMI, sex and age were similar in two groups. Lp (a) level was significantly higher in diabetic ones compared with control group (35.27 ± 28.6 vs. 20.22 ± 10.3 mg/dl, P  <  0.001). Serum TG, Cholesterol, LDL were also significantly higher in diabetics (P  <  0.001) while HDL was lower. HDL-Cholesterol level was significantly higher in diabetic men than women [OR = 0.18 CI 95% (0.06- 0.56)], and there was positive correlation between FBS level and lipid profile.
CONCLUSION: Lp (a) as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis has elevated level in diabetic patients. So lowering its concentration would help prevention of CAD, a known cause of death in diabetic patients.

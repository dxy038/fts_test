Background & Objective: The issues of environmental engineering , due to its technical , environmental, social and economic factors are  complicated. So, it is difficult to determine which variables are more effective. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effective variables by using AHP and choose the best method of wastewater treatment (Soleimani Village).
Materials & Methods: This is a descriptive study with applying approach. By using AHP is the preferred choices were determined. This method was evaluated by using software Expert Choice. In this regard, after considering the factors affecting or affected by, 3 criteria and 15 sub-criteria, and then the analytic hierarchy process were used. Then, the wastewater treatment processes were prioritized. The processes are constructed wetland systems, rotating biological discs, extended aeration with floating Media and activated sludge. They were based on technical criteria, economic, efficient of treatment process, sub- criteria, weighting and prioritization.
Results: The results showed that weight scores of constructed wetland, rotary biological disc, extended aeration with floating Media and activated sludge were 0.36, 0.28, 0.2 and 0.15, respectively. Therefore, the treatment of choice in rural areas was constructed wetland treatment.
Conclusions: The results show economic criteria are more effective to make the final decision. By the way, the technical criteria were also considered (e.g., ease of operation and construction, etc.) It can be concluded that the wetland method is the best alternative for Soleimani village.

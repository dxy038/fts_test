The objective of the paper is to analyze, assess and compare the flood area extent of multi polarization SAR images against the landuse/landcover units of disaster affected region. A comparative flood area assessment of L- and C-band SAR images of the same disaster region has been carried out. The output results which represent the deep, shallow and non-flooded regions of the input HH, HV and VV polarization images were derived and the same has been integrated with the landuse/landcover map of the study area mainly to estimate and cross analyze the aerial extent of the derived end results on each land cover class of the disaster region. The result brings out the significance of quantifying the flood extent against the landuse categories of the disaster region using high resolution and high wavelength SAR image.

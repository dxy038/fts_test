Splash erosion in land is affected by factors such as slope, meteorological factors, soil properties and plant cover. The objective of this research is to determine the effects of different cover crops and different slopes on splash erosion. The experiment was carried out in an open field on four different cover crops (control, vetch, barley, ryegrass) in two different slopes (4% and 9%) with a three replications in four months. Splash erosion is determined with the help of splash cups placed on the experiment plots. In the experiment, splash erosion decreased with the increase in cover percentage and the decrease in the slope. Splash erosion increases in control plots with the increase in rainfall. Correlation coefficient between kinetic energy of rainfall and splashing soil in control plots were determined as 0.83 in 4% slope and 0.84 in 9% slope.

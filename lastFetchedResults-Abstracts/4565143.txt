Smart Electric Grid is an important as well as intelligent element towards the development of an energy independent and environmentally sustainable society. Although there is no universal definition for Smart Grid, it has various functionalities towards modernization of the electrical grid by using digital systems and addressing disturbances via automated prevention and various other novel ideas. But a smarter grid needs a real-time analysis of the network. Therefore to provide accurate scientific decisions, the idea of integrating enterprise Geographic Information System (GIS) with Smart Electric Grid presented in this paper so as to make the grid apt in advanced decision making. It also helps in modelling the workflow of a network by understanding the relationship between network and surroundings and by controlling all parts of the grid. With the increasing demand of electricity in almost every sector, power sector utilities of India need to perform more effectively and in efficient manner. For this purpose, a Smart Electric Grid along with enterprise GIS is one of the evolutionary idea which can facilitate a cleaner environment, efficient load management and fully automated systems. GIS enabled system also helps to establish a link between the surroundings, the consumers and the grid and thus making it proficient in automation and efficient energy consumption and customer awareness by maintaining a relational database including all the required spatial information. The main objective of this study is to showcase the integration of enterprise GIS with Smart Electric Grid to provide an end-to-end solution for the utilities to improve the efficiency of the electrical system, enable intelligent demand side management and enhance energy security through sustainable business model.

The design and fabrication of OEICs on semi-insulating InP substrates comprising 1300 nm DFB lasers, 1300/1530 nm wavelength duplexers and monitor photodiodes is described. OEIC lasing thresholds were as low as 20 mA. The through-state crosstalk for the integrated duplexer was typically -12 dB. Linear tracking of the laser output by the monitor photodiode was achieved with sensitivities in the region of 70 mu A/mW. The OEICs operated successfully in a 622 Mbit/s bidirectional optical link.

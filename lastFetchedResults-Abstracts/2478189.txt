The data were collected via a package that was consisted of questionnaires involving demographic, athletic history, menstrual pattern, eating attitude test-26, (The EAT-26 questionnaire) and female body image scale. The body mass index (BMI) was measured to compare actual, perceived and ideal body sizes Data were analyzed by Mann Whitney U and Spearman correlation.
Results: The finding showed that there was no significant difference between eating disorder and secondary amenorrhea between athlete and non-athlete groups; but there was significant difference between body dissatisfaction, social pressure to change weight and actual BMI between two groups (P < 0.05). The most rate of body dissatisfaction and social pressure to change weight observed in non athletes women (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: In general, it seems that exercise can reduce eating disorders and body dissatisfaction or fitness contribute to increased performance.

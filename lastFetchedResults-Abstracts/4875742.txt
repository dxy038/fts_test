This paper addresses the normalized site attenuation (NSA) parameter above a frequency of 1 GHz using existing measurement techniques and calculation models. Actual measured NSA data in the frequency range 1-10 GHz was acquired via present day measurement methods and then compared with the theoretical NSA as calculated from existing models. The objective of this paper is: (1) to provide some insight into the measured NSA above 1 GHz, i.e., to give the reader some idea of the behavior of NSA above. If this frequency; and (2) to compare this measured NSA data to theoretical values calculated from existing mathematical models referenced in the present day standards (e.g., ANSI C63.4). The measured NSA data presented in this paper was acquired using a 10 m semi-anechoic test chamber that was constructed new in 1998 and which complies with the present required &#177;4 dB NSA requirement in the frequency range 30-1000 MHz as specified in ANSI C63.4. The authorÂ´s primary reason for undertaking this analysis was the desire to have some idea on the behavior of the NSA parameter above 1 GHz for an actual test site, particularly since there is little published information in the open literature on measured NSA data above this frequency threshold.

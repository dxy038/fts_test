Comparisons of various energy systems are often made from partial, limited standpoints that do not take into due consideration the numerous factors involved in such systems. A more complete assessment of the global quality of energy systems must consider a wider range of characteristics, such as: conversion and transportation yields, energy potential, added value, risk of accidents during conversion and transportation, coefficients of transportability and storability, and polluting emissions (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulphur and nitrogen oxides, unburnt hydrocarbons, dust, radionuclides and dispersed heat).
This paper not only identifies and quantifies the parameters that allow the above qualities to be expressed, but also defines a tree-structured energy-quality index system which starts from the parameters identified and makes it possible to obtain a global summary index, through various intermediate levels of aggregation.
Our objective is to make an instrument available to professionals (engineers, policymakers and energy managers) which allows them to concentrate their attention each time, according to the specific needs in question, on particular aspects of the quality of the energy, or to obtain numerical indicators that briefly express quality in the broadest sense.
In addition, a sample application of the proposed method is presented, using data gathered mainly from the literature on alternative systems for power production and space heating by fossil fuels.

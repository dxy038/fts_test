Background and Objective: Cervical cancer involves many women annually and Pop smear
test has played a significant role in reducing its mortality and for this reason, its improvement is
very essential. In this respect, cervex brush is a new tool that has been introduced in many countries.
Therefore, this study was conducted to compare Pop smears from cotton swab-spatula and Cervex
brush methods with regard to cell number.
Materials and Methods: The clinical trial and randomized protocol of this study was
conducted on 400 women as referrals of gynecology clinic of Hazrat Rassoul Akram (s) hospital and
the cases with inclusion criteria were further investigated and their data using above-mentioned
methods were compared. For statistical analysis, SPSS software and student’s t-test and chi-square
tests were used.
Results: It was found out that the mean age of cases was 34.13 ± 9.3 years. Meanwhile, there was
a significant difference between the groups regarding endocervical cells (p < 0.001) and bleeding on
sampling (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: It is concluded that appropriate use of Cervex brush method can prevent the need
for re-sampling regarding Pop smear test and in this way it can lower health-related costs.

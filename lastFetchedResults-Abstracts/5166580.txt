Aiming at shortcomings in existing scheduling methods for batch processing workflow, this paper attempt to investigate and solve the optimization problem for grouping and scheduling multiple activity instances in batch processing workflow. A multiple objective optimal model of problem with constraints is presented firstly. Then, a discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to produce a set of optimal Pareto solutions by optimizing the two objective functions simultaneously. The result of simulation experiment shows the effectiveness of this algorithm.

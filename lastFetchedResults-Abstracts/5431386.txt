The main objective of this paper is to explore the effectiveness of perceptual features for performing isolated digits and continuous speech recognition. The proposed perceptual features are captured and code book indices are extracted. Expectation maximization algorithm is used to generate HMM models for the speeches. Speech recognition system is evaluated on clean test speeches and the experimental results reveal the performance of the proposed algorithm in recognizing isolated digits and continuous speeches based on maximum log likelihood value between test features and HMM models for each speech. Performance of these features is tested on speeches randomly chosen from &#8220;TI Digits_1&#8221;, &#8220;TI Digits_2&#8221; and &#8220;TIMIT&#8221; databases. This algorithm is tested for VQ and combination of VQ and HMM speech modeling techniques. Perceptual linear predictive cepstrum yields the accuracy of 86% and 93% for speaker independent isolated digit recognition using VQ and combination of VQ &amp; HMM speech models respectively. This feature also gives 99% and 100% accuracy for speaker independent continuous speech recognition by using VQ and the combination of VQ &amp; HMM speech modeling techniques.

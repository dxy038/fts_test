In this paper, we develop control algorithms for addressing second-order consensus problems in intrinsically second-order nonlinear multi-agent dynamical systems with switching topologies. The proposed adaptive controller applies a leader-following strategy in which all agents are assumed to be informed of the leaderÂ´s state. Another feature of this work which specifically distinguishes it from others is that the proposed controller uses undirected and directed graphs to accommodate for a full range of possible graph information topologies without limitations of bidirectional communication.

In modern wireless networks, call admission control (CAC) has received a lot of attention because of its central role for quality of service (QoS) provision. In this paper, a new admission control scheme using statistical priority queue (SQCAC) is proposed. Its objective is to get an optimal overall satisfaction for the customers in terms of an objective function defined in this paper. In SQCAC, handoff calls and new calls occupy the queue in basic station (BS) statistically. Handoff calls are given a higher probability to occupy the queue than new calls when the available bandwidth is used out. SQCAC can also provide a tradeoff between call block probability (CBP) and call dropping probability (CDP)

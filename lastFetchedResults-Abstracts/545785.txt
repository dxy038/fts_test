Objective
Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common causes of activity limitation
in children. Although the central nervous system (CNS) lesion, causing the
disorder of posture and movement, is not progressive, the manifestations of
the lesion however may change over time. The purpose of this study was to
determine the effects of a functional therapy program on motor abilities of
children with cerebral palsy.
Materials & Methods
In the year 2007, in a pre- and post design study, fifteen children, diagnosed
with CP at the physiotherapy clinic of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences
were recruited using simple non - probability sampling by consulting the child
neurologist. Before and after intervention, subjects were classified with Gross
Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) to assess gross motor function
with the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Muscle tonicity was graded,
based on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). A 24 session functional physical
therapy program which lasted 12 weeks, twice per week, and 90min per session
was carried out.
Results
Fifteen children with CP (12 boys and 3 girls) aged 21.87±13.37 months
were enrolled in this study; six of them were diplegic, 7 hemiplegic, and 2
quadriplegic. After treatment, muscle tonicity decreased from 1.93±0.59 to
0.87±0.64 (P < 0.0001). The subjects’ GMFM scores increased significantly from
30.52±28.99 to 49.27±26.9 (P < 0.0001).
Conclusion
The results showed that a functional therapy program may be effective in
increasing gross motor function and improving daily activities in children with
cerebral palsy, thereby decreasing parent and nursing dependency following
this program

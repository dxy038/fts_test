Objective: To study the frequency of port-site infection (PSI) in cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomies reusing disposable ports.Material and Methods: Record of all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Surgical A Unit; LRH between 2007-1994 was retrospectively analyzed for PSI. Out of 300 cases, 6 cases were converted to open cholecystectomy and excluded from the study. All patients were admitted a day before surgery and were given 3 shots of ceftriaxone 1gm (Inj. Rocephin, Roche, UK); one before and two after the surgery. The patients were monitored for port site using standard National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System definitions given by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All infected wounds were treated by local washes and oral antibiotics.Results: Out of 294 cases, 17 (5.78%) developed PSI. Out of these 17 infected cases 12 (70.5%) had superficial infection while 5 (29.4%) had deep surgical site infection (SSI). Epigastric port-site was infected in 15 (88.2%) cases followed by the umbilical port-site in 2 (11.8%) cases. Two (11.8%) patients with port-site infection had operation lasting < 1 hour while in 15 (88.2%) cases the surgery lasted for >1hr. Main operative findings were acute cholecystitis in 7 (41.1%) patients, empyema gall bladder in 4 (23.5%), adhesions in 3 (17.6%).Conclusion: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with a low risk of PSI, which in most cases is only superficial and responds to local measures. It is most commonly the trocar site of gall bladder extraction that is infected.

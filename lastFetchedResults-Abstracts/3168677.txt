This paper presents a fuzzy multi-objective approach for clearing the reactive power market. The object functions that have been studied are the total payment function (TPF), voltage stability and the voltage deviation of the buses. All of the object functions are transformed to membership functions and then a pseudogoal function is derived to express a unique object function. The proposed reactive market is implemented to the IEEE 30-bus system.

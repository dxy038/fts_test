When employing conditionally stable transistors in microwave amplifier design, it is impossible to have both parts perfectly matched. One can easily design for a perfect match at one of the parts, but the resulting mismatch at the remaining part may be unacceptable. Through trial and error using graphical methods, the designer may trade-off the perfect part match for improved match at the other part. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach whereby the maximisation of an objective function results in maximum gain and part match, for given stability safety margins

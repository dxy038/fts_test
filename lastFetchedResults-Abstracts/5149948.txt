This paper presents a communication controller between the FlexRay and Modbus protocols for embedded systems. FlexRay is a kind of high speed bus technology, which has high performance and high reliability. Modus is a mature fieldbus technology, which is widely used on industrial field. The communication controller is based on a 16 bit MCU platform, with XGATE as its coprocessor, which provides FlexRay interface and Modbus interface, and realizes bidirectional transceiving data. The data flow between the modules is controlled by an application specific gateway unit that provides all control signals. The communication controller will play a major role in different industrial applications continuously.

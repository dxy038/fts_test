Granular computing concerns human thinking and problem solving, as well as their implications to the design of knowledge intensive systems. It simplifies complex real world problems by considering different levels of granularity. Basic granules represent the elementary units of human knowledge. A granular structure reflects structural connections of different pieces of knowledge. The main objective of this paper is to show how to construct granular structures in a logic setting. This is done by interpreting notions of granular computing by using a logic language L. Two types of granular structures are constructed based on the basic granules, called cap-closure granular structure and cup-closure granular structure. An information table is used to give a concrete interpretation of the language L for constructing granular structures.

Anode surface temperature has a significant impact on the interruption capacity of a vacuum circuit breaker. The objective of this paper is to experimentally understand the decay process of anode surface temperature after extinguishing a high-vacuum arc with a large contact gap. The anode surface temperature after current zero was measured by a two-color pyrometer and arc modes observation was recorded by a highspeed charge-coupled device. A pair of asymmetric butt type contacts (contact materials: CuCr25 and CuCr50) was subjected to an axial magnetic field in a demountable vacuum chamber. The experimental result shows that there are two modes in decay processes of anode surface temperature: Mode I and Mode II. Mode I describes the anode surface decay process after diffuse low-current extinction and Mode II corresponds to high current extinction. In addition, the decay time of anode surface temperature will last longer, if the proportion of chromium rises from 25% to 50% in anode material.

Infrared radiation (IR) can simulate the heat flux created during the frying process, yielding products with fried-like textures but lower fat content. The objective of this study was to determine the process parameters needed to produce partially-fried, infrared-finished gluten-free (GF) donuts having similar instrumental and sensorial properties to fully-fried wheat and GF donuts but lower fat content. Eight different IR oven parameter settings were tested. All GF donuts had significantly lower (p ⩽ 0.05) fat content (23.7–28.2%) than the wheat control (33.7%). Several IR oven parameters yielded donuts that were instrumentally similar to the wheat and GF controls. All IR-finished GF donuts received significantly lower overall acceptance scores (3.81–3.44) than the wheat control (6.94), although they had similar sensory scores to the GF control (4.54). Infrared radiation may be used to finish-fry partially-fried GF donuts to produce donuts significantly lower in fat, yet instrumentally and sensorially similar to fully-fried GF donuts.

A knowledge-based approach is presented for data integration. The objective is to illustrate how a frame-based knowledge structure can be used to advantage in the automatic evaluation of design for better manufacturability. Several features are discussed with emphasis on automated procedures using the proposed description method. Coupling this discussion and the research experience in working on a feature recognition system, the author has proposed the function and requirements of a system for data integration. A casting example is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the approach

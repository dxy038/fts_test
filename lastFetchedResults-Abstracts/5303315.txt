With the help of reliability engineering and system analysis, the components of the fire equipment in buildings and the objective of the integral reliability were analyzed. The reliability goals and main evaluation index were discussed. Based on the working principle and the data of the maintainability management, the reliability, function of the fire equipment and the estimation method of reliability index of the subsystems were studied. The integral reliability model of fire equipment was developed. According to the application and management of the fire equipment, this method has been tried out in an integral reliability assessment of an office building. The corresponding data structure of estimating the integral reliability was set up, and the applicability of the method was discussed.

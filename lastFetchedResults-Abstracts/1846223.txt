To reduce the scan time of time of flight or phase contrast angiography sequences, fast three-dimensional k-space trajectories can be employed. The best 3D trajectory depends on tolerable scan time, readout time, geometric flexibility, flow/motion properties and others. A formalism for flow/motion sensitivity comparison based on the velocity k-space behavior is presented. It consists in finding the velocity k-space position as a function of the spatial k-space position. The trajectories are compared graphically by their velocity k-space maps, with simulations and with an objective computed index. The flow/motion properties of various 3D trajectories (cones, spiral-pr hybrid, spherical stack of spirals, 3DFT, 3D echo-planar, and shells) were determined. In terms of flow/motion sensitivity the cones trajectory is the best, however, it is difficult to use it for anisotropic resolutions or fields of view. Tolerating more flow sensitivity, the stack of spirals trajectory offers more geometric flexibility.

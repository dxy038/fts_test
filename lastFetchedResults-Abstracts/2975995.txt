The wavefront technology mapping algorithm leads to a very simple and efficient implementation that elegantly decouples pattern matching and covering but circumvents that patterns have to be stored for the entire network simultaneously. This coupled with dynamic decomposition enables trade-off of many more alternatives than in conventional mapping algorithms. The wavefront algorithm maps optimally for minimal delay on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) when a gain based delay model is used. It is optimal with respect to the arrival times on each path in the network. A special timing mode for multi-source nets allows minimization of other (non-delay) metrics as a secondary objective while maintaining delay optimality

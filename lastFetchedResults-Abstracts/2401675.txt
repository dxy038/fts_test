Aiming at the objective problems that great amount of precious coal resources are inhibited by water-conducting and bearing fault and become lost and wasted due to impossibility of safe extraction, the paper analyzed hydro-geological characteristics of different faults, put forward division of faults into four types with different hydro-geological properties, as follows: water-conducting fault, water â€“bearing fault, water-isolating fault and water-conducting and bearing fault, summed up spatial constitutional relation among fault, coal seam and aquifer, types and formation mechanism of different water hazards caused by faults under different constitutional relation. Four types of water hazards caused by faults were given, i.e. transverse inrushing water hazard, vertical conducting water hazard, overflowing water hazard from floor and bursting water hazard from roof. Aiming at hydro-geological characteristics of faults and different types of water hazards, water control technologies and methods were proposed, including in advance pre-dewatering and drainage, directional guided inclination detection and transformation of key interval by grouting as well as remaining scientifically water-proof coal/rock pillars, which has important significance for reducing coal pillar left for fault and increasing recovery of coal resources.

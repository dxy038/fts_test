The algebraic approach is applied to the control of the HIMAT aircraft. The objective is to find a robust controller which guarantees robust stability and decoupled control of longitudinal model of a scaled remotely controlled vehicle version of the advanced fighter HIMAT. Control design is performed by decoupling the MIMO system into two identical SISO plants, which are approximated by a 4<sup>th</sup> order transfer function. The algebraic approach is then used for pole placement design and the nominal closed-loop poles are tuned so that the peak of the &#956;-function is minimal. As an optimization tool evolutionary algorithm Differential Migration is used in order to overcome the multimodality of the cost function. Final controllers are compared with the D-K iteration through simulations of standard longitudinal manoeuvres.

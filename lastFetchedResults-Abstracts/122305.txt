Introduction: Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common benign tumor in males and a major cause of urinary symptoms in most males over 50. Prostate cancer is the second lethal cancer, after lung cancer, in the males.
Objective: In attention to the possibility of occurring incidental carcinoma in BPH patients, in this study we decided to estimate its prevalence in urology centers of Rasht hospitals: Razi, Aria and Golsar. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive cross sectional study, from April 2000 through July 2002, we interviewed all patients who later underwent surgery for BPH and filled out the questionnaire form. The reports of the patients were collected from patients and Rasht pathology centers. Data were analyzed by SPSS.9.0 using chi square test, t- test and fisher exact test. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: From 1437 patients, 39 patients were excluded from study because their pathology reports were not found, and 1398 patients were enrolled. The mean age of patients were 67.8± 7.8 years (43-91). Prostate carcinoma was detected in 75 patients (5.4%), and all had adenocarcinoma. Mean age of prostate cancer group was 69.4± 8.3 years. Fifty patients (66.7%) were smokers.
Familial history of prostatic cancer was negative in all patients in cancer group. In patients with diagnosis of cancer, the major symptoms at admission were irritate symptoms (5.3%), irritate obstructive (94.7%) and none of them had only obstructive signs. The grade of tumor in 62.3% was well differentiated and in 37.7% was moderate differentiated. The mean of PSA in cancer and BPH groups were 8.2± 12.7 and 2.6± 4.1 mg/ml respectively (P= 0.0001) The kind of operation in 53.1% was TURP and in 46.9% was open prostatectomy. In prostate cancer group, 76% of operations were TURP and in 24% were open prostatecomy..
Conclusion: In this study, prevalence of prostate cancer in operated patients with a BPH diagnosis was 5.4% that is similar to other studies.

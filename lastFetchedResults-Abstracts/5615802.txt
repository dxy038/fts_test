Objective: To study structural changes of hemoglobin from critically ill patients with coronary heart disease in the physiological condition pH7.4, for clinical diagnosis and treatment of new information. Methods: Using dynamic laser light scattering and UV- visible spectroscopy, the particle size distribution and absorption spectra were detected in hemoglobin dispersed in buffer solution pH 7.4 from critically ill patients with coronary heart disease. Results: (1) critically ill patients with coronary heart disease remained the hemoglobin tetramer size structure, the same as healthy adults; (2) critically ill coronary heart disease patients had the same hemoglobin absorption spectra and absorption peak as healthy adults. Moreover, there was no significant difference in absorption peak value between them. Conclusion: The structures of hemoglobin had no marked differences between critically ill patients with coronary heart disease and healthy adults.

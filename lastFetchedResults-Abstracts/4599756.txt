Aiming at traffic jams and potential traffic danger and other traffic problems at present, research on trajectory following control based on vehicle to vehicle communication on automatic drive is conducted. Through a simple and accurate vehicle kinematical model, it analyzes the state space of system, establishes model-based system state equations, combined with constraint conditions of practice and theory, it optimizes objective functions with the quadratic programming as the principal method, and avoids infeasibility solutions during its execution by properly improving objective functions, and then according to the updated status information of vehicle to vehicle communication it predicts the next time-domain output and feedbacks it to state space of system, repeat it until the control process is completed. Then, it establishes simulation models of tracking system through Simulink components in MATLAB, gains the movement data of front vehicle from Carsim software during vehicle to vehicle communication, and obtains the movement data of following vehicle accordingly. Finally, movement data of following vehicle and front vehicle is analyzed comparatively; the vehicle model predictive control predicts the feasibility of reference trajectory tracking in the quadratic programming method to complete the tracking strategy when moving.

By restricting object tracking, we form a robust object-specified active contour model which adapts itself to the properties of the specified object, that is to say, the objective smoothly deformable line-feature. The proposed model allows us to track the objective deformable line-feature throughout the entire observed noisy moving image sequence automatically. Furthermore we apply it to the surveillance image processing task that suspended power-transmission wires swinging due to strong winds are automatically tracked in an observed outdoor noisy moving image sequence. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is considerably robust to noise

To screen cancer for specific autoantibodies, we applied the approach established by Brichory et al., who reported annexins I and II as specific antigens. Solubilized proteins from a cancer cell line (A549) were separated using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), followed by Western blotting (WB) analysis, in which the sera of individual patients were tested for primary antibodies. We found 11 positive spots on PVDF membrane using a WB/enhanced chemiluminescence detection Kit, and identified eight proteins, such as α-enolase, inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, 3-oxoacid CoA transferase, chaperonin, peroxiredoxin 6 and triosephosphate isomerase, that reacted with these antibodies in patients’ sera using MALDI-TOF/TOF. All eight antibodies were not detected in the sera derived from lung tuberculosis and healthy controls.

For the tension distribution problem of cable-driven parallel robot, a new tension distribution method based on normal linear programming is researched. Because cables only sustain tensions, and the limitation of tensions are finite, so the computation of cable tensions become very important. By introducing a slack variable and transforming the objective function about tensions into one about slack variable, the optimist tension distribution in feasible zone is obtained. Comparing with the 1-norm optimal algorithm, results show that the optimal tensions received by new method is far away from the boundary of cable tensions, the control of tension distribution is much convenient and the controllable workspace is relatively increased.

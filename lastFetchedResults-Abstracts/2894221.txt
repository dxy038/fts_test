By concerning with the health of the patients, analysis of blood cell particularly morphological structure of leukocyte in microscopic blood smear can effectively detect the important blood disorder such as the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Unfortunately, the analysis made by hematology expert is not always accurate and rapid due to the error prone modality and operator´s incapability´s. The presented paper shows the how to enhance the microscopic blood smear by removing the unwanted microscopic background by segmenting the cell and analyzing the existing algorithms for segmentation by performing comparative study for effectively segments and accurately measure the leukocyte characteristics in order to allow, subsequent automatic diagnosis of leukemia and other hematic diseases.

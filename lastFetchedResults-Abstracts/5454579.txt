Because all the Shape from shading (SFS) algorithm depend on assumptions about the continuity of surface height and its partial derivatives, we add the smooth constraint to the objective function to enforce the integrability, and propose a new shape from shading algorithm based on maximum entropy. We present results of our new shape from shading method on a synthetic image. Results and comparisons showed that the new algorithm gives consistently better feature preserving reconstructions.

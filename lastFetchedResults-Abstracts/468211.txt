Objective: The object was to study serum concentrations of reproductive hormones and aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in early pregnancy as markers of pelvic pain (sacral pain or symphyseal pain) during later pregnancy. Study Design: A prospective, clinical cohort study was performed, with repeated examinations of 200 women. Results: Serum concentrations of relaxin and serum concentrations of propeptide of type III procollagen (a collagen turnover marker) measured in early pregnancy were significantly correlated with pelvic pain with onset during pregnancy and reported in late pregnancy (positively and negatively, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, relaxin and propeptide of type III procollagen concentrations remained independently and significantly correlated with pelvic pain. Conclusion: Serum concentrations of relaxin and propeptide of type III procollagen measured in early pregnancy may reflect the cause of and indicate an increased risk of pelvic pain (back pain or symphyseal pain) during late pregnancy. The mechanism is unclear. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:128-34.)

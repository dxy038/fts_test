Recent research in wireless code-division multiple-access systems has shown that adaptive rate/power control can considerably increase network throughput relative to systems that use only power or rate control. In this paper, we consider joint power/rate optimization in the context of orthogonal modulation (OM) and investigate the additional performance gains achieved through adaptation of the OM order. We show that such adaptation can significantly increase network throughput, while simultaneously reducing the per-bit energy consumption relative to fixed-order modulation systems. The optimization is carried out under two different objective functions: minimizing the maximum service time and maximizing the sum of user rates. For the first objective function, we prove that the optimization problem can be formulated as a generalized geometric program (GGP). We then show how this GGP can be transformed into a nonlinear convex program, which can be solved optimally and efficiently. For the second objective function, we obtain a lower bound on the performance gain of adaptive OM (AOM) over fixed-modulation systems. Numerical results indicate that relative to an optimal joint rate/power control fixed-order modulation scheme, the proposed AOM scheme achieves significant throughput and energy gains.

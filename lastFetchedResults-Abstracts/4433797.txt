This paper presents an algorithm for resource allocation in satellite networks. It deals with planning a time/frequency plan for a set of terminals with a known geometric configuration under interference constraints. Our objective is to maximize the system throughput while guaranteeing that the different types of demands are satisfied, each type using a different amount of bandwidth. The proposed algorithm relies on two main techniques. The first generates admissible configurations for the interference constraints, whereas the second uses linear and integer programming with column generation. The obtained solution estimates a possible allocation plan with optimality guarantees, and highlights the frequency interferences which degrade the construction of good solutions.

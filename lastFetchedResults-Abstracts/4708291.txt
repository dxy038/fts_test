Project-oriented teaching model achieves the combination of classroom teaching and project practice, and the synchronism of knowledge delivery and practical application. When students start the project, they generally change the passive reception to the active absorption study by combining the required knowledge and teaching contents. And finally, students will clear the objective of study and learn for accomplishing the task of project. ItÂ´s very important to select a topic in the project-oriented model. It requires teachers clearly grasp of the course and carry out an all-wave analyze, then summarize the practical experience in development projects and teaching experience to determine a project topic.

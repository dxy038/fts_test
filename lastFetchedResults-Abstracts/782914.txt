Objective The aim of this study was to compare
self-reported emotional and behavioral problems
for Turkish immigrant, native Dutch and native Turkish
adolescents. Method A total of 379 Turkish immigrant
adolescents living in the Netherlands, and 1,039 Dutch
adolescents from the general population completed the
Dutch translation of the Youth Self-Report (YSR); 2,151
Turkish adolescents from the general population completed
the Turkish translation of the YSR; parents of
Turkish immigrant adolescents filled in the Turkish
translation of the Child Behavior Checklist
(CBCL/4â€“18). Results Turkish immigrant adolescents
scored themselves significantly higher than Dutch adolescents
on five of the 11 YSR syndromes,most markedly
on the Anxious/Depressed,Withdrawn and Internalizing
scales. Dutch adolescents scored themselves higher
than immigrant adolescents on the Somatic Complaints
and Delinquent Behavior scales. Turkish immigrant
adolescents scored themselves higher than Turkish adolescents
on five of the 11 scales, most markedly on the
Delinquent Behavior scale. Total problems scores for
Turkish immigrant adolescents were higher than for
Dutch and Turkish adolescents.Turkish immigrant adolescents
scored themselves higher than their parents assessed
them on seven of the 11 scales. Conclusion Turkish
immigrant adolescents reported more problems in
comparison to their Dutch and native Turkish peers.
Different patterns of parent-child interaction, family
values and delay of Dutch language skills are considered
to be responsible for these differences in scores.

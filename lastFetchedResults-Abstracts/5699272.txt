A decision support system (DSS) intended for the study of expansion policies of power generation systems is presented. The cornerstone of this DSS is a new tricriteria interactive algorithm named TRIMAP, which is also briefly discussed. Special emphasis has been placed on interactive graphical capabilities in order to facilitate the decision maker (DM) tasks in all the components of the DSS: data input, formulation of the tricriteria linear programming problem, probabilistic computations, and dialogue mechanisms with the DM for specifying the direction of search. Traditionally, linear programming models judge generation expansion planning problems by considering as a single objective the total system cost. Presently, several social measures and security considerations have also become essential to evaluate the relative merits of alternative schemes. In this paper, three objective functions quantify the total system cost, the risk of supply failure, and the environmental impact

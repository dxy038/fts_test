Most commercial digital still cameras use a single sensor array (e.g., CMOS or CCD) with color filter array (CFA) to reduce the cost and size. Since the image obtained with CFA has only one color value per pixel, the demosaicing is needed to acquire missing two color values. Although many demosaicing methods have been proposed, they still have artifacts such as rainbow and zippering artifact. In this paper, we propose the simple demosaicing algorithm using tendency of neighbor pixels with the enhanced weighting function. In the experimental results, our algorithm shows much better subjective qualities of the images than conventional demosaicing algorithm and improves objective qualities.

A bidirectional lateral base resistance controlled thyristor has been proposed and demonstrated with experiment results, which achieves a symmetrical performance with low conduction-loss. Thanks to its voltage controlled anode-short, an excellent high temperature capability for a wide frequency range has been obtained

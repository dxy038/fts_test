Distributed energy resources (DERs) offer on-site generation at consumption points, which are expected to change the conventional concept of central power generation. DER integration reduces transmission losses and enhances the operation reliability of distribution systems. However, distribution systems are traditionally designed as passive networks in which large DER penetrations representing bidirectional power flows and topology-dependent fault currents could affect protection devices, cause danger to the maintenance personnel, and result in uncontrollable under-/overvoltage and frequency. IEEE Standard 1547 requires DER units to stop energizing the distribution system when the system is de-energized due to faults.

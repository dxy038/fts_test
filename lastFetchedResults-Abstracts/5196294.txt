Small and medium sized enterprises have been recognized as the main driver of economic development of a country. Hence their development is the main issue of discussions in the literature. In Pakistan, 96% of its SMES are employed less than five workers (Very Small and Medium Sized Enterprises-VSMEs). These enterprises face a lot of difficulties in their development. Hence, this paper examines the structure of the VSMEs. Its objective is to propose a conceptual framework on the factors contributing to the innovativeness of these VSMEs. Consequently, their contribution is more significant in the development of the country.

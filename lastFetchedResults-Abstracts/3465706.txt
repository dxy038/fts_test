A generalized sector bounded by piecewise linear functions was introduced in a previous paper for the purpose of reducing conservatism in absolute stability analysis of systems with nonlinearity and/or uncertainty. This paper will further enhance absolute stability analysis by using the composite quadratic Lyapunov function whose level set is the convex hull of a family of ellipsoids. The absolute stability analysis will be approached by characterizing absolutely contractively invariant (ACI) level sets of the composite quadratic Lyapunov functions. This objective will be achieved through three steps. The first step transforms the problem of absolute stability analysis into one of stability analysis for an array of saturated linear systems. The second step establishes stability conditions for linear difference inclusions and then for saturated linear systems. The third step assembles all the conditions of stability for an array of saturated linear systems into a condition of absolute stability. Based on the conditions for absolute stability, optimization problems are formulated for the estimation of the stability region. Numerical examples demonstrate that stability analysis results based on composite quadratic Lyapunov functions improve significantly on what can be achieved with quadratic Lyapunov functions.

The work envisions current scenarios of developing countries. Unfortunately the developing countries are going through a very critical time, facing terrorism, bomb blasts; strikes have impacted the sellers, the buyers, and the business adversely. People are reluctant to go out for shopping etc. Furthermore Life is moving at a fast pace, and we rarely get free time and in those moments one actually wants to stay away from the crowd, noise etc, and if one gets facilitates of shopping are just a few clicks away with a cup of coffee in hand, then who would not love it. Work here is facilitating the people with ease and security in buying and even selling with certain criteria. The problem with the current online shopping is that customers are reluctant to use their credit cards due to the online theft incidents, then the fake websites. Our proposed system will be capable of confirming the identities of the users and e-commerce websites which in turn will reduce the risk of any kind of fraud. This will make online-shopping fun, easy, and useful. The objective of the proposed system is to enhance the customers to shop online securely and efficiently.

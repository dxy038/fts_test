We consider the problem of optimal control of queueing systems with heterogeneous servers in parallel. The system objective is to assign customers dynamically to idle servers based on the state of the system so as to minimize the average cost of holding customers. Three cases, either known in the literature or new, are studied in detail: queueing systems with server heterogeneity in-service rates, in-service functions, and both in-service rates and in-service functions. An approach is presented using fuzzy control to solve these problems. Simulation shows that this approach is efficient and promising, especially in cases where analytical solutions do not exist

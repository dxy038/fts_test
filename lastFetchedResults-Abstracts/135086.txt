BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: "l 'he third stage of labour is probably the most dangerous stage, due to bleeding threatens mother_ The objective of this study was to determine the effect of early and late cord umbilical clamping and injection of oxytocin after delivery on duration of third stage and hernorrahage and prevalence of retained placenta.
METHODS: This study was done on 260 singleton deliveries. Gestations less than 34 weeks, newborns with low birth weight (less than 2000 gr) and fetal distress and also the Rh negative mothers were all excluded from the study. Third stage of labour was managed by three methods. FINDINGS: Duration of the third stage in method 1, 2 and 3 were 8.5+ 1.8, 3.6± 1.9 and 4.2±1.9 minutes, respectively which there was only a significant difference between method 1 and 2 (p<0.05). In method 1, retained placenta was seen in 4 cases (3.5%) In method I, 2 and 3, the average of hemorrhage in the third stage and standard deviation was 90.3+126, 72+ 63 and 54 9 70 ml, respectively which there was a significant difference between method 1 and 3 but there was no significant difference between 1 with 2 and 2 with 3.
CONCLUSION: According to the results, early umbilical cord clamping is not recommended in order to reduce the duration of the third stage and also the amount of hemmorrhage.

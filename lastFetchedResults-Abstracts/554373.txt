Background and Objective: Exercise is increasingly becoming popular during pregnancy. One goal of exercise during pregnancy is to restore optimum body biomechanics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise during pregnancy on the intensity of low back pain and kinematics of spine.

Materials and Methods: During a prospective randomized study, 212 pregnant women filled questionnaire between weeks 17-22 of pregnancy and 12 weeks later to assess the severity low back pain. All of them were randomized into two groups; one group was offered to exercise three times a week for 12 weeks, the other group was not. Lordosis and spinal flexibility with flexible ruler and Side bending test, respectively, and at one time were measured Weight gain during pregnancy, gestational age at delivery and birth weight were also recorded.

Results: Intensity of low back pain in the exercise group after exercise significantly decreased( p<0.0001), but it increased in the control group. Lordosis was significantly increased in the two groups with no major differences between the two groups. After ending the exercise, flexibility of spine in the two groups was significantly decreased, and there was significant difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups according to maternal weight gain, pregnancy length and neonatal weight. There is strong correlation between lordosis (r=0.45, p<0.000) and spine flexibility (r=0.44, p<0.000) with BMI.

Conclusion: Exercise during the second and beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy could reduce the intensity of low back pain and increase flexibility of spine and had no detectable effect on Lordosis.

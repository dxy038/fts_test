Objective Patients with severe mental illness who are
treated in assertive community treatment (ACT) teams are
sometimes involuntarily admitted when they are dangerous
to themselves or others, and are not motivated for treatment.
However, the consequences of involuntary admission
in terms of psychosocial outcome and treatment motivation
are largely unknown. We hypothesized that involuntary
admission would improve psychosocial outcome and not
adversely affect their treatment motivation.
Methods In the context of routine 6-monthly outcome
monitoring in the period January 2003â€“March 2008, we
used the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS)
and a motivation-for-treatment scale to assess 260 severely
mentally ill patients at risk for involuntary admission.
Mixed models with repeated measures were used for data
analyses.
Results During the observation period, 77 patients (30%)
were involuntarily admitted. Relative to patients who were
not involuntarily admitted, these patients improved significantly
in HoNOS total scores (F = 17,815, df = 1,
p\0.001) and in motivation for treatment (F = 28.139,
df = 1, p\0.001). Patients who were not involuntarily
admitted had better HoNOS and motivation scores at
baseline, but did not improve.
Conclusions Involuntary admission in the context of
ACT was associated with improvements in psychosocial
outcome and motivation for treatment. There are no indications
that involuntary admission leads to deterioration in
psychosocial outcome or worsening of motivation for
treatment.

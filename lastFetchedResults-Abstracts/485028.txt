Background & object: Diabetes mellitus is associated with a decrease in bone mineral content and increased urinary cxcretion of calcium and phosphate. In addition, there are abnormalities in calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D metabolism in diabetic patients. The objective of this study was to assess the serum calcium and vitamin D status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Materials and methods: A total of 61 diabetic patients (35 male and 26 female), 35-65 years old, were studied in the middle of winter, at the seasonal nadir of 25 (OH) D levels. Serum levels of 25(OH) D < 20 ng/ml and of total calcium < 8.8 mg/dl were defined as vitamin D and calcium deficiencies, respectively.
Results: The mean serum 25(OH) D level was 10.87 ± 10.59 ng/ml. It was significantly lower in males than in females (p< 0.002). Forty-eight subjects (78.7%) were vitamin D-deficient and only 13 (21.3%) had normal serum vitamin D levels. The mean scrum calcium level in the whole sample was 9.45 ± 0.23 mg/dl, which is in the normal range. The mean was higher in males than in females, but the difference was not statistically significant.
Conclusion and suggestions: The results suggest that vitamin D deficicncy might be prevalent in diabetic patients in Iran, it probably being markedly higher in males.

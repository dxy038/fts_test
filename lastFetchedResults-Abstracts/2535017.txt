The objective of the present paper is to study the stances and polices of the governments of Iran and Arab countries towards the Lebanon 33day war. The US and Western supporters of the Zionist regime expected to defeat Hezbuallh within a week, but the 33day calculated defense of Hezbuallh forced the armedtotheteeth Zionist regime to accept the defeat. The countries of the region adopted different stances towards the war. Attempts have been made in the present paper to study different aspects of these stances through documentary method within the framework of Rosena’s foreign policy and international policymaking theory. The findings of the present paper show that the Islamic Republic of Iran’s foreign policy is based on its internal and external environments and its ideological orientation. Hence Tehran announced its support for the resistance in political, cultural, publicity… arenas in the entire region. Among the Arab countries, six have been chosen that have had a more outstanding role during the 33day war. The triangle of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan are classified as opponents of resistance that opposed the Lebanese war in the hope of the victory of Zionist regime and US. But countries such as Syria, Qatar and Yemen supported Lebanon. The official stances, diplomatic propaganda and religious propagation as well as the fatwas are among the stances to be studied in the present paper.

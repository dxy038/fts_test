MPLS-based explicit routing technology is particularly useful for Internet traffic engineering. In this article, we model the optimization problem of explicit routing with multiple constraints as an integer programming problem with the objective of minimizing global network congestion. This optimization problem is NP-hard. And a heuristic adaptive genetic algorithm (HAGA) is presented to solve this problem. HAGA improves simple GA model in efficiency and local search ability, by introducing adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation, and combining with heuristic method to guide the local search. The simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm is effective and efficient, and has a superior optimization performance over the simple GA in the aspects of robustness and efficiency.

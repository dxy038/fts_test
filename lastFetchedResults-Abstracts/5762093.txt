This paper proposes a multi-objective optimal design process for an in-wheel permanent magnet synchronous motor (in wheel PMSM) for high performance. In order to improve the characteristics of the PMSM such as the cogging torque, torque ripple, the average torque and the back-EMF, the modified Taguchi method and the response surface method (RSM) are utilized. The optimal solution at the global scope is found by using the modified Taguchi method, then the RSM is performed to find out optimal value.

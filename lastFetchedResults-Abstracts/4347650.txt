This paper presents the results of a study to determine the statistical distribution of the amplitude of the short duration impulse currents discharged by surge arresters installed in medium voltage systems. This procedure considers the survey of the currents discharged by silicon carbide surge arresters taken from the field. The objective of this analysis is to define improved strategies for surge arrester acquisition and insulation coordination.

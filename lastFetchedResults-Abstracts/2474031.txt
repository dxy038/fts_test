BACKGROUND:The Harkisheep is a fat-tailed breed which medium- sized bodyand dairy- meat sheep.OBJECTIVES:In this study parameters of production, reproduction and economic management obtained from data recorded for Harki sheep breed was evaluated in five flocks with 500 ewe during annual cycle of production in village system in 2012. METHODS:Traits included; fertility, pregnancy rate, weight lambs from birth to the end of period, survival rate of lambs, wool production weight, average daily gain and milk production. A bioeconomic model was written for rearing system and flock information,economic values usingmaximumprofitorientation was calculated by partialderivativeofthe profit functionfor a production system with one lambing per year by the Ecoweight software. To calculate economic values,change in system profit per unit change in the trait while was kept the other characters in the average, and was considered the average change in profit as an economic value. First all costs, revenues, profits and flock structure determined then intered input files and run the software.RESULTS:The relative economic values for birth weight, daily gain from birth until weaning, daily gain from weaning until end of period, conception rates ewes, little size, lamb survival at weaning, lifetime, milk yield during the standardized milking period of 150 d, milk fat, milk protein and fleece weight were 6.12, 0.68, 0.515, 2.36, 2.12, 2.54, 16.72, 3.54, 0.047, 0.024 and 1 respectively. CONCLUSIONS:Breeding objective in Harki sheep breed were  productive lifetime,birth weight, milk yield, lamb survivalat weaning, conception rates ewes, little size,wool yield, daily gain from birthuntil weaning, daily gain fromweaning until end of period, milk fat and milkprotein.

Background
Children frequently undergo bidirectional Glenn anastomosis in the staged surgical management of single ventricle physiology. The purpose of our study was to investigate the role of inhaled nitric oxide therapy in children with marked elevations in Glenn pressures after this surgery.
Methods
A retrospective study over a 30-month period was performed. The effect of inhaled nitric oxide therapy was analyzed in children with marked elevations of Glenn pressures resulting in decreased systemic perfusion. Effects on Glenn pressures, respiratory indices, and systemic perfusion were evaluated after initiation of nitric oxide therapy and compared with baseline parameters.
Results
Sixteen patients were placed on nitric oxide therapy for marked elevations of Glenn pressures (22.4 Â± 3.9 mm Hg). In the 11 responsive patients, there were significant reductions in Glenn pressures (from 22.4 mm Hg to 17.1 mm Hg, p< 0.001) and significant improvement in partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (from 49 to 74.3, p = 0.001) and oxygenation index (from 17 to 12, p = 0.005). There was simultaneous significant reduction in inotrope score (from 14.9 to 11.4, p< 0.001) and fluid volume support (from 11.4 mL/kg to 2.3 mL/kg, p< 0.001) in the responsive patients. Five patients that failed to show any response were found, subsequently, to have an anatomic lesion.
Conclusions
Inhaled nitric oxide produces significant reduction in Glenn pressures and improvement in systemic perfusion and pulmonary gas exchange in patients with marked elevations of Glenn pressures after bidirectional Glenn anastomosis. Patients who fail to respond should be investigated for an anatomic lesion.

In this study, under the constraint of resource-saving and environment-friendliness objective,
based on multi-agent genetic algorithm, multi-objective spatial optimization (MOSO) model for land use
allocation was developed from the view of simulating the biological autonomous adaptability to environment
and the competitive-cooperative relationship. The model was applied to solve the practical multi-objective
spatial optimization allocation problems of land use in the core region of Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangttan city
cluster in China. The results has indicated that MOSO model has much better performance than GA for solving
complex multi-objective spatial optimization allocation problems and it is a promising method for generating
land use alternatives for further consideration in spatial decision-making.

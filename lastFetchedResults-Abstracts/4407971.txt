The implementation of the smart grid technology does not follow pre-established rules as it must be built and customized for each company. Each company must choose from a range of applications, devices and vendors the items needed taking into account its organizational and electrical infrastructure as well as the expected technical and economic benefits. Thus, the strategic planning has the aim to identify and analyze these items in order to supply subsidies for the smart grid technology deployment within the company. The objective of this paper is to elaborate a strategic planning considering the insertion of the smart grid technology within the generation and transmission of power at Furnas S.A. utility. Also, a pilot system for the evaluation of such various smart functions is proposed.

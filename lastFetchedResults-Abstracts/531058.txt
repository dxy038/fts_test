Background: Despite advances in the medical care of renal transplant recipients which have led to an improvement in allograft survival, renal allograft rejection is still a major ob-stacle to successful organ transplantation. Understanding the mechanisms contributing to allograft rejection will be of great importance for the development of efficient antirejection strategies. Objective: The aim of current investigation was to study the impact of polymor-phisms of CCR5Δ32, CCR5- 59029 A/G and CCR2-V64I on renal allograft survival. Methods: Using PCR and PCR-RFLP methods in 84 renal transplant recipients, the influ-ence of CCR5Δ32, CCR5- 59029 A/G and CCR2-V64I polymorphisms on renal allograft survival in two rejector and non-rejector groups were examined. Rejector group was de-fined as having rejection before 1 year and non-rejector group had stable graft function at least for 5 years. Results: Significant reductions were found in the risk of renal transplant rejection in recipients possessing the CCR2-64I (A) allele (p=0.03) or 59029-A allele (p=0.03) compared to non-rejector group. There were no significant differences in the fre-quency of CCR5Δ32 polymorphism in rejector group compared to non-rejector group (p>0.05). Conclusion: It was possible to conclude that the chemokine receptors CCR2-V64I (A) and CCR5- 59029 A alleles may influence renal allograft survival

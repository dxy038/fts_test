To develop an effective vector cross entropy method, multiple probability density functions are introduced; measures to consider both the number of improvements in the objective functions and the amount of improvements in a specified objective function are proposed. An information sharing mechanism is also designed. To demonstrate and showcase the feasibility and advantage of the proposed algorithm, both high and low frequency inverse problems are solved and reported in this paper.

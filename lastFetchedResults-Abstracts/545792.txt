Objective

This study investigates the awareness and perception on “epilepsy” amongst biology teachers in Fars province, Iran.

Materials & Methods

A sample of high school biology teachers in Fars province, Iran, filled out an investigator designed questionnaire including questions about their knowledge and attitude concerning “epilepsy”. There were 17 questions in the questionnaire. Nine questions addressed the knowledge and the rest were about attitude and perception.

Results

Forty two teachers completed the questionnaires. More than two-thirds of the participants had a fairly desirable awareness about the definition; whereas, only approximately 40% knew something about the etiology and treatment of epilepsy. More than two-thirds of the participants had a positive attitude towards epilepsy; however, misconceptions and negative attitudes were observed.

Conclusion

Educational programs for biology teachers and also other teachers are necessary to improve their knowledge, attitude and perception about epilepsy.

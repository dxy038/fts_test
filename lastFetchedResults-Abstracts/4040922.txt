In this article, a specification and testbed implementation results of an application-based QoE controller are presented, proposing a solution for objective and context-aware end-to-end QoE control in the NGN networks. The proposed solution bases on standardized NGN service enabler operation principles that allows for efficient in-service QoE estimation and optimization. QoE control is accomplished through context-based QoE modeling, the principal role of which is to provide a detailed description of the circumstances, under which the communication is established and by which the end-userÂ´s QoE is affected. Implementation results and findings confirm feasibility and efficient design of the QoE controller proposal as well as full compliance with the requirements for its deployment into real-world NGN environments.

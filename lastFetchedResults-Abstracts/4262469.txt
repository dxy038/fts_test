The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility and importance of creating an innovative class of multi-attribute behavior signatures. These behavior signatures will provide an invaluable tool to the warfighter for predicting, identifying, detecting, following, and anticipating the activities of members of transnational terrorist groups, whether state- sponsored or independent actors. The primary means of accomplishing this objective is through the identification of particular domestic and international behavior, followed by a correlation of this conduct to worldwide terrorist activities. The newly identified behavior signatures may then be applied to a searchable, multi-attribute, networked terrorism identification system (hereafter "MANTIS"). An application of this kind will be searchable, fungible, scalable and responsive, thereby leveraging disparate data streams and bases of knowledge and allowing the anticipation of enemy activities.

ABSTRACT: Ecological systems which are types of organic or integrated farming, aim to improve quality and quantity at the same time. These systems can be used instead of conventional systems. A very important factor in success of these production systems is the application of biofertilizers, e.g., azotobacter and azospirillum. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of biological fertilizers of azosprilium and azetobacter on physiological and morphological characteristics and optimal yield of rice. For this purpose, a randomized block experiment design with three replicates was established. Biological fertilizer treatments as main factors consisted of Azosperilium, azetobacter, Azosperilium+azetobacter and standard (without fertilizer) and Nitrogen treatment as a secondary factor consisted in three level of 0, 45 and 90 kg/ha. Analysis of variances indicated that root inoculation with biological fertilizers of azosprilium and azetobacter had significant effect on number of active leaves, tiller in m2, unfilled grain and amount of nitrogen. Different level of nitrogen fertilizer had significant effect on above traits and length of panicle. Interaction effect of biological and nitrogen fertilizers had significant effect on number of active leaves and tiller with confidence interval of 99%. The results indicated a significant positive correlation between the numbers of tiller in m2 with length of panicle and between length of panicle with amount of nitrogen with confidence interval of 99%.

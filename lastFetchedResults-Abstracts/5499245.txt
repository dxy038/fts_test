Fuzzy techniques can be applied in several domains of image processing. In this paper we will show how notions of fuzzy set theory are used in establishing measures for image quality evaluation. Objective quality measures or measures of comparison are of great importance in the field of image processing. Such measures are necessary for the evaluation and the comparison of different algorithms that are designed to solve a similar problem, and consequently they serve as a basis on which algorithm is preferred to the other. In this paper, we will show how similarity measures originally introduced to compare two fuzzy sets can be applied successfully in the domain of image processing.

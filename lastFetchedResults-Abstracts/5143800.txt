In this paper, the controller is proposed for vehicle start-up process by using Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy, which considers the state and input variables (engine speed &#969;<sub>e</sub>, clutch friction torque T<sub>c</sub> and engine torque T<sub>e</sub>) constraints in the problem formulation. The contradictive requirements of less friction loss and less driveline shock are included in the objective function. The proposed control strategy is tested on apowertrain simulation model. Simulation results obtained are presented and discussed. Through a large number of simulations, it is verified that the system with the constrained MPC controller has ability to reject disturbances, such as vehicle mass and road grade.

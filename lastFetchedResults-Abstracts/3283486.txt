Battery energy storage system (BESS) plays great roles in peak shaving, improving voltage quality and providing active power adjustment capacity. The efficiency of active distribution network (ADN) to integrate large scale dispersed energy resources (DERs) largely depends on the rational placement of BESS. The paper focuses on the multi-objective optimal model for siting &amp; sizing BESS in ADN, concerning on peak shaving capacity, voltage quality and active power adjustment capacity. Additionally, the paper proposes a weighted minimum module ideal point method to solve the multi-objectives optimal programming. Finally, the study case results demonstrate the efficiency of the aforementioned optimal siting &amp; sizing BESS model with its solving method.

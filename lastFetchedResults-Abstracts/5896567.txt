This paper studies a field coverage problem of wireless sensor networks. The objective is to prolong the network life for active sensing coverage. The problem is modeled using cellular automata. One deterministic algorithm and one probabilistic algorithm are proposed to extend the network life time. Both algorithms allow the activation of a particular sensor be determined by the current state of its immediate neighbors. Simulation examines both algorithms in percentage of coverage, residual energy and active sensors. The simulation results show a significant increase in network lifespan with a reasonable coverage through time. The results also indicate that a cellular automata is suitable for simulating large wireless sensor networks.

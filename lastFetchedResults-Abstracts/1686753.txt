The objective of the present study is the development of an analytical model for predicting the response under reversed cyclic loading of structural members with ‘old-type’ detailing, strengthened with reinforced concrete (RC) jacketing. The analytical model introduces one additional degree of freedom between the existing member (core of the retrofitted member) and its outer RC shell, thus allowing slip to take place at the interface between the existing member and the jacket. Shear resistance mechanisms, such as aggregate interlock, friction, and dowel action, are mobilized to resist slip. Existing constitutive models are further improved to describe the mechanisms that resist sliding under cyclic shear reversals and implemented for the first time in an analytical model for deriving the response of RC jacketed members. A calculation algorithm is developed to estimate the flexural response under cyclic loading taking into account slip at the interfaces. The sensitivity of the proposed analytical model to the shear transfer mechanisms degradation rules, as well as to the crack spacing estimation, was evaluated. The validity of the proposed analytical model is assessed against experimental results.

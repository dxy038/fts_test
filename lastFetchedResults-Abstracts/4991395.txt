In this paper, we study the problem of regenerator pool site selection for mixed line rate optical networks (MLR-RPSS), with the objective of minimizing the number of regenerator pool sites for a given set of requests. We first provide the problem definition of MLR-RPSS and show that the MLR-RPSS problem is NP-complete. We then present four algorithms, named Independent algorithm, Sequential algorithm, MLR-combined algorithm, and Weighted MLR-combined algorithm. The performance of the algorithms is compared via simulation and results show that the Weighted MLR-combined algorithm has better performance in most cases. Also, when network load is high, the minimum number of regenerator pool sites will approach a certain limit, and some specific nodes will be more likely to be selected as regenerator pool sites.

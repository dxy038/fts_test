Efficient energy transfer has been demonstrated in an Er/Yb codoped phosphorus-doped silica fiber for the first time. This has indirectly allowed the use of reliable, high-power AlGaAs diode laser arrays as the semiconductor pump source through the use of a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser (DPL) operating at 1064 nm. Small signal gains of 42 dB and output powers of 71 mW (+18.5 dBm) have been observed with a single DPL. Bidirectional pumping with two DPLs has yielded an output power of 130 mW (+21 dBm).&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

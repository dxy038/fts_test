This paper conduct a comprehensive simulation study on the behavior of TCP-friendly Rate Control (TFRC) protocol over Ad-Hoc On Demand Vector (AODV) routing protocol and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. The aim are first, to measure the performance of TFRC in terms of throughput, delay and jitter. The second objective is to identify which Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) routing protocols work well with TFRC. We conduct the experiment by sending multimedia streaming traffic carried by TFRC over AODV and DSR respectively. Random-Waypoint mobility model is used for both experiments. Results obtained shows that in average TFRC over AODV has more throughput and less delay as compared with TFRC over DSR. However, in terms of jitter, TFRC over DSR gives better result.

This paper analyzes the choice of a PISA selector for a Hybrid Algorithm integrating it as a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) with a path-dependent search algorithm. The interaction between these components provides an efficient procedure for solving Multi-Objective Problems (MOPs) in operations scheduling. In order to choose the selector,  we consider both NSGA and SPEA as well as their successors (NSGAII and SPEAII). NSGAII and SPEAII are shown to be the most efficient candidates. On the other hand, for the path-dependent search at the end of each evolutionary phase we use the multi-objective version of Simulated Annealing.

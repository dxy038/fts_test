According to the principles of philosophical hermeneutics, "understanding" represents an existential description in general and the interpreter’s understanding of the text, including the religious text, in particular, within the framework of the interpreters' prior expectations, questions and knowledge. This understanding is not only deeply affected by prior knowledge, but, basically it is indispensable to it. In his Al-Mizan Commentary, Allameh Tabatabaei uses various principles and approved premises in his interpretation of the Quran and these can be considered among his preconceptions. The question that arises here whether or not it is possible to make a true and accurate interpretation of the Quran within the framework of preconceptions. Using a descriptive –analytical method, the present paper investigates the role of Allameh’s preconceptions in his interpretation. The result shows that he rejects undue interference of preconceptions in the interpretation of the Qur'an or imposing them on the Qur'an, and regards the acceptable preconceptions as principles and rules for the objective understanding of the meaning intended by God. His ideas about interpretation can be considered as consistent with objective hermeneutics and opposing philosophical hermeneutics.

In this paper we present a software system that is being developed at the University of Leeds for simulating and optimizing energy efficient optical core networks. The system is called CORNETO, an acronym for CORe NETwork Optimization. The software implements many of the energy saving concepts, methods and computational heuristics that have been produced by the ongoing INTERNET, INTelligent Energy awaRe NETworks, project. The main objective of the software is to help network operators and planners green their networks while maintaining quality of service. In this paper we briefly describe the software and demonstrate its capabilities with two case studies.

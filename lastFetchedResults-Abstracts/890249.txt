Crop models are appropriate and low-cost tools for investigating the effect of agricultural inputs on water and
soil resources and crop production. The objective of this study was to evaluate the OILCROP-SUN model for
Euroflor hybrid of sunflower in order to gain a suitable base to conserve soil and water resources. This study was
conducted as a strip-plot statistical design with randomized complete blocks design with three replications for
each treatment. Total biomass, seed weight, seed yield, percentage of seed oil, and seed nitrogen were measured.
Using collected field data, OILCROP-SUN model was calibrated and evaluated for different levels of water and
nitrogen applications. Six genetic coefficients were then derived from calibration of OILCROP-SUN model for
Euroflor hybrid. The results indicated that seed yields were simulated reasonably well for 12 treatments with
NRMSE value of 18.5%, and the d-index of 0.92. The d value of different treatments of water and nitrogen for
seed nitrogen was 0.93, and for oil production per hectare was 0.91.

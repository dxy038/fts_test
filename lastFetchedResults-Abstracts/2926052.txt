The objective of this paper is to present the current activities, jointly carried out by DIST and LAN, in the development of a computational architecture for the control of advanced robot systems. In particular, the activity is focused on marine and underwater applications. The problem of the control of advanced robot systems is discussed. A Lyapunov based approach to the synthesis of the control laws in task space domain is presented. Moreover, experimental setups implementing the proposed control scheme are briefly described

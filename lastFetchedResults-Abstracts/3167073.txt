A research activity is being carried out with the objective of finding approximations that allow the estimation of several propagation parameters (attenuation, brightness temperature and mean radiating temperature), from other measurements. The research is based on radiosounding data from 60 sites covering the World. Some polynomials have been obtained from the global set of data, and from the data corresponding to ko&#776;ppen climatic zones. The latter provide better estimations. The results are compared with the best possible option, which would be the use of the data obtained for the stations themselves. We can conclude that the ko&#776;ppen approximations give better results than the global ones, except in one case (in which the advantage is small). Finally we indicate the future perspectives of our work.

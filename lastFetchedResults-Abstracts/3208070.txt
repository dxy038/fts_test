This paper proposes an optimal rotor design method of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) using a permanent magnet (PM) shape. The goal of this design is to obtain the minimum design variables of an objective function using a Box-Behnken response. To find the best design model, high torque and low torque ripple were found from electromagnetic finite element method, and safety factor was obtained from mechanical stiffness analysis.

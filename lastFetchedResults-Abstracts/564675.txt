The purpose of this article is studying the city schema from the perspective of Islamic notions.  The main question is what are the traditional schematic components and non-schematic components in the construction of a city in the Muslim world.  The practical method is like the one used by Muslim scholars in their researches.  Thus, the source documents in the research are Quran, narratives and scientistsâ€™ views which have been used as basic knowledge and the widely accepted rational arguments and inferences.  The results demonstrate that in a traditional city structure there is a multifaceted relationship between all components.  Such a structure is earthly and heavenly; in other words, the earth is the shadow of the sky.  The purpose of the traditional city structure is to develop the appropriate ground for the guidance of mankind to perfection which is absolute submission.  It is through such submission that the individual finds peace of heart and the necessary ground would be developed for the emergence of justice.   Traditional city structures are changing continuously in accordance with changes in the nature and the development of new needs.  While having diversity, it has unity.  On the other hand, the interconnection between the components has caused the elements of nature to be used in the traditional city structure properly and as much as necessary.  Since the purpose of the traditional city structure is human being and human being has spirit and body, such a structure is shaped according to human being and his physical and spiritual needs.  Accordingly, before establishing the city, the traditional human being must be created. Therefore, the objective in the traditional structure is beyond just establishing the framework of the city.

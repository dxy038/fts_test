The objective of this study is to characterize the multiple-access interference in a DS-CDMA integrated voice/data wireless network. The system model is designed to accommodate bursty packet-based data services in addition to stream-based services on a shared spectrum basis. A common packet data channel (CPDC) is employed to transport bursty data services, Consequently, this study incorporates features associated with packet-based services, such as higher transmitter power, short inter-arrival times, and short service time durations, as well as features associated with stream-based services, in order to provide a complete interference characterization. The results of a detailed and precise simulation study are presented in which the influence of traffic burstiness, voice activity, spatial distribution of mobiles, and transmitter powers on the fluctuation of the interference and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is assessed. The results obtained also quantify the impact of interference caused by CPDC services on stream-based services. The interference and SIR statistics are evaluated in terms of cumulative distribution functions. Since a DS-CDMA network is interference limited, studies of this type are essential for system design, capacity evaluation, and bandwidth management

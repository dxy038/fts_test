The first method developed to translate customer requirements into software specification was the Quality Function deployment (QFD) and the second approach to the identification of software specification comes from the software engineering. Requirements may be defined as a demand or need. In software engineering, a requirement is a description of what a system should do. System may have dozen to thousands of requirements. Software requirements stipulate what must be accomplished, transformed, produced or provided. It is well documented that requirement engineering saves money. There are several techniques to elicit the software requirements like JAD, misuse, RAD, Web Surveys etc. In this paper we have used the Web Surveys approach to elicit the software requirements for a railway projects. The main objective of this paper is to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of the freight transportation between source and destination using optimization algorithm.

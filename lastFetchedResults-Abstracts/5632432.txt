Flexure joints are frequently used in precision mechanisms, from motion stages to micro-robots. Due to their monolithic construction and superior wear and loss properties, flexure joints can be used to reduce the mechanism size and increase the positioning accuracy. The compliance of flexure joints, however, can affect the static and dynamic characteristics of the overall mechanism. The objective of this paper is to develop analysis and design tools for general platform type parallel mechanisms that contain flexure joints. In this paper, a micro planar parallel mechanism that has 3-DOF motion is examined by considering the configuration change effect. Usually, MEMS mechanism is designed for a specific purpose with a motion restriction. Here, using the conventional planar parallel robotics design, a general purpose of micro mechanism is presented.

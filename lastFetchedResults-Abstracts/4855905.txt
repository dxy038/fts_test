The objective of this study is to construct an balanced scorecard (BSC) based on knowledge management and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) for evaluating an software companies. The BSC concept is applied to define the hierarchy with four major perspectives (i.e. financial, customer, internal business process, and learning and growth), and performance indicators are selected for each perspective. A fuzzy AHP (FAHP) approach is then proposed in order to determine weight. The results provide guidance to software companies regarding strategies for improving department performance.

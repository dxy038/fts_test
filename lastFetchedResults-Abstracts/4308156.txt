Torque ripple and consequent acoustic noise is one of the primary disadvantage of a switched reluctance machine which otherwise possess excellent characteristic for application in many commercial drives. This paper begins with modeling and simulation for performance evaluation of a switched reluctance machine. Two design modifications were then suggested in the design with the objective of minimization of torque ripple. The first modification is introduced to the stator pole teeth. In the second modification skewing is done in steps of one degree up to twenty degrees. The performance parameters of the design is simulated and the results were compared with those of standard SRM and the angle of minimum torque ripple is identified. This paper also examines the effects on the torque due to variations in the air gap.

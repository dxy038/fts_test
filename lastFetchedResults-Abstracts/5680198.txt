In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm with a spanning tree representation for solving the bicriteria fixed charge transportation problem. First we consider the fixed charge transportation problem with a single objective function by the spanning tree-based genetic algorithm, and then extend this GA approach to solve the bicriteria problem. Due to the bicriteria program, the fitness function is constructed by dynamic scaling which normalizes the different data from the bicriteria region. The proposed genetic algorithm can find Pareto optimal solutions in the bicriteria space. Computational results will show the performance of the spanning tree-based genetic algorithm

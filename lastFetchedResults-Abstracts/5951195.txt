Methods Forl22 essential hypertensive patients who were enrolled in the trial groups, we chose 104 normotensives as control group PCR-RFLP method was used to measure the C/T polymorphism. The results were observed by agarose gel eletrophoresis. Some biochemical tests were performed also.Results The frequencies of 825T allele were 54.1% to 51.5% in the two groups. The association between the polymorphism and blood pressure was analyzed by the case-control study.There is not association between GNB3 825C/T polymorphism. GNB3 has some effects on regulation of the blood pressure, but it is not a susceptible gene of hypertension in the Mudanjiang Region of china.

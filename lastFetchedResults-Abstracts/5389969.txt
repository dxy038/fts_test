In this demonstration, distributed consensus building is used to improve the performance of RSSI based trilateration algorithms. Specifically, the objective of the consensus is to determine the spatial centroid for a distribution of sensor nodes in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Incorporating a consensus aspect reduces the sensitivity of the objective to dropped packets, changing topologies, and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fluctuations. The work will present results for both fully and partially connected networks through simulation and a hardware implementation.

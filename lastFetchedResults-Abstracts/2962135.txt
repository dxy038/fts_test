We present a formulation of the plant layout problem where the objective is to minimize work-in-process. We show that the choice of layout has a direct impact on work-in-process accumulation, manufacturing lead time, achievable throughput rates, and required material handling capacity. More importantly, we show that layouts generated using a queueing-based model can be very different from those obtained using conventional layout procedures

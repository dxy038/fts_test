The detailed parametric study of an irreversible regenerative Brayton refrigerator cycle using the new thermoeconomic approach is presented in this paper. The external irreversibility is due to finite temperature difference between the cycle and the external reservoirs while the internal irreversibilities are due to the nonisentropic compression and expansion processes and the regenerative loss. The thermoeconomic objective function defined as the cooling load per unit cost is optimized with respect to the state point temperatures for a typical set of operating conditions. The power input and cooling load are found to be decreasing functions of the expansion outlet temperature (T1), while it is the reverse in the case of COP. On the other hand, there are optimal values of the temperature T1, cooling load, power input and COP at which the cycle attains the maximum objective function for a typical set of operating parameters. Again, the objective function, COP and cooling load further enhance, while the power input goes down, as the various values of the effectiveness or efficiency components are increased.

Energy storage is the major concern in smart micro grids like in renewable power generation, electric vehicles and small scale DC-UPS systems. This paper proposes analysis, and voltage mode control of coupled inductor bidirectional converter. Unfortunately, switches of four and beyond in isolated schemes increase production costs and reduce conversion efficiency, and non-isolated topologies suffer from high voltage/current stress. As compared with the counterparts of conventional converter topologies, the proposed converter has the merits of less component count, high efficiency, and smaller size. The high voltage diversity enables a battery module of low voltage to be interfaced with the high-voltage dc bus or the micro grid for subsequent utilization. The battery fed bidirectional converter with controller to regulate the DC link voltage and battery charge voltage is implemented in the Simulink/Matlab environment. Also, experimental confirmation of the proposed converter is shown.

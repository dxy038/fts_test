Optimization of machining processes is of primary importance for increasing machining efficiency and economics. Determining optimal values of machining parameters is performed by applying optimization algorithms to mathematical models of relationships between machining parameters and machining performance measures. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of using empirical models and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The use of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms is justified because of their ability to handle highly non-linear, multi-dimensional and multi-modal optimization problems. Meta-heuristic algorithms are powerful optimization tools which provide high quality solutions in a short amount of computational time. However, their stochastic nature creates the need to validate the obtained solutions. This paper presents a software prototype for single and multi-objective machining process optimization. Since it is based on an exhaustive iterative search, it guarantees the optimality of determined solution in given discrete search space. The motivation for the development of the presented software prototype was the validation of machining optimization solutions obtained by meta-heuristic algorithms. To analyze the software prototype applicability and performance, six case studies of machining optimization problems, both single and multi-objective, were considered. In each case study the optimization solutions that had been determined by past researchers using meta-heuristic algorithms were either validated or improved by using the developed software prototype.

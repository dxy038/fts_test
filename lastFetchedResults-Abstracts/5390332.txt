The deployment of wireless networks needs to consider both the cost and system performance metrics. The design objective is to decide the optimal placement of access points (or base stations) and to assign the available radio resources to respective traffic demand points with guaranteed performance, while keeping the deployment cost at its minimum. However, we feel that it would be better to adopt a design which can achieve long-term optimal rather than just at the instant of deployment. This paper set up a platform to look into the deployment of wireless networks which is able to optimize the profit generated over multiple periods each with different spatial traffic demands. Given a set of candidate sites, we first derive the placement and compute the transmission power of the access points to support a given spatial traffic demand over a specific period of time. The problem was formulated using a mixed integer linear programming model. Adjustable transmission range is made possible through power control to minimize the amount of interference among neighboring access points. With the knowledge on the projected demand traffic in subsequent periods, algorithms to maximize the long term profit are developed, both when the projected traffic are probabilistic and deterministic.

This paper explores a configuration for modular inverter system, namely, input-series-output-series (ISOS) connected inverter system, which is suitable for high-input-voltage and high-output-voltage applications. The control objective of this configuration is to realize input voltage sharing and output voltage sharing. On the basis of existing centralized control method, a novel distributed voltage sharing control strategy is proposed. Compared with the centralized control strategy, the distributed control strategy makes each module in the system work independently and fully modularity is achieved. The principle of the control method is elaborated and the experimental results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis.

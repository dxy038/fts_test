Background and objective: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) -as a novel, non-invasive therapeutic approach- may be considered a valuable strategy. This study was designed with the aim of the evaluation of efficacy of PDT in treatment of BCC.
Methods: This was a clinical trial which was done on 28 patients with BCC. Patients were treated with ALA- PDT for 1-6 sessions monthly and evaluated for clinical response, cosmetic results and probable side effects.
Results: From 28 lesions 82.1% had some response to PDT (32.1% complete response and 50% partial response). Cosmetic result was excellent or good in 77.5% of cases. In 92.8% of cases no or mild side effect was observed. Patients with positive history of radiotherapy had less response (p<0.05). No significant relation was found between patient's age or sex, localization, diameter and type of BCC with clinical response. At 6 months, none of the lesions had recurrence.
Conclusion: PDT would be a good therapeutic option in treatment of BCC -especially superficial type- with high efficacy and low side effect.

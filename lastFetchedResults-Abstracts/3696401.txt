Successful employment of numerical techniques for the solution of forward and inverse ECG problems requires the ability to both quantify and minimize approximation errors introduced as part of the discretization process. Our objective is to develop discretization and refinement strategies involving hybrid-shaped finite elements so as to minimize approximation errors for the ECG inverse problem. We examine both the ill-posedness of the mathematical inverse problem and the ill-conditioning of the discretized system in order to propose strategies specifically designed for the ECG inverse problem. We demonstrate that previous discretization and approximation strategies may worsen the properties of the inverse problem approximation. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our strategies on both a simplified and a realistic 2-D torso model.

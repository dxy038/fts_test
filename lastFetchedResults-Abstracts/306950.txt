Background: The objective of the study was to evaluate the additional value of Î²-glucuronidase (BGD), a lysosomal enzyme in the analysis of transudative and exsudative pleural effusions, especially between malignant and non-malignant effusions.
Design and methods: Pleural fluid samples obtained from four respective diagnostic groups: transudates parapneumonic effusions, malignant effusions or pleuritis carcinomatosa, and empyema were evaluated.
Results: Beta-glucuronidase was significantly different between transudative and exsudative effusions (p < 0.001) as well as between parapneumonic and malignant effusions (p< 0.03), parapneumonic effusions and empyema (p< 0.002), and malignant and empyema (p< 0.002), respectively. Logistic regression analysis yielded a weak discrimination between the parapneumonic and malignant groups.
Conclusions: Beta-glucuronidase activity differed between pleural effusions of various origin. However, including BGD in the biochemical work-up of pleural effusions did not reveal discriminatory value in the assessment of the classification of these effusions.

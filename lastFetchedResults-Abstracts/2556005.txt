Background: Water is considered as a vital element in the life cycle. Therefore,
water safety in drinking and agricultural fields is one of the communitiesâ€™ necessities
to protect health of humans and environment.
Objective: The main objective of the present study was to evaluate and classify
the water quality of Ghorbaghestan and Doab Merk Stations in Kermanshah
Province owing to the importance of their drinking and agricultural uses as well
as recent droughts in Kermanshah province and Gharasoo watershed resulting
in discharge reduction of Gharasoo river.
Material & Methods: The studied parameters of water chemical quality in this
study were salts residual, acidity, electrical conductivity, bicarbonate, chloride,
sulfate, magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, sodium absorption ratio and
total hardness. In this study, the obtained data placed in the XLSTAT software.
Then, the homogeneity and Mankendal numbers were drawn using Homogeneity
and Petit tests in a period of 40 years. Also, the Paiper, Duru, Shuler and
Wilcox diagrams were drawn in Ghorbaghestan and Doabmerck stations using
the Aqua Chem software.
Results: The classification results of Wilcox in Ghorbaghestan and Doabmerck
stations showed that the samples placed in the class slightly salty
(C2S1);therefore, the river water in these stations was almost suitable for agricultural.
The Shuler diagram showed that the water quality was inappropriate
for drinking in Ghorbaghestan and Doabmerck stations.
Conclision: For improving the quality of river water and its efficient use, point
and non-point pollutants entry into the river water especially urban and nonurban
sewage should be prevented with long-term plans

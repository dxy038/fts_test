Digital images are distorted by processing, transmission, compression etc. We need objective image quality assessment (IQA) to check each processing performance. The objective IQA should be matched to human eyes perceptually. Up to now, a variety of objective IQA measures have been proposed. They are suitable for a specific type of noise images. In this paper we propose a new objective IQA method by combining two scores of objective IQA. This combining is suitable commonly for the JPEG compressed images and the white Gaussian noise images as well as the contrast change images. By experiments, the performance of the proposed method is validated.

This test was conducted to evaluate the addition of a thrust director bug to the engine display. The purpose of the thrust director is similar to that of a flight director on an ADI, where deflection indicates path error. In the case of the thrust director the bug magnifies the error with the target Nl value. The objective of the test was to evaluate the addition of this bug to the Nl dial to see if it assisted the pilot in more quickly acquiring a set Nl target value. Two engine formats were presented, one with and one without the thrust director bug. The subjects used high fidelity C-5 RERP prototype throttles in a high fidelity simulator. Testing was conducted using 5 C-5 test pilot participants. The addition of the thrust director reduced the time to set an Nl target value by as much as 4.5 seconds.

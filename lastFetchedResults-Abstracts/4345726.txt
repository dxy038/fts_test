Distance learning context means that the learners in a digital learning environment achieve their learning objectives through self-spaced learning or collaborative learning, studying the knowledge contents, passing several tests and acquiring the knowledge they needed. In this context, learners face several learning problems, such as studying the same learning content repeatedly, skipping to the next learning unit before achieving the current learning objective, staying at a learning unit for a long time, and browsing the irrelevant learning units. So developing some navigation and sequencing strategies in the learning process is critical. Some e-learning standardization organization has specified the learning process and learning activities in distance learning contexts. These specifications include IMS Simple Sequencing (SS), ADL SCORM SN and CELTS-8. In this paper, we analyzed these specifications and proposed several navigation and sequencing strategies for distance learning process

This paper describes a Qt-based C++ application for full-reference stereoscopic video quality assessment. The application is platform independent and provides a friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). The stereoscopic video signals used in the application are based in two-view model, such as the H.264/AVC standard with Multiview Video Coding (MVC), and several spatial resolutions are available. The application provides objective video quality algorithms, such as PSNR, SSIM and PW-SSIM and incorporates a recently published technique for stereoscopic video quality assessment, called disparity weighting (DW), DPSNR, DSSIM and DPW-SSIM. Numerical results corresponding to the performance of the objective measurements acquired using the proposed application are presented. The ultimate goal is that the application will contribute, as an open-source tool to be used by academia and industry, for standardization and development of objective algorithms and evaluation of impairments in stereoscopic video signals caused by some processing techniques.

Gradient stiffness leaf spring is of a positive meaning for increasing the ride smooth of vehicle, which has a more stable natural frequency of leaf spring stiffness. A multi-objective optimization model of Gradient stiffness leaf spring of vehicles is established according to a certain light truck. Using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, the model is solved on the Optimal Design platform Matlab software. A optimal structure design scheme and optimization design parameters are obtained under the goals of the minimum total mass of the spring, minimum maximum stress in the roots of main spring, minimum maximum stress in the roots of auxiliary spring.

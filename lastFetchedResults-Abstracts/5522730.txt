The accuracy and the real-time of the flood disaster evaluation are significant to the disaster rescue measures. However, itpsilas difficult to obtain accurate value of flood assessment factor because of the restrictions of objective conditions, which increases the difficulties of real-time evaluation. The traditional assessment methods have some limitations to some extent. In order to improve the time efficiency of evaluation, a method based on cloud model is proposed in this paper, which can fuzzily and quickly evaluate under the conditions of having no accurate value but some fuzzy reviews of factors. Firstly, the reviews grading model and the corresponding score model of each assessment factor are constituted. Then according to the uncertain reasoning regulations of the cloud model, the fuzzy reviews are quantified to accurate value so that the quantitative analysis of flood disaster loss can be finished quickly. Lastly, based on the qualitative and quantitative mapping nature of the cloud generator, the final composite score can be qualitatively re-evaluated to some disaster grade. This paper puts forward a new method for quick flood disaster evaluation, which is proved to be efficient after comparing the experimental results with composite index computation method.

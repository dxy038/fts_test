In this paper we propose a deformation transfer technique that achieves physically-plausible deformation by transferring stretchiness ratios of local edges. Given a source reference mesh, a source deformed mesh, and a target reference mesh, the objective is to transfer deformation between the source reference and deformed onto the target reference, and produce a target deformed mesh. To generate a deformed target, we create a mass-spring system which is topologically consistent with the target reference mesh and multiply the stretchiness ratio between the edge lengths from the source meshes to the rest lengths of that mass-spring system. The deformed new target mesh can be synthesized by computing the equilibrium state of the new mass-spring system. To increase the performance we also adopt a non-linear multi-grid algorithm for solving large scale mass-spring systems. Stretchiness ratio is a coordinate-free quantity and we show that our method outperform previous approaches in certain cases.

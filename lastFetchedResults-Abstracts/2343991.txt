The objective of this study is to investigate specific energy in grinding of tungsten carbides of various grain sizes. Through the construction of a mathematical model, the study demonstrates the correlation of specific energy with the grinding process parameters and the material property parameters for the tungsten carbides. The study also examines material-removal mechanisms and surface finish in grinding of such materials using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry and energy dispersive spectrometry techniques, etc. The study concludes that specific energy is related not only to grinding process parameters, but also to the physicalâ€“mechanical properties of the workpiece material.

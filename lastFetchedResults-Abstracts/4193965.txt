A mathematical model is proposed for the target characteristics in laser scattering analysis, using the Bidirectional Reflectance Distributional Function (BRDF) effectively describing the reflective property of the target surface material. The five-parameter genetic algorithm simulated annealing is employed to perform parametric inversion for the semi-empirical statistical expression the BRDF modeled by. On obtaining these parameter values required in the BRDF model, LRCS of the target is then determined in a straightforward manner according to the mathematical relationship between the BRDF and the LRCS. The model is validated by yielding simulated results which agree with the measured data and proves to be an effective approach in evaluating target characteristics in laser scattering analysis.

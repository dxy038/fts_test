Objectives:
Cardiac troponins T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) are the most sensitive biochemical parameters in the detection of myocardial damage. In neonates, in utero exposure to tocolytic therapy results in detectable values of cardiac troponins after delivery. Additionally, some preliminary results suggest that the upper reference limits for healthy newborns are higher than those for adults but definitive reference limits for newborns are not available. Our objective was to determine those limits.
Design and methods:
In this study we investigated the distribution of cTnT and cTnI in cord blood of 869 healthy newborns. cTnT was determined with the 3rd generation assay and cTnI with the Dade Behring assay on a Dimension RxL. For data analysis Student's t test and the Mann–Whitney U test were used.
Results:
Using the 99th percentile, the upper reference limit in healthy termed newborns was 0.097 μg/l for cTnT and 0.183 μg/l for cTnI. Compared to the adult values, the newborn upper limit was tripled for cTnT and doubled for cTnI. Statistically significant differences were found between males and females for cTnT and between natural childbirth and caesarean section for cTnI.
Conclusion:
Healthy-termed newborns have a higher upper reference limit for both cTnT and cTnI compared to adults. This circumstance must be taken into account when interpreting slightly “elevated” cTnT and cTnI values in newborns.

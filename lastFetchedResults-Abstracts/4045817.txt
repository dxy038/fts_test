In digital broadcasting services such as digital satellite TV, cable TV, and digital terrestrial TV, several video programs are compressed by MPEG-2 and then simultaneously transmitted over a conventional CBR (constant bit rate) broadcasting channel. In this environment, the picture quality of the aggregated video programs should be kept as equal as possible to provide fair video services for all the viewers. We propose a joint video coding scheme for ensuring that the picture quality of all the programs are nearly the same. This objective is achieved by simultaneously controlling the video encoders to generate the VBR (variable bit rate) compressed video streams. This paper contributes in two ways. First, we propose a rate-distortion estimation method for MPEG-2 video, which enables us to predict the amount of bits and the distortion generated from an encoded picture at a given quantization step size and vice versa. The most attractive features of the proposed estimation method are its accuracy and a computational complexity low enough to be applied to real-time video coding applications. Second, this paper presents an efficient and accurate joint video coding scheme using the rate-distortion estimation results. The experimental results show that our coding scheme gives a higher and more stable picture quality and a more efficient channel utilization than an independent coding scheme that encodes each program independently

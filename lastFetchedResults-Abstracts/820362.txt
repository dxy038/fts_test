The results of 10 year-old non-clinical Iranian samples in Rorschach test were compared with the ones of their non Iranian counterparts (Exner, 2003).  In doing so, one hundred and seventy fourth grade students (80 girls and 90 boys) from five education districts of the city of Tehran participated in the study and the Rorshach test was administered to  them. Mean scores comparison in two groups of Iranian and Exner samples showed significant differences in variables of location, determinant, content and popular variables. Considering the culture related factors affecting objective and projective tests similarly, these results could be attributed to cultural differences.

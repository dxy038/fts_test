Rainfall-runoff models are important in the water resource management of river basins. The main aspect of this role is determined through proper use of these models and relies on the quality of their calibration. Mainly, there are two approaches in rainfall-runoff model calibrations. The first one is a simple time consuming trial and error method and is limited to small problems. The second approach, on the other hand, uses optimization techniques to find proper values of parameters and is capable of handling large scale problems calibrations.This article references an attempted calibration of a precipitation-runoff model using a newly developed heuristic approach called Marriage in Honey Bees Optimization (MBO). The process contains development of simulation-optimization models using the heuristic methods for improving the value of objective function obtained through the simulation of a runoff-rainfall Tank model.The results obtained through the application of MBO compares favorably to those of a Genetic Algorithm.

Conventional practices in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) operations have a great potential for improvement as regards information management. This paper presents a method for automated information processing of uncertain search results produced by multiple agents. Information association is based on graph analysis which considers georeferences, spatial precision and preexisting knowledge. The objective of the scoring fusion is to suggest as quickly and as precisely as possible the hypothetic positions of trapped persons by increasing the quality of uncertain information. The overall aim is to ameliorate the search efficiency by increasing the detection capabilities while reducing risks, false alarms and oversight.

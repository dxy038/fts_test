
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a glycoprotein is a member of the tumor necrotizing factor alpha receptor super-family. By considering the possible role of OPG in cardiovascular disease (CVD), higher incidence of CVD in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN), and anti-atherosclerotic effects of statins, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of lovastatin on serum levels of OPG, and soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-?B ligand (sRANKL) in people with T2DN.
METHODS: During the present quasi clinical trial, 30 male adult patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy were studied. Lovastatin, 20 mg/d was administrated for 90 days. Serum levels of OPG and sRANKL were measured using commercial ELISA kits at baseline, after 90 days of intervention, and after 30 days of withdrawal of lovastatin.
FINDINGS: Serum level of OPG was significantly increased (10.76±16.44) and decreased (7.38±11.98) during 90 days of intervention and 30 days of withdrawal periods, respectively (p < 0.002), while sRANKL level was significantly decreased (1192.08±578.20) and increased (4418.67±2124.66) during the same periods, respectively (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate decreased risk of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification following lovastatin administration.

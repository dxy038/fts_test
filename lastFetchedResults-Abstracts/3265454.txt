IP/MPLS service providers rely on transport networks to provide bandwidth on demand with the lowest possible provisioning time. However, due to the static nature of transport networks and the differences in the communication languages and switching systems, the IP/MPLS and transport network management systems are isolated from each other. To address this issue, a mediator called &#8220;ONE Adapter&#8221; has been developed. It allows automatic interaction and coordination of network management functions between the two network management systems. The objective of this paper is to capture the deployment impact of the mediator on the business of IP/MPLS providers and transport service providers, and to illustrate the changes in the market. To achieve that, we have conducted a survey of the literature on business models in the telecommunication sector and analyzed the service offerings of 15 leading telecommunication operators. The result is a description of the current Internet ecosystem, including the market players, their roles, and relationships. Furthermore, our results suggest that a mediator deployment will change the way how the IP/MPLS network and the transport network interact. It will allow new players to enter the market and new business models to emerge. This study will help IP/MPLS and transport service providers to anticipate the changes in the market due to a NMS mediator entering the market.

An original technique to transform functional representation of the design into a structural representation in form of a data flow graph (DFG) is described. A canonical, word-level data structure, Taylor expansion diagram (TED), is used as a vehicle to effect this transformation. The problem is formulated as that of applying a sequence of decomposition cuts to a TED that transforms it into a DFG optimized for a particular objective. A systematic approach to arrive at such a decomposition is described. Experimental results show that such constructed DFG provides a better starting point for architectural synthesis than those extracted directly from HDL specifications

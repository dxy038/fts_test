In order to overcome the weakness of subjectivity in determining weight coefficient of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, an attributes recognition method based on coefficient of data-driven is built up, and the weight is determined by the data-mining thinking through comprehensive utilization of classification criteria information and sample information. Utilization of this model to evaluate the water quality of Fuqiao River reservoir verifies its feasibility. Through comparison with traditional fuzzy synthetic evaluation method and attribute recognition model based on coefficient of entropy, the attribute recognition model based on coefficient of data-driven can get more objective evaluation results.

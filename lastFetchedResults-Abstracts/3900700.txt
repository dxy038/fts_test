The objective of this study was to examine the biosynthesis potential of facultative marine fungus <i>Aspergillus niger</i> (isolated from coastal waters of Gulf of Cambay, West Coast of India) for the preparation of silver nanoparticles. When fungus was challenged with different concentrations of silver nitrate (0.25-1-mM), within 24-h, it synthesised extracellular silver nanoparticles. The biosynthesised nanoparticles were characterised by analytical techniques through UV-visible spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The particles were found to be spherical with size range of 5-26-nm. Laser optical speckles were also observed for these nanoparticles, which is the first ever report of laser optical speckles from biosynthesised silver nanoparticles using marine-derived fungus.

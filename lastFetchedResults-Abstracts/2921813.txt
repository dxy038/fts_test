Demonstrates the feasibility of performing the perfect shuffle using holographic optical interconnects which in conjunction with the Sightmod and suitable associated electronic hardware could, in principle, be used to implement sorting and related algorithms. This would not make much sense, however, since although the shuffle itself is performed in parallel, the data is still fed into the Sightmod and out of the sensing camera in serial manner. The authors primary objective for forming these interconnections is to eventually devise a holographic interconnection scheme for neural network type architectures. Future arrays will conclude fan-out and weighted interconnections which will require greater space-bandwidth products. This may be achieved in the optically generated arrays by subdivision of each holographic facet

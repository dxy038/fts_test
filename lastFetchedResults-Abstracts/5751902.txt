We propose a novel Spread-Time UWB modulation scheme to send additional information over Community Antenna Television (CATV) networks. It takes advantage of Spread-Time technology (ST-UWB) [1], to minimize the interference between TV and UWB signals. The objective of this study is two fold. First, quantify how much additional one-way broadcasting capacity is gained when ST-UWB signals are mixed on top of the standard TV channels in CATV networks. Second, compare its performance with that of a more conventional scheme based on a direct sequence spread spectrum approach (SS-UWB).

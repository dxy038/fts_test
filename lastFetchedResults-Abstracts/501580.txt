Introduction: Helicobacter pylori infection is likely acquired was in childhood. Helicobacter pylori is recognized as a cause of gastritis and peptic ulcer. Our objective to investigate some noninvasive tests, particularly serum H pylori IgG, for the diagnosis of H pylori infection in comparison with the gold-standard invasive test, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy (histology and rapid urease test).

Materials and Methods: We studied 100 patients (age range: 6-18 years) who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy (histologic examination) for a suspicious upper gastrointestinal disease, in all of them serum Hpylori immunoglobulin G was measured and result of this were compared with those of the gold standard esopahgogastrodudenoscopy with biopsy.

Results: Of 100 patients (60 males, 40 females), 91% had history of gastrointestinal disease and 29% had positive family history for gastrointestinal disease, gastritis, ulcer and erosion were found respectively in 94%, 31%, 34% of patients.

Rapid urease test, serology and histology were positive respectively in 57%, 23%, and 29% of patients. In comparison with histology sensitivity of serology was 45% and it's specificity was 71%. Conclusion: serum Hpylori IgG test has a low sensitivity and specificity in children in comparison with the gold standard invasive test.

Background: Pain management is the challenging concepts in health workers. Since neonates have higher pain sensitivity in compare to childhood and adults. The objective of this study was to examine the pain relieving effect of breast feeding during immunization injections in healthy neonates.
Methods and Materials: In this control randomized clinical trial, Samples were divided two groups (by age and sex) of 76 healthy 2- 4 months old term infants. In breast-fed group, 2 minutes before, during, and 15 seconds after the DPT immunization injection were in mother hug, and in control group as routine of clinic, were lied on the examining table during injection. Appearance of Neonates were observed and assessed by Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS) during 5 second before immunization to 15 second after it.
Results: In breast fed and control group mean of age were 81.53±41.46 and 81.61±40.59 day and for weight were 6.65±1.17 and 6.70±1.14 kg for hight were 64.27±5.5 and 63.38±5.06 cm respectively. There were significant differences in Behavioral Pain Scores of two groups include: facial expression (4 items), cry (5 items), and movements (6 items). (P<0.0001). There is no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for age, sex and the time of feeding prior to vaccination 
Conclusion: Regarding to significant difference in behavioral of pain responds in two groups, it is suggested, with simple and safe intervention method of straight breast feeding reduce pain during immunization and muscular injections too.

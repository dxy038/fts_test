Background and Objective: Due to volatile property of monomer from methylmethacrylate and its well known toxic side effects, in case of absorbtion via skin or respiratory system. Also, due to allergic reactions of it, consideration of suitable ventilation systems and using protective methods is very important. To decrease direct contact with it, the capabilities of technician and improves his health and work place, we investigate relationship between methanol level and exposure to methylmethacrylate.
Materials and Methods: In a case -control (in -vivo) study of 32 dental laboratory technicians in Babol and Sari before and after working and 32 normal subjects, urine samples were collected. Urine methanol levels were analysed by paper and gas chromatography
Results: Mean concentration of methanol in case group (1.2 micro mol/l) was significantly more than control group (0.78 micro mol/l). Also, methanol level was significantly higher after work (1.45 micro moll]) when compared to before work (I.27micro rnol/l), P<0.05. No relation between work history and urine methanol level was observed.
Conclusion: Due to significant increase of methanol concentration during work in work place, the use of protective methods such as suitable ventilation, wearing mask and gloves, also, using vapor absorbing tubes can be useful in increasing dental laboratory workplace salty.

OBJECTIVE: There is not any effective treatment for patients with asthma now. Physicians need drugs with minimal side effects for conservative treatment. This study was done to compare the effects of ipratropium bromide and beclomethasone for conservative treatment of asthma. METHODS: In this clinical trial 60 patients were randomly selected, divided into two groups and were treated during two weeks (group one with ipratropium bromide and group two with beclomethasone). After two weeks, the results were compared with original physical examination and spirometry.
FINDINGS: Despite clinical improvement of asthma after administration of ipratropium bromide in 83% of cases and beclomethasone in 70% of cases, there was not a significant difference. On the basis of PFT, ipratropium bromide in 50% of cases and beclomethasone in 10% of cases caused an improvement in spirometry results (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: According to the results, it seems that ipratropium bromide is more effective than beclomethasone in improvement of pulmonary function. Of course, further investigation is necessary.

This paper presents a development of teaching aid for induction motor starting technique by using Matlab/Simulink. The main objective for this study is to build accurate and reliable simulations model that can be very good teaching aids for undergraduate students to learn the differences between induction motor starting techniques. Each starting techniques which is differ in term of their respective wiring connection has been selected because there are the most applicable and widely used in the industrial area due to its economic reason. This study uses Simulink model to represent the stationary reference qd0 model of a single excited, three phase induction motor and was given an interactive interface which makes it easier for students to learn the induction motor starting techniques. Finally, some major conclusions are obtained and advantages and disadvantages of described techniques are discussed.

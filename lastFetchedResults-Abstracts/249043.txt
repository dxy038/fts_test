Three-dimensional unstructured tetrahedral and hexahedral "nite element mesh optimization is studied
from a theoretical perspective and by computer experiments to determine what objective functions are most
e!ective in attaining valid, high-quality meshes. The approach uses matrices and matrix norms to extend the
work in Part I to build suitable 3D objective functions. Because certain matrix norm identities which hold
for 2]2 matrices do not hold for 3]3 matrices, signi"cant di!erences arise between surface and volume
mesh optimization objective functions. It is shown, for example, that the equality in two dimensions of the
smoothness and condition number of the Jacobian matrix objective functions does not extend to three
dimensions and further, that the equality of the Oddy and condition number of the metric tensor objective
functions in two dimensions also fails to extend to three dimensions. Matrix norm identities are used to
systematically construct dimensionally homogeneous groups of objective functions. The concept of an ideal
minimizing matrix is introduced for both hexahedral and tetrahedral elements. Non-dimensional objective
functions having barriers are emphasized as the most logical choice for mesh optimization. The performance
of a number of objective functions in improving mesh quality was assessed on a suite of realistic test
problems, focusing particularly on all-hexahedral &whisker-weaved' meshes. Performance is investigated on
both structured and unstructured meshes and on both hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes. Although several
objective functions are competitive, the condition number objective function is particularly attractive.
The objective functions are closely related to mesh quality measures. To illustrate, it is shown that the
condition number metric can be viewed as a new tetrahedral element quality measure

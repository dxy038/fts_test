For diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction, measurement of total '1', or T. concentration must be
interpreted with caution. There is considerable variability with age, breed and environmental
temperature as well as a wide range of normal values, The objective of this study "as the
determination and comparison of serum levels otT. and T. of Arab horses in cold and hot
seasons in Ahvaz. Fifty horses were studied and radioimmunoassay method was used to
measure '1', and T., The results showed that the values of mean of T 1 and T. were II R,9i43
ng/dl and O,R6Â±O.07 ug/dl, respectively, The serum level ofT; in cold seasons was
significantly higher than hal seasons (P<O,OS), Also, the level of T. in cold seasons was
higher than hot seasons but there wasn't significant difference between them, Results also
showed that the serum levels of TJ and T. in male were more than female but there wasn't
significant difference between them. It was also revealed the serum level of 1', and T. in

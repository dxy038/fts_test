Occupational biomechanics models deal with the evaluation of physical activities such as lifting of loads. This allows the user to determine the stresses imposed on the musculoskeletal system while holding or moving a load. These models are useful tools in estimating these stresses especially those imposed on the lumbar spine. dynamic biomechanical models, as opposed to static models require the displacement-time information to obtain the kinematics needed to estimate the kinetics of the motion. However, the collection of this displacement data is both tedious and can require expensive equipment.
Simulation models on the other hand can provide an indirect means of performing the biomechanical analyses without having to collect the displacement-time data. A typical simulation model for 2-D lifting activities will be presented. The basis for this is the hypothesis that the body will perform the activity in such a manner so as to minimize the work done. Using this assumption an objective function was developed subject to a set of constraints. These constraints relate to the human movement, the physical workplace layout, and maintenance of balance. Using this model, it was possible to generate the lifting motion patterns, as well as the kinematics and kinetics of motion. The paper discusses the model development, the model output and the kinematics and kinetics of the simulation of the lifting action.

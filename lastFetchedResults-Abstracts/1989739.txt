The objective of the present study was to generate information about the potential health-enhancing properties of selected Thai wild fruits. Nineteen varieties of wild fruits, collected from the natural forest in north-eastern Thailand, were analysed for phytochemicals, anti-oxidant activity, vitamin C and sugar content. The results showed that Diospyros decandra Lour. exhibited the highest content of total phenolic compounds (215 mg GAE/g) and total flavonoid content (187 mg RE/g). Terminalia chebula Retz. had higher anti-oxidant activities than other fruits, as measured by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging (99% inhibition) and ferric reducing/anti-oxidant power assays (63 mmol FeSO4/g). The sum of sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose and galactose) ranged from 33 to 430 mg/g fresh weight, being dominated by glucose (ranging from 7.5 to 244 mg/g) and fructose (ranging from 5.3 to 193 mg/g). The highest content of vitamin C was found in Phyllanthus emblica Linn. (2.2 mg/g). Thai wild fruits, which were investigated in this study, have been shown to be a novel rich source of phytochemicals.

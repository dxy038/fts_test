This paper proposes an edge-directed interpolation algorithm to enhance the quality of natural images which are captured by low-resolution camera installed on car or CCTV. Based on the accurate estimation of edge directional covariance between low-resolution and high-resolution image, local covariance coefficients extracted from the low-resolution image has been adapted for the interpolation to obtain the high-resolution image. DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) kernel function is used in order to reflect the multi-directional edge accurately without increasing of complexity. Simulation result shows that our new interpolation algorithm significantly improves the subjective quality of the interpolated images compared with conventional linear interpolation and NEDI one. It also demonstrates the improvements of objective metrics such as PSNR, SSIM(structural similarity index measurement) and WEA (Wiener filter coefficients Estimation Accuracy) which are used for the accuracy estimation of directionality.

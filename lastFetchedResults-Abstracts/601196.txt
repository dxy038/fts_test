Developing reflective teachers who will be committed to their professional mission and whose own development will represent a value is an important objective of the professional training of future teachers. This article deals with an evaluation of the module of instruction in teacher training that was directed at raising students' awareness of the importance of reflecting on their pedagogical work and their overall professional activity. The module focused on the acquisition of skills for thoughtful activity in pedagogical practice and the development of a positive attitude to lifelong teacher education. The main aim of the study was to assess students' conceptions of instruction, in particular from the perspective of students' perceptions of the importance and influence of learner-centred methods targeting didactical competencies.

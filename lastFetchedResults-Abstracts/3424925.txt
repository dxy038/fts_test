We proposed and experimentally demonstrated the reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA)-based wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network (WDM-PON) scheme where not only up/downlink data services but also broadcasting service could be provided using a single optical source. In the proposed scheme, the digital signal and subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) signal for downstream were simultaneously modulated by a single distributed feedback laser diode and RSOA in optical network unit remodulated downstream source as an upstream. Without performance deterioration of digital signals both in up- and downstream, the proposed WDM-PON scheme can stably offer the SCM signal for broadcasting service. In the experiment, 1-Gb/s digital signals both for up- and downstream and 20-Mb/s SCM signal at 2.2 GHz for broadcasting were demonstrated in 10-km bidirectional link

Despite many studies on cognitive function and its influential factors among old
population, relatively little research has been designed to study the relationship between dietary intake and
cognitive function in elderly. Objective: We conducted a population-based, prospective nested case-control study
to investigate the association between dietary habits and declines in cognitive function over three years among
Chinese illiterate elderly. Design and methods: This study was part of the Chinese Longitudinal health
Longevity Study (CLhLS). Six thousand nine hundred and eleven illiterate residents aged 65 or older were
investigated. Socio-demographic and dietary habits data were collected at baseline. The cognitive function of
illiterate elderly persons was assessed using Chinese revised Mini Mental State examination (MMSe-r) in 2002
and 2005. Cognitive decline was defined as MMSe-r score dropped to less than 18 at follow-up among those
with normal cognitive function (MMSe-râ‰¥18 at baseline). Odds ratios (OR) were calculated via logistic
regression models. Results: Five thousand six hundred and ninety one elderly were included in the current
analysis. In bivariate analysis, cognitive decline was associated with gender, marital status ,financial status,
smoking, drinking alcohol, drinking tea, eating fruits, vegetables, legumes, fishes, meat, egg and sugar.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that always eating vegetable (adjusted OR: 0.66; 95% confidence
intervals, CI: 0.58, 0.75), always consuming legumes (aOR:0.78; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.96) were inversely associated
with cognitive decline. Conclusions: Lower intakes of vegetables and legumes were associated with cognitive
decline among illiterate elderly Chinese. Dietary factors may be important for prevention cognitive decline.

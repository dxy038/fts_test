Study objective
We investigate the efficacy and safety of oral paracetamol compared with oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or combination therapy in relieving pain after blunt limb injury in an emergency department (ED).
Methods
This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled study in an ED of a university hospital in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Three hundred adult patients with painful isolated limb injuries were enrolled. Primary outcome measures were pain relief at rest and with limb movement, adverse events, and patient satisfaction.
Results
There was no statistical difference in the mean reduction in pain score between any of the combinations at any point, although combination therapy was the first to reach a clinically significant reduction in pain score (<13 mm), and diclofenac-paracetamol combinations consistently produced a greater reduction in mean pain score than either nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or paracetamol alone. All combinations appeared to be safe, although more patients receiving diclofenac-paracetamol combination complained of abdominal pain. The median patient satisfaction scores were poor.
Conclusion
In the doses, frequencies, and routes of administration used for this study, any analgesic benefit of oral paracetamolâ€“nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug combinations over single nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or paracetamol treatment is small and of doubtful clinical significance. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, paracetamol, and diclofenac-paracetamol combinations appeared equally safe in the management of musculoskeletal pain.

In order to solve the problem of voltage stability existed in wind farms interconnected to power system, a computing method taking the statistical law of wind output power into account is proposed to determine the reactive power compensation capacity that is interconnected to power system. Based on the statistical law of wind power and considering the characteristics of reactive power and active power of doubly-fed induction generation (DFIG), the modelÂ´s objective functions are to maximize the utilization rate of wind energy and minimize the cost of reactive compensation infrastructure. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to calculate the multi-objective functions of reactive power compensation capacity. By analyzing the case, the method to determine reactive power compensation capacity is effective to improve voltage level and maintain the maximum utilization of wind energy. Therefore, the method is proved to be effective.

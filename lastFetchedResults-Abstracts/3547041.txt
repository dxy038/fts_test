A resonant slot array with a bidirectional radiation pattern and an impedance bandwidth of more that 15% has been realized by measuring the admittance of a couple of longitudinal shunt slots on the opposite walls of the waveguide, and then optimizing the reflection coefficient of the equivalent network of the array in the desired frequency range.

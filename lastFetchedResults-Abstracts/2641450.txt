Health system is responsible for providing the fair services and choice right to the public. Hence, this study aims to explore the current position of freedom and equity in providing the healthcare services.
Methods: This qualitative study was conducted through literature and national documents review and face to face interview with key experts of the health system. All interviews are recorded and transcribed. MAX QDA10 was applied for organizing the concepts. Framework analysis was used for analyzing the concepts.
Results: Findings were categorized in two main themes of freedom of choice (with 3 categories including freedom of choice for treatment services, freedom of choice for preventive and hygienic services and freedom of choice for choosing the insurer) and equity(with 2 categories including equity in financial access and equity in physical access). Equity in physical access includes two sub categories: equity in access to preventive and hygiene services and equity in access to specialty and subspecialty services.
Conclusion: The freedom of choice and equity are considered in different ways in the health system however, there is a significant gap with the ideal position.

Supplementation of yeast culture to equine diets has improved digestion of nutrients in some studies but not others. Improving the digestibility of lower-quality forages could be advantageous both for the producer and for the horse's health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of yeast culture on digestibility of high- and low-quality forage in mature horses. Sixteen geldings (483.6 ± 25.5 kg and 6.8 ± 3.2 years), of Quarter Horse (n = 14) and Thoroughbred (n = 2) breeding, were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28-day treatment periods. Russell Bermuda grass hay of either high (13.1% crude protein (CP), 73.1% neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 35.3% acid detergent fiber (ADF), and 6.0% ash) or low (8.1% CP, 75.3% NDF, 37.6% ADF, and 4.3% ash) quality was offered at 1.35% of body weight (BW, dry matter [DM] basis). Diets consisted of high-quality forage with the addition of yeast culture (HY), high-quality forage without yeast culture (HC), low-quality forage with the addition of yeast culture (LY), and low-quality forage without yeast culture (LC). All horses were fed a commercial grain mix (12.6% CP, 25.4% NDF, 12.1% ADF, and 4.0% ash) offered at 0.45% of BW (DM basis) daily. Yeast culture was added to the grain mix during the morning feeding at a rate of 56 g per horse. Body weight was measured weekly and feed intake was adjusted accordingly. Fecal samples were obtained every 6 hours on the last 3 days of each treatment period. Horses receiving low-quality hay (LY and LC) had greater (P < .01) intake expressed as a percentage of BW compared with horses receiving high-quality hay (HY and HC). No influence of yeast culture supplementation was seen on intake of grain or forage (P < .23 and P < .62, respectively). Digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM), CP, and NDF were greater (P < .01, P < .01, P < .01, and P < .01, respectively) for the diets with high-quality forage compared with the diets with low-quality forage. Dry matter, CP, and NDF digestibilities were greater (P < .09, P < .03, and P < .05, respectively) for horses receiving LY compared with LC. Supplementation of yeast culture to mature horses improved digestibility of lower-quality Bermuda grass hay.

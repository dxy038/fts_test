The traditional Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm is usually based on the image intensity, so the segmentation results are unsatisfactory when the images are impacted by noise. Considering this shortcoming, in this paper the FCM objective function is improved by adding two kinds of spatial information: the relative position information and the intensity information of the neighborhood. Moreover, Quantum Immune Clone algorithm (QICA) is used to optimize the spatial impact factors in the objective function. The proposed algorithm has been tested in synthetic and real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is feasible and effective, and it can lead to higher accuracy.

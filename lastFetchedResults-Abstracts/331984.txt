Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the human pulp response to Scotchbond Multi Purpose Plus (SMPP) bonding agent in non-exposed Class V cavities.

Methods: SMPP was placed in 24 of 40 cavites according to manufacturer's instructions and the cavities were restored with amalgam. The remaining 16 cavities were capped with a calcium hydroxide formulation (Dycal) sealed with zinc-oxide eugenol, and restored with the amalgam. After extraction at 10 and 35 days, the teeth were fixed, sectioned and stained for light microscopy.

Results: All Dycal-capped teeth, at both 10 and 35 days, exhibited no pulp inflammation and no demonstrable bacteria. Six cases sealed with SMPP at 10 days showed no pulp inflammation or stained bacterial profiles. The remaining six teeth demonstrated mild to moderate inflammatory pulpal responses and five out of these six cases exhibited stained bacterial profiles. Nine out of 12 teeth showed no inflammatory pulp responses at 35 days, the remaining three cases exhibited mild to moderate pulp inflammation without stained bacteria.

Conclusions: None of the teeth sealed with SMPP presented severe inflammatory pulpal reactions histologically. SMPP did not exhibit significant deleterious effects on the human pulp tissue during the test periods.

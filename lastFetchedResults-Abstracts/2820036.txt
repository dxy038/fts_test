Blind adaptation with appropriate objective function results in enhancement of signal of interest. Skewness is chosen as a measure of impulsiveness for blind adaptation to enhance impacting sources arising from defective rolling bearings. Such impacting sources can be modelled with harmonically related sinusoids which leads to discovery of harmonic content with unknown fundamental frequency by skewness maximization. Interfering components that do not possess harmonic relation are simultaneously suppressed with proposed method. An experimental example on rolling bearing fault detection is given to illustrate the ability of skewness maximization in uncovering harmonic content.

This paper describes a simple and effective quadratic placement algorithm called RQL. We show that a good quadratic placement, followed by local wirelength-driven spreading can produce excellent results on large-scale industrial ASIC designs. As opposed to the current top performing academic placers [4,7,11], RQL does not embed a linearization technique within the solver. Instead, it only requires a simpler, pure quadratic objective function in the spirit of [8,10,23]. Experimental results show that RQL outperforms all available academic placers on the ISPD-2005 placement contest benchmarks. In particular, RQL obtains an average wire- length improvement of 2.8%, 3.2%, 5.4%, 8.5%, and 14.6% versus mPL6 [5], NTUPlaceS [7], Kraflwerk [20], APlace2.0 [11], and Capo10.2 [18], respectively. In addition, RQL is three, seven, and ten times faster than mpL6, Capo10.2, and APlace2.0, respectively. On the ISPD-2006 placement contest benchmarks, on average, RQL obtains the best scaled wirelength among all available academic placers.

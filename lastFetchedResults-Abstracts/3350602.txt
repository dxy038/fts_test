More than a decade, Optical flow is relevant in many areas such as video coding and compression, robot vision, object tracking and segmentation, and super resolution reconstruction. By the result of the motion vector from optical flow, reduction the error stands a problem especially under noisy condition. Many models have been proposed to reduce the error and bilateral is one of the popular models. This paper introduces the model of bilateral filter in combination with bidirectional confidential over simple local based optical flow where the quality of the restored images from the returned motion vector is focal point. Several noise levels over several official sequences are observed for the noise tolerance analysis where PSNR is used as an indicator.

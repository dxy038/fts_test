Effective data management and resource management are vital to the success of emerging mobile data applications. This paper investigates the problem of bandwidth allocation for data dissemination in a multicell environment, which has received little attention in the literature. The performance objective is to minimize the overall expected access latency. An optimal allocation technique is obtained to effectively allocate bandwidth among a cell cluster. We also extend the allocation technique to the case in which there is a constraint on the bandwidth allocation granularity. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes substantially outperform the uniform allocation and proportional allocation schemes

Reliability, power consumption and timing performance are key considerations for the utilisation of field-programmable gate arrays. Online measurement techniques can determine the timing characteristics of an FPGA application while it is operating, and facilitate a range of benefits. Degradation can be monitored by tracking changes in timing performance, while power consumption can be reduced through dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) of the power supply to exploit any spare timing headroom. If higher performance is the objective, dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) can be used to maximise operating frequency. In both cases, online timing measurement of the application circuit is used to exploit favourable operating conditions. This work demonstrates a method of online measurement, achieved by sweeping the phase of a secondary clock signal, driving additional shadowing registers strategically added to the application design. The measurement technique and initial voltage and frequency scaling experiments are demonstrated on an Alter a Cyclone III FPGA. Timing performance can be measured with a best case resolution of 96ps. The additional circuitry results in minimal overhead in terms of area and performance. Power savings of 23% dynamic and 13% static in an example circuit are achieved through DVS, or performance improvements of 21% through DFS, when compared with operating at nominal core voltage, or timing model FMax.

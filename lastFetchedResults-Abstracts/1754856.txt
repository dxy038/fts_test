Objective
m of the present study was (1) to evaluate the extent and nature of sleep disorder-related symptoms in the older primary care patient population and (2) to differentiate a pattern of self-reported symptoms that identify patients who should be referred to the sleep clinic for further evaluation.

ndred ninety-six older adults recruited from family practice centers were administered a brief symptom survey measure. All were invited to participate in an extensive self-report evaluation, consultation with a sleep medicine specialist, and an overnight polysomnographic study.
s
tantial number of older primary care patients report symptoms related directly or indirectly to physiological sleep disorder. Over 30% of total reported some insomnia, 40% daytime sleepiness, and 10% apnea. Those participants who agreed to pursue further aspects of the study protocol endorsed a higher number and greater severity of primary sleep disorder symptoms than those who declined to continue beyond the first phases. Participants who chose to pursue polysomnography (13% of total) had a very high rate (88.5) of diagnosed sleep disorder.
sion
tudy suggests that an older patient, male or female, who both endorses medically unexplained daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or other sleep disorder related symptoms and agrees to further evaluation, including overnight polysomnography, is at substantial risk for physiologically based sleep disorder. In the future, a brief, validated measure, such as the Sleep Symptom Checklist used in this study, would be an important part of the diagnostic process.

We propose a scalable multiresolution coding scheme for HDTV using hybrid motion compensated subband and transform coding. The scheme exploits advantages of discrete wavelet transforms, hierarchical multiresolution motion compensation, and transform coding. Three resolutions for applications of HDTV, conventional TV, and videophone, are aimed. Optimal bit allocation is performed for each resolution, where the constrained bitrate is required. An MPEG-like coding method with the DCT or lapped orthorgonal transform (LOT) is applied to the lowest subband. A motion-compensated PCM scheme and an efficient but low complexity VWL coding are applied to the medium and full resolutions. The performance of DCT and LOT in these applications is compared. Simulation results show that very good subjective and objective quality can be achieved for all the three resolutions

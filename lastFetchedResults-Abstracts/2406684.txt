In this paper a mesh-free model of the functionally graded material (FGM) plate is presented.  The piezoelectric material as a sensor and actuator has been distributed on the top and bottom of the plate, respectively. The formulation of the problem is based on the classical laminated plate theory (CLPT) and the principle of virtual displacements. Moreover, the Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for the vibration control of the (FGM) plate. In this study a function of the sliding surface is considered as an objective function and then the control effort is produced by the particle swarm method and sliding mode control strategy. To verify the accuracy and stability of the proposed control system, a traditional sliding mode control system is designed to suppressing the vibration of the FGM plate. Besides, a genetic algorithm sliding mode (GASM) control system is also implemented to suppress the vibration of the FGM plate. The performance of the proposed PSO sliding mode than the GASM and traditional sliding mode control system are demonstrated by some simulations.

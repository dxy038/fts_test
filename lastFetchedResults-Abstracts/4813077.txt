In this paper, a control scheme is designed to obtain satisfactory optimum power from the double output induction generator (DOIG). The proposed controller is used to optimize a nonlinear objective function with different effective equality constraints. Minimum power losses and consequently maximum generated power can be obtained by controlling the inverter firing angle. The constraints are selected according to the optimal restrictions in order to ensure the duplication of the generated power when the speed varies from synchronous to double of the synchronous speed. The desired cost function in the nonlinear form is realized corresponding to the selected equality constraints when all the system optimal and stable requirements are taken into consideration. The optimal regulator theory is used and the Hassian matrix technique is selected in this study to facilitate the calculation of the optimal operation conditions

In this paper, we present a new approach for the enhancement of the bone proliferation rate by electrostimulation in the acetabular region. Based on the complex tissue structure in this area, the electric field distributions were computed by numerical means using a model based on high-resolution computed tomography scans of the acetabular area. This results in a complex, nonlinear, and discrete optimization problem. Therefore, an adapted algorithm was developed to reduce the computational effort in the order of several magnitudes. We divided the procedure into two stages: data extraction and a subsequent optimization process. The used optimization algorithm utilizes an evolutionary concept and a multidimensional definition of optimality for different, partly contradictive objective functions. Finally, we present first optimization results for different stimulation situations.

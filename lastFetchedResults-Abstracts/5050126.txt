System-on-a-chip (SoC) is the paramount challenge of the electronic industry for the next millennium. The semiconductor industry has delivered what we were expecting and what was predicted: silicon availability for over 10 million gates. The VSIA (Virtual Socket Initiative Alliance) has defined industry standards and data formats for SoC. The reuse methodology manual, first ´how-to-do´ book to create reusable IPs (intellectual properties) for SoC designs has been published. EDA tool providers understand the issues and are proposing new tools and solutions on a quarterly basis. The last stage needs to be run: consolidate the experience and know-how of VSIA and IP OpenMORE rating system into an industry adopted VC (virtual component) quality metrics, and then pursue to tackle the next challenges: formal system specifications and VC transfer infrastructure. The objective of this paper is to set the stage for the final step towards a VC quality metrics effort that the industry needs to adopt, and define the next achievable goals.

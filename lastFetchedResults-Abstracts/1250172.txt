Topological groundwater hydrodynamics is an emerging subdiscipline in the mechanics of fluids in porous media whose objective is to investigate the invariant geometric properties of subsurface flow and transport processes. In this paper, the topological characteristics of groundwater flows governed by the Darcy law are studied. It is demonstrated that: (i) the topological constraint of zero helicity density during flow is equivalent to the Darcy law; (ii) both steady and unsteady groundwater flows through aquifers whose hydraulic conductivity is an arbitrary scalar function of position and time are confined to surfaces on which the streamlines of the flow are geodesic curves; (iii) the surfaces to which the flows are confined either are flat or are tori; and (iv) chaotic streamlines are not possible for these flows, implying that they are inherently poorly mixing in advective solute transport.

Earlier detection of breast cancer is very important. The objective of this study is to develop an inexpensive portable device for simply detecting the existence of breast cancer using microwave. In this paper, we investigated the feasibility of the proposed method for such device by actual measurement, and analyzed the possible detection rate dependent on the tumor size by numerical simulation. Measurement results show that the proposed method is quite feasible, and the simulation results reveal that the detection rate of such device could be more than 60 % for tumor of 5 mm size. The proposed device can be used for self-diagnosis of breast cancer. Next step of our study will be the realization of a proto-type system.

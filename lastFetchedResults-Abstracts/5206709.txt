With the development of ChinaÂ´s economy, the banking industry has more and more important role to play and people have more requirements. But there are lots of problems among supply and demand. We used a questionaire to analyze them and then try to innovate banking service from the management angle. We predict that banking service patterns should be changed in the near future with the development of economy, education and income. Our innovtions starts from service patterns which are at different levels, and guide customers from lower levels to higher ones. A new discipline, service science management and engineering (SSME), views service as a systemic science and we illustrate service innovation using an SSME framework. We also talk about some challenges and strategy in service innovation. The objective of this research is to study the supply and demand, and to illustrate how to realize SSME.

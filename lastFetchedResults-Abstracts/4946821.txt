Reconstruction of wideband speech from its narrowband version is an attractive issue, since it can enhance the speech quality without modifying the existing communication networks. This paper proposes a new recovery method of wideband speech from narrowband speech. In the proposed method, the narrowband spectral envelope of input speech is transformed to a wideband spectral envelope based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), whose parameters are calculated by a joint density estimation technique. Then the lowband and highband speech signal is reconstructed by the LPC synthesizer using the reconstructed spectral envelope. This paper also proposes a codeword-dependent power estimation method. Both the objective and subjective test results shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional codebook mapping method

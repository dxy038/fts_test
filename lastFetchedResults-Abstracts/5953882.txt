Adjustable speed drives (ASDs) under short-term power interruptions (STPIs) can interrupt a critical process. In this paper an approach to provide ride-through with flyback converter modules (FBCMs) powered by super capacitors is explored. The proposed approach is modular and facilitates additional modules to be added to suit higher voltage/power ratings. Both unidirectional and bidirectional flyback DC/DC converter topologies are examined. Simulation and experimental results are presented

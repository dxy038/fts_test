Background and objective: In magnetic ?uid hyperthermia therapy, controlling temperature elevation and optimizing heat generation is an immense challenge
in practice. The resultant heating confguration by magnetic ?uid in the tumor is closely related to the dispersion of particles, frequency and intensity of magnetic feld, and
biological tissue properties.
Methods: In this study, to solve heat transfer equation, we used COMSOL Multiphysics and to verify the model, an experimental setup has been used. To show the
accuracy of the model, simulations have been compared with experimental results.
In the second part, by using experimental results of nanoparticles distribution inside
Agarose gel according to various gel concentration, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4%, as well as
the injection velocity, 4 µL/min, 10 µL/min, 20 µL/min, and 40 µL/min, for 0.3 cc magnetite ?uid, power dissipation inside gel has been calculated and used for temperature
prediction inside of the gel.
Results: The Outcomes demonstrated that by increasing the ?ow rate injection at
determined concentrations, mean temperature drops. In addition, 2% concentration has
a higher mean temperature than semi spherical nanoparticles distribution.
Conclusion: The results may have implications for treatment of the tumor and any
kind of cancer diseases.

Objective(s):Several studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of various nanoparticles exposed to radiofrequency (RF) waves on cancerous tissues. In this study, a colon carcinoma tumor model was irradiated by RF in the presence of gold-gold sulfide (GGS) nanoshells.
Materials and Methods: Synthesis and characterization of GGS nanoshells were initially performed. CT26 cells were subcutaneously injected into the flank of BALB/c mice to create the colon carcinoma tumor models. Then the tumors were subjected to different treatments. Treatment factors included intratumoral injection of GGS and RF radiation. Different groups were considered as control with no treatment, receiving GGS, RF irradiated and simultaneous administration of GGS and RF. Efficacy of the treatments was evaluated by daily monitoring of tumor volume and recording the relative changes in it, the time needed for a 5-fold increase in the volume of tumor (T5) and utilizing pathologic studies to determine the lost volume of the tumors.
Results: In comparison with control group, tumor growth was not markedly inhibited in the groups receiving only GGS or RF, while in the group receiving GGS and RF, tumor growth was effectively inhibited compared with the other groups. In addition, the lost volume of the tumor and T5 was markedly higher in groups receiving GGS and RF compared with other groups.
Conclusion: This study showed that RF radiation can markedly reduce the tumor growth in presence of GGS. Hence, it can be predicted that GGS nanoshells convert sub-lethal effects of noninvasive RF fields into lethal damages

Man has constantly tried to discover the secret of nature and sought to simulate it. In this regard, the invention of airplane, application of artificial neural networks and now using the behavior of ants for optimization in problem solving can be mentioned. In optimization, the major aim is to achieve a certain order of variables for optimality of the objective function. Ant algorithm is one of the nonparametric methods based on the swarm artificial intelligence which has been recently applied very much in nonfinancial and financial sciences. In various applications of ant algorithm, variables and the objective function are different that it will be discussed in more detail. In this paper the characteristics of natural ants, ant algorithm and its financial applications are discussed in short.

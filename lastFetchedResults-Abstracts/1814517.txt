Objective: Patients with metabolic syndrome are prone to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Regarding the importance of nutritional factors in management of metabolic syndrome, this study was designed to evaluate the effects of dark chocolate consumption on serum lipid profile in patients with metabolic syndrome.
Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 114 patients with metabolic syndrome, aged 30 to 60 years, without heart, renal and hepatic diseases were recruited. The eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive either dark chocolate (76% purity), 20 or 40 grams daily for two months. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides (TG) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were measured with enzymatic methods before and after intervention. A low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level was calculated by the Friedewald formula. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 and ANOVA test P < 0.05 was considered significant. Dietary intake was measured with NUT4 software at the beginning and the end of the study.
Results: There were no significant changes in dietary intakes of patients during the intervention in three groups. No significant differences were seen in mean concentration of lipid profile before and after intervention in groups (P > 0.05). 
Conclusion: Consumption of 20-40g/day dark chocolate with 76% purity for 2 months doesn't change the lipid profile of patients with metabolic syndrome.

Tin oxide is the most commonly used transparent conducting oxide for CdTe solar cells. Its properties are critical to solar cell performance, in particular when CdS films of small thicknesses are utilized. Using thin CdS films to enhance the photocurrent of CdTe solar cells typically leads to lower V<sub>oc</sub>s and fill factors. This is believed to be due to the presence of pinholes in CdS which lead to the direct contact of the CdTe layer with SnO<sub>2</sub>. The main objective of this work is to study the effect of the roughness/grain size of the SnO<sub>2</sub> films on the performance of CdTe solar cells. It has been found that as the roughness/grain size of the SnO<sub>2</sub> increases, the performance of CdTe cells fabricated using thin CdS films improves

Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is complex, especially in HIV positive patients. Ultrasound can aid diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), but experienced sonographers are often not available in endemic settings. We describe a novel tool to aid diagnosis of EPTB using telemedicine and a previously described standardized protocol for fast assessment with sonography of HIV/TB patients (FASH).

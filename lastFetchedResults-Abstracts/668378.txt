Given to increasing complexities and environmental changes in contemporary competitive world, style of management within organizations has gone through significant changes, and in this framework, has experienced three periods: (1) management by instructions (MBI); (2) management by objective (MBO); and (3) management by value (MBV). Moreover, another development happened in modern management concerns with relation between organization and environment (according to strategic management) which has increasing received scholars attention. According to this approach, key question is that “in state of turbulence and environmental predictable and unpredictable transformations, how organizations must survive and expand their activities?”
	This paper seeks to study the evolution of management and the quality of change in style of management towards MBV and to explain values’ philosophical foundations as well as their relevant intellectual schools, and in doing so, focuses on strategic and in-between values. Therefore, a mixed research method is used and qualitative as well as quantitative findings simultaneously are analyzed. This paper’s innovation is that it seeks to introduce a conceptual model for studying organizations (a case study on a big financial organization) as a model of management based on underlying values which involves issues such as structure, strategy, culture and style of management.

We have developed a laser-aligned measuring device to facilitate the measurement of linear hand dimensions. Our objective has been to make a simple, clinically applicable device for anthropometry of the hands in patients with arthritis in order to guage the progression of hand deformities. The system provides an alternative to the use of rules, tapes, photogrammetry and least-squares devices which have previously been applied to hand measurements. The system delivers results which are not significantly different from those measured with rules and callipers and has a similar level of accuracy. The use of laser pointers for alignment facilitates measurements which necessitate picking the highest point of the hand. The device is portable and simple to use in the clinic. We have used it to measure hand dimensions in normal subjects and patients with arthritis. However, the system could equally well be used to facilitate measurement of other objects with an irregular surface profile

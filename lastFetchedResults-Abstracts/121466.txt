BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cancer is a major medical problem and one of the most causes of death. Considering the young population of Iran and the high rate of malignancies, cancer registry is necessary in order to plan strategies to control and detection of cancer.
METHODS: This study was done on all pathological reports in Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals in Babol during 1990 to 2002. Sex, age and affected organs were determined and the repeated cases were excluded. Then they were categorized in two age groups 15-50 years and over 50 years. Data were analyzed by SPSS and using t-test and p<0.05 was considered significant.
FINDINGS: After removing pediatric cancers, there were 3746 cases. The mean age for all cancer cases was 57.43 ± 8.99 year, for men was 60.12 ± 8.89 and for women was 53.42 ± 9.13 year. Females were more than males in first group and vice- versa in second group that were statistically significant. In both sexes, the most frequency was in 7th decade. There were 2245 cases in males with the three most common cancers being: stomach (23.69%), esophagus (9.75%) and skin (9.3%) and 1501 cases observed in females with the three most common cancers being: esophagus (12.99%), breast (12.45%) and stomach (12.25%).
CONCLUSION: Since gastric cancer in males and esophageal cancer in females were the most frequent malignancies in this study and it seems that there is a relationship between these cancers and dietary, environmental and infective agents, further epidemiological research is needed to establish screening programs, early detection and better treatment.

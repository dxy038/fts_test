Fluid shear stress and mechanical wall stress may play a role in the formation of early atherosclerotic lesions, but these quantities are difficult to measure in vivo. Our objective was to quantify these parameters in normal subjects in a clinical setting, and to define regions of low wall shear stress and high mechanical stress. The right carotid bifurcations of five healthy male volunteers were investigated using a novel non-invasive technique which integrates magnetic resonance angiography, ultrasonography, tonometry and state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics and solid mechanics models. Significant inter-subject variations in patterns as well as magnitude of wall shear stress and mechanical stress were found. In spite of individual variabilities, this study revealed that some regions of the artery wall are exposed simultaneously to low wall shear stress and high mechanical stress and that these regions correspond to areas where atherosclerotic plaque develops. The coexistence of regions of low wall shear stress and high tensile stress may be an important determinant of the formation of atheroma in human arteries.

This paper presents the results of a qualitative research whose objective was to broaden the understanding on the participation of youngsters and adolescents on Internet-based social networks. Data collection was conducted from participants of the Cidadao.NET (Citizen.NET), which is a digital inclusion project that covers the north and northeast regions of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The results indicate the start of new forms of socialization and differentiated cohabitation, in which simultaneous long-distance communication plays, in the construction of social relations, the same role as face-to-face interaction and dialogue, reinforcing pre-existing strong ties and opening possibilities for the establishment of weak ties, which may or may not become stronger. It was possible to identify a preferential use for entertainment activities and, secondarily, for the accomplishment of school-related tasks.

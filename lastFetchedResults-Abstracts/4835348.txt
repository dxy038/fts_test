Electrical design is usually made with the concepts based on electric circuit theory. Nowadays it needs to consider the electromagnetic (EM) field generated in devices, components, and equipment to achieve their expected performances and satisfy the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulations as well. In such kind of design, EM-fiel simulators are often used to estimate EM-fieIl effects to circuit performances. In this paper, the application of a multi-objective satisfactory design method to electrical design is discussed. The method, named preference set-based design (PSD), is developed as a concurrent design method in a fiel of mechanical engineerings. The PSD method is a sort of synthesis technique to optimize multi purposes concurrently. As a firs model to electric and electronics fields the method is applied to filte designs and its usefulness is discussed. Applied filter are an ordinary f ve-order low-pass filte and an electromagnetic interference (EMI) filte composed of plural element parameters and objectives or performances of attenuation characteristics. In practical cases, some unclear parameters should be taken into account, for example a terminal load in some range, and a coupling coefficien in a common-mode chock for EMI filte. Such an uncertainty problem is treated in this study. By using the resultant parameter sets, the attenuation characteristics are analyzed and confirme whether the performances are satisfie with the required performances.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Listeria spp. in milk and dairy products in Isfahan province, Iran. From March 2007 to September 2009, a total of 594 samples of various milk and dairy products were obtained from randomly selected retail stores. Using conventional bacteriologic method, 55 samples (9.3%) were positive for Listeria spp. The highest prevalence of Listeria was found in raw sheep milk samples (22.6%), followed by cheese samples (18.9%). The most species recovered was Listeria innocua (58.2%); the remaining isolates were Listeria monocytogenes (32.7%) and Listeria seeligari (9.1%). Overall, 54 Listeria isolates (98.2%) were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. Resistance to nalidixic acid was the most common finding (96.4%). All Listeria isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. The results of this study indicate the potential risk of infection with Listeria in people consuming raw and unpasteurized milk and dairy products.

Web based training systems offer enhanced functionality for co-operative learning. Nevertheless, these system approaches are mostly dedicated to distributed information presentation, exploring the potentials of current Internet/WWW technologies (e.g. Java, HTML, VRML). This article describes a research project at the Computer Graphics Center (ZGDV) in collaboration with small and medium enterprises in the maritime application area with the objective to enhance the interaction and demonstration quality of training by integrating a distributed simulation environment into the training scenario. This training scenario is based on HLA/RTI while clients are developed using Visual C++ as well as the Java development kit

A multiobjective programming algorithm may find multiple nondominated solutions. If these solutions are scattered more uniformly over the Pareto frontier in the objective space, they are more different choices and so their quality is better. In this paper, we propose a quality measure called U-measure to measure the uniformity of a given set of nondominated solutions over the Pareto frontier. This frontier is a nonlinear hyper-surface. We measure the uniformity over this hyper-surface in three main steps: 1) determine the domains of the Pareto frontier over which uniformity is measured, 2) determine the nearest neighbors of each solution in the objective space, and 3) compute the discrepancy among the distances between nearest neighbors. The U-measure is equal to this discrepancy where a smaller discrepancy indicates a better uniformity. We can apply the U-measure to complement the other quality measures so that we can evaluate and compare multiobjective programming algorithms from different perspectives.

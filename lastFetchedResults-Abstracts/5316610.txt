This paper reports the development and implementation of a model-based cross-directional controller for plastic film extrusion and other web-forming processes. The controller design has a similar structure to that of internal model control (IMC) with the addition of an observer whose gain is designed to minimise process and model mis-match. The observer gain is obtained by solving a multi-objective optimisation through the application of a genetic algorithm and simulation results are presented in this paper demonstrating improvements that can be achieved by the proposed controller over two existing CD controllers.

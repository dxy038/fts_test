Video streaming over IP is severely affected by packet losses. The effect of transmission errors in immersive media may be worse compared to conventional video applications. Therefore, effective error concealment algorithms are required at the decoder to improve the end user media experience in case of packet losses. This paper proposes a novel frame concealment algorithm for depth maps associated with ´colour plus depth´ based stereoscopic video. The proposed method exploits the motion correlation of colour and depth map image sequences. The missing depth frames are concealed using the motion information of the correctly received colour video frame. The proposed method is implemented on a backward compatible, scalable video coding architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively restore the lost depth frames giving both good objective and subjective quality.

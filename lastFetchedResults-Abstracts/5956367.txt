Experimental results showed that heavy metal ions had little effect on accumulated capacity of filament-like membrane for dieldrin due to the weak bond with cellulose acetate and little interaction with triolein. Accumulated capacity increased with the increase of contents of organic matters in water. It is the main reason that organic matters can be adsorbed on the surface of filament-like membrane because of the large quantity of active groups on organic matters. Microbe could intake dieldrin and other organic matters as diet, but subsequent inhibition of dieldrin on microbe leads the decrease of microbe contents, and further deadsorption of dieldrin from the filament-like membrane.

The American Food and Drug Administration approval of parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration for osteoporosis as well as the possibility for its future therapeutic applications requires an examination of the suggested association between PTH and cancer, particularly osteosarcomas.
The objective was to evaluate such a connection by collecting observational data from two groups of patients, designated as “studies by nature”.
Cohort 1: Medical records of all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism that were treated in a referral center during a 12-year period were retrospectively reviewed for malignancy before, at the time or after diagnosis.
Cohort 2: Records of patients with osteosarcomas that were treated in referral centers during 15 years were retrospectively reviewed for hyperparathyroidism, as indicated by history or laboratory results.
There were 582 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. While 56 (9.6%) had malignancy, 47 (8%) developed cancer after diagnosis with hyperparathyroidism during 6.1 years of documentation. This rate did not exceed the incidence of developing cancer among the general population. Although thyroid cancer was about 4 times the incidence in the general population, this may be attributed to a high level of detection while work-up, treating and following the parathyroid disease. None had osteosarcoma.
None of the 126 patients with osteosarcoma had documentation of primary hyperparathyroidism or had biochemical evidence of hyperparathyroidism.
No obvious association was found between primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Similarly, there was no demonstrable relationship between osteosarcomas and hyperthyroidism biochemical stigmata. Since PTH may contribute to tumor invasiveness, screening for existing neoplasms, especially prostate and breast, before PTH treatment may be of importance.

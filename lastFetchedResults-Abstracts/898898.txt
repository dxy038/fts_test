ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pre-eclampsia is one of the most important complications in pregnancy. Early detection of pre-eclampsia in prenatal care is important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of increased levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit in first and second trimesters of pregnancy in predicting pre-eclampsia.
METHODS: This case-control study was conducted on 140 pregnant women referred for delivery to Ayatollah Roohani hospital of Babol, Iran. Women with no signs of chronic hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, smoking and using drugs that affect blood parameters were chosen. Data about pregnant hospitalized women, 70 ones diagnosed with pre-eclampsia (case group) and 70 ones from healthy pregnant women (control group) was filled in special forms and compared. 
FINDINGS: The mean age of patients was 27.21±5.7. The mean and standard deviation of hemoglobin in first trimester in case and control groups was 12.82±1.10 and 12.30±1.39, respectively (p=0.016). The mean and standard deviation of hemoglobin in second trimester in case and control groups was 11.90±1.39 and 11.46±1.37 respectively (p=0.011). 
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the level of hemoglobin and hematocrit in first and second trimesters of pregnancy is associated with preeclampsia.

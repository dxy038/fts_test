Objective: Measure the transmission imaging spectra of Folium Uncariae. Provide a new effective method for studying medicinal plants. Method : Determine five kinds of 10 populations in different parts of Folium Uncariae by spectral imaging device with electric controlled liquid crystal filter. The spectral resolution is 0.5nm. Spectral range is from 400nm to 720nm. Cluster its transmission imaging spectra fingerprint in cosine distance. Result: The results of the transmission imaging spectra of Folium Uncariae match the systematic botany appraisal result. Conclusion : Spectral imaging analysis techniques can be used to construct fingerprints of traditional Chinese medicine, quality evaluation and study of plant phylogenetic relationships, etc., the operation method is simple, rapid, non-destructive.

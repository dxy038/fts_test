A spinning wheel powder feeding system has been developed as a conveying mechanism to feed fine particle aggregates on a laboratory scale. An example of a use of this conveying mechanism is with a transport tube reactor, since the reactor only provides a few seconds residence time to react the powder. Methods to shear the powder mechanically, as opposed to using a high gas velocity, are developed as to not reduce the available residence time in the reactor. The objective is to feed a powder at the smallest particle aggregate size possible rather than a large particle aggregate size generated by an upstream feeding device, and to achieve such dispersion using minimized gas flow. Statistical results show that the spinning wheel alone is able to reduce the mean aggregate size of the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and when a minimal amount of gas is added to the system the PSD is reduced further. In addition, a fundamental model employing a discrete particle aggregate breakage equation combined with a Monte Carlo method has shown that the spinning wheel feeding system is able to consistently reduce particle aggregate size.

This paper demonstrates plasma bullets generated by microsecond pulses in He flow propagation inside of conductive agarose gel tubes mimicking tissue. The objective of this paper is to understand the possibility of internal diseasesÂ´ treatment (e.g., lung or intestinal cancer) using plasma jets. The propagation dynamics is studied using fast imaging technique, and production of reactive species is demonstrated both in gas phase (using optical emission spectroscopy) and inside of the agarose gel (using fluorescent dye). In addition, it is demonstrated that plasma bullets may propagate not only in a straight tubes, but also in L-shaped tubes, as well as be split in T-shaped tubes. All these facts offer an indication of possible successful application of plasma bullets for treatment of internal diseases, for example, lung cancers or intestinal diseases.

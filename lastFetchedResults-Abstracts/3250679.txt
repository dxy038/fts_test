Optimal design of the decoupled sliding mode control (SMC) is a great and worthwhile challenge by regarding appropriate design parameters and objective function. In the present study, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed as an effectual smart evolutionary algorithm to design optimally the control coefficients of an Inverted Pendulum (IP) and to eliminate tedious and repetitive trial-and-error process. When decoupled SMC is used to address the problem, there has to be a trade-off between the error of the position and the error of the angle. Hence, a Multi-objective Genetic algorithm is used to design optimally the Pareto front of the problem by regarding the errors as objective functions. Moreover, simulation has been done by considering the case with external disturbance and without external disturbance. Then, the results implemented in the MATLAB software environment are contrasted with the experimental results. Numerical results and comparison analysis elucidates the superiority of the optimal robust proposed controller over the traditional decoupled sliding mode controller in terms of attenuating the chattering and actuator variations.

This document describes the software project scheduling problem as a combinatorial optimization problem trough the Project Scheduling Problem (PSP). The authors represent the problem as a single-objective problem, which is solved through a group of metaheuristics, including an hybrid strategy that allows to schedule software projects, by minimizing either cost or duration. The metaheuristics implemented were validated with 18 instances of software projects with different number of developers, tasks and skills.

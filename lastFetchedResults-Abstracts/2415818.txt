Objective(s): This study aims to investigate joint association between cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) polymorphisms and body mass index (BMI) or birth weight with the risk of dyslipidemia in Iranian children and adolescents. Materials and Methods:This study was conducted as a sub-study of the “school-based nationwide health survey” (CASPIAN-III). We randomly selected 750 samples from the whole blood samples. Real-time PCR and high resolution melt (HRM) analysis were performed to determine Taq1B (rs708272) and A373P (rs5880) polymorphisms. Results:Taq1B polymorphism increased HDL-C, and total cholesterol (TC) as well as decreased triglyceride and LDL-C concentrations. LDL-C and triglyceride levels were significantly higher and HDL-C and TC levels were significantly lower among those with A373P polymorphism. CT/TT genotype in Taq1B polymorphism showed a protective effect on dyslipidemia (OR= 0.12, 95%CI: 0.07-0.20). G allele of A373P polymorphism increased the risk of dyslipidemia (OR=4.10, 95%CI: 2.14, 7.83) after adjusting the confounders. We observed interactive effects of CETP gene polymorphisms and BMI or birth weight on dyslipidemia. Conclusion:Findings showed Taq1B polymorphism might have a protective effect and A373P polymorphism had deleterious effect on dyslipidemia in Iranian children and adolescents. These associations interacted with BMI and birth weight.

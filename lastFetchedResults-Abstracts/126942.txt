Reclamation project of Lamerd plain was started in 1995 with seeding, seedlings and protection in an area about 8000 hectares using resistant species to drought and salinity such as Atriplex sp., Prosopis juliflora and Acacia tortilis. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of this project of soil and vegetation characteristics. For this purpose, five profiles were dug within each site. Physio-chemical soil characteristics such as texture EC, pH, lime, organic matter, gypsum, soluble ions (Na, K+, Ca2+, Mg^2+, Ct) and SAR were measured. In addition, vegetation characteristics such as percentage of canopy cover; condition and trend of vegetation and yield were determined. The results showed that soil have high salinity. Soil salinity was increased specially in the protective area comparing to the first year of the project and expansion of protective area within seedlings area was considerable. One of the important reasons which cause decay in seedlings after project performance (in spite of considerable growth at the first year of project) are: stopped additional irrigation, limitation of plant roots penetration because hard pan caused by lime in 30-60cm depth, shallow water table, water salinity and damaging of plant roots because of severe crust caused in surface layer of soil in the study area.

Objective: To determine the frequency of asymptomatic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in normotesive type 2 diabetic patients. Material and Methods: This descriptive case series study was conducted on 80 normotesive Type 2 diabetic patients at Cardiology Department, PGMI Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar from March 2007 to March 2008. Detailed history and physical examination was performed on every patient. . The glycemic status was defined on the basis of HbA1c. Exercise tolerance test was performed on every patient to exclude major ischemia. Echocardiography was performed in left lateral position. Main outcome measure was Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Results: We enrolled 80 normotesive Type 2 diabetic patients in the study that fulfills the inclusion criteria. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was found in 53% (43/80). There were 20 (47%) males and 23 females (53%) among subjects presenting with diastolic dysfunction. Subjects with diastolic dysfunction the mean age were 55±15 years. Patients having no Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction mean age were 52.5±7 years. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of asymptomatic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients.

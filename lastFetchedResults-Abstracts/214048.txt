Background: The objective was to evalu ate whether extending the embryo culture period from 2 to 3
days would yield a more optim al selection of viable embryos, thereby increasing the pregnancy rate.
Materials and Methods: We have retrospectively analyzed pregnancy rates in the patients who had
embryo transfer either on day 2 (582 patients) or on day 3 (387 patients) post- insemin ation over a
10-month period. The relationsh ip between the quali ty score of day 2 and day 3 embryos and their
respective pregnancy rates was also analyzed .
Results: The demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. Embryos transferred
on day 2 or day 3, were sim ilar morphologically& we found no difference in the distribution of grades
between patients who became pregn ant and those who failed to become pregnant. Pregnancy rates
were slightly higher in patients who had embryo transfer on day 3 (40.72 %) than patients who had
transferred on day 2 (38.96 %), but this difference was not significant.

Conclusion: Extending the embryo culture period from 2 to 3 days had no adverse effect on pregnancy
rate . Embryo transfer could be done on days 2 or 3 according to the convenience of the patient and the
medical team .

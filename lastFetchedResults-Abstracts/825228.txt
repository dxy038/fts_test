Given an undirected graph with edge weights, we are asked to find an orientation, that is, an assignment of a direction to each edge, so as to minimize the weighted maximum outdegree in the resulted directed graph. The problem is called MMO, and is a restricted variant of the well-known minimum makespan problem. As in previous studies, it is shown that MMO is in image for trees, weak image-hard for planar bipartite graphs, and strong image-hard for general graphs. There are still gaps between those graph classes. The objective of this paper is to show tighter thresholds of complexity: We show that MMO is (i) in image for cactus graphs, (ii) weakly image-hard for outerplanar graphs, and also (iii) strongly image-hard for graphs which are both planar and bipartite. This implies the image-hardness for image-bipartite, diamond-free or house-free graphs, each of which is a superclass of cactus. We also show (iv) the image-hardness for seriesâ€“parallel graphs and multi-outerplanar graphs, and (v) present a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for graphs with bounded treewidth.

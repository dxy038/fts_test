Background
ysis is one of the most common studies performed on the diabetic patient at every visit. The presence of leukocyturia is relatively common but it is not clear what the attitude of the physician toward this particular finding should be. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the clinical significance of leukocyturia in diabetic women.
s
-eight diabetic women (84.7% type 2) aged 57 Â± 13 years who were being seen at the diabetic out-patient clinic were randomly selected. All patients underwent a clinical and gynecologic examination and a urinalysis. A Papanicolaou smear and a urine culture were also obtained.
s
erall prevalence of leukocyturia (&gt;5 cells/high power field (hpf)) was 46.5%. Patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) were 7.5 times more likely to have leukocyturia, while a leukocyte count &lt;5cells/hpf predicted the absence of UTI in 96% of the women. In the comparison of patients with and without leukocyturia, we found that proteinuria (p = 0.06) and bacteriuria (p &lt;0.002) were more common in the women with leukocyturia. A significant association with leukorrhea was not demonstrated. The empirical use of antibiotics was 12 times more frequent in the patients with leukocyturia.
sions
ary culture should be requested in all diabetic patients with leukocyturia. The possibility of a UTI is remote when leukocyturia is absent.

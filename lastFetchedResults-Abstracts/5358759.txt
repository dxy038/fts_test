Most tourists today expect a friendly tour guidance and services considering their individual preferences and actual situation while protecting their privacy. The ideal is an intelligent guide taking care of the whole organization and execution in time. This is the main objective of the context-based Personalized Mobile Tourist Guide (PMTG). TouristÂ´s profiles or visiting background is stored in a user model. This paper develops a user model based on information retrieval techniques to rank tourists preferences of POIs. The tour computation is solved using a guided local search metaheuristic which is fast and can produce solutions dynamically meeting the real-time requirements. By integrating various sources like GIS and existing databases or Webs, the PMTG is a mobile agent that selects attractions, plans an individual tour, provides navigational guidance and offers context-based service in any possible way with the help of a mobile device. Furthermore, it protects the tourist privacy.

Objective
form disorders are characterized by patterns of persistent bodily complaints. Organic illness attributions are assumed to represent a central supporting factor in the development and maintenance of somatoform disorders. Using group control design, we aimed to investigate the processing of illness-belief-related word stimuli in somatoform pain disorder patients.
s
c-related, psychosocial-related, and neutral word stimuli were presented to 14 somatoform pain patients with a predominantly organic illness attribution, 14 somatoform pain patients with a predominantly psychosocial illness attribution, and 14 control participants. Behavioral measures were taken during free recall and recognition tasks.
s
udy revealed cognitive impairment in somatoform pain patients with an organic attribution of pain symptoms as compared to somatoform pain patients with a psychosocial attribution and healthy controls in both free recall test and recognition test. However, selective processing of word stimuli was not observed for patient groups.
sion
clude that the observed impairment of memory performance in somatoform pain patients with an organic illness attribution may play an important role in the illness behavior of this patient group and ultimately result in the maintenance of symptoms and a more critical clinical outcome.

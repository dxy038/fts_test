Background: Sperm selection for ICSI based on morphology and motility might not be relevant to chromatin integrity. Thus sperm selection based on sperm characteristics has been suggested. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of Zeta method with routine Density Gradient Centrifugation method (DGC) for the selection of sperm with higher DNA integrity. Materials and Methods: Semen samples were obtained from 63 individuals referring to Andrology Unit of Isfahan Fertility and Infertility Center. Semen analysis was carried out according to WHO criteria. Each semen sample was divided into three equal portions. One portion was used as control, the second portion was used for Zeta method and the third portion underwent DGC method. Each portion was evaluated to DNA integrity by TUNEL assay. Student t-test was carried out using SPSS and p-value lower than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The mean number of sperm DNA fragmentation in Zeta and DGC methods were significantly decreased compare to the control group (p<0.001). In addition, Zeta method was more efficient than the DGC method in the selection of sperm with intact DNA (p<0.001). Conclusion: The Zeta method appears to be a suitable procedure to recover sperm with normal DNA integrity.

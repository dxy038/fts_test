This paper proposes a new current source inverter using a coupled inductor, which is derived from the circuit of the matrix converter using an additional inductor. The proposed circuit has the bidirectional power conversion ability, providing step-up and step-down operation in each direction, and can switch the direction of the power flow instantaneously. This paper describes the principle of operation, the simulation results and the experimental results of the proposed circuit.

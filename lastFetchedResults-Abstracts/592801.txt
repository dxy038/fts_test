A few case reports of coinfections with Nocardia and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB)
have previously been published in the literature. We report on a case of concomitant
pulmonary nocardiosis and tuberculosis, in a recently diagnosed 55-year-old woman,
with rheumatoid arthritis, who had been taking a short course of a low dose corticosteroid.
The patient was treated with a combination of amikacin and imipenem, as well as a
standard anti-TB regimen. Physiologic doses of corticosteroids might be a predisposing
factor for opportunistic infections, such as nocardiosis or tuberculosis.

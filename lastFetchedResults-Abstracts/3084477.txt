In a power network where more than one generator is used to supply a load, power generators have to be controlled with the lowest power production cost. Network load in a power system is always varying with occasional demand surges. Even small surges create a frequency deviation in the power system and if the frequency deviation is not rapidly eliminated, the power system frequency can become unstable, causing damage to its components. One of the control methods is automatic generation control (AGC). The AGC objective is to provide a power control input to each generating unit. This paper presents the implementation of an AGC strategy in a field programmable gate array (FPGA). For testing, the power generating units and the load were simulated using LabVIEW

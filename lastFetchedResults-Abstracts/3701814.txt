An analytical model that takes into account the influence of the laser linewidth on Rayleigh backscattering is given. For an unmodulated source the power spectral density is found to be identical to the delayed self-homodyne spectrum of the laser. The backscattered signal was measured for different laser linewidths, and the results are compared with the theory. The effects of Rayleigh backscattering noise on fiber gyroscopes and bidirectional optical systems are discussed

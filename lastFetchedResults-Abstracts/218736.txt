Background: During the past decades the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) has declined and its prognosis has changed
dramatically due to chemotherapy; however, cases of tuberculous pericarditis are still reported worldwide.
Materials and methods: The study population included 19 men and 11women aged 12-76 years admitted to the hospital
for acute pericardial disease. The diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis was verified based on the adenosin deaminase
activity (ADA), culture on Lowenstein-Jensen media, Ziehl Neelsen staining, biopsy of pericardial tissue and evaluation
of tuberculin test.
Results: Of 30 patients, 13 (43.3%) had tuberculous pericarditis. All of whom had clinical TB manifestations. The
culture of pericardial fluid in 6 patients (46%), staining in 3 (23%), and the culture of pericardial tissue in 6 patients
(46%) were positive. The caseating granuloma w identified in 46% of cases. Ten case (77%) had positive PPD reaction.
All tuberculous pericarditis patients had ADA level of >45U/l.
Conclusion: Results have revealed that measurement of ADA level may prove a good screening test for early diagnosis
of tuberculous pericarditis.

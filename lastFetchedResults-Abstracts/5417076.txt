Cross docking is a material handling and distribution concept in which goods move directly from receiving to shipping. In a typical cross docking system, the primary objective is to eliminate storage and excessive handling. As companies continue to streamline distribution functions, cross docking is becoming a more widely accepted distribution method. The benefits of cross docking include reduced inventory, increased customer responsiveness, and better control of the distribution operation. By definition, cross docking systems require: a close connection between receiving and shipping operations This connection calls for robust hardware and software systems to solve the cross docking problem. Simulation reduces some of the risk involved with cross docking systems. The paper describes how simulation helps ensure success in cross docking systems by determining optimal hardware configuration and software control, as well as establishing failure strategies before cross docking problems are encountered. Modeling methods and issues are also discussed as they apply to cross docking. The paper is oriented toward simulation practitioners who need to model cross docking systems, as well as distribution managers who are evaluating cross docking

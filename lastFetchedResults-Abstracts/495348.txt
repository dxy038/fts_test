Background and objective: Resistance of gram negative bacteria towards antibiotics has caused mortality through out the world and a great deal of money is spent for treatment of relevant infection. Klebsiella pneumoniae, which its resistant strains are on increasing trend can be pointed out as the cause of hospital acquired infection ,easily transferred by hand of hospital staff. Since the pattern of resistance toward antibiotic has a key role in treatment and control of the infection , thus determination of ESBLs became our goal in this study.

Materials and methods: To carry out this investigation 150 isolates of Klebsiella strains including urine, sputum, wound, CSF were collected. The MICs for ceftazidime was also determined using microbroth dilution. Method

Results: The resistance demonstrated that 94% of the isolates were resistant to carbenicilin, piperacilin (55%), cefotaxime (32%),ceftazidime(31%). All strains were susceptible to imipenem.

Conclusion: Care should be taken to use ceftazidime because of high resistance and ESBLs producing strains.

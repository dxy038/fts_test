The main objective of short-term load forecasting (STLF) is to provide load predictions for generation scheduling, economic load dispatch and security assessment at any time. A new forecasting approach is designed in this paper and the novel method based on the cooperative co-evolutionary and the immune algorithm is proposed. The cooperative co-evolutionary immune network is used to evolve the structure and parameters of neural network. The proposed cooperative co-evolutionary immune network model has been implemented based on the actual data and compared with the traditional Radial-Basis Function (RBF) network method. The test results reveal that the cooperative co-evolutionary immune network method possesses far superior forecast precision than the Radial-Basis Function neural network method.

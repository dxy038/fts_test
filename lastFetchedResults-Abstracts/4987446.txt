The undispatchability of wind farm presents lots of integration problems to safe operation of power system. Designing energy storage system for Dispatchability of wind farm is an effective integration solution. This paper presents a novel sizing method of energy storage system for dispatchability of wind farm with different confidence level. The forecast data of wind power is generated base on persistence method, and then based on forecast data a dispatch strategy is proposed for the minimization of energy storage size. For the compromise between dispatchability of wind farm and energy storage size, different confidence level of dispatchability can be defined as constraint and constraint function of energy storage rated power and capacity is established with non-parametric estimation and curve fitting. The investment cost model considering lifetime of energy storage is proposed as objective function with constraint function. For obtaining optimal energy storage size, genetic algorithm is used to solve the non-linear objective function. Finally, the sizing method is illustrated by an example adopting lithium-ion battery energy storage system.

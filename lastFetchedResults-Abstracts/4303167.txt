Transients normally contain information that is helpful to diagnose the cause and aspect of the fault. This experiment is conducted with the objective of studying the basic knowledge of fault features and hopefully useful to get more precise in discriminating fault causes. Ground faults are concentrated in this paper because they are known as the most frequent ones occurring on distribution lines. The results are compared with those from actual fault and computer simulation. The authors also conduct the time-frequency analysis of dynamic spectrum of transients of various fault causes by means of wavelet transform for explaining fault phenomena.

Background: Treg cells are the most potent suppressants of antitumural activity of immune system and expression of CTLA-4 is essential for activation of FOXP3+ T-cells. IL-10 is an immunosuppressor which is one of the major obstacles of specific tumoral T-cells. Objective of this study was comparison of expression of FOXP3, CTLA-4 &IL10 genes among patients with and without laryngeal cancer local metastasis and patients with lymph node ivolvement.
Material and Methods: 59 patients with laryngeal cancer which 8 of them had lacal metastasis were enrolled in this study. Also 31 samples of lymph node tissues were taken. The percentage and expression of FOXP3, CTLA-4 &IL10 genes were investigated by Real-Time PCR.
Results: The results indicated that there were not any significant difference between laryngeal cancer patients with or without local metastasis and also between patients with or without lymph node involvement in percentage of FOXP3, CTLA-4 and IL-10 genes expression (P > 0/05). As well as there were no statistical association with the genes expression and different stages and pathological differentiation of tumors (P > 0/05).
Conclusion: There is no significant association between percentage of expression of FOXP3, CTLA-4 and IL-10 genes in our patients with laryngeal tumor considering local invasion extension and lymph node involvements.

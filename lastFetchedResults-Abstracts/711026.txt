Study Objective
To provide late adolescent and young adult psychosexual follow-up information on a consecutive series of patients with either mixed or partial gonadal dysgenesis.
Setting
Children's Memorial Health Institute (Warsaw, Poland).
Participants
19 patients (age range, 17â€“26 years), 9 raised as females and 10 raised as males.
Measures
Clinical interview and psychologic tests were used to evaluate gender identity, gender role, and sexual behavior.
Results
All patients raised as male had a normal male gender identity, displayed masculine gender role behavior in childhood, and had a heterosexual sexual orientation. Seven of the 10 male patients had experienced heterosexual intercourse. Two out of nine women did not identify with the female gender. The majority had masculine gender role interests in childhood. The female patients were significantly less likely to have experienced sexual activity with a partner than the male patients.
Conclusion
Although gender identity differentiated largely in accordance with sex assignment or sex of rearing in our sample, the patients reared as female appeared to have poorer sexual adjustment than the males. Cultural factors may have impacted on this latter outcome.

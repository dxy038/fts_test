The architecture, design and performance of RDMA (remote direct memory access) over the IBM HPS (high performance switch and adapter) are described. Unlike conventional implementations such as InfiniBand, our RDMA transport model is layered on top of an unreliable datagram interface, while leaving the task of enforcing reliability to the ULP (upper layer protocol). We demonstrate that our model allows a single MPI task to deliver bidirectional bandwidth of close to 3.0 GB/s across a single link and 24.0 GB/s when striped across 8 links. In addition, we show that this transport protocol has superior attributes in terms of a) being able to handle RDMA packets coming out of order; b) being able to use multiple routes between a source-destination pair and c) reducing the size of adapter caches.

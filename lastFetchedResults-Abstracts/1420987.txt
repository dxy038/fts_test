The objective of the present paper is to study analytically the performance of four-pocket orifice compensated hydrostatic/hybrid journal bearing system of various geometric shapes of recess operating with micropolar lubricant. The modified Reynolds equation for micropolar lubricant is solved using FEM and the Newtonâ€“Raphson method along with appropriate boundary conditions. The results suggest that the influence of micropolar effect of lubricant on bearing performance is predominantly affected by the geometric shape of recess and restrictor design parameter. Therefore, the bearing designer must judiciously choose an appropriate geometric shape of recess in order to get an overall enhanced bearing performance.

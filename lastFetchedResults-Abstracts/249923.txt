The objective of this paper is to investigate the e ciency of various computational algorithms implemented
in the framework of structural optimization methods based on evolutionary algorithms. In
particular, the e ciency of parallel computational strategies is examined with reference to evolution
strategies (ES) and genetic algorithms (GA). Parallel strategies are implemented both at the level of
the optimization algorithm, by exploiting the natural parallelization features of the evolutionary algorithms,
as well as at the level of the repeated structural analysis problems that are required by ES and
GA. In the latter case the  nite element solutions are performed by the FETI domain decomposition
method specially tailored to the particular type of problems at hand. The proposed methodology is
generic and can be applied to all types of optimization problems as long as they involve large-scale
 nite element simulations. The numerical tests of the present study are performed on sizing optimization
of skeletal structures. The numerical tests demonstrate the computational advantages of the proposed
parallel strategies, which become more pronounced in large-scale optimization problems

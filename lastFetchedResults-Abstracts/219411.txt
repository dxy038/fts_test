Objective: It is reported that some inflammatory markers are predictive factors for atherosclerosis in childhood and adolescence and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. We investigated whether markers of inflammation including: cytokine [Interleukin-6 (IL-6)], acute-phase reactant [C-reactive protein (CRP)], white blood cell (WBC) count and its subgroups are associated with maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) in overweight and normal children.
Methods: Subjects were 26 boys aged 11-14 years included in two groups of overweight (n=10) and normal weight (n=16) children. VO2max was measured employing an incremental graded exercise test. IL-6 and CRP levels as well as WBC count were measured. Multivariable regression was employed to evaluate whether inflammatory markers were associated with VO2max. 
Findings: Mean VO2max for all subjects (n=26) was 36.35±10.42 ml/kg/min. This rate was lesser for overweight subjects (25.77±5.04) than in normal weight children (41.54±5.96). Log IL-6, log CRP, and WBC count were correlated with VO2max. Also subgroups of WBC including Leukocytes, Lymphocyte, Neutrophils, Monocytes and Eosinophils associated with VO2max.
Conclusion: IL-6, CRP and WBCs were inversely associated with aerobic or cardiorespiratory fitness levels measured by VO2max in children. This was independent of BMI of the subjects.

The interaction between the beam and its environment leads to beam instabilities, and is characterized by coupling impedance. The longitudinal coupling impedance of some RHIC devices with azimuthal symmetry such as bellows, pipe transition, gate valve and collimator have been calculated numerically using the time domain code TBCI. The objective is to keep the broadband impedance below a threshold so that it satisfies the microwave stability criteria; and make sure there is no contribution to narrowband impedance from any of these structures

The detection of auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) provides an objective and frequency specific technique to assess reliable hearing thresholds at audiometric frequencies. Unfortunately, the duration of ASSR measurements can be long, which is unpractical for wide scale clinical application. Therefore, we propose a multi-channel Wiener filtering (MWF) based technique with a priori knowledge through LQ factorisation as a tool to improve the ASSR detection in recorded multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) data obtained at intensities above hearing threshold. We conclude that this technique is able to reduce measurement duration significantly. For a multi-channel data set and implementation, near-optimal performance is obtained with five-channel recordings.

By adopting statistical methods, we calculated word frequency, sentence length, style, selection and other aspects of these 12 volumes of Tibetan language textbooks. The result is as follows: 1) The arrangement of textbooks basically follows the principle of gradual and orderly progress; 2) the main literary genre is narrative and enough attention is paid to the the diversity of genre. 3) Through calculation of reiteration degrees, the distribution of lexical entry is reasonable and consistent with the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. 4) attention should be paid to the ratio of texts of native language and those translated from Chinese language. Statistical data provides an objective basis and quantitative criteria for compiling and evaluation of textbooks, which helps new primary school textbooks better meet the needs of the development in Tibetan language education.

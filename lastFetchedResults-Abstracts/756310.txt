Objective
To evaluate the use of the phosphorylcholine (PC) coated BiodivYsio small vessel (SV) stent in native coronary vessels of small calibre.
Design and setting

Prospective, multi-centre, multi-national registry with 6-month clinical and core-lab angiographic follow-up. Adverse events were adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) and included peri-procedural analysis of cardiac enzymes.
Patients

Patients with signs or symptoms of ischaemia with an identified target lesion in an epicardial vessel with reference diameter 2.0–2.75 mm were enrolled. Intervention in other epicardial territories in the same patient was permitted.
Results

Recruitment of 150 consecutive lesions (in 143 patients) was completed in 19 centres in Europe and Israel. The stent was deployed successfully in all but one lesion. At 6 months, 1 patient (1%) had experienced sudden cardiac death, 4 further patients (3%) had a non-Q wave MI, and a further 24 patients (17%) had repeat revascularisation of a study target vessel. The mean reference vessel diameter prior to stenting was 2.2 mm (S.D. 0.4). Mean minimal luminal diameters at pre-procedure, post procedure and follow-up were 0.6 mm (S.D. 0.3), 2.0 mm (S.D. 0.4) and 1.2 mm (S.D. 0.6), respectively. The late lumen loss index was 0.55 (S.D. 0.53) with a binary restenosis rate of 32%.
Conclusions

In stenting of selected lesions in small vessels, the BiodivYsio SV™ stent demonstrated high rates of implant success. The rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), angiographic restenosis and repeat revascularisation are similar to those reported in other small vessel bare metal stent studies.

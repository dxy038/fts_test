Background: Since the measles resurgence of 1989–1991, which affected predominantly inner-city preschoolers, national vaccination rates have risen to record-high levels, but rates among inner-city, preschool-aged, African-American children lag behind national rates. The threat of measles importations from abroad exists and may be particularly important in large U.S. cities. To stop epidemic transmission, measles vaccination coverage should be at least 80%.

Objective: To determine measles vaccination rates and predictors for having received a dose of measles-containing vaccine by age 19 to 35 months among children in an inner-city community of Chicago.

Methods: We used a cross-sectional survey with probability proportional to size cluster sampling. Immunization histories from parent-held records and providers were combined to establish a complete vaccination history.

Results: A total of 2545 households were contacted, and 170 included a resident child aged 12 to 35 months. Of these, 97% (N=165 children) agreed to participate. Immunization history from a parent or provider was not available for 20 children. Among children aged 19 to 35 months with available immunization histories, 74% received measles vaccine (n=100); of these, 84% received the vaccine as recommended at ages 12 to 15 months. However, when including children without immunization histories, measles coverage levels among children aged 19 to 35 months were 64% (n=114). Among children with records, predictors for receipt of measles vaccine by age 19 to 35 months were possessing a hand-held immunization card (odds ratio [OR]=16.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]=4.2–67.1); utilizing a public health department provider for a usual source of care (OR=8.9; 95% CI=1.6–47.2); and being up-to-date for vaccines at 3 months of age (OR=5.0; 95% CI=1.8–14.1).

Conclusions: Optimistically assuming that children without immunization histories are as well immunized as children with immunization histories, the measles vaccination rate among Englewood’s children aged 19 to 35 months is too low to maintain immunity (74%). Measles coverage levels lagged behind coverage reported in a national survey in Chicago (86%) and the nation as a whole (92%). Efforts to raise and sustain coverage should be undertaken.

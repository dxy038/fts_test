Experimental prototype high-speed entropy coder and decoder chips with parallel architectures are discussed. Two coding techniques, run-length coding and variable-length coding, are implemented in these two chips. Designed in a 1.2-&#956;m double-metal CMOS technology, the die-size of each chip is about 5 mm&#215;5 mm. Each chip contains about 35 K transistors. Based on the simulation of critical parts, they are expected to meet a speed objective of 52 MHz with margin

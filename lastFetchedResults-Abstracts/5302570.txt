Summary form only given, as follows. The two-dimensional edge plasma transport code B2 will be used to investigate the power handling capability of candidate designs for the Compact Ignition Tokamak (CIT). The primary objective is to estimate the divertor target plate temperature. Early work will focus on the impact of varying the distance between the X-point and the plate. The effects of helium and carbon impurities on edge plasma conditions will also be examined. The model describing the CIT edge plasma in the B2 code will be benchmarked against TFTR discharges as part of a separate project to investigate the carbon bloom phenomenon. In particular, B2 will be used in conjunction with the DEGAS neutral transport code to identify sets of transport coefficients that yield a simulation consistent with TFTR data. The initial work will be done with deuterium only; runs with a carbon impurity will follow

This paper presents a simple method to find out the minimum value of capacitance crucial to initiate self excitation process in six-phase induction generator. The problem is formulated as multivariable unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem. The admittance of the equivalent circuit of the six-phase self-excited induction generator (SPSEIG) is taken as an objective function. The frequency and magnetic reactance or speed and magnetic reactance or frequency and capacitive reactance are selected as an independent variables depending upon the operational condition of the machine. In this proposed method, resultant matrix is directly solved by Fmincon method. The developed mathematical model is quite simple and can be implemented for connection of pure resistive load with appropriate value of capacitor connected across SPSEIG. The computed results are compared with experimental results, and are found to be in good agreement with them.

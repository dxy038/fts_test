Objective: Our aim was to determine whether cocaine use increases neonatal morbidity in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Study Design: We reviewed records of pregnancies that were complicated with preterm premature rupture of membranes between 24 weeks to 34 weeks of gestation. Clinical characteristics and neonatal outcomes of patients who had positive results for cocaine in the urine were compared with patients with negative test results. Results: During the study period, 16.1% (85/528 patients) had a positive result in a urine screen for cocaine use. Patients who used cocaine were older and of higher gravidity and parity. When major neonatal morbidities were compared, there was improvement in morbidities that were linked to neonatal infection in patients with positive test results for cocaine, including pneumonia (3.5% vs 11.7%; P = .012) and sepsis (5.9% vs 14.7%; P = .016). Jointly, neonatal outcomes were significantly worse in the negative cocaine group (Ï‡2 = 5.143; P = .023). Conclusion: The association of preterm premature rupture of membranes with major neonatal morbidity was unexpectedly and significantly weaker in pregnancies complicated by cocaine use.

This work presents a multiplatform architecture to support the design and implementation of desktop multiplayer games controlled by mobile phones with Bluetooth capability. Our main objective was to demonstrate that by harnessing technologies such as J2ME, J2SE, and Bluetooth communication it is possible to transform any mobile phone that support these technologies into a wireless application-independent remote controller. To demonstrate the flexibility of this approach, we have focused on employing mobile phones as game controllers. We developed four games in different genres/styles that support various input modes among players. The results gathered from our testbed games are twofold: i) in terms of overall game performance there was no noticeable communication delays, and; ii) in terms of gameplay, we have observed that the nature of the game interaction supported by this communication architecture has enhanced the social aspect of games-each game offered a entertaining environment in which a group of people could engage in.

The applications of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, due to such features as high strength to weight ratio and excellent creep resistance, is increasing in various industries. However, because of the difficulty involved in chip removal of titanium alloys by traditional methods, special machining techniques have attracted more attention. In this study, wire electrical discharge machining process of Ti-6Al-4V alloy has been investigated. The distinct aspect of this research is the consideration of various cutting heights along with the effects of 8 process parameters on the two output characteristics, namely cutting rate and surface roughness. For this, a total of 108 experimental data have been collected and, based on signal-to-noise ratios, separate optimal parameters settings were obtained for maximum cutting rate and minimum surface roughness. The optimization results have been verified against the experimental data. According to analysis of variance, pulse on-time, with 77% contribution, is the most significant parameter affecting surface roughness. While pulse on-time and machining voltage, with combined contribution of 67%, are the most effective parameters for the cutting rate. In general, by decreasing pulse on-time and peak current and increasing pulse off-time and voltage, surface rohghness and cutting rate are decreased. Finally, using multi-objective optimization and based on the relative importance of process output characteristics, technology tables for the three investigated cutting heights are presented. The results indicates that, with respect to the surface roughness and cutting rate, optimal parameters levels and their rate of impacts are affected by the cutting height.

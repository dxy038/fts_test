In this paper, we propose a new method to simulate human gait motion when muscles are weakened. The method is based on the enhanced version of three-dimensional linear inverted pendulum model that is used for generation of gait in robotics. After the normal gait motion is generated by setting the initial posture and the parameters that decide the trajectories of the center of mass and angular momentum, the muscle to be weakened is specified. By minimizing an objective function based on the force exerted by the specified muscle during the motion, the set of parameters that represent the pathological gait was calculated. Since the number of parameters to describe the motion is small in our method, the optimization process converges much more quickly than in previous methods. The effects of weakening the gluteus medialis, the gluteus maximus, and vastus were analyzed. Important similarities were noted when comparing the predicted pendulum motion with data obtained from an actual patient.

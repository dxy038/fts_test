Different from the conventional piezoelectric microcantilevers with a piezoelectric film sandwiched between two metal electrodes on cantilever structures, the objective of our investigation is to develop a technology platform based on the integration of two piezoelectric PZT thin-film elements on silicon cantilevers for microsensors and microactuators. Two novel piezoelectric microcantilevers with two piezoelectric elements (bimorph or two segments of PZT films) and three electric electrodes were designed. The microcantilevers were successfully fabricated by bulk micromachining. The generated piezoelectric charge and actuation force of the microcantilevers were characterized. As microsensors or microactuators, the bimorph piezoelectric cantilevers can increase the sensing resolution and actuation displacement (force) of the piezoelectric cantilevers. The bimorph and two-segment piezoelectric cantilevers can be served as the versatile devices for sensing and actuation. The multifunctional cantilevers have many potential applications in fields such as micromanipulation systems, microrobots, and vibration controls of flexible manipulators.

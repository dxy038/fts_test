Monitoring of speech quality in emerging heterogeneous networks is of great interest to network operators. The most efficient way to satisfy such a need is through nonintrusive, objective speech quality assessment. In this paper, we describe a low-complexity algorithm for monitoring the speech quality over a network. The features used in the proposed algorithm can be computed from commonly used speech-coding parameters. Reconstruction and perceptual transformation of the signal is not performed. The critical advantage of the approach lies in generating quality assessment ratings without explicit distortion modeling. The results from the performed experiments indicate that the proposed nonintrusive objective quality measure performs better than the ITU-T P.563 standard

In this work the use of blending-function methods for the reduction of blocking effect is presented. An important aspect of our method is the novel approach for blocking effect definition. The image is deblocked by subtracting from every block an interpolatory surface canceling precisely prescribed curves, related to discontinuities on the boundaries between adjacent blocks. Two extensions which adapt themselves to the nature of the block and human visual perception are proposed. A new adaptive quantization constraint set is defined. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides better performance as compared to several of the best known methods in both objective and subjective image quality. The proposed algorithms are applicable to color images.

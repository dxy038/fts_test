This paper presents synthesis of unequally spaced linear array antenna with minimum sidelobe suppression, desired beamwidth and null control using wind driven optimization (WDO) algorithm. The WDO technique is nature-inspired, population based iterative heuristic global optimization algorithm for multidimensional and multimodal problems. The array synthesis objective function is formulated and then optimizes elements location using WDO algorithm to achieve the goal of minimum sidelobe level (SLL) suppression, desired beamwidth and null placement in certain direction. The results of the WDO algorithm are validated by comparing with results obtained using PSO and other evolutionary algorithm as reported in literature for linear array (N=10). The synthesis results such as radiation pattern and convergence graph show that WDO algorithm performs far better than the common PSO, CLPSO and other evolutionary algorithms.

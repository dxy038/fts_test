Route optimization technique helps to optimize the media path and to lessen the propagation delay time between two communicating nodes. For PMIPv6 technology, this route optimization technique is applicable to the scenarios, i.e., a separate MAG scenario and a sharing MAG scenario whose two communication terminals register different LMAs respectively. In this paper, two route optimum mechanisms for local communication on PMIPv6 is presented for forwarding data packets rapidly. For the separate MAG scenario, a bidirectional tunnel is set up between two peer MAGs. A MAG address discovery mechanism is presented because its address is a prerequisite of route optimum in the scenario. An internal binding mechanism is proposed for the route optimum on the sharing MAG scenario. The set up and maintenance of localized routing optimum, which allows forwarding of data packets between mobile nodes and correspondent nodes directly without involvement of the LMA in forwarding, can makes no difference for data packet forward, decrease packet loss, increase throughput or diminish transport delay.

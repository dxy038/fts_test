BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several studies have indicated that serum uric acid increases in patients with pre-diabetes and the early of type 2 diabetes mellitus. As diabetes continues and blood sugar goes uncontrolled, the level of serum uric acid drops again. This study aimed to determine the relationship between serum uric acid and blood sugar levels in the elderly, diabetic patients of Amirkola city.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was a part of Amirkola Health and Ageing Project (AHAP). Blood samples were obtained from all the patients in order to measure the Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) and blood uric acid levels. Afterwards, the relationship between the serum uric acid and Blood Glucose was evaluated.
FINDINGS: Of the 1525 older people aged 60 and over, 351(23%) were known to have type 2 diabetes and 116 people was diagnosed as diabetes mellitus based on the measurements of FBS. Data analysis revealed an inverse relationship between FBS and serum uric acid level (p=0.012, r=-0.054) and age (p=0.001, r=-0.090) whereas there was a direct relationship between FBS and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p=0.001, r=0.115).
CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this study, FBSis inversely correlated with the serum uric acid and age whereas there is a direct correlation between BMI and FBS.
KEY WORDS: Diabetes, Uric Acid, Blood Sugar.

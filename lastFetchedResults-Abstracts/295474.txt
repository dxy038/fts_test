Objective: To show the effectiveness of an integrated therapeutical approach in a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following burns, inhalation injury with therapy-refractory oxygenation under maximized ventilatory settings, and an overall complicated clinical course. Patient and methods: Case report of a patient with severe inhalation injury and burns in an intensive care unit setting, undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), nitric oxide (NO)-inhalation, surfactant-, kinetic-, and urodilatin-therapy. Case report: A 15-year-old male presented with deep dermal and full thickness thermal injuries involving 25% of his total body surface area. Shortly after presentation, the patient developed therapy-refractory respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and subsequently suffered five-organ system failure (lung, heart, gastrointestinal, liver, kidney), in addition to burn injury, and ischemia related cerebral lesions. The patient was successfully treated with cardiac resuscitation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), NO, kinetic therapy, surfactant, urodilatin, and other standard intensive care regimens. Three months post-trauma the patient was discharged home, nearly fully recovered. Conclusions: In a patient with severe ARDS, oxygenation failure under maximized ventilatory settings, and subsequent five-organ system failure, an integrated therapeutical approach comprising ECMO, NO, kinetic therapy, surfactant, and urodilatin did cross-bridge respiratory and vital functions, enabling overall survival.

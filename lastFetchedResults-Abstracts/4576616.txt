This paper presents an implementation of a novel approach in radial distribution system for cost of loss reduction on an 11 kV distribution system consisting of 37 buses and 35 transmission lines. The study is carried out incorporating an appropriate load distribution model. This approach identifies an optimal location (node) of the capacitor by sequential comparison of line flows with previous ones followed by determination of size of the capacitor for maximum loss reduction by taking the voltage magnitude and currents at that particular node. The installation of capacitor indicated the reduction in total system losses and there is overall improvement in voltage profile of the system. A study has been carried out on the 11 kV distribution system. The objective of reducing the losses and improvement in voltage profile has been successfully achieved. After installation of capacitor, the system can save a total energy of 682.8 kWH per day, which is very substantial

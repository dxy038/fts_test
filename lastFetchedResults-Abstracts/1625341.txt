The objective of this study was to investigate and compare the physical and functional properties of chitosan films prepared with poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP) and polyethylene oxide (PEO). Addition of PVP or PEO reduced yellowish coloration of chitosan-based films and made the films easier to puncture and tear. Contrary to chitosan/PEO films, where addition of PEO had tendency to reduce water vapor permeability (WVP), the chitosan/PVP films with PVP content of 75% had significantly higher WVP compared to pure chitosan films. Chromium binding capacity of the films was not significantly reduced by any of the tested synthetic polymers even when they replaced up to 75% chitosan in the films. Similarly, antimicrobial efficiency was reduced only when 75% PEO or 50% PVP was used in the films. It appears that incorporation of PVP or PEO in chitosan films could significantly reduce production price with no effect on functionality of the films.

The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate the possibility to synthesize mixed carbon aerogels (denoted CmRF) from cresol (Cm), resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F), as an alternative economic route to the classical RF synthesis. These porous carbon aerogels can be used as electrode materials for supercapacitors with a high volume-specific capacitance. Organic precursor gels were synthesized via polycondensation of a mixture of resorcinol and cresol with formaldehyde in an aqueous alkaline (NaOH) solution. After gelation and aging the solvent was removed via drying at ambient pressure to produce organic aerogels. Upon pyrolysis of the organic aerogels at 1173 K, monolithic carbon aerogels can be obtained. By controlling the catalyst (Cat) molar ratio (Cm+R/Cat) in the range 200â€“500, up to 70% of the resorcinol can be replaced with the cheap cresol. The resulting homogeneous organic aerogels exhibit a drying shrinkage below 15% (linear). The shrinkage and mass loss upon pyrolysis of the mixed aerogels increase with increasing cresol content. Nitrogen adsorption at 77 K was employed to characterize the microstructure of the carbon aerogels. The data show that the porous structure of mixed carbon aerogels is similar to that of RF carbon aerogels. Cyclic voltammetry measurements show that the as-prepared CmRF carbon aerogels exhibit a high volume-specific capacitance of up to 77 F/cm3.

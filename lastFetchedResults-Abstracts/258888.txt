We use a computational general equilibrium model to demonstrate that commonly-used simplified specifications for environmental control costs do not yield results that are comparable to those obtained when environmental control costs are correctly specified. The results indicate that simplified specifications may perform well when the objective is to qualitatively identify sectors disproportionately affected by environmental regulation, but not when the goal is to estimate the magnitude of the effects

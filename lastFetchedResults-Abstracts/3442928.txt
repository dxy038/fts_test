Interference is the key parameter in a code-division multiple access (CDMA) network. As users move around, the interference will flow with the movement. The objective of this paper is to study the impact of the moving interference (mobility) on systemsÂ´ performance and design parameters. In this paper, we develop a detailed CDMA interference model with soft handoff, power-control errors, and shadowing effect. We combine this interference model with a Markov model to study the performance of CDMA systems under various mobility and traffic conditions. We also present a call admission control (CAC) scheme that sets aside some interference cushion for handling mobility and compare this scheme with other CAC schemes in terms of the effectiveness of mitigating the negative impact of mobility on system capacity

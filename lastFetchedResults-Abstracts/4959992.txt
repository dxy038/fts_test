This paper takes a fresh look at peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) reduction for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) using partial transmit sequences (PTS). In particular, the two major drawbacks of PTS, its high complexity when searching for a "good" solution and the need to transfer side information (SI) to the receiver are addressed. Reformulating PTS as a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem enables us to apply various efficient search strategies from the CO literature to PTS. We also incorporate an approximation of the PTS objective function to further reduce the overall complexity. Finally, we propose an implicit SI embedding scheme. This low-complexity scheme requires minimal redundancy and has minimal effect on the overall performance of the OFDM system.

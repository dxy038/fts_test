<para> We developed a 10-Gb/s AlGaInAs colorless remote amplified modulator with a gain peak detuned semiconductor optical amplifier using a selective epitaxy and semi-insulating buried heterostructure. The device provides up to 10-dB insertion gain and lossless operation together with static extinction ratio larger than 20 dB over a 50-nm range. Using this device, we achieved 10-Gb/s remote modulation over 80-nm spectral range in a back-to-back transmission. The device operates also in a single-mode fiber bidirectional link without penalty at 20 <formula formulatype="inline"> <img src="/images/tex/540.gif" alt="^{\\circ}"/> </formula>C. </para>

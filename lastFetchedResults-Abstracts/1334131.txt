The consumption of energy in greenhouses and residential buildings has gained an increasing interest. Recently, due to the rising demand for efficient energy use and higher comfort standards, our contribution will relate to an application of heating of a greenhouse by using an abundant and more universal sources and easily accessible. Thus, the resources employed are water or air. The objective of this work is to model and simulate a heat pump on TRNSYS which is dedicated to study the thermodynamic phenomena. Here, we present a mathematical description of the heat pump on TRNSYS model by using HVAC technique, as well as the numerical results of the simulation of the heat pump, such as the COP, power consumption and the delivered power, by using the geothermal source in southern Tunisia.

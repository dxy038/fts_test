Notwithstanding the fact that data mining and particularly sequence mining have come to the help of database proprietors and experts in variety of fields by extracting the hidden knowledge in their raw data, they have provided an opportunity for adversaries to take advantage from this sensitive knowledge. So this work addresses the problem of sequential pattern hiding, and proposes an efficient and applicable algorithm which benefits from a multi-objective scheme to fulfill the requirements of the problem as well as maintaining database fidelity as much as possible.

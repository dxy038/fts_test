Today, in Post-war Kosovo, there is an increase of malignant processes in all organs, affecting both men and women. Objective of the project: to evaluate the impact of artificial pregnancy interruption in presentation of breast carcinomas arising in women, as well as the possibility to prevent this phenomenon. Material and methods: In the university Clinical Centre of Kosova various radiological diagnostic methods have been used, such as: ultrasonography, mammogra- phy, and galactography, which proved to be very important tool in detecting the ductal car-cinomas. Data-sources, used for this research were questionnaires, which contained also a question related to the number of artificially interrupted pregnancies, showed great dis¬crepancies between the number of abortions and arising breast carcinomas. percentages are calculated based on statistic parameters. Tests verification was done for the reliability of 95% and 99%. For this presentation tables and graphics were used. Results: Out of the overall group of 149 patients, 119 or 79.9% were patients examined during the time period of 3 years, with different number of abortions. Whereas, 30 patients or 20.27% experienced other (non-malignant) changes, such as: mastitis, cysts, fibroma's, etc. With 3 or more abortions, we had 53 patients (44.5%), with two artificial abortions we had 39 patients (or 32.8%). Finally, with one artificial abortion we had 27 patients (or 22.7%). The predominant age-group was 31-40 years, with three or more abortions, but it is important to stress that young age-group of 21-30 years was also considerably affected. The age-group of 41-50 years was less affected. As per residence-based criterion, we obtained other figures and percentages. In women of age 21-30 years, living in a city, we had a number of 37 patients with 3 or more abortions, in ad¬dition to 28 patients of age-group 31 -40 years with two abortions and 19 patients with one abortion, belonging to the age-group of 41¬50 years. Women residing in the villages had less abortions per age-group; there were 15 patients belonging to the age-group of 21 -30 years, who had 3 or more artificial abortions, whereas 11 patients of the age-group 31-40 years had two abortions, and within the age- group of 41 -50 years, we had 8 patients with one abortion. As a result, the criterion based on place of residence-a city or village halves the number of patients, in favor of the city, as a place of residence. Sequentially, the number of 20 cases or 37.7% belonging to the age- group of 21-30 years, having three abortions, is statistically very large. The age-group of 31-40 years corresponds to the number of 27 cases or 50.9% of cases with two abortions. The age-group of 41 -50 years or 11.3% had 6 cases with 3 or more abortions. The age- group of 21-30 years or 38.7% with 3, two and one abortion corresponded to the number of 46 cases. There were 53 cases or 44.5% belonging to the age-group of 31 -40 years. In addition, there were 53 patients or 44.5% with three abortions, belonging to all age-groups.

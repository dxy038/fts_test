Moving object segmentation directly from compressed video stream is a challenging task in video signal processing community. A novel moving object detection algorithm for H.264/AVC stream is presented in this paper. Firstly, a series of operations, including spatial-temporal normalization, bidirectional accumulation, median filtering and thresholding magnitudes, are conducted on the raw motion vector (MV) field so as to gain a robust MV field, which can indicate the moving region reliably. Then global motion compensation in compressed domain is implemented if there exist global motion caused by camera. Finally, the macroblock coded mode with variable size is combined with the temporal information to locate the foreground object. Its effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated in our experimental results. The main advantage of the algorithm lies in its robustness and real-time performance.

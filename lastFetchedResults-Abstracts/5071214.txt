This paper presents a video super resolution algorithm to enhance definition for a low resolution video sequence within a mixed spatial-temporal resolution stereo video. Two different views of the same scene with large overlapped area are captured by two cameras: one is low-resolution high-speed camera, whilst the other is high-resolution low-speed camera. First, the low resolution frames are spatially super-resolved by compensating new high-frequency information followed by stereo matching. Then the remainder frames of the low resolution video are super resolved via bidirectional overlapped block motion compensation using adjacent high resolution frames obtained above. Experimental results demonstrate that both the subjective and objective qualities of the super resolved videos are significantly improved by the proposed algorithm.

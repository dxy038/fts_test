Sustainable operation of sensor nodes powered by limited lifetime batteries is a key challenge. Environmental energy harvesting is an attractive technique to forestall this energy crisis of wireless sensor networks. To realize a self-sustaining wireless sensor node, the objective of this research is to develop a new power management circuit which is supplied with four photovoltaic batteries which harvests energy from environment. One of the photovoltaic batteries was over the encapsulated wireless sensor node and the others were installed the three lateral of the encapsulated wireless sensor node. The design date and experimental results demonstrate that the energy management system can extend the lifetime of sensor network and prove the feasibility of the energy management system.

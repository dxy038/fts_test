This paper´s objective Is to Identify near and far-term underwater/Ice missions for which potential unmanned, untethered submersible (UUS) systems may become prime candidates. Its introduction includes a review of subjects to be considered and the rationale for procedures followed. Overviews of possible UUS systems and their general potential for serving underwater/ice missions are presented. An analysis of anticipated system capabilities, as both enhanced and limited by eliminating tethers, provides the basis for identifying the missions of interest. Concluding comments reflect on the paper´s perspectIve.

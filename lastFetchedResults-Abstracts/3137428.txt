To solve the problem of distributing special resources, such as rescue resources, healthcare resources and military resources etc, a simplex model is proposed based on the item´s saturation of resources and total satisfaction of demanders. The advantages and drawbacks of the simplex model are analyzed, and an improved resource allocation model, called one by one model, is proposed for solving the problem of the special resource allocation, in which the demanders´ satisfaction is taken as the objective function instead of the commonly used economic benefit. It proves that the one by one model is more reliable for the rescue resource allocation than the linear programming model.

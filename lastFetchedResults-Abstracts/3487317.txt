An enhanced genetic algorithm (EGA)-based fuzzy multi-objective approach to solve a network reconfiguration problem in a radial distribution system Is presented. Maximising the fuzzy satisfaction allows the operator to simultaneously consider the multiple objectives of the network reconfiguration to minimise power loss, violation of voltage and current constraints, as well as switching number, while subject to a radial network structure in which all loads must be energised. The optimisation technique of the EGA is then adopted to solve the fuzzy multi-objective problem efficiently. Test results verify the feasibility of applying the proposed method to manipulate the combinatorial optimisation network reconfiguration in distribution systems.

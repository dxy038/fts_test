A new pyrimidine based scaffold has been developed by three-component solid-phase syntheses. The utility of scaffolds was demonstrated by synthesizing libraries of 80 substituted pyrimidines 12(a–p), 13(a–p), 14(a–p), 15(a–p), 16(a–p). Among 80 compounds screened, six compounds, 12i, 13c, 14d, 14e, 14o, and 15d showed in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MABA) at a concentration of 50 and 25 μg/mL

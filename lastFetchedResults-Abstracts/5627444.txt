As a unique natural region unit and the "buffer zone" which connects reservoirs and its peripheral region, the reservoir shore zone not only provides geographical space and resources-environmental supporting conditions for the local socio-economic development, but also plays a "barrier" role in maintaining reservoir ecosystem services function and protecting the environmental security of the reservoir area. Since Three Gorges reservoir begin to impound, the conflict between the reservoir shore resources - environment and local socio-economic development had affected the overall benefit exertion of the reservoir. In order to ensure good ecological environment and sustainable development of resources and socio-economic in a harmonious way, there is an urgent need to establish a reservoir shore zone ecological protective screen to reduce pollution and block substances into reservoir water body of Three Gorges reservoir. Based on the experiences summary about the ecological protective screen construction of rivers and reservoirs at domestic and foreign, this paper took the bearing capacity of water and soil resources and water environment bearing capacity of the reservoir area as constraint condition, took the water environment and water ecosystem protection of reservoir area as the target, and took multi-objective system optimizing as analysis means. In view of the Three Gorges reservoir area and complex natural features of the shore zone, we took typical regional as the research workspace, and the potential parameters of the ecological screen can be obtained and gradually extended to the entire reservoir area. In addition, the dividing principles and methods, comprehensive development and utilization pattern, protection measures and policy safeguard of ecological protective screen for the reservoir shore area were also proposed.

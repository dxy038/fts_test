BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The defensive role of saliva is mainly played via immunoglobulins. Periodontal infections are the most common diseases in oral cavity and therefore defensive function of saliva against these infections are important. With regard to the effects of systemic diseases on defensive function of saliva, the objective of this study was to survey the relationship between gingivitis and salivary immunoglobulins in patients with thalassemia major.
METHODS: This study was done on 55 children (between 5-12 years old) with thalassemia major who referred to thalassemia centre of Amirkola children hospital. Of these, 30 cases with gingivitis and 25 without gingivitis were chosen as case and control groups, respectively. Questionnaires were prepared and then evaluation of gingiva condition was done. Saliva samples were taken and examined by ELISA.
FINDINGS: There was no a significant difference between the rate of IgA, IgG and IgM in two groups. Also, there was not relationship between severity of gingivitis and the rate of salivary immunoglobulins.
CONCLUSION: T- cells affect on the activity of B cells. With regard to reduction of activity of T-cells lymphocyte (CD4) in thalassemia and the effect of these cells on promotion of B- lymphocyte function, B- cells can not response to gingivitis by synthesis of immunoglobulins.

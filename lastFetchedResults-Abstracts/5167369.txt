In mobile grid environment, intermittent connectivity of mobile device brings large challenge for schedule. Based on distributed schedule model, the problem of task schedule in mobile grid is formulated. MGRR algorithm is presented for scheduling independent tasks with same length onto mobile grid with dynamic performance resources. Making use of re-scheduling and replication, the proposed algorithm does not use any prediction information on the performance of resources and adapts to intermittent connectivity of mobile resource. The MGRR algorithmÂ´s objective function is total processor cycle consumption, which is the total number of instructions consumed for a application during schedule. At last the performance of MGRR is analyzed and the simulation result is given.

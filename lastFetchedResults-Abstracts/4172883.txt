Virtual-reality (VR) technology is a powerful tool for analyzing simulation results in really 3-D VR space. Although it was difficult so far to visualize simultaneously the objects created by the different multiple software in one VR world, it becomes easy to do it by the new software. By using it, plasma simulation results can be visualized in the experimental device with the objective description so that we can grasp the relation between the plasma and the objects in the device three dimensionally just as if we were in the really experimental device. An image of plasma simulation results in the vessel device in VR space is presented.

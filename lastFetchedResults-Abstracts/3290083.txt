Package-board co-design plays a crucial role in determining the performance of high-speed systems. Although there exist several commercial solutions for electromagnetic analysis and verification, lack of Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for SI aware design and synthesis lead to longer design cycles and non-optimal package-board interconnect geometries. In this work, the functional similarities between package-board design and radio-frequency (RF) imaging are explored. Consequently, qualitative methods common to the imaging community, like Tikhonov Regularization (TR) and Landweber method are applied to solve multi-objective, multi-variable package design problems. In addition, a new hierarchical iterative piecewise linear algorithm is developed as a wrapper over LBP for an efficient solution in the design space.

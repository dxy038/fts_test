In cognitive radio network, secondary users (without license) are allowed to access the licensed spectrum if primary users (having license) are not present. A serious threat in physical layer of this network is that a malicious secondary user exploiting the spectrum access etiquette by mimicking the spectral characteristics of a primary user known as Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA). The main objective of this paper is to eliminate the PUE attack that may arise from one of the secondary users. We propose our Intense Explore algorithm to eliminate the PUE attack in a proactive way. Our simulation results proved that our proposed Intense Explore algorithm yields better results than existing techniques.

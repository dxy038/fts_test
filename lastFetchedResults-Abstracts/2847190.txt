Optical navigation technology is widely used in precision guidance for autonomous landing and obstacle avoidance. According to the requirements of the computer vision landing location system on a planetary lander, this paper mainly studies the image feature matching algorithm in the process of autonomous navigation during landing on asteroids. A matching algorithm based on local feature regions was proposed, which takes the invariant moment and mutual information as similarty measures in the two phases of feature matching, and introduces bidirectional matching strategy, to improve matching accuracy. In order to solve the problems of the feature matching for zoom image, this paper put forward an improved SIFT algorithm, the experimental results showed that this method can not only match feature points effectively for zoom image, but also achieve high matching accuracy and is qualified for engineering application.

Existing study on grey target decision-making methods mainly for the cases when the decision-making information is real numbers or grey interval numbers. In the case when the decision-making information is three-parameter interval grey numbers, existing grey target decision-making methods can no longer solve such problems. So, based on the characteristics of three-parameter interval grey numbers and the advantages of grey target, multi-objective grey-target decision-making methods under the information of three-parameter interval grey numbers are developed in this paper. A distance between three-parameter interval grey numbers is defined. The underling decision-making problem is considered in two cases: when the grey target weight is known or when it is unknown. The methods of weighted bull´s eye distance of three-parameter interval grey numbers, the methods of deviation from the bull´s-eye degree and the methods of square distance are given, as well as the algorithm for each method. An example is also presented to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the methods obtained.

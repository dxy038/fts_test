A new motion compensated deinterlacing method using forward and backward motion estimation is proposed in this paper. Bi-directional motion estimation is performed using two previous and two subsequent fields. The motion estimator uses pre-filtering prior to motion estimation for the current and the subsequent two fields. The motion estimator finds a single optimal matching block in the same or opposite parity reference fields. Motion compensation is done according to the amount of vertical motion within the reference fields to achieve the highest vertical resolution improvement. A novel technique to prevent the appearance of visual artifacts in the presence of fast-moving objects is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the conventional deinterlacing methods, based on objective and subjective criteria.

This paper addresses a quality function deployment (QFD) methodology for understanding and integrating user quality factor requirements into system design. A modified analytic hierarchy process is used to determine the relative importance of each requirement. The main objective of this methodology is to convert each user quality factor requirement into design specifications expressed in producers language. This paper establishes the process and uses a simple well understood problem to test the functionality of the process. A kitchen is used as a hypothetical system to illustrate key steps involved in the QFD process for translating user quality factor requirements into final design specifications

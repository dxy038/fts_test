BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth common cancer in Iran with different geographical patterns.The purpose of this study was to examine recent trends in incidence and epidemiologic & clinical aspects of this cancer among survivors in Babol County.
METHODS: In order to assess the incidence trend, all incident cases of colorectal cancer between 2007 and 2012 recorded by Babol cancer registry were included. Information related to epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of this cancer were collected via interview in 2013 from survivors during the time period of interest.
FINDINGS: A total of 237 patients were recorded during a time period of interest in which only 120 were alive and available in 2013. Age-statndardized incidence rate was 7.7 per 1000000 population in 2007 which has increased to 14.6 in 2012. The mean age of survivors was 58.51 (14.32). More than half of them were residents of urban areas (54%), 46% illiterate. Smoking was reported by 30% , waterpipe 16% and opium 10%. Family history of colorectal cancer was seen in 27(22.5%) persons. About one-third of survivors were less than 50 years old. The average time between the onset of symptoms and the confirmed diagnosis was 10Â± 13.3 months. The most common symptoms were changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, constipation, weight loss, and rectorragia.
CONCLUSION: This study showed an increase in incidence of colorectal cancer in Babol. Education strategies is recommended to increase awareness about warning signs and screening program because of a considerable percentage of young people and a relatively delayed diagnosis time.

Objective. To compare the rates of health counseling provided during primary care visits in two different types of ambulatory care settings.

Methods. Secondary analysis of the 2000 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS).

Results. Of the estimated 722 million adult ambulatory care visits during 2000, 90.8% were made to office-based physician practice settings and 9.2% to hospital-based outpatient departments. Consistent with previous reports, the demographic profile of patients who seek primary care in hospital outpatient departments differs from those seen in office-based practices. Provision of health counseling for exercise [OR = 1.4; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1–1.8], diet (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2–2.3), breast self-exam (OR = 2; 95% CI: 1.1–3.6) and stress management (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1–2.7) during patient visits was more likely to be reported in the office-based practices than in hospital outpatient clinics. The visit-based rates of health counseling for HIV/STD prevention, tobacco use, mental health or injury prevention were low in both settings.

Conclusions. There is opportunity to improve rates of preventive counseling in primary care settings and to reduce disparities that exist. Identifying the reasons for these disparities and effective interventions will be important steps in providing equitable care in the area of preventive health counseling.

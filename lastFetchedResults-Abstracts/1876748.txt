Background
ts who undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery often rely on spouses for care during recovery. Although often meaningful, caregiving may be stressful and affect spousesâ€™ ability to provide care to the patient.
ives
rpose of this study was to compare burden and caregiving outcomes across three groups of spouses. Spouse groups varied by the interval of time between surgery and follow-up, which may have been 3, 6, or 12 months.
s
ross-sectional comparative study recruited a convenience sample of 166 spouses on the basis of a power analysis. A total of 166 spouses completed caregiver surveys on burden and other caregiving outcomes.
s
 objective, and subjective burden levels were low to moderate. Although no burden differences were found between groups, men had higher total burden but more positive caregiving outcomes. Future outlook and social activities were less positive in the 6-month group. Burden levels were not lower, nor were caregiving outcomes higher, in the 12-month group, suggesting a steady caregiving demand across the first year after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
sion
udinal investigations are needed to understand burden and caregiving outcomes over time and the impact of burden on spousal and patient recovery outcomes.

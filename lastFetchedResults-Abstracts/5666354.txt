Objective: The purpose of the research was to provide agrogeology theoretical basis and practical guidance for agrogeological regionalization and ecological environment benefit for Siraitia grosvenorii. Method: The comprehensive geological research method was adopted which combined the environment survey and sample plot research. Result: The main variety in the growing area was the green-peel Siraitia grosvenorii, which mainly distributed in eight strata like Danzhou Group and Sinian System of middle-upper Proterozoic erathem, Cambrian System and Ordovician System of lower Paleozoic erathem, Devonian system and Lime System of upper Paleozoic erathem, Cretaceous System of Mesozoic erathem. Conclusion: Through investigation on the Siraitia grosvenorii living in the karst landform of northern Guangxi, the results aimed to provide agro-geology theoretical basis and practical guidance for the resource protection, agrogeological regionalization, genuineness study and artificial cultivation of Siraitia grosvenorii.

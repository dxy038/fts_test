Background and Objective: Intra-uterine fetal death (IUFD) is a traumatic event for the family which occurs in about 1% of all pregnancies. Li comparison with other countries this rate is increasing in Iran. Certainly many factors cause IUFD which include intra-uterine infection, lethal malformations, fetal growth retardation and placental abruption. The aim of this case-control study was to determine the risk factors of IUFD among our patients. Subjects and Methods: Li this retrospective case-control study, which used a self-made quesitonaire designed to assess the risk factors associated with maternal or fetal factors for intrauterine deaths. The samples included 953 records (358 cases and 595 controls). The data were collected form patents records in Imam Khomeini hospital during a five year period of 2001-2006. We used a questionnaire which designed for assessement of maternal and fetal factors. The questionnaire was filled by using collected medical records. Results: The estimated rate of IUFD was 4%. We found IUFD was related with older aged mother (P< 0.002), previous IUFD (P< 0.000), with Arab race (P = 0.000), Malformation (P <0.000), fetal weigh (P < 0.022 \ pregnancy complications (P< 0.025 ) and maternal diseases (P< 0.000).
Conclusion: This study shows the rate of IUFD (4%) is increasing in Ahvaz. It is difficult to identify preventable factors of IUFD. However proper prenatal care consultation can facilitate early diagnosis may prevent complications and may reduce the incidence of IUFD. Sci Med J 2010;8(4):437-43

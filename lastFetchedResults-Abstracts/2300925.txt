This study was carried out during 2012â€“2013 at South Pars Gas processing plants, which is located in Assaluyeh city, southern part of Iran. The project involves the sources of wastewater pollutants in oily wastewater process and collects samples for analysis. The parameters that affect the environmental pollution are BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), pH, TSS (Total Suspended Solid), Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) and hydrocarbon which are determined in oily wastewater. The goal of this research is to show source reduction through process modification is a viable technique to minimize process waste. To accomplish this objective some operational and technical suggestions were presented to improve the current process at South Pars Gas processing plant. These recommendations would play a major role in the advancement and optimization of the wastewater treatment process. For wastewater disposal to surface water, Iranian National Standard limitations are applied. Our study demonstrates that COD concentration of effluent streams of API and Induced Gas Floatators (IGF) (oily water treatment sections) is above the standard level and tends to fluctuate. Hence, alternative modification and treatment processes such as biological and advanced oxidation process have been applied for increasing recovery and improving COD removal from wastewater.

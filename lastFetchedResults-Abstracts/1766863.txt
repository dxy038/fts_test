methodological movement that has emerged in response to the 
limitation use of current (qualitative or quantitative) methods. 
In recent years, use of these methods is increasing in most 
fields like health care sciencesand especially in nursing. The 
purpose of this article is to provide researchers learn more 
about mixed methods studies and introduction to current 
typologies that can help researchers in choosing optimum 
mixed methods research design.
Methods:Purposive library search, electronic resources and 
data bases was used to gather information to be organized and 
presented here.
Results:The findings of this study have been presented in the 
form of introducing a mixed methods research, typology and 
tips for choosing the suitable design.
Conclusion:There are various designs of mixed studies. 
Researchers need to be aware of the mixed method typologies 
and factors affecting the choice of a suitable design

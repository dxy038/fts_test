Objective: Maternal mortality is a major public health
problem in low-income countries, such as Bangladesh. Women’s
empowerment in relation to enhanced utilization of delivery care
is underexplored. This study investigates the associations between
women’s economic empowerment and their utilization of maternal
health care services in Bangladesh.
Methods: In total, 4925 women (15–49 years of age) with at least
one child from whole Bangladesh constituted the study sample. Home
delivery without skilled birth attendant and use of institutional delivery
services were the main outcome variables used for the analyses.
Economic empowerment, neighborhood socioeconomic status,
household economic status, and demographic factors were considered
as explanatory variables. The chi square test and unadjusted and
adjusted logistic regression analyses were applied at the collected data.
Results: In the adjusted model, respondent’s and husband’s
education, household economic status, and residency emerged
as important predictors for utilization of delivery care services.
In the unadjusted model, economically empowered working and
microfinanced women displayed more home delivery.
Conclusion: The current study shows that use of delivery care
services is associated with socioeconomic development and can
be enhanced by societies that focus on general issues such as
schooling, economic wellbeing, and gender-based discrimination.

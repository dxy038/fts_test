Objective (s): A population-base study was conducted to measure health literacy among Iranian adult aged 18-65. 
Methods: The Health Literacy for Iranian Adults (HELIA) was used to assess health literacy. The questionnaire contained 33 items on access to health information, reading, understanding, appraisal, and behavioral intention. Each item was rated on a 5-point scale giving a total score ranging from 0 (the worse) to 100 (the best). 
Results: In all 20571 individuals entered into the study. The mean age of participant was 34.92 (SD = 11.80) and 51% were female. The mean year education of participants was 11.96 (SD = 3.79). Overall the mean score for health literacy was 68.32 (SD = 15.16) and that 44% of participants had limited health literacy. Further analysis of the data indicated that health literacy significantly was associated with age and education.
Conclusion: In general the findings suggest that health literacy among Iranian adults was relatively acceptable. However, about half of participants had limited health literacy and this was more evident among vulnerable groups. Indeed planning and implementing educational interventions are recommended to improve health literacy among Iranian adults.

Some novel two-step dispatching rules are proposed for the spraying-drying processes in the painting workshop in this paper. The spraying-drying processes are the bottleneck and in the majority in painting workshop, and its scheduling problem very complicated. The two two-step rules are designed for the spraying-drying processes in the painting workshop considering some specific objective. The relative performance of the existing rules and the proposed rules is discussed for the equipment utilization, the part waiting time and the completion rate. The results of the study indicate that the proposed rules perform better than the existing rules.

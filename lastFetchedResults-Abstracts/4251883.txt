The main objective of this work was to find suitable algorithms to solve strongly nonlinear circuits through the harmonic balance technique. To compare them, two different nonlinear circuits are analyzed: a one-diode mixer equivalent circuit and a cubic nonlinear conductance damped with a resonant circuit. Also analyzed, by means of one of the presented algorithms, is the Van der Pol oscillator with the damping coefficient ranging from 0 to 10

Background
Our study objective was to develop a technique for robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy and to evaluate feasibility of the technology to address the technical limitations of conventional laparoscopy.
Methods

The study design was a case series analysis in a university hospital. Sixteen consecutive patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy and were assessed for outcomes. Robot-assisted hysterectomy technique was refined and is described.
Results

There were no conversions to laparotomy. The mean uterine weight was 131.5 g (range 30 to 327 g). Median operating time was 242 minutes (range 170 to 432). Average estimated blood loss was 96 mL (range 50 to 300 mL). One patient experienced a delayed thermal bowel injury, 2 developed postoperative infections, and 1 developed a vaginal cuff hematoma that was managed expectantly. The median length of hospital stay was 1.5 days.
Conclusions

Robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy is a feasible and promising new technique that may overcome surgical limitations seen with conventional laparoscopy.

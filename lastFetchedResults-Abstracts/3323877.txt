In Delay Tolerant Network (DTN), the available resources like buffer size, bandwidth etc., are limited and easily gets consumed, which results in network congestion and adversely affects the overall network performance, Due to its network characteristics and custody transfer mechanism the standard TCP congestion control mechanism is not suitable for DTN. The congestion control in DTN is the area under the research because as DTN tries to establish a network in an unfavorable environment where network infrastructure is not available and if it succeeds then the high priority messages must not be dropped because it will affect the overall objective of DTN, as some of the application areas are highly sensitive. Some of the congestion control strategies have been discussed, compared after which a CASE routing algorithm is proposed by studying them.

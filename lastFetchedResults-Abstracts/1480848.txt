Our objective was to evaluate the antioxidant capabilities of clover (CH) and wildflower honeys (WH) in delaying lipid oxidation in cooked and reheated ground beef patties stored in refrigerated and frozen states. CH and WH (5%, 10%, or 15% w/w) were each mixed separately into ground beef chuck (18% fat) and formed into 30 g patties mixed with 1% salt (w/w). A control (CON) with no honey and a control with sodium tripolyphosphate (STP; 0.25% w/w) were used for comparison. Patties were cooked to 71 °C, overwrapped with oxygen-permeable PVC film and either stored refrigerated (4 °C) for 12 days or frozen (−18 °C) for 45 days. Cook yield, pH and water activity were measured on day 0. On designated sampling days, patties were reheated to 71 °C. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) were measured spectrophotometrically to assess lipid oxidation. TBARS and LOOH of ready-to-eat (RTE) ground beef patties containing either CH or WH were lower (P &lt; 0.01) than CON patties following storage; however, STP patties had lower TBARS values than honey-containing patties (P &lt; 0.01). WH and CH at 15% were equally effective in suppressing LOOH compared to STP in refrigerated and frozen patties. All honey concentrations improved cook yield, with 10% WH being more effective than STP. Both CH and WH delayed lipid oxidation in RTE ground beef patties stored at 4 °C and −18 °C, with WH decreasing LOOH formation in refrigerated patties as effectively as STP. Honey may be a natural alternative to phosphates to delay lipid oxidation.

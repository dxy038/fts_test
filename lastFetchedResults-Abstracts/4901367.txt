This paper presents a generalized DC voltage regulation strategy, for both symmetric (eta = 1) and asymmetric (eta = 2, 3) multilevel converters used in a static VAR compensator. The objective is to keep regulated the DC links and the reactive power compensation. The strategy is applied to a single phase converter with a combination of staircase and PWM technique. Simulation results on PSIM are presented showing a good performance of proposed control strategy.

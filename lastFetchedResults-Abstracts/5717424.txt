This study is dedicated to accomplish landing posture control of a twin-body system with 2-relative rotation degree of freedom (RDOF) using method of sliding control. The twin-body system is simplified model of a cellular phone with two relative RDOF, the inclination between two bodies and rotation through self-axis. The objective of the research is controlling the landing posture without structural damage. First, the equations governing the dynamics of the twin-body system are established based on the Lagrange-Euler formulation. The damping uncertainty caused by the actuators with bearing would be considered, and the robust controller is designed based on the sliding control and applied to achieve the control object. Finally, the controller performance is validated by MATLAB simulations. The results show that the designed controller is capable of performing lading control, and the relations between dynamics responses and control variables are discussed.

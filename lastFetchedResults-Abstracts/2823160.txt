Search engines have become mandatory part in the usability of information available through Internet. They provide direct support in the growth of the World Wide Web. Today their concern is to give more importance to the precision in the top results suggested to reduce the iterative search of a concept by any user. Our main objective is to improve the efficiency of search results suggested by the search engine in response to a query. The objective is approached by constructing alternate queries for the main query given by the user. It involves the selection of contextually most similar alternate queries through the method proposed here. The coalition of results produced by the main query and the alternate queries could improve the precision in the top pages. We evaluated the proposed method and observed that the proposed method performed well in projection of some of the important links of the search results into the top few pages. Also, it is observed that the precision improved considerably.

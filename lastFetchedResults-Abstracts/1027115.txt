Biomaterials are needed for tissue regeneration applications that provide control of mechanical properties and enhanced toughness compared to conventional bioceramics. New sol–gel hybrids were developed with interpenetrating networks of silica and bis(3-aminopropyl) polyethylene glycol. Covalent coupling between the organic and the inorganic components was used to control mechanical properties of the hybrids. The objective was to synthesise and characterise a bis(3-aminopropyl) polyethylene glycol silica hybrid material with 35 wt% organic and 65 wt% inorganic and covalent coupling between the components. A coupling agent, 3-glycidopropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) was used to form the covalent links. The hypothesis was that the epoxy ring of the GPTMS would react with the polymer, leaving a polymer functionalised with siloxane groups. In a sol of hydrolysed tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) the siloxanes from the GPTMS form –Si–O–Si– bonds between the functionalised polymer and the silica network. Bis(3-aminopropyl) polyethylene glycol contains two terminal amino groups available for the covalent functionalisation with the epoxy group of GPTMS. Hybrids with 35 wt% organic and 65 wt% inorganic with a ratio of GPTMS:PEG of 1:4 were proven to have an excellent balance between strain to failure (10%) and compressive strength (20 MPa). However, the functionalisation of the polymer was followed by liquid NMR as a function of the aging time and temperature and the expected reaction of nucleophilic attack of the epoxy ring by the amino group of the polymer did not happen until the water was removed from the system during drying. Increasing the amount of GPTMS decreased rate of weight loss during immersion in TRIS buffer solution.

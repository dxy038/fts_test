Objectives: A systematic review is a method of evaluating the published and unpublished literature relating to a specific area or topic. The objectives of this paper are to identify and discuss problems encountered in synthesising the available literature; and to make recommendations for the future conduct and reporting of clinical trials that aim to determine the longevity of dental restorations.

Data sources: Studies were identified by a wide search of published and unpublished material in any language using a large number of general and specialist data bases, hand searching of key dental journals and searching of abstracts from conference proceedings.

Study selection: Pre-defined inclusion criteria based on objective outcome measures of restoration longevity and study designs were applied to determine study selection.

Conclusions: A review of the longevity of dental restorations completed recently encountered substantial problems in designing an appropriate protocol to address this issue. The review found that many of the factors reported previously as affecting restoration longevity could not be confirmed using the agreed systematic review protocol that incorporated an objective study design. Further, the multiplicity of study designs, and reporting methods found in the literature made meta-analyses impossible. A proforma is proposed in order to aid the design of future research into the longevity of restorations.

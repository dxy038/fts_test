This paper describes a procedural approach for modelling a technical system for industrial environmental assessments. The approach is formulated as a procedural and conceptual model, denoted PHASETS (PHASEs in the design of a model of a Technical System). The objective of PHASETS is to serve both as a linguistic model for documents describing a technical system, as well as to serve as a guideline when accomplishing or assessing a model of a technical system. The PHASETS approach for information management and data quality control is independent of data format but relies on organisational commitment, for authorisation and for supplying the necessary competence needed to maintain the quality routines. Some applications for PHASETS are described.

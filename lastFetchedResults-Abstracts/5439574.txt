The Computer Numeric Control (CNC) is a technology which aims to generate, parse and execute sequential actions that describes the behavior of the end effector. This article reports the development small sized prototype CNC machine, based on a modular system with the capability of communication through USB. It is also reported the development of the basic electronic devices to run a CNC machine and proposes, as well, a software developed in LabVIEW to establish the communication between the machine and the computer. The main objective of this work is the development of a machine which allows future researches on the process performance, on educational purposes, the demonstration the parts involved on the CNC machine.

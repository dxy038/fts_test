The status and prospects of LiNbO<sub>3</sub> switch arrays are reviewed in view of system requirements. An experimental switching system is described. In this system, the subscriber access has a gross bit rate of 620 Mb/s divided into four 155 Mb/s interface blocks (IBs). In the access switch, the individual IBs can be switched (in optical form) to the digital cross connect (DCC) for private leased lines, to the distributive services switch, to the synchronous transfer mode (STM) services switch, or to the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) services switch. Each IB is bidirectional (not used in distributive services). The potential applications of semiconductor switch arrays are discussed

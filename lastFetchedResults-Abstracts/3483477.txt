Display is the step of the imaging chain in which the image is put into a form viewable by an observer. The objectives of display can be qualitative or quantitative, and each requires different display approaches. For each objective, producing a high-quality result requires facing issues in both the space and intensity dimensions. In the spatial dimension the major choices are of sampling and interpolation. In the intensity dimension the major choices are of sampling, display scales, assignment by the display device of display scale values to display-driving intensities, and contrast enhancement. Concepts and approaches, but not hardware, for each of these choices will be presented.

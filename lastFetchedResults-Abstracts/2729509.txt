Our final objective is the automatic recognition of targets from full-polarimetric bistatic synthetic aperture radar images. To this end, the theories of Huynen and Cameron are generalized to bistatic radar scattering, and their respective characteristic parameters are compared. We have then studied first how to characterize and compare bistatic mechanisms free from physical rotations and second how to build &#8220;coherent&#8221; reference memories. Two algorithms are proposed and tested.

Reallocation of replaced water of the Yellow River is regarded as a complicated problem of multi-area and multi-objective decision-making, which has not only quantitative indexes but also qualitative indexes. Based on assigning the index system of water reallocation, in view of the deficiencies of analytical hierarchy process (AHP), unit systematic theory of the fuzzy sets decision-making can solve this problem effectively. A case study shows that this theory fully takes account of the influence of reallocation of replaced water of the Yellow River on every index and peopleÂ´s experience knowledge. The decision is rational and reliable.

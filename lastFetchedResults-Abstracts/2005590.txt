In this work, we present a suitable methodology to produce magnetically recoverable bioreactors based on enzymes, which are covalently attached on the surface of iron oxide@silica nanoparticles. In order to produce this system, iron oxide clusters with a mean diameter of 68 nm were covered with silica. This strategy yields spherical Î³-Fe2O3@SiO2 cluster@shell nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 200 nm which present magnetic responsiveness and enhanced stability. The surface of these nanoparticles was modified into two steps with the aim to obtain carboxylic functional groups, which were activated to react with the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) that was thus immobilized on the surface of the nanoparticles. The objective of this chemistry at the nanoparticles interface is to produce magnetic-responsive bioreactors. The enzymatic activity was evaluated by using the recoverable bioreactors as part of an amperometric biosensor. These measurements allowed determining the stability, catalytic activity and the amount of enzyme immobilized on the surface of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, the functionalized nanoparticles can be recovered by applying an external magnetic field, which allows them to be employed in chemical processes where the recovery of the biocatalyst is important.

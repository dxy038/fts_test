Objective: Plantar Fasciiti s is the common foot complaint that
outbreaks as a result of an inflammation of plantar fascia . The
purp ose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three
orthoses, silicon heel pad, thermoplastic custom-made arch support
and Tension Night splint, how they reli ved pain in plantar fasciitis ,
Materials & Methods: In this quasi experimental study that was done
on 16 patient s who were referred from Shariati Hospital Orth opedi c
ward to Saba Orthotics & Prosthetics Center ; age , sex, BMI, occupation
and acti vity level were not inclusion criteria, sys temic diseases and also
surgery on foot in past were as exclu sion criteria. The patients were
assigned one by one to three treatment groups who were ready to admit
them. Subject 's pain was assessed for 3 month s, at 2nd
, 6' 10 and 12dl week,
by Numerical Rating Scal e and Verbal Ratin g Scale through phone . Data
were analyze d with ANOVA, Pierson 's and Spearm an' s correl ation
coe fficie nts, Kruskal-Wallis test and Repeated Measurement test.
Results: The coefficient correlation of Numerical sco re pain and rating
score pain were 0.80.The average of morning (P=0.87), evening (P=0.198)
and the worse pain (P=O.J13) befor e entering the study were similar in
three groups. The repeated measurement test defined that all the three
orthoses were effective for the morning, evening and as so for the worse
pain (P<O.OO1).There was not significant difference among the three group s
in decrease of morning (P=0.483), eve ning (P=0.462) and worse pain
(P=0.948).
Conclusion: Taking advantage of the three ortho ses without any treatment
was effective for the Plantar Fasciiti s pain in this study.

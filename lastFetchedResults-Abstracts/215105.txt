Background: Anti-Mullerian hormone is produced by the granulosa cells of preantral and
small antral follicles. The objective of this study was to investigate whether anti-Mullerian hormone
and antral follicle count can be useful in predicting the ovarian reserve and pregnancy outcome in
assisted reproductive technology cycles.
Methods: This prospective study included a total of 60 patients attending an assisted
reproductive technology program. Patients with an oocyte count of .4 were considered good
responders (group A); those with <4 oocytes were considered as poor responders (group B). On
day three of the menstrual cycle, blood sample was taken from each woman for the measurement
of serum levels of FSH, LH, E2, and anti-Mullerian hormone. Thereafter, ovarian ultrasound
scanning was performed to evaluate the number and size of antral follicles.
Results: Parameters such as serum FSH, LH, and E2 levels were not statistically different
between the two groups. Meanwhile, the difference between serum anti-Mullerian hormone levels,
AFC, HCG day follicle counts, and retrieved oocyte counts were statistically significant in the two
groups. The meanپ}SD serum anti-Mullerian hormone level was 34.22پ}13.95 and 12.53پ}9.4 pM/mL in
groups A and B, respectively (P=0.002). The number of chemical pregnancies was seven versus
three in groups A and B, respectively (P=0.014), whereas the number of clinical pregnancies was
six versus two in groups A and B, respectively (P =0.52).
Conclusion: It appears that there is an association between the serum level of anti-Mullerian
hormone in early follicular phase and ovarian reserve. Furthermore, a higher serum level of anti-
Mullerian hormone on day three is associated with chemical pregnancy success.

Reported here are measurement methods developed to time the execution of specified events taking place in a communications controller. Overall objective was to arrive at a well-defined, well-documented model that allowed communication systems engineers the ability to rapidly modify the communications controllerÂ´s software. Data key and frame processing were the specific areas of code that were measured and analyzed. A model was developed to simulate varying levels of additional bus traffic for the purpose of measuring the effects of the additional traffic on performance. A set of procedures was developed that outlines the steps necessary to perform the measurement, which can be used for future performance measurements

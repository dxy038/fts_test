Unstable angina (UA) is now a severe burden on society and family in both industrialized and developing countries, but the traditional related factors can not explain the whole situations. The effect of treatment is very limited. Determination of treatment based on the symptoms and signs in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have certain curative effect. But the objective of the syndrome diagnose is a very urgent and difficult problem in TCM. The aim of this study was to establish characteristic diagnose pattern for UA with Qi-yin deficiency syndrome. Five inflammatory factors were detected on one hundred and twenty-one unstable angina with or without qi-yin deficiency syndrome patients. Then, decision tree were use to establish diagnosis pattern for UA with Qi-yin deficiency syndrome. A pattern, which could distinguish unstable angina with qi-yin deficiency syndrome patients from the none qi-yin deficiency syndrome patients, made by three inflammatory factors was gain. The diagnosis accuracy could reach 78.5%. The obtained patterns are validated by 3-fold cross validation. The decision tree may be a suitable data mining method for the diagnosis pattern discovery.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess impact of foot sensory modulation on inhibition of hypertonicity of the lower limb in children with diplegia spastic cerebral palsy. Materials &Methods: 24 selected children (aged 2.5 to 4.5 years) were randomly assigned to a control and experimental groups. Muscle
tone was assessed using modified Ashworth scale, passive Range of
motion by goniameter (Pedretti), neurodevelopmental level by Bobath scale. All children were pre-post tested in an interval of ten weeks. Results: Significant reduction was observed in hypertonicity of hip extensor (p<0/1) and ankle planter flexor (P<0/05). Significant increase was observed in passive Range of motion of hip flexion (P<0/1), knee extension (P<0/05) and ankle dorsi flexion (P<0/05).
There was found no significant difference of reduction in hypertonicity of knee flexor and improvement neurodevelopmental level. Meaningful relationship was observed between reduction hypertonicity of the hip extensor (P<0/05) and improvement of neurodevelopmental level (P<0/05).
Conclusion: Impact of sensory modulation on children with diplegia spastic cerebral palsy reduces spasticity of lower limb and also extends joints domain of motion.

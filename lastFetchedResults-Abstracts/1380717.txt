Crack propagation in metallic materials produces plastic dissipation when material in front for the crack tip enters the active plastic zone traveling with the tip, and later ends up being part of the residual plastic strain wake. Thus, the macroscopic work required to advance the crack is typically much larger than the work needed in the near tip fracture process. For rate sensitive materials, the amount of plastic dissipation typically depends on the rate at which the material is deformed. A dependency on the crack velocity should therefore be expected. The objective of this paper is to study the macroscopic toughness of crack advance along an interface joining two dissimilar rate dependent materials, characterized by an elastic-viscoplastic material model that approaches the response of a J2-flow material in the rate independent limit. The emphasis here is on the rate sensitivity of the macroscopic fracture toughness under mixed Mode I/II loading. Moreover, special cases of joined similar rate dependent materials, as well as dissimilar materials where one substrate remains either elastic or approaches the rate independent limit is also included. The numerical analysis is carried out using the SSV model [Suo, Z., Shih, C., Varias, A., 1993. A theory for cleavage cracking in the presence of plastic flow. Acta Metall. Mater. 41, 1551â€“1557] embedded in a steady state finite element formulation, here assuming plane strain conditions and small-scale yielding. Results are presented for a wide range of material parameters, including noteworthy observations of a characteristic crack velocity at which the macroscopic toughness becomes independent of the material rate sensitivity. The potential of this phenomenon is elaborated on from a modeling point of view.

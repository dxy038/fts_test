Background
The objective of this study was to test whether baseline echocardiography in newly detected hypertension improves left ventricular mass index and blood pressure control. This is a randomized trial with primary care patients.
Methods
After routine clinical work-up 177 consecutive patients with newly detected hypertension were randomized according to result of their echocardiogram (echo group and control group). Treating physicians were encouraged to prescribe angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy for patients with evidence of hypertensive target organ damage. Mean blood pressure (BP) and echocardiographic left ventricular mass index were measured at baseline and after 6 months of therapy in both groups.
Results
More patients with hypertensive target organ damage were identified in the echo group as compared to the control group (58 of 91 [64%] v 42 of 86 [49%] patients (difference 15%, 95% CI 1%–29%). In the echo group, 41 patients (45%) received angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy as compared to 27 patients (31%) in the control group (difference 14%, 95% CI 0–28%). After 6 months, there were no differences in mean left ventricular mass index, mean diastolic 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, or mean systolic and diastolic office BP between the two groups.
Conclusions
In patients with newly detected hypertension, baseline echocardiography detects more patients with hypertensive target organ damage, but does not lead to a reduction in left ventricular mass index or improved BP control after 6 months of therapy.

<strong>Objective:</strong> To compare the clinical profile and pattern of catatonic symptoms of patients with schizophrenia and mood disorder.<strong><br />Method:</strong> Records of 13,968 patients seen between 1983-1985 and 2003-2005 were reviewed for symptoms of catatonia by resident doctors in psychiatry. Cases in which the diagnosis were schizophrenia or mood disorder were then noted. Socio-demographic and clinical features were described for each diagnosis.<strong><br />Results:</strong> There were a total of 98 cases with catatonia out of the 13,968 case notes reviewed. Schizophrenia accounted for 82.5% and 53.4% in the two periods, while the proportion associated with mood disorders increased from 10% to 20.7%. Male to female ratio was 1.2:1 in schizophrenia and 1:3 in mood disorder. Those with schizophrenia were younger and with an earlier age of onset of symptoms than those with mood disorders.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Catatonia associated with mood disorder was found to be increasing over the years when compared with schizophrenia. Differences were observed in socio-demographic characteristics and number of predominant catatonic symptoms. Having a separate category for catatonia due to the mood disorders in the current diagnostic guidelines (10(th) edition of the International Classification of Diseases and the 4(th) edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) will help in better diagnosis of catatonia.

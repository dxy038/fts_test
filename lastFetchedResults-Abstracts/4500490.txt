Simultaneous power and signal transfer in a wireless/contactless system is an emerging technology for portable electronics. This paper aims at exploring simple and cost effective ways for such applications for a wide range of the portable consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones. Frequency-shift keying (FSK) and amplitude-shift keying (ASK) techniques for an inductive battery charging platform have been successfully implemented for simultaneous power and signal transfer in an 10 W wireless charging system. The proposed techniques provide effective bidirectional communication between the charging platform and the loads and form the basis for load identification and battery monitoring in wireless charging system. Considerations of these methods for compatibility among a wide range of portable products are discussed.

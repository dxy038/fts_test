It is the most effective resource use practices for slurry and slime to be used as fuel for Fluidized bed boiler. The dry desulfurization of sludge Fluidized bed boiler is a large time delay system, and load disturbance of this system changes frequently. In order to achieve stable control of SO<sub>2</sub> emission, and meet environmental requirements, a fuzzy control technology combined with the optimal feed-forward was designed. Combined with field experience, fuzzy controller was designed by fuzzy control technology, and then the integral process was added to achieve non-error track. Based on the objective to minimize disturbance impact, and in order to coordinate the desulfurization control and steam load control, a nonlinear programming problem for solving the optimal feed-forward parameters was established, from which the most excellent feed-forward form can be obtained. Results of 440T/H fluidized bed boiler show that the proposed method has satisfactory control effect. SO<sub>2</sub>concentration can fully meet environmental emissions requirements, and its fluctuation is relatively small.

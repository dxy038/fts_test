To further improve our understanding of trabecular bone mechanical behavior in torsion, our objective was to determine the effects of strain rate, apparent density, and presence of bone marrow on trabecular bone shear material properties. Torsion tests of cylindrical trabecular bone specimens from sheep lumbar vertebrae with and without bone marrow were conducted. The bones with marrow were divided into two groups and tested at shear strain rates of 0.002 and 0.05 s−1 measured at the specimen perimeter. The bones without marrow were divided into three groups and tested at shear strain rates of 0.002, 0.015, and 0.05 s−1. Comparing the results of bones with and without marrow tested at low (0.002 s−1) and high (0.05 s−1) strain rates, presence of bone marrow did not have any significant effect on trabecular bone shear modulus and strength. In specimens without marrow, power relationships were used to define shear strength and modulus as dependent variables in terms of strain rate and apparent density as independent variables. The shear strength was proportional to the apparent density raised to the 1.02 power and to the strain rate raised to the 0.13 power. The shear modulus was proportional to the apparent density raised to the 1.08 power and to the strain rate raised to the 0.07 power. This study provides further insight into the mechanism of bone failure in trauma as well as failure at the interface between bone and implants as it relates to prediction of trabecular bone shear properties

With increasing penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), it is necessary to introduce a two-way interactive mechanism between PHEVs and the power system to improve system reliability and satisfy the PHEV charging requirements. To address these requirements, a bidirectional charging power control method, based on the time series model of PHEV charging, is developed. The control strategy ensures that PHEVs achieve full-charge before the usersÂ´ desired disconnecting time, and allows the spare time during users desired charging horizons to be used to manage PHEV charging power and to respond to the generation capacity shortage signal. Grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control strategies are defined to determine whether PHEVs draw power from the grid or inject power to the grid. Generation system adequacy and PHEV charging behavior are analyzed for various scenarios under this interactive mechanism, and the costs and benefits to vehicle users and utilities are analyzed based on several new generation system adequacy indices. The simulation results illustrate how charging power control can effectively improve generation system adequacy, particularly for higher PHEV penetration and when users are incentivized to extend charging horizons.

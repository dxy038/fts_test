Two series of 2- and 3-[5-(nitroaryl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio, sulfinyl and sulfonyl] propionic acid alkyl esters were synthesized and screened for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The MIC values for the compounds showing more than 90% inhibition were determined. The result of comparison between two groups of data exhibited that among the synthesized derivatives, the compound propyl 3-[5-(5-nitrothiophen-2-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio]propionate was the most active one (MIC = 1.56 μg ml−1).

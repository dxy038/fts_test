The role of a path planning unit within a control scheme is to determine the reference signals using a nominal model of the plant. This work addresses the problem of path planning for a satellite. The classical linear approach is compared to nonlinear flatness approach. It is shown that the integration of nonlinear character of the plant in the path planning module lead to an exact output tracking in the noise-free case and a reduction of output error when disturbances and parameter uncertainties are present. So, the tracking control objective is reduced to disturbance rejections. This work falls within the scope of the so-called flat systems, a subset of nonlinear systems. The methodology is tested on a simplified satellite model provided by Alcatel Space and a comparison is performed with respect to traditional satellite path.

This paper introduces new objective related knowledge driven product feature definition method in order to achieve better human influence on feature definition in model based product engineering. The proposed method utilizes earlier relevant results by the authors in knowledge communication intensive product modeling and it is devoted as a contribution to solution for some actual problems in current product lifecycle management (PLM) systems. The authors analyzed definition of objects, knowledge representations, contextual connections, and product behavior descriptions in industrial PLM systems. They recognized that current PLM systems suffer from the lack of higher level representations in product model and decided development of new representations mainly in product function and quality driven feature definition. Main purposes of the reported work were establishing organized situation and event based active knowledge representation and replacing direct definition of product model features by a new indirect communication between human and product feature generation processes. The proposed method is an organic extension to modeling in current PLM systems. Its main characteristics are improved human interactions, situation and event based knowledge, and multi intent based decisions in contextual feature based product definition.

This paper has been presented in keeping the view of optimal design of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller based on Pattern Search (PS) Optimization algorithm. In order to determine the optimum parameters of the PID controller for an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) system in a 3-ph generator this meta-heuristic algorithm is used. In this paper, the objective function is expressed as a function of Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE), damping ratio, settling time, peak time and the peak value of the amplitude of the wave. The proposed method is found to be better than Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm with objective function as Integral Time Square Error (ITSE). It has been observed that different parameters of the AVR system such as settling time, peak time, rise time, oscillations and overshoot improve drastically. The AVR systemÂ´s results were analyzed by different methods like of transient analysis, root locus analysis and bode analysis. Moreover, the results obtained by the simulation derive that the AVR tuned by Pattern Search algorithm are highly better and robust.

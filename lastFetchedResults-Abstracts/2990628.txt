During the transmission of video, errors can cause the loss of single or multiple macroblocks in MPEG-2 video. Although there are many ways to correct these losses, the use of spatial concealment, which relies on data from surrounding macroblocks in the same frame, is an invaluable scheme. This paper describe a spatial concealment scheme based the Hough transform and image segmentation. The image is initially segmented into bright foreground, dark foreground and background. The Hough transform is used to determine the best direction for filtering or interpolation of the foregrounds. The results show a significant improvement over the use of bidirectional interpolation especially in the area of significant edges and texture. It also improves upon other directional schemes by better isolating and preserving edge features

This paper proposes a new event-based control method for nonlinear SISO systems that are input-output linearizable and have internal dynamics. The main control objective is disturbance rejection while simultaneously reducing the feedback communication effort compared to a continuous control loop. The event-triggered control loop is shown to be ultimately bounded and, moreover, a bound for the deviation between this control loop and the continuous reference system is derived, which depends on the threshold of the event generator. Hence, by appropriately choosing the event threshold the event-based controller can be made to mimic the continuous control with desired accuracy. The novel control approach is evaluated by its application to a continuous stirred tank reactor.

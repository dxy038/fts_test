A filter design method for continuous-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems with time-varying delay is presented in this paper. The design objective is to ensure that the estimation error system is stable and a prescribed level of performance, namely, the induced energy-to-energy gain from the disturbance input to the estimation error signal, is satisfied. The filter synthesis conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problems. The proposed design method is finally validated through a numerical example and the results are compared with a related study.

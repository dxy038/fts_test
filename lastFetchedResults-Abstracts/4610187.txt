Image contrast enhancement methods play a key role in many image processing and vision applications. For surveillance applications, real-time contrast improvement over the whole image is required when videos are taken in poor lighting conditions. It is also necessary to highlight details in shadowed regions without introducing artifacts. In this paper, several state-of-the-art contrast enhancement methods are compared. Image quality is evaluated by means of objective metrics such as intensity contrast and brightness error, and by subjective assessment. Execution time is also measured. Experimental results show that a technique based on histogram modification presents a better trade-off considering both aspects.

This project is about designing a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Elevator. The objective of this project is to develop a security and safety system based on the RFID application. There are two part that will covered in this project which are research about RFID and development of RFID to elevator buttons. Today, the security system for building provided in the market does not implement to elevator controller. Using this system, it can increase the security in the building. This project is suitable to be implemented in hospital. During peak time, this system can limit the undesirable traffic flow by only allow the authorized staff and patient to use the elevator. Each tag have unique serial number that identifies the respective tag user. The RFID system will integrate with the microcontroller and the result will be displayed at the LCD display.

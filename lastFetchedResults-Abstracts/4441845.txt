Vehicle to Grid (V2G) has become a research area of interest in recent years. This project seeks to design a power electronic interface (PEI) for a niche application in the V2G research space. This systemÂ´s objective is to allow a household to receive power from a V2G equipped vehicle in much the same way a backup generator would be used. To facilitate this objective, a novel backstepping controller is developed for the full bridge converter stage of the PEI that tracks a desired output voltage in the presence of both an uncertain load and disturbance. A stability analysis and a circuit level simulation are provided to validate our approach. This proposed system is designed and simulated to provide AC power that meets the IEEE 1547 Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems.

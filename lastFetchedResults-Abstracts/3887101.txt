The objective of this letter is to evaluate the surface radar backscattering models, namely, integral equation model (IEM), Oh, and Dubois, for synthetic aperture radar data in X-band over bare soils. This analysis uses a large database of TerraSAR-X images and in situ measurements (soil moisture &#8220;<i>mv</i>&#8221; and surface roughness &#8220; <i>h</i>_<i>rms</i>&#8221;). OhÂ´s model correctly simulates the radar signal for <i>HH</i> and <i>VV</i> polarizations, whereas the simulations performed with the Dubois model show a poor correlation between TerraSAR-X data and model. The backscattering IEM simulates correctly the backscattering coefficient only for <i>h</i>_<i>rms</i> &lt;; 1.5 cm in using an exponential correlation function and for h_rms &gt;; 1.5 cm in using Gaussian function. However, the results are not satisfactory for the use of IEM in the inversion of TerraSAR-X data. A semiempirical calibration of IEM was done in X-band. Good agreement was found between the TerraSAR-X data and the simulations using the calibrated version of the IEM.

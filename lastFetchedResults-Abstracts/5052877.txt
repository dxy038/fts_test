The 2012 Budget announced by the Prime Minister of Malaysia indicated that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) continue to play an important role in the nation´s economy and are therefore, given sufficient allocation to sustain the various small enterprises. ICT usage has never been more emphasized than now, therefore the objective of this paper is to assess the SME´s use of enterprise information system (EIS) of companies in the Kelantan and Terengganu, Malaysia. The findings from the preliminary study showed that only three out of 20 companies (or 15%) are into full ICT usage. The implication from non-usage of ICT in the globalized world will negatively impact the SMEs ability to compete at both the local and international level, hence, internal management and organizational matters, particularly leadership and resilience must be enhanced, else these SMEs will not succeed in their endeavors.

We consider deterministic dynamic systems with state space representations which are dissipative in the sense of Willems (1972) with respect to several supply rates. This property is of interest in robustness analysis and in multi-objective control. We give conditions under which the convex cone of dissipated supply rates is closed. Furthermore we show convexity and continuity properties of the available storage and required supply as functions of the supply rate

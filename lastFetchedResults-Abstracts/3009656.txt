Our objective was to study the cytocidal and inhibitory effect of energy controllable pulse on ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3. An ovarian cancer cell suspension was treated by electric pulses with different parameters. Inhibitory rate (IR) was assayed by modified colorimetric MTT methods. Growth curves of two test groups and one control group were also measured, and morphological changes were observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Treated SKOV3 cell proliferated more slowly. IR promoted with the enhancement of each pulse parameter. The morphological study showed that ultrastructural changes occurred obviously. Swollen mitochondria, fractured ridges, cytoplasmic vacuoles and membrane holes appeared in most of processed cell, and part of bilayer membrane was ruptured. In conclusion, irreversible electric breakdown occurred in part of treated cells, and an electric pulse with proper intensity could kill cancer cells and inhibit their recovery and growth.

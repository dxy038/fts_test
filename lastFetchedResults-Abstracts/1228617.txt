The main objective of the present work is to describe normal penetration of a deformable projectile into an elastic–plastic target. The force imposed on the projectile by the target is generally a complex function of the strength of the target material, the projectile velocity, its diameter and shape, as well as the instantaneous penetration depth. When this force exceeds a certain critical value the projectile begins to deform. At moderate-to-high values of the impact velocity, the projectile's tip material flows plastically with large deformations causing the formation of a mushroom-like configuration. This process is accompanied by erosion of the projectile material. In the rear (“elastic”) part of the projectile the deformations remain small and the region can be approximated as a rigid body being decelerated by the projectile's yield stress. The general model allows one to predict the penetration depth, the projectile's eroded length and the crater diameter. It has been shown that in the limit of very high impact velocities the present model reduces to the well-known form of the hydrodynamic theory of shaped-charge jets. Also, a simplified asymptotic formula for the crater radius has been derived which includes the effect of the target's yield stress and compares well with experimental data for very high impact velocities.

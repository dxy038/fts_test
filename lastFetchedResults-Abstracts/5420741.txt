The influence of adaptive antenna systems on the radio resource scheduling in cellular communication systems is studied and analyzed. The multi-objective distributed power and rate control algorithm is used as radio resource scheduler (RRS). The minimum variance distortionless response algorithm is used for the antennaÂ´s weights adaptation. The joining procedure between the RRS and the adaptive antenna is explained. Chip level simulations have been performed to evaluate our algorithms. In this paper we show that using smart antenna (in multi-path environment) can fairly increase the performance of the RRS.

The placement of regenerators in optical networks has become an active area of research during the last few years. Given a set of lightpaths in a network <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="G" src="/images/tex/550.gif"/> </formula> and a positive integer <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="d" src="/images/tex/494.gif"/> </formula>, regenerators must be placed in such a way that in any lightpath there are no more than <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="d" src="/images/tex/494.gif"/> </formula> hops without meeting a regenerator. The cost function we consider is given by the total number of regenerators placed at the nodes, which we believe to be a more accurate estimation of the real cost of the network than the number of locations considered in the work of Flammini <etal> (IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw., vol. 19, no. 2, pp. 498&#8211;511, Apr. 2011). Furthermore, in our model we assume that we are given a finite set of <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="p" src="/images/tex/387.gif"/> </formula> possible traffic patterns (each given by a set of lightpaths), and our objective is to place the minimum number of regenerators at the nodes so that each of the traffic patterns is satisfied. While this problem can be easily solved when <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="d=1" src="/images/tex/22114.gif"/> </formula> or <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="p=1" src="/images/tex/22115.gif"/> </formula>, we prove that for any fixed <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="d,p \\geq 2" src="/images/tex/22116.gif"/> </formula>, it does not admit a PTAS, even if <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="G" src="/images/tex/550.gif"/> </formula> has maximum degree at most 3 and the lightpaths have length <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt=" {cal O}(d)" src="/images/tex/22117.gif"/> </formula>. We complement this hardness result with a constant-factor approximation algorithm with ratio <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\ln (d \\cdot p)" src="/images/tex/22118.gif"/> </formula>. We then study the case where <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="G" src="/images/tex/550.gif"/> </formula> is- a path, proving that the problem is polynomial-time solvable for two particular families of instances. Finally, we generalize our model in two natural directions, which allows us to capture the model of Flammini <etal> as a particular case, and we settle some questions that were left open therein.</etal></etal>

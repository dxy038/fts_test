The objective of the article is the numerical analysis of the controllability of an elliptic system with non zero boundary conditions and delays in controls. The main novelty of the article are considering the non zero Dirichlet conditions and making the use of the numerical method of lines. Based on these conditions, we simulated the so called controllability level of the analyzed system for several grid distances, presenting the results on graphs.

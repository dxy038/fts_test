Unlike traditional best-effort packet networks, ATM networks support a wide range of services by providing a specified QoS on each ATM connection. Currently, QoS can be measured with specialized high-speed testing equipment but their complexity and cost prevent them from wide field use. This article describes the INQIRE project approach based on software for enabling common personal computers (with an ATM network interface card) to function as QoS monitoring stations at the edges of an ATM network. The main objective is to develop a low-cost, off-the-shelf alternative to broadband testing equipment. An INQIRE station, consisting of a PC running the INQIRE application, can actively probe any selected connection and collect sample measurements of the QoS. The monitoring approach is intended to be non-intrusive and work with any ATM network without requiring any modifications to existing ATM switch equipment or interruptions to active services

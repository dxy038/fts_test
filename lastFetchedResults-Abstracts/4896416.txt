The paper proposes conducted and radiated noise reduction using circuit balance on double switch converter. The main objective is to analyze common mode noise circuit of the single switch converter and improve by double switch converter. Common mode noise current is generated and flow through the switching impedance and parasitic capacitor to the frame ground and causes common mode noise emission and differential mode noise emission generating. The impedance imbalance of common mode noise circuit of a single switch converter and the impedance balance of a double switch converter, which are compensated with passive balance and switching device balance, are investigated. The experimental results in time domain and spectrum measuring clearly present the achievement of common mode noise reduction method both of conducted emission and radiated emission respectively.

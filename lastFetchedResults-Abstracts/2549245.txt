Objective: Sulfur mustard (SM) is a potent mutagenic agent that targets several organs,
particularly lung tissue. Changes in morphological structure of the airway system are
associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary deficiency following exposure to SM. Although
numerous studies have demonstrated pathological effects of SM on respiratory
organs, unfortunately there is no effective treatment to inhibit further respiratory injuries or
induce repair in these patients. Due to the extensive progress and achievements in stem
cell therapy, we have aimed to evaluate safety and potential efficacy of systemic mesenchymal
stem cell (MSC) administration on a SM-exposed patient with chronic lung injuries.
Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial study, our patient received 100×106 cells
every 20 days for 4 injections over a 2-month period. After each injection we evaluated the
safety, pulmonary function tests (PFT), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Assessment Test (CAT), St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Borg Scale
Dyspnea Assessment (BSDA), and 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT). One-way ANOVA test
was used in this study which was not significant (P > 0.05).
Results: There were no infusion toxicities or serious adverse events caused by MSC administration.
Although there was no significant difference in PFTs, we found a significant
improvement for 6MWT, as well as BSDA, SGRQ, and CAT scores after each injection.
Conclusion: Systemic MSC administration appears to be safe in SM-exposed patients
with moderate to severe injuries and provides a basis for subsequent cell therapy investigations
in other patients with this disorder (Registration Number: IRCT2015110524890N1).

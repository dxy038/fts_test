Background and Objective: Ductus arterisus is a large normally duct that communicate pulmonary artery and disending aorta in fetus. After birth and respiration this duct is normally closed. One of the congenital heart diseases is patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Patency of this duct results in heart failure or endarteritis. Treatment involves both surgical and non-surgical interventions. In this study we evaluate our first non-surgical intervention experiences in Khuzestan. 
Subjects and Methods: Fourteen PDA patients who were diagnosed by echocardiography underwent of transcatheter closure with amplatzer or coil 
Results: Narrowest part of the PDA close to pulmonary artery had a median size of 3.7 mm (range from 1.6- 6.2 mm). All PDA patents with exception of one, complete occlusion was acheived after the procedure. On follow up, that patient had no residual shunt after three months. None of our patients had complications immediately and on follow-up.
Conclusion: Our fist experience showed that PDA occluder by amplatzer or coil is safe and effective and recommended for majority of PDA.

Real-time Computed Tomography Fluoroscopy (CTF) has been during the last decade the medical imaging technique for guidance of surgical tools in percutaneous interventions. However, with CTF the guidance is done in a slice-by-slice basis, whereas other imaging techniques, such as MRI, shows a true volume of the region of interest, despite of a lower quality. The research in CTF is focused towards the development of CT scanners with 2D array of X-ray sensors and novel reconstruction algorithms. A European initiative in this field, called DynCT, is working in the development of that real-time true-volume CTF scanner. Moreover, the objective of DynCT is to develop a novel CT system in fluoroscopy mode that addresses two hot issues in this medical scanning modality: real-time 3D cone-beam reconstruction and organ motion-independent CT reconstruction. Innovative user interface and virtual-reality-based image visualisation devices will be developed to give the surgeon the experience of real immersion in the patientÂ´s body

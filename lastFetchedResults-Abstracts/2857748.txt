Mobile Learning is becoming an essential tool for educators in the ubiquitous learning environment. With estimated 20 to 23 million mobile users in Malaysia, there is an anticipation of rapid growth of M-Learning in education. The main objective of this study is to provide a theoretical framework of playful interaction in mobile learning through lens of theoretical analysis and deductive reasoning approaches. The incorporation of the dimensions from the dimensions of (i) pedagogical, (ii) playfulness and (iii) kansei engineering are adopted from the work of well-known theories from education and human-computer interaction disciplines. The theoretical framework with injection from kansei engineering will be prescribed as a guideline to construct a fun, joyful and quality learning experience. Future work involves empirical verification of the framework with experts and experimental procedure with M-Learning users.

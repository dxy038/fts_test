Introduction : Perinatal death complicated 1.5% of all births. Such loss is often difficult for families to cope with understand, accept, and may provoke self-recrimination and criticism of the physician.
An autopsy can provide an explanation for a loss, often relievies parents and physician, and may reveal a specific disorder for which recurrence risks or strategies for prevention may take place.
Objective : Determining of autopsy findings on stillbirths in Shahid Motahaty hospital of Urmia from October 2001 to September 2002 (A ten months study).
Methods : All of the stillbirths with consent for an autopsy examination were submitted for autopsy. Two pathology residents under supervision of a pathology staff performed autopsies. Results : Seventy- three fetal deaths occurred in ten months of study, consent for an autopsy examination was granted for 31 of them (42%). Abnormalities likely to be the cause of death were identified in 26 of cases (84%). Seventeen subjects (55%) did not have structural anomalies. In 6 cases (19%) autopsy revealed previously unsuspected pathology, that altered parental counseling; and in three cases (10%) no pathologic findings are seen. Fourteen cases (45%) had structural anomalies. Severe macreration was present in 2 cases. Asphyxia and CNS malformations were the most frequent causes of death in this series.
Conclusion : The cause of fetal death was determined by autopsy in 84% of cases in this study. The importance of perinatal routine ultrasound screening and perinatal autopsy is emphasized.

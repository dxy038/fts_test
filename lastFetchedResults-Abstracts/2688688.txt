The utilization of all the available data sources is a permanent objective of state estimation (SE). In this sense, forecasting-aided state estimation (FASE) is an important alternative to conventional state estimation, especially regarding its expeditious data validation scheme, which comprises bad data (BD) smearing effect elimination, block identification, and adequate replacement. Also, with the availability of synchrophasor measurements, there has been a growing interest in building a phasor-aided state estimation (PHASE) process. This paper presents a novel way of processing BD, whose features are similar to those found in the data validation routines of FASE. The proposed PHASE approach has the advantage of leaving the existing SE application software intact, complementing it with an extra estimation module, capable of processing phasor measurements separately and judging whether the measurement set contains anomalies. The results of a proof of concept study performed on the IEEE 14-bus benchmark system demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. Also, PMU-observability issues are addressed and illustrated through simulation studies conducted on the IEEE 118-bus system.

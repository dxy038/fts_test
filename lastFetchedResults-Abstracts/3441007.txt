High-speed intrasatellite networks are needed to interconnect units such as synthetic aperture radars, high-resolution cameras, and fast image-compression processors that produce data beyond gigabits per second. We have developed a fiber-optic link, named SpaceFibre, which operates up to 3.125 Gb/s and is compatible with the existing SpaceWire network. The link provides symmetrical, bidirectional, full-duplex, and point-to-point communication. It employs 850-nm vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers, radiation-hardened laser-optimized 50/125 mum graded-index fibers, and GaAs p-i-n photo diodes. The transceiver electronics is realized using a multilayer-ceramic-substrate technology that enables the passive alignment of optical fibers to active devices. The SpaceFibre link demonstrator was tested to transfer data at 2.5 Gb/s over 100 m with a bit error rate of less than 1.3middot10<sup>-14</sup>. Fiber-pigtailed modules were stressed with temperature variations from -40degC to +85degC, vibrations up to 30 g, and mechanical shocks up to 3900 g. The test results of 20 modules show that the SpaceFibre link is a promising candidate for the upcoming high-speed intrasatellite networks

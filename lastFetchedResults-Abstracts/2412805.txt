Global mantle tomography can be improved through better use of data and application of more accurate wave propagation methods. However, few techniques have been developed for objective validation and exploration of the resulting tomographic models. We show that cluster analysis can be used to validate and explore the salient features across such models. We present a cluster analysis of a global upper mantle radially anisotropic model SEMum developed using full waveform tomography and the Spectral Element Method. Applied to SEMum down to 350 km depth, the cluster analysis reveals that absolute shear wave velocity (Vs) depth profiles naturally group into families that correspond with known surface tectonics. This allows us to construct a global tectonic regionalization based solely on tomography, without the help of any a priori information. We find that the profiles of stable platforms and shields consistently exhibit a mid-lithospheric low velocity zone (LVZ) between 80 and 130 km depth, while the asthenosphere is found at depths greater than 250 km in both regions. This global intra-continental-lithosphere low velocity zone agrees with recent receiver function studies and regional tomographic studies. Furthermore, we identify an anomalous oceanic region characterized by slow shear wave speeds at depths below 150 km. Hotspots are found preferentially in the vicinity of this anomalous region. In the Pacific Ocean, where plate velocities are largest, these regions have elongated shapes that align with absolute plate motion, suggesting a relationship between the location of hotspots and small-scale convection in the oceanic upper mantle.

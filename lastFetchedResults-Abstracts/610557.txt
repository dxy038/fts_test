Form U.S. perspective, the Arab, Middle East and North African countries currently dealing with internal political-social unrests each have their own special dynamics and complexities and therefore they will have different impact on the U.S. policies and its long-term interests in the Middle East. From this point of view, recent developments can specifically overshadow the U.S. policies on implementing political-economic reforms in the region, the U.S. approach to Palestinian-Israeli dispute, energy security and its strategy for struggling against terrorism in the Middle East. This article tries to highlight the relation between the U.S. policies in the Middle East and recent developments in the Arab countries. The main hypothesis of this article centers around the unilateral role the U.S. has been playing during the last two decades in shaping developments in the Middle East. It states that this role has been transformed into a bidirectional relation and this transformation is believed to be the direct result of the participation of people in Arab countries in the domestic political scene. Finally, itâ€™s worth mentioning that conflicts between society and government in the Middle East is considered a major challenge for Americans in decision-making process and the management of unrests in the region. On the other hand, lack of a specific directive and strategy and application of result-oriented models are among other problems the U.S. is facing in dealing with the Arab revolutions.

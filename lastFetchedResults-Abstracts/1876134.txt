Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if the SF36 general health status survey has the sensitivity to detect physical function impairments before surgery and the expected improvement in health-related quality of life variables after elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Design: A prospective, nonrandomized study design was used. Outcome Measures: The SF36 general health status survey comprises 36 multiple choice questions sorted into 8 categories, or subscales, that describe overall health status. The scores of this survey were used to measure the outcome. Intervention: The SF36 was administered before surgery and at 12-month follow-up. Patients were also queried about the occurrence of angina with normal activities of daily living. Results: Before surgery (n = 81), scores for all SF36 subscales (with the exception of mental health) were lower than published normative data, indicating the disease burden of coronary artery disease. At 12-month follow-up, scores in 6 of 8 subscales improved significantly; general health and role-emotional scores did not change. These changes in SF36 scores at follow-up paralleled a decreased occurrence of angina; before CABG surgery, 75% of patients (61 of 81) had angina; at 12-month follow-up, only 3.7% of patients (3 of 81) had angina. Conclusions: The SF36 can be used effectively to document changes in health-related quality of life variables in patients with coronary artery disease after CABG surgery.

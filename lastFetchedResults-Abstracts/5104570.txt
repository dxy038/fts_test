Quality of service for Voice over IP on wireless links (WiFi) has to be measured by the perceptual speech quality. How can this subjective measures be "captured" by models that rely on objective measures based on transmission delays and packet losses monitoring. These parameters which are common on such links can affect dramatically speech quality. In this paper, The ITU-T legacy e-Model, recently proposed to qualify audio and well adapted to circuit switched networks is adapted for packet switched networks. A new model to automatically quantify or measure the speech quality perception for voice/audio communications over IP. named here "packet-e-Model", adapts the e-Model to packet networks in general with a special emphasis on WiFi.

In this paper, we present an evaluation method of 3D-mesh segmentation algorithms based on a ground-truth corpus. This corpus is composed of a set of 3D-models grouped in different classes (animals, furnitures, etc.) associated with several manual segmentations produced by human observers. We define a measure that quantifies the consistency between two segmentations of a 3D-model, whatever their granularity. Finally, we propose an objective quality score for the automatic evaluation of 3D-mesh segmentation algorithms based on these measures and on the ground-truth corpus. Thus the quality of segmentations obtained by automatic algorithms is evaluated in a quantitative way thanks to the quality score, and on an objective basis thanks to the groundtruth corpus. Our approach is illustrated through the evaluation of two recent 3D-mesh segmentation methods.

N-Hydroxythiosemicarbazide was prepared by two methods starting from 2,4-dimethoxy benzyl amine and hydroxylamine hydrochloride, which in turn was reacted with various aldehydes and ketones to obtain the titled compounds. Eighteen compounds were tested for their in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the agar dilution method. Compound 10p was found to be the most potent compound (MIC: 0.28 Î¼M) and was 2.5 times more active than standard isoniazid.

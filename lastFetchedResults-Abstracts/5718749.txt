This work studies the problem of CMOS operational amplifiers (OpAmps) design optimisation. The synthesis of these amplifiers can be translated into a multiple-objective optimisation task, in which a large number of specifications have to be taken into account, i.e., GBW area, power consumption and others. We introduce and apply the genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation technique to the proposed problem. A novel multi-objective optimisation methodology is embedded in our genetic algorithm and we focus on the synthesis of a standard analog operational amplifier. The proposed methodology is very general, in the sense that it can be applied to digital and analog VLSI design with multiple-objective specifications

This paper proposes a practical problem of optimization of product assembly process in Pinggao Group Co., Ltd. According to customÂ´s demand, it needs to complete the productive task of high voltage switch products in a strict time window. The practical problem is originated form the produce demand. The objective is to minimize the total cost of product assembly process, satisfying the time constraint. In this paper, the practical problem is formulated as an integer programming model. Furthermore, the programming model is improved as a linear integer programming.

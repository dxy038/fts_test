The optimum management of a wind system involves capturing a maximum energy at a significantly variable wind speed. This requires the control of both speed and torque of wind turbine and adapting the generator load to the wind speed. The main objective of this work is determining the RPM corresponding to the maximum energy given by wind turbine. By simulation, is determined the mechanical angular speed at which the energy is maximally, considering a variable wind speed.

Objective of this paper was to discuss the role of intellectual capital (IC) components in a strategy
development. The aim of this paper is to propose an integrated theoretical model that explains, each element
of IC (i.e. human capital, structural capital, relational capital) is influencing the process of strategy
development (i.e. Mission, Vision, and values, Strategic Goals, Strategic Analysis, and Strategy
formulation) independently and differently.
Content analysis method was to used to find a research Gap in the field of strategy Development
(formulation) and competitive advantage, and we have found that in the field of competitive advantage and
strategy the element of Intellectual capital and in particular the components of intellectual capital (Human
capital, Structural capital, Relational capital) their linkages with the strategy formulation in preview of
gaining competitive advantage was missing. Role of each component of IC on Strategy has been discussed by
many researchers and scholars already, the strategy as a source of competitive has also discussed by porter,
paper will be integrating all these thing into a single model and will discuss the role of IC in strategy
development that will lead the organization towards competitive as well as sustainable competitive
advantage.

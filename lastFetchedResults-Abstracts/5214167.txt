The primary objective of the work described is to synthesize a flexible neural styled decision-aiding network capable of supporting competitive players engaged in two-person positional games. The approach is to develop some experimental games, to present a heuristic analysis, and finally to interpret the heuristic as an artificial neural net. A novel control scheme is introduced for deterministic net convergence. Briefly explored are some analogies existing between the network model and natural thought processes, vision processing in the brain, and realization of human-machine interfaces without extensive programming

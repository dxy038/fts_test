Jibbigo is a speech-to-speech translation application for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad devices. Jibbigo allows the user to simply speak a sentence, and it speaks the sentence aloud in the other language, much like a personal human interpreter would. The speech-to-speech translation is bidirectional for a two way dialog between participants.

Objective: Chronic hypoxia exists in many diseases, including cancer. The subject of
our study is analysis of molecular pathways affected in the chronically hypoxic mouse brain.
Materials and Methods: Using the emPAI protocol, we performed a quantitative pro- teomic approach to characterize the global proteome in the mouse brain exposed to 7%
for 48 hours.
Results: Utilizing the emPAI protocol to estimate protein abundance and assign molar concentrations to all proteins, we were able to identify 33 proteins with significant changes in their expression.
Conclusion: Deregulated proteins were mainly involved in cell metabolism, apoptosis, Ca2+  signaling, pentose phosphate pathway, 14-3-3 protein mediated signaling cascades and protein degradation. The obtained data will provide some clues for understanding mechanisms with which cells respond and adapt to chronic hypoxia.

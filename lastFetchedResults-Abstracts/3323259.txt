This article describes the tuning of various digital control structures by means of genetic algorithms with the aim of reducing the vertical acceleration of a high-speed craft in order to decrease Motion Sickness Incidence (MSI). The objective pursued in designing each one of these controllers was to obtain good performance for a craft speed of 40 knots and for sea-state 4. To tune the ship controllers the Simulink model was used. The variable controlled was the vertical acceleration measured in the position of the &#8220;worst passenger&#8221; (WVA), which is also the cost function to be minimized in the genetic algorithm. It is found that these controllers provide a significant vertical acceleration and MSI reduction for the studied case.

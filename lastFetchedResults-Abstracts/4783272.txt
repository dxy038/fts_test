This paper deals with an efficient hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm in accordance with combining the ant colony optimization (ACO) and the simulated annealing (SA), so called ACO-SA. The distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is known as one of the most important control schemes in the distribution networks, which can be affected by distributed generations (DGs) for the multi-objective DFR. In such a case, DGs is used to minimize the real power loss, the deviation of nodes voltage and the number of switching operations. The approach is carried out on a real distribution feeder, where the simulation results show that the proposed evolutionary optimization algorithm is robust and suitable for solving the DFR problem.

Automatic text recognition from natural images receives a growing attention because of potential applications in image retrieval, robotics and intelligent transport system. Camera-based document analysis becomes a real possibility with the increasing resolution and availability of digital cameras. Our research objective is a system that reads the text encountered in natural scenes with the aim to provide assistance to visually impaired persons. In the case of a blind person, finding the text region is the first important problem that must be addressed, because it cannot be assumed that the acquired image contains only characters. In a previous paper (N. Ezaki et al., 2004), we propose four text-detection methods based on connected components. Finding small characters needed significant improvement. This paper describes a new text-detection method geared for small text characters. This method uses FisherÂ´s discriminant rate (FDR) to decide whether an image area should be binarized using local or global thresholds. Fusing the new method with a previous morphology-based one yields improved results. Using a controllable Webcam and a laptop PC, we developed a prototype that works in real time. At first, our system tries to find in the image areas with small characters. Then it zooms into the found areas to retake higher resolution images necessary for character recognition. Going from this proof-of-concept to a complete system requires further research effort.

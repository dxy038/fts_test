This paper presents the optimal design and self-tuning fuzzy PID force control of a new 6-DOF haptic device. The haptic device is designed to select the optimal lengths of links so that requirements of workspace, force transmission ratio and singular configuration are satisfied. These requirements produce a composite global design index as a multi objective function. The indexes of optimal design are described in the discrete domain where the local workspace is approximated by a pyramid. The comparisons of six designs for six different weighting factors indicate the best case of optimal design.

In this paper, a new dynamic clustering approach based on the harmony search algorithm (HS) called DCHS is proposed. In this algorithm, the capability of standard HS is modified to automatically evolve the appropriate number of clusters as well as the locations of cluster centers. By incorporating the concept of variable length in each harmony memory vector, DCHS is able to encode variable numbers of candidate cluster centers at each iteration. The PBMF cluster validity index is used as an objective function to validate the clustering result obtained from each harmony memory vector. The proposed approach has been applied onto well known natural images and experimental results show that DCHS is able to find the appropriate number of clusters and locations of cluster centers. This approach has also been compared with other metaheuristic dynamic clustering techniques and has shown to be very promising.

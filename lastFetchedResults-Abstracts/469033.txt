Objective
In this study, we sought to estimate the black-white gap in early mortality among triplets.
Study design
This was a retrospective cohort study on triplets delivered in the United States from 1995 to 1997. We computed relative risks for early mortality among triplets born to black mothers using the generalized estimating equation framework.
Results
There were 1317 black and 14,364 white triplets analyzed. Black triplets were twice as likely to have neonatal and infant mortality compared with whites (Odds ratio [OR], 2.00, 95% CI, 1.38-2.77; and OR, 2.20, 95% CI, 1.59-3.00, respectively). The widest disparity was observed postneonatally, with black triplets sustaining a level of risk almost 4-fold that of whites (OR, 3.60, 95% CI, 2.10-6.10). Stillbirth and perinatal mortality were comparable for both races.
Conclusion
Black-white disparity for early mortality among triplets was widest postneonatally. This finding bears important clinical and public health implications.

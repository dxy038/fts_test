Factors of suburban highway, such as oversized signalized intersection spacing, complex traffic composition, abundant exits and entrances along the artery, and low traffic demand always undermine the effectiveness of signal coordination. In order to decrease delay and number of stops on suburban highway, on the basis of bidirectional communication between vehicles and infrastructures in VII system, this paper proposes a novel speed guidance strategy according to vehicles´ spatial and temporal trajectories and referred signal timing parameters. A microscopic traffic simulator, VISSIM, is applied to develop simulation architecture for evaluating speed guidance strategy. As a case study, Cao´an Highway in Shanghai is taken as evaluation base for the preliminary assessment of the strategy operation capability and efficiency. The results show that, compared to fixed signal coordination, average delay and number of stops are decreased by about 29%.

Objective
Erbium (Er.) YAG laser may be usable for middle ear surgery because of its ability to ablate bony tissue. We investigated the inner ear damage caused by the fenestration to the inner ear with Er. YAG laser.
Design
We investigated the influence of Er. YAG laser on the inner ear using electrophysiological technique.
Results
Several cases had a decrease in endocochlear potential (EP) and cochlear microphonics (CM) after the fenestration to the inner ear.
Conclusions
Er. YAG laser is safe if it is used for the small and superficial fenestration to the stapes footplate. However, a few extra pulses after fenestration are dangerous.

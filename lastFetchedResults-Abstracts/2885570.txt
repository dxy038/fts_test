This paper considers the spectrum sharing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio network, in which single primary user (PU) coexists with multiple secondary users (SUs). Instead of solving the single-objective optimization prob-lem, we strive to jointly maximizes the number of served SUs and enhances the transmit rate of secondary links with the transmit power and interference temperature constraints. With dynamical signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), the multi-objective optimization problem can be solved via an iterative bisection search approach, which achieves the optimum SINR targets distributively without feasibility checking. Simulation results demonstrates the proposed scheme achieves desirable transmits rate and power efficiency with intelligently-selected maximum number of SUs.

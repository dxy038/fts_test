In this work, we proposes a two-tier binning scheme. First, we develop a Fountain coding with side information to construct the inner binning structure. Second, for the the outer binning, we model the WZ video coding architecture as a multi-access channel and exploit the duality property between the WZ coding and channel coding techniques. Third, we provide both the primal and dual solutions. For the primal distortion minimization problem, we use dynamic programming approach to find the optimal binning policy, and for the dual capacity maximization problem, we give a near sum-capacity binning algorithm. The objective is to lower the coding rate under same video reconstruction quality.

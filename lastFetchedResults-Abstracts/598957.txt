Problem statement: MPLS is a highly scalable, protocol agnostic and data-carrying mechanism. Traffic engineering is the major research area in MPLS due to the emerging requirements of MPLS and the internet usage. A major objective of traffic engineering is to minimize or eliminate high-loss situations. Another goal of traffic engineering is to balance the Quality of Service (QoS) against the cost of operating and maintaining the network. Approach: This study proposes a hybrid model for effective traffic management in the MPLS network which contains two models namely traffic flow analysis model and ant colony optimization based routing model. The traffic analysis model will analyses the traffic pattern and identifies the low load path. And the ACO is used for effective transmission in the low load path. Results: The proposed HTM provides lesser packet loss and less response time than existing routing protocol. Conclusion: This hybrid model enables traffic free environment in the congested MPLS network. The routing packet size of the proposed HTM is higher than ACO but comparing existing traditional routing protocol like OSPF and RIP, the packet size is very less.

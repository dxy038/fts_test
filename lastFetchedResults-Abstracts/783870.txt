Objective It is often assumed that individual stigmatizing
attitudes toward the mentally ill are linked to stigmatizing
attitudes in the social milieu and that both, individual and
social stigmatizing attitudes are major barriers to mental
health treatment seeking. This study aims to examine these
assumptions.
Method Data from the 2005â€“2006 Eurobarometer general
population survey (N = 29,248) are used to examine the
association of social stigmatizing attitudes assessed in a
random half of the sample with individual stigmatizing
attitudes assessed in the other half of the sample, and to
examine the association of both individual and social
stigmatizing attitudes with willingness to seek professional
help.
Results Social stigmatizing attitudes are specifically and
strongly associated with individual stigmatizing attitudes.
Both social and individual stigmatizing attitudes are associated
with willingness to seek professional help. Believing
the mentally ill to be dangerous or not likely to recover, or
living in a community with such beliefs, are associated
with increased willingness to seek help; whereas, believing
the mentally ill to be unpredictable or blameworthy for
their illness, or living in a community with strong beliefs in
blameworthiness of the mentally ill, are associated with
decreased willingness to seek professional help.
Conclusion The view that all stigmatizing attitudes
toward mental illness are associated with reluctance to seek
professional help may be naive as some stigmatizing attitudes
may be associated with increased willingness to seek
help. The complex association of different stigmatizing
attitudes with professional help seeking should be carefully
considered in planning anti-stigma campaigns.

In this paper we consider the no-wait job shop problem with a makespan objective. This problem has usually been addressed by its decomposition into a sequencing and a timetabling problem. Here, first we focus on the timetabling problem and take advantage of the symmetry of the problem in order to suggest a new timetabling procedure. Secondly, we suggest embedding this timetabling into a recent metaheuristic named complete local search with memory.

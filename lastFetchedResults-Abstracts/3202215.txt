The controlled and protected communication between civilian and military computer nodes is the objective of this paper. The release of unclassified military information to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) may improve the safety and effectiveness of their operations. The information exchange must meet several requirements though, related to military tactics, the impartial status of the NGO and international jus in bello. The paper proposes a framework that both protects communication and controls the access to information resources. A prototype based on the framework has been built and was evaluated during the CoNSIS experiment in June 2012.

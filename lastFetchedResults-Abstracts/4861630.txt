Organizations with a presence in the Second Lifereg world typically only provide direct user interaction with staff at specific schedules, or not at all. We present a system that provides organizations with a simple way to enable constant interaction with users of the Second Life world, by simulating staff presence using automated avatars as communication channels to real-life staff by means of instant messaging and short message service technologies. Staff members are assigned to communication with Second Life avatars based on a hierarchy of information desk staffing priorities, and communication is bidirectional.

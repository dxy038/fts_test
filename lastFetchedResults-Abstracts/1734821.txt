The objective of this study was to determine the effects of an oxygen enriched environment on the induction of the metalloprotein metallothionein (MT) and its relation to zinc metabolism in rats supplied with different levels of dietary zinc. Male albino rats were fed purified diets based on maize starch, egg white, saccharose and soybean oil differing in the concentration of zinc (1; 20; 100; 500 mg Zn/kg diet). At a dietary zinc supply of 1 mg/kg, the rats developed a zinc deficiency indicated by visual and biochemical parameters. At the end of the 37-day feeding period, half of the rats were exposed to 100% oxygen for 12 h.

ygen treatment significantly reduced plasma zinc in the zinc supplemented rats and reduced it in tendency in the zinc deficient rats. The MT concentration was increased in the zinc supplemented groups in the liver, kidney and lung. The oxygen treatment elevated the metallothionein concentration in the two high zinc supplemented groups (100 and 500 mg Zn/kg diet) in the liver. The response of the zinc concentration in plasma and of hepatic metallothionein levels to oxygen exposure indicates a role of metallothionein in zinc distribution or interactions with other trace elements to support antioxidant capacity, rather than an impact on direct scavenging activity of free radicals.

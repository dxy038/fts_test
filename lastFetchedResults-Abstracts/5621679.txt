Reverse logistics has become an important entity in the world economy. Nonetheless, many companies are not capable of or are unwilling to enter the reverse logistics market. Such reluctance appears to be attributed to lack of knowledge of reverse logistics. With the emergence of new type of electronic product, it brings a lot of electronic wastes. There are lots of deleterious materials in these wastes, they must be disposed well, and otherwise, they will do great harm to environment. Meanwhile, there is high recyclable and reusable value in these wastes. So the recycling problem of electronic waste has brought the attention of every country in the world. Especially in the field of design of recycling network, some researchers have the recycling problem of electronic waste has brought the attention of every country in the studied in both the theoretical and practical field. Collection and recycling of product returns is gaining interest in business and research worldwide. In this paper, we provide an integrated holistic conceptual framework that combines descriptive framework. We also provide detailed solutions for network configuration and design and the MILP(mixed integer linear programming) model whose objective function is the lowest cost of the network is built. According to the characteristic of the model, the software of Lingo 8.0 is applied to solve the model. Considering the relationship between the scope of electronic waste recycling network and recycling quantities, recycling quantity are calculated.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The testis is a rare site for prostate cancer metastases and is usually found in autopsies or incidentally after therapeutic orchiectomies. The prognosis for such patients is very poor. Bilateral orchiectomies were done for patients. The aim of this report was to introduce one case of testicular metastases from prostate carcinoma.
CASE: The patient was a 75 year old male that has prostatism signs. Primary examination showed the increase of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Biopsy and nuclear scan were requested for patient. Pathology reported multifocal infiltrating prostate adenocarcinoma, also estimated Gleason score of 4+5=9 and vertebral column involvement. The patient was candidate for bilateral orchiectomies and ten sessions of radiation for vertebral column was requested. After pathology feature and immunohistochemical (IHC) study for testis, deposits of carcinoma were posed. Now, symptoms related to bone pain are decreased, and PSA=68 ng/ml change to PSA=6 ng/ml. 
CONCLUSION: Considering the reported case, evaluation in patients with prostate carcinoma by clinical examination, pathology assessment of testis tissue and biomarkers seems to be necessary.

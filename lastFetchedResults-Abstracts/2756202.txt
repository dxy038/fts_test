This paper is part of the EFDAs European goal oriented training program on remote handling (RH) GOT-RH. The program aims to train engineers for activities supporting the ITER project and the long-term fusion program. This paper is written based on the results of a project verification and validation (V&amp;V) of ITER RH system using digital mock-ups (DMUs). The purpose of this project is to study an efficient approach of using DMU for the V&amp;V of the ITER RH system design using a system engineering framework. This paper gives an overview of the current trends in product and simulation lifecycle management (PLM/SLM) in the industry. This paper suggests a design verification process centralized around a collaboration platform. The purpose of this paper aims at improving and formalizing the ITER RH design process together with the V&amp;V process. The objective of the suggested process is to improve the cost efficiency and reliability of ITER RH systems.

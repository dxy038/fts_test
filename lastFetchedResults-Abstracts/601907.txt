Background and Objective: Although endurance training or omega-3 fatty acids consumption have beneficial effects on cardiovascular system, but it seems that their simultaneous use have more benefits. This study investigated the effect of 4-week omega-3 fatty acids supplementation and endurance training on blood lipids and endurance performance of young men.

Materials and Methods: Forty untrained overweight young men with high cholesterol and triglyceride were randomly divided into "omega-3", "endurance training", "omega-3 and endurance training" and "control" groups and participated in a 4-week test. Supplement groups consumed an omega-3 capsules per day. Training groups trained 3 sessions per week and with 65% maximal heart rate for 20 minutes in the first week. Exercise intensity and duration were increased 5 percent and 4 minutes respectively every week. Blood samples were collected before and after the test period and triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL and LDL concentrations were measured. Endurance performance of Subjects was assessed by the Bruce test. 

Results: In the "endurance training" and "omega-3 and endurance training" groups, triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations significantly decreased and maximal oxygen consumption increased. HDL concentrations of "omega-3", "endurance training" and "omega-3 and endurance training" groups significantly increased and LDL concentration of "omega-3 and endurance training" group had a significant decrease.

Conclusion: Endurance training or omega-3 fatty acids consumption improve blood lipids and endurance performance and combined effects of omega-3 consumption and endurance training has apparently the most favorable effect on these variables.

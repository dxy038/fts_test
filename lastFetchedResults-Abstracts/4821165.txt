Fractal image compression is promising both theoretically and practically. The encoding speed of the traditional full search method is a key factor rendering the fractal image compression unsuitable for real-time application. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the comprehensive coverage of the principles and techniques of fractal image compression. In this paper, the novel image quality index (structure similarity, SSIM) and block property classifier employed for the fractal image compression is investigated. Experimental results show that the scheme speeds up the encoder 10 times faster and the visual effect is better in comparison to the full search method.

Ultrawideband (UWB) has drawn the interest among the research and wireless communication communities due to its configurability and adaptability, which enables it to coexist with many concurrent services. There are currently various mobile communication standards in use worldwide. The mobile communication industry is under transition phase and experiencing a shift from single system connectivity to multi-system connectivity. The objective is to communicate over varying distances using varying bit rates with a high-speed data and coverage. One of the challenging blocks to design in such transreceiver is the multi-standard low noise ultrawideband (UWB) RF signal source (VCOs) that can provide seamless connectivity among the various standards considered. The VCOs design approach demonstrated in this work can satisfy the present demand of tuning range and noise performance, and reconfigurable for integration in chip form. The measured phase noise is better than -112 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset over the tuning range (0.5-2 GHz/2-8 GHz), and to our knowledge this is the best phase noise and highest tuning band of operation using N-push topology with discrete components so far reported

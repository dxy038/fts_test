The energy consumption of high-sulfur gas sweetening was significantly higher than conventional gas, in order to save energy, a novel Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) modified process is discussed in this paper. The law of operating conditions' impact on gas sweetening efficiency and economic benefits has been obtained by using process simulation and optimization. The results showed that the maximization of the treated gas yield should be selected as the optimization objective of gas sweetening rather than the minimization of the operating costs. This will enable improvement of the economic efficiency of the gas processing.

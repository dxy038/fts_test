Pollution occurs when the concentration of various chemical or biological constituents exceed a level implying negative impact on amenities, the eco-system, resources and human health. Oil spills are the serious environmental hazards which often exhibit long-term impacts. The main objective of response to an oil spill is to reduce its impact on nature and human health. This paper allows us to get a comprehensive idea of the oil spill impact in the
presence of thermal and concentration buoyancy effects. The governing equations and their associated boundary conditions are first cast into dimensionless form and the resulting equations are then solved analytically using perturbation technique. The effect of various physical parameters such as Grashof number, Prandtl number, Schmidt number and chemical reaction parameter on the velocity, temperature and concentration profile as well as surface skin
friction, heat and coecient of mass transfers are discussed in detail with the help of graphs.

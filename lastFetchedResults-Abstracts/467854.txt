OBJECTIVE: We sought to test the hypothesis that elective delivery of infants diagnosed with macrosomia by ultrasonographic studies in diabetic women will significantly reduce the rate of shoulder dystocia without significantly increasing cesarean section rate. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective study diabetic women with ultrasonographic estimated fetal weight ≥4250 gm underwent elective cesarean section; women with estimated fetal weight ≥90th percentile but <4250 gm underwent induction of labor. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were analyzed and compared for the periods before and after initiation of the protocol. RESULTS: A total of 2604 diabetic patients were included in this study. The rate of shoulder dystocia was significantly lower after instituting the protocol (2.4% vs 1.1%, odds ratio 2.2). The cesarean section rate increased significantly between the two periods (21.7% vs 25.1%, p< 0.04). Ultrasonography correctly identified the presence or absence of macrosomia in 87% of patients. Only 10.6% of diabetic patients at term required intervention under the protocol (6.8% labor induction, 3.8% elective cesarean section). The rate of shoulder dystocia was 7.4% in macrosomic infants delivered vaginally. CONCLUSION: An ultrasonographically estimated weight threshold as an indication for elective delivery in diabetic women reduces the rate of shoulder dystocia without a clinically meaningful increase in cesarean section rate. This practice, in conjunction with an intensified management approach to diabetes, improves the outcome of these high-risk women and their infants. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:922-5.)

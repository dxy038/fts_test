Introduction & Objective: Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) describes a number of disorders attributed to compromise of blood vessels and/or nerves at any of several points between the base of the neck and the axillla. Compromise of brachial plexus causes true (classic) TOS that is very rare.Case: The patient was a 52-year-old man, who came with pain,  weakness and numbness of left forearm and hand. In physical examination there was severe atrophy of thenar, moderate to severe atrophy of other interossei, decreased sensation of medial of forearm and hand. Cervical spine radiographs revealed cervical rib below seventh vertebra. In electrodiagnostic study of left upper limb there were absent compound muscle action potential of median nerve and sensory action potential of 
medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve and prolonged latency of F wave of hypothenar. In EMG there were polyphasicity, decreased recruitment of C8 and
T1 roots innervated muscles.Conclusion: Surgery was recommended for
progression of muscle atrophy and reduction of pain and numbness.

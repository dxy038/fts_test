The objective of this paper is to present a realization of vertical Handover which is applicable for 4G communication networks. The authors have realized vertical handover in four levels. Four different experiments have been conducted in the laboratory corresponding to four levels from basic fundamental level to final complex levels of vertical handover. It is observed that acceptance; lock and track of particular spectrum and rejection of unwanted spectrum are achieved with this set up. It leads to vertical handover in 4G communications.

Mobile and portable nature of MANETs, increased by two fold the popularity of these networks. Wireless channel is used by these networks and such channel is considered highly vulnerable against malicious attacks. It is a cooperation based network that expects each participating node to forward packets to/from the destination. During packet forwarding, valuable packets that belong to any node are on the discretion of another node. A node can act maliciously or selfishly and could harm the packet under transit. Our paper considered two malicious attacks i.e. gray, black hole and two types of selfish behaviors i.e. type-1, type-2. These attacks were simulated with AODV, a famous routing protocol in MANETs. The objective of malicious and selfish behavior node is to disrupt communication and conserve own resources, respectively. Resource conservation by selfish nodes would also ultimately degrade the overall network performance. Simulations result showed an enormous decrease in packet delivery ratio and extensive packet dropping by these malicious and misbehaving nodes. This study could be a valuable asset for those researchers who are working to propose secure routing protocols that can mitigate such malicious or misbehaving attacks.

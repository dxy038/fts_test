A technique is proposed for determining the responses of nonlinear power circuits. The technique involves connecting voltage sources such that the nonlinear circuit is separated into a linear part and a nonlinear part. Alternatively, current sources may be connected in series with the nonlinear elements. The mismatch currents flowing into the voltage sources (or the mismatch voltages across the current sources) are determined. The objective of the proposed technique is to determine the voltage (or current) sources for which the mismatch quantities are zero. The technique is general and can be applied to simulate transient and steady state responses

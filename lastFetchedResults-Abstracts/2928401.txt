In this paper, comprehensive non-linear optimization algorithms for the minimization of global objective functions in image analysis tasks, are investigated. We explore several versions of the approach corresponding to different exploration strategies of the multiresolution structure. The efficiency of this general approach to global optimization in image processing is demonstrated on a highly non-linear MRF motion estimation model. We show, that, associated with a deterministic relaxation algorithm, very significant gains on the convergence speed and on the quality of the final solutions may be obtained

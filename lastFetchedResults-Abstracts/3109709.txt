A number of authors have recently provided results on a generalization of KharitonovÂ´s interval polynomial problem. This more general formulation includes linearly dependent perturbations in the coefficients of a polynomial and the main objective is to provide computationally tractable criteria for robust stability. In this paper, provide robust stability criteria are provided in an even more general setting&#194;&#191;one which also accommodates unmodelled dynamics.

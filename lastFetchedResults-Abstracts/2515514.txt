Tuberculosis remains a major public health problem in developing countries. Diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis can be difficult, as it requires a higher index of suspicion than primary tuberculosis. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis may mimic malignancies and many other diseases, so it should be included in the differential diagnosis. Here, we present a case of extrapulmonary tuberculosis associated with Pott’s disease and hip arthritis in a patient who recovered after 12 months of antituberculosis therapy. A 16-year-old girl presented to the outpatient otolaryngology clinic with painless swelling of the neck, and to the physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic with complaints of hip and low back pain that mimicked spondyloarthropathy. She was eventually referred to the outpatient pediatric clinic. Her acute-phase reactants were high, and hilar lymphadenopathy was evident on chest x-ray. On computerized tomography, a Pott’s abscess involving the T8, T9, and T10 vertebrae was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging of the dorsal vertebrae and hip was performed, and a Pott’s abscess and hip tuberculous arthritis were confirmed. The patient had been exposed to tuberculosis 10 years earlier, and her purified protein derivative (PPD) test was 16 mm. After antituberculosis treatment, our patient recovered and the Pott’s disease and hip tuberculous arthritis regressed. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis may mimic many other diseases, so it should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis. It is essential to diagnose osteoarticular tuberculosis early, as late diagnosis or inadequate treatment may cause permanent disability.

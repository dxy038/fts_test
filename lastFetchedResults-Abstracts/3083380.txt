The optimal control of complex distributed systems is of great significance and of extreme difficulty. This paper presents a novel generalized particle model (GPM) to optimally control the resource allocation and task assignment in complex distributed systems. The GPM approach transforms the optimal control process of complex distributed systems into the kinematics and dynamics of massive particles in a force-field. The conception, dynamics, algorithm and properties of GPM are discussed. The GPM approach has many advantages in terms of the high-scale parallelism, multi-objective optimization, multi-type coordination, multi-degree autonomy, multi-granularity coalition, and the ability to deal complex phenomena in systems

Pathological discontinuous adventitious sounds (DAS) are strongly related with the pulmonary dysfunction. Its clinical use for the interpretation of respiratory malfunction depends on their efficient and objective separation from vesicular sounds (VS). In this paper, an automated approach to the isolation of DAS from VS, based on their nonstationarity, is presented. The proposed scheme uses two fuzzy inference systems (FISs), operating in parallel, to perform the task of adaptive separation, resulting in the orthogonal least squares-based fuzzy filter (OLS-FF). By applying the OLS-FF to fine/coarse crackles and squawks, selected from three lung sound databases, the coherent structure of DAS is revealed and they are efficiently separated from VS. The important time domain DAS features, related to diagnostic information, are preserved and their true location and structural morphology are automatically identified. When compared to previous works, the OLS-FF performs quite similarly, but with significantly lower computational load, resulting in a faster real-time clinical screening of DAS.

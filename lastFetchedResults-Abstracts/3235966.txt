The goal of this paper is to present a comparison among three known metaheuristics: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Simulated Annealing (SA). For the comparison, the design of an LC - Voltage Controlled Oscillator (LC-VCO) is considered, where the minimization of both VCO phase noise and power consumption is envisaged. The objective of this comparison is to find the algorithm yielding the best solution. The validity of the solution obtained with each metaheuristic algorithm is checked against HSPICE/RF simulation results. Robustness checks for each algorithm are presented at the end of this paper.

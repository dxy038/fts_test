Distributed generations that are connected to the network via a converter, employ dq current control method to
control their active and reactive power components in grid-connected mode. In this paper a simple lead-lag
control strategy is proposed for a distributed generation (DG) unit in island mode. When it is connected to the
utility grid, the DG is controlled by a conventional dq-current control strategy for active and reactive power
components. Once the islanding occurs, the dq-current controller is disabled and the proposed controller is used
in order to for control of the DG unit operating with its local load. The problem of tuning of controller
parameters is converted to an optimization problem with a time-domain objective function which is solved by a
genetic algorithm. To achieve a robust performance ITAE criterion is used as objective function. The robustness
of controller is proved by zero-pole diagram and frequency domain analysis. Simulations results under different
operating conditions verify robustness of controller in comparison with a classical d-q based controller. The
results reveal that the proposed control strategy has an excellent capability in achieving good robust
performance and greatly enhances the dynamic stability of the system against load parameter uncertainties.

The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of contamination of the domestic Iranian soft cheese with EPEC serogroupes in southeastern of Iran-Kerman in 2004. Seventy-seven random samples of domestic Iranian soft cheese were collected from different groceries and markets in sterile conditions and cultured in selective media and examined for biochemical tests. Among the samples, E coli was isolated from 76 (98.70%) of them and 15 (19.48%) of the isolates were EPEC. Eight EPEC identified serogroups were included: 026 (I), 086 (II), 0114 (IV), 0142 (IV and I), 0119 (II), O128 (III), and 0127 (II). All these types are pathogenic. Thus, samples are not suitable for consumption in positive cases. 0127 was the most prevalent serogroup followed by 0128 and 0119. The occurrence of a high proportion of E coli in our cheese samples may be due to the lack of proper sanitation and absence of pasteurization of milk used for cheese making. Therefore, stringent hygienic measures must be followed and pasteurization of milk should be imposed to prevent contamination of cheese with coliforms and thus avoid additional outbreaks of food borne illness caused by E coli.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has established a dose quality audit service for radiation processing facilities. The objective of the service is to provide an independent check on the routine dosimetry system in use at the facility. The audit service is based on the use of alanine EPR dosimetry. Generally, alanine dosimeters are irradiated at the facility together with a product, and the response is then analyzed at the IAEA laboratory. Practice of the audit service has shown that the main uncertainty in alanine dosimetry is due to absence of temperature control at the irradiation facilities. Here, a method for stabilizing the temperature of the dosimeter during irradiation is proposed.

This article presents a cognitive radio system built from a wavelet packet multi-carrier modulation MIMO scheme with a VBLAST receiver architecture. The objective is to combine the promise of optimum utilization of radio resources by cognitive radio, the high data throughput without additional bandwidth/power requirements offered by MIMO and the flexibility of wavelets, to develop intelligent wireless systems. Taking the example of effective spectrum utilization, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system through simulation studies.

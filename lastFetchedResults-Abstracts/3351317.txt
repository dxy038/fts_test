Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is an innovative solution for gastrointestinal disease detection. The image quality of WCE is not satisfactory for medical applications since some of them are dark or hazy. For the purpose of improving WCE image quality, we take a new way to establish a parametric image generation model (called WCE hazy model) between the captured image and the ideal image by considering adverse effects due to inhomogeneous lighting, unfocused and light reflection. Some experiments have been carried out to validate this model. Accordingly, the retinex theory and dark-channel prior have been adopted to estimate the model parameters adaptively. Hence, the WCE hazy image restoration is achieved by the inverse process of the hazy model. Intensive experiments have been conducted with hazy WCE images of the testers. Experimental results using the subjective and objective performance measures further verify the effectiveness of proposed method.

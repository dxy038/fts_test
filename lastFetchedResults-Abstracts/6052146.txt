This paper addresses a problem of sweep coverage by a network of self-deployed autonomous vehicles. We propose a decentralized motion coordination algorithm for the vehicles to accomplish the deployment objective of sweep coverage. The control algorithm is developed theoretically using the ideas of nearest neighbor rules, and its effectiveness is illustrated via numerical simulations.

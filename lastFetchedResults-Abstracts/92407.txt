In this paper we consider the one-centre problem on a network when the speeds on links are stochastic rather than deterministic. Given a desirable time to reach customers residing at the nodes, the objective is to find the location for a facility such that the probability that all nodes are reached within this time threshold is maximized. The problem is formulated, analyzed and solved by using multivariate normal probabilities. The procedure is demonstrated on an example problem.

Contiguous-disk bubble devices are an approach to higher bit density through the use of coarse overlay patterns in manipulating small bubbles to relax device lithography requirements. As a first step towards such an objective, a fully processed chip using ion-implanted devices has been tested, showing the feasibility of all required memory functions with 5-&#956;m bubbles and 25-&#956;m period overlay patterns. A critique of permalloy versus implanted contiguous-disk devices is made, pointing out their basic difference in magnetization reversal processes and explaining the superiority of the latter over the former in achieving a good edge affinity of bubbles. The requirements for a good implanted device are reviewed, including the selection of garnet material parameters (K<inf>1</inf>, &#955;<inf>111</inf>), of implantation parameters (ion energy and dosage) and of device pattern geometry (thickness and shape of implanted layer). An understanding of these requirements has made it possible to demonstrate 1-&#956;m bubble propagation in several contiguous-disk type circuits with 4.5-&#956;m periods, yielding an areal density of over 3 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup>bit/in<sup>2</sup>made by conventional photolithography.

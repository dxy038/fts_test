A study was conducted to determine the potential of a two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) for the treatment of a poorly soluble compound, anthracene, by the enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP) from the fungus Bjerkandera sp. BOS55. Silicone oil was used as the immiscible solvent, which contained anthracene at high concentrations. The optimization of the oxidation process was conducted taking into account the factors which may directly affect the MnP catalytic cycle (the concentration of H2O2 and malonic acid) and those that affect the mass transfer of anthracene between the organic and the aqueous phase (solvent and agitation speed). The main objective was carried out in terms of improved efficiency, i.e., maximizing the anthracene oxidized per unit of enzyme used. The TPPB reached nearly complete oxidation of anthracene at a conversion rate of 1.8 mg l−1 h−1 in 56 h, which suggests the application of enzymatic TPPBs for the removal of poorly soluble compounds.

In this paper, we propose a scheme intended for low bit-rate motion-compensated interpolation to improve the quality of low bit-rate video encoded in conjunction with the frame dropping technique. We develop a two-mode interpolation errors concealment (TMIEC) MCI scheme, which exploits the block-based motion vector field available to the decoder and which can work well in both smooth regions and edge regions. Simulation results demonstrate that, with the help of a gradient estimator, TMIEC results in a better subjective quality and objective quality compared to previously proposed schemes.

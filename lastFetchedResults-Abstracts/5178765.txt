The traffic signals in this area were controlled by West Glamorgan County CouncilÂ´s urban traffic control system using fixed time plans which were several years old. Although some additional capacity might be gained from the introduction of new timings, it was assessed that significant additional capacity could only be achieved by introducing SCOOT control to the region. The prime objective of this pilot study was to assess whether selective detection and SCOOT operation could be integrated without modification or development of the traffic signal controller software or the SCOOT system

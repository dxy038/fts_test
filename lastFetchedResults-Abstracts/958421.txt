Laser shock processing (LSP) has been proposed as a competitive alternative technology to classical surface treatments for
improving fatigue, corrosion and wear resistance of metals, and has recently been developed as a practical process amenable to
production engineering.
In the present paper a summary is provided of different experimental results obtained from the most recent LSP experiments
carried out by the authors along with some conclusions for the assessment of LSP technology as a profitable method for the
extension of fatigue life in critical heavy duty components.
In particular, a principle demonstration has been obtained on the capability of frequency doubled Nd:YAG lasers to induce
compressive residual stresses in a highly deformable material as aluminium, although reasonable doubts arise on their capability
to induce these tensions over extended depths (what is really an objective in comparison with other competitive technologies) or
in less deformable materials (i.e. stainless steels).

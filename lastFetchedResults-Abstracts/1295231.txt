This work studies multiobjective optimization (MOP)(MOP) of nonsmooth functions subject to general constraints. We first present definitions and optimality conditions as well as some single-objective formulations of MOP, parameterized with respect to some reference point in the space of objective functions. Next, we propose a new algorithm called MultiMads (multiobjective mesh adaptive direct search) for MOP. MultiMads generates an approximation of the Pareto front by solving a series of single-objective formulations of MOP generated using the NBI (natural boundary intersection) framework. These single-objective problems are solved using the Mads (mesh adaptive direct search) algorithm for constrained nonsmooth optimization. The Pareto front approximation is shown to satisfy some first-order necessary optimality conditions based on the Clarke calculus. MultiMads is then tested on problems from the literature with different Pareto front landscapes and on a styrene production process simulation problem from chemical engineering.

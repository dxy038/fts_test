The aim of this paper is to discuss the problem of the critical path in which the weights of network activity are fuzzy numbers. One kind of the fuzzy network is introduced and the optimization problem of the fuzzy network is discussed. For the uncertainty optimization problems with fuzzy number coefficients in objective functions, from subjective factors and objective factors, the method of the multiobjective looking for critical path is advanced and example is provided at the end to verify the feasibility of this method which combines subjective factors with objective factors.

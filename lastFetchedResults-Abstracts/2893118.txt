Massively Multiuser Online (MMO) Computer Games arguably provide some of the best examples of large groups of users, potentially distributed all across the world, coming together to interact with each other in a single common environment. Depending upon the scenarios presented by the game designers, such user interaction may consist of countless individuals each operating with their own set of priorities and goals. Alternatively, other situations may require the collective collaboration of multiple users, each performing a role in order to achieve a larger overall objective. This paper outlines some initial research for an investigation taking inspiration from some technologies and frameworks used by MMO Computer Games, to create a new global network of distributed Intelligent Environments. This research has been performed as a part of the ongoing Scale Up project, an international collaboration between the University of Essex and King Abdulaziz University, focussing on creating smart hybrid systems to increase the functionality within Intelligent Environments.

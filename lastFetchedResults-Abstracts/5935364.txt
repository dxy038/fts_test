Brushless direct current (BLDC) motor is now widely used for industrial and automotive field since its efficiency is higher than a permanent motors and it has relatively small size. Therefore modelling of BLDC was necessary for its application. The objective of this research was to investigate the performance of BLDC motor modeled by using ANN. The target for this work was to get the maximum power consumption of a BLDC motor. Back propagation algorithm based ANN was then applied in order to achieved the efficiency target. For ANN, torque and angular velocity was set as the input. Power consumption efficiency was set as the output. The ANN model showed good performance with average of error of 0.5 and MSE of 1.5. It was concluded that an accurate prediction can be performed by using ANN.

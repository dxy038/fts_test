The coexistence of ac and dc subgrids in a hybrid microgrid is likely given that modern distributed sources can either be ac or dc. Linking these subgrids is a power converter, whose topology should preferably be not too unconventional. This is to avoid unnecessary compromises to reliability, simplicity, and industry relevance of the converter. The desired operating features of the hybrid microgrid can then be added through this interlinking converter. To demonstrate, an appropriate control scheme is now developed for controlling the interlinking converter. The objective is to keep the hybrid microgrid in autonomous operation with active power proportionally shared among its distributed sources. Power sharing here should depend only on the source ratings and not their placements within the hybrid microgrid. The proposed scheme can also be extended to include energy storage within the interlinking converter, as already proven in simulation and experiment. These findings have not been previously discussed in the literature, where existing schemes are mostly for an ac or a dc microgrid, but not both in coexistence.

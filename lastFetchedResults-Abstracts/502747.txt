Background and Objective: Nursing research plays an outstanding role in the quality of care. One strategy to put the research into practice and change current practice is to identify barriers and then implement tailored interventions to reduce them. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe Registered Nurses perceptions of barriers to utilization of research results at University affiliated and educational hospitals of Zanjan, Iran. 
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study data were collected using the Funkâ€™s Evidence Based Practice Barriers Scale. Sample of the study consisted of 170 graduate nurses employed in Zanjan Educational Hospitals. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to analyze the data.
Results: According to the research results, the first three important barriers were insufficient facilities (65.3%), lack of time to read research results (64.7%), and insufficient time on the job to implement new ideas (62.4%). However, perceptions of barriers to research utilization did not show a significant difference based on demographic variables of the nursing staff. 
Conclusion: It is highly recommended that the Zanjan hospitals education styles should be modified in order to provide the nurses with sufficient facilities and time to read and implement recent research findings.

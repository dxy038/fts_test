The problem of assigning locomotives to trains consists of determining the number of
locomotives of different types that provide sufficient power to pull trains on fixed schedules. The
objective is to minimize the fixed and operational locomotive costs. The locomotive assignment
problem is defined for cyclic and non cyclic problems. In this paper, an approach using a genetic
algorithm and a neural network algorithm is presented to find a cyclic solution on a one-week
horizon, while satisfying the power demands of all trains. This system was tested using realistic data
from the Canadian National (C.N.) North America Company with about 1600 trains and 1300
locomotives.

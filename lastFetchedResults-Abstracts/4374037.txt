The index system of comprehensive evaluation on regulation and storage capacity of an underground reservoir is presented. Furthermore, a multi-objective fuzzy recognition model with cross iteration for multi-layer system is established to assess regulation and storage capacity of an underground reservoir on condition that the index correlation is eliminated. The model can consider qualitative and quantitative indexes, determine the index weights in multi-objective system through subjective preference and iterative weights integrated method. Finally, the fuzzy pattern recognition model proposed is applied to evaluate and optimize regulation and storage capacity of the underground reservoirs in lower Liao river watershed. The case study shows that the new framework and methodology is scientific, reasonable and easy to use in practice

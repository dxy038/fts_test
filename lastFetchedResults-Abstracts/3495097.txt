This paper proposes an incremental multiple-object recognition and localization (IMORL) method. The objective of IMORL is to adaptively learn multiple interesting objects in an image. Unlike the conventional multiple-object learning algorithms, the proposed method can automatically and adaptively learn from continuous video streams over the entire learning life. This kind of incremental learning capability enables the proposed approach to accumulate experience and use such knowledge to benefit future learning and the decision making process. Furthermore, IMORL can effectively handle variations in the number of instances in each data chunk over the learning life. Another important aspect analyzed in this paper is the concept drifting issue. In multiple-object learning scenarios, it is a common phenomenon that new interesting objects may be introduced during the learning life. To handle this situation, IMORL uses an adaptive learning principle to autonomously adjust to such new information. The proposed approach is independent of the base learning models, such as decision tree, neural networks, support vector machines, and others, which provide the flexibility of using this method as a general learning methodology in multiple-object learning scenarios. In this paper, we use a neural network with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure as the base learning model and test the performance of this method in various video stream data sets. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this method.

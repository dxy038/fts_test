Objective.
Neural tube defects (NTDs) affect about seven of every 10,000 deliveries in Texas. To reduce the risk for NTDs, women are encouraged to supplement with 400 mcg folic acid daily during their reproductive years. This study examines folic acid awareness, knowledge, and supplementation practices among women of childbearing age (WCBA), including residents of Texasâ€“Mexico border as well as women of Hispanic origin/ethnicity, populations that have NTD rates up to three times higher than the national average.
Methods.

We conducted a statewide multistage sample telephone survey among Texas women of childbearing age in 2001. In total 1,196 women age 18 to 44 were interviewed.
Results.

About 78% of WCBA knew about folic acid, 28% knew that folic acid prevents birth defects, and 25% knew to take folic acid before pregnancy. The prevalence of daily folic acid supplementation among all women of childbearing age was 33%. Education was the strongest predictor of folic acid awareness followed by race/ethnicity and age. Significant predictors of daily folic acid supplementation were education and ethnicity.
Conclusions.

Our findings suggest the need for more emphases on strategies to improve the level of folic acid supplementation among low educated women, and race ethnic minority populations.

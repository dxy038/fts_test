Functional decline is a major threat to independency, progressing into functional limitations
and eventually leading to disability. chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases, are important
determinants of functional limitations and disability. vascular damage exits long before it is clinically manifest
and can have adverse effects on health, physical and cognitive functioning. the objective was to investigate the
association between non-invasive atherosclerosis measures and physical functioning in older men. Design:
Prospective cohort study. Setting: the study was conducted in the general community. Participants: 195
independently living older men. Measurements: atherosclerosis was measured by intima media thickness
(cIMt) of the common carotid artery using ultrasonography and assessment for presence of atherosclerotic
plaques. Physical functioning was measured by isometric handgrip strength and leg extensor strength using a
hand held dynamometer, lower extremity function using the physical performance score and ability to perform
activities of daily life using the modified Stanford health assessment Questionnaire. Linear regression analysis
was performed to estimate the associations between cIMt or plaques and physical functioning. Results: after
adjustment for confounders, higher baseline cIMt was associated with lower isometric handgrip strength at
follow up (Î²cIMt =-7.21, 95% cI[-13.64;-0.77]). no other associations were found between cIMt and physical
functioning. In addition, no associations were found for the presence of plaques and physical functioning either at
baseline, or at follow-up. Conclusion: atherosclerosis, as measured by higher cIMt, is related to a lower
isometric handgrip strength at follow-up, but no further associations with physical functioning were found in this
longitudinal study among independently living older men.

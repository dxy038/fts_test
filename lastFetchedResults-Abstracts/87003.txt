The in vitro maturation rate of equine oocytes remains low, regardless of culture conditions. Our objective was to determine the reasons for failure of equine oocytes to resume meiosis during in vitro maturation and to ascertain the influence of the estrous cycle stage on meiotic competence. In 10 cyclic mares, 7 ultrasound-guided follicular punctures were performed alternately during the follicular phase (group DF; n = 3 punctures), at the end of the follicular phase (group EF; n = 2), and during the luteal phase (group DL; n = 2). We evaluated the competence of the oocytes for in vitro maturation and measured their maturation-promoting factor activity by histone H1 kinase assay. Puncturing once at the end of the follicular phase and once during the luteal phase, or three times during the follicular phase, yielded about 11 cumulus-oocyte complexes per 22 days. The maturation rate was different between the groups, 51% in group EF, 34% in group DL (p < 0.05), and 15% in group DF (p < 0.01), and it increased with an increase in follicular diameter (p < 0.05). After in vitro culture, the H1 kinase activity was lower in oocytes that remained in germinal vesicle or dense chromatin stages than in oocytes that reached metaphase I or metaphase II (p < 0.05). The H1 kinase activity was not different between oocytes in germinal vesicle stage after in vitro maturation and immature oocytes that were not cultured in vitro, and was higher in preovulatory oocytes that reached metaphase II in vivo than in the oocytes that reached metaphase II after in vitro maturation (p < 0.001). This is the first report on kinase activity in the equine oocyte.

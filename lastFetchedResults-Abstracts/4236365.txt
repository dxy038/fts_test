In this work, combined trading of energy and emissions for coordinated wind and thermal units is considered. The objective is (a) to maximize the expected profits of the owner using coordination as risk mitigation and (b) to minimize emission. A two level mixed integer stochastic programming (SP) is used to handle various uncertainties. Simulation results show the benefits of using a combined bidding strategy for wind and thermal units along with emission reduction.

This paper presents preliminary results of an experimental study that aims to find an objective measure of emotional stress by using physiological variables. Biochemical stress markers, psychometrics tests and physiological signals were recorded during two different session to 40 healthy young adults (17 men and 23 women). The first session seeks to measure stress baseline state of each subject and the state of deep relaxation that is achieved by autogenic techniques. The second session seeks to measure the state of stress generated by a memory test and an arithmetic task, based on the Trier Social Stress Test. Psychometrics tests show an increment of 40% of stress level at the second session in comparison with the first session. Cortisol levels in men have a significant increments. Physiological signal show significant response to stress stimulus applied in the second experimental session. It can be seen that face temperature increases during the session due to vasodilation; meanwhile the hand temperature decreases the effect on vasoconstriction.

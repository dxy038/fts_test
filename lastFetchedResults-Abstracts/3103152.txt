This article provides results of subjective and objective measurements of video quality in HDTV systems. Picture quality in a compressed system can change dynamically based on a combination of data rate, picture complexity, and the encoding algorithm employed. Current HDTV formats, 720p/50, 1080i/25, 1080p/50 compressed with H.264/AVC codec were examined and compared. The original (uncompressed) and compressed test sequences were presented in full-HD display to the viewers who graded picture quality. Our results show that 720p/50 format provides an optimal combination of bit rate reduction and picture quality.

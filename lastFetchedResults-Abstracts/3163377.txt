The hybrid artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm based on mutation operator and simulated annealing algorithm (MAFSA) is studied and improved. The mutation operator was improved and a method for tentative determining of mutation probability was presented in improved MAFSA (IMAFSA). Besides, economic and security objective function is also applied to improve the model of reactive power optimization of distribution network. The result obtained from simulated calculation in real distribution network shows that the IMAFSA applied in reactive power optimization of distribution network is reasonable and feasible.

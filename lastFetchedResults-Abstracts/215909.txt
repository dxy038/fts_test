In this investigation, a novel approach is presented to find the optimum locations and capacity
of Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices in a power system using a fuzzy
multi-objective function. Maximising the fuzzy satisfaction allows the optimization algorithm
to simultaneously consider the multiple objectives of the network to obtain active power loss
reduction; i.e., new FACTS devices cost reduction, robustifying the security margin against
voltage collapse, network loadability enhancement and a voltage deviation reduction of the
power system. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization technique is then implemented to
solve the fuzzy multi-objective problem. Operational and control constraints, as well as load
constraints. are considered for optimum device allocation. Also, an estimated annual load profile
has been utilized in a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) optimization sub-problem to
find the optimum location and capacity of FACTS devices, accurately. A Thyristor Controlled
Series Compensator (TCSC) and a Static Var Compensator (SVC) are utilized as series and
shunt FACTS devices in this study. The Fars regional electric network is selected as a practical
system to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method.

The objective of this study was to establish a standard clinical evaluation tool for assessment by palpation of extrinsic laryngeal muscular tension (ELMT) and investigate the relationship between ELMT and different voice disorder diagnosis categories, particularly muscle misuse dysphonia (MMD), and the presence or absence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER). A palpation technique and tension grading system for four separate muscle groups (suprahyoid, thyrohyoid, cricothyroid, and pharyngolaryngeal) were established. 465 patients, 65% female and 35% male, were assessed sequentially and ELMT results were analyzed in relation to diagnosis and reflux status. A strong relationship was found between thyrohyoid muscle tension and both GER and MMD (p â‰¤ 0.01). Thyrohyoid muscle tension is the only group that demonstrated a significant relationship with MMD. No significant difference in the ELMT scores was found between GER and non-GER patients, although a possible causal relationship was found between MMD type 3 and reflux. It is postulated that palpation of extrinsic laryngeal muscles can yield important information about internal laryngeal postures and diagnosis of muscle misuse voice disorders, particularly MMD type 3 (anteroposterior supraglottic compression). Integration of this technique into routine laryngeal examination can be a significant aid to diagnostic accuracy.

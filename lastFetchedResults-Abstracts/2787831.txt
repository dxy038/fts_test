We develop a novel consensus of hierarchical clusterings. We do this in order to have a framework (including visualization and supporting interpretation) for the parts of the data that are determined to be ultrametric. Furthermore a major objective is to determine locally ultrametric relationships as opposed to non-local ultrametric relationships. This work aims at a major new application, namely quantifying and interpreting vestiges of the subconscious, or what could be arising from subconscious processes, in narrative, through finding emotional content, metaphor and other potential expressions of the subconscious, i.e. of symmetric logic as defined by the psychoanalyst, Matte Blanco.

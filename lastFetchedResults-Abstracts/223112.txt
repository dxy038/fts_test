A key topic in classical control theory is the Internal
Model Principle (IMP). A particular case of the IMP for tracking
periodic references or attenuating periodic disturbances in closedloop
control systems is a technique called repetitive control. This
paper proposes and describes an educational laboratory plant to
show the students the advantages of repetitive controllers in systems
with periodic references or disturbances. The plant has been
designed to be low cost, easy to build, and subject to periodic disturbances
with a clear physical explanation. More specifically, it
consists of a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) electronic amplifier,
a small dc motor, and a magnetic setup that generates a periodic
load torque under constant mechanical speed operation. The control
objective for the closed-loop control system is to regulate the
mechanical speed to a constant value in spite of the periodic load
torque disturbance. In order to accomplish this performance specification,
a detailed design of a digital repetitive controller is presented,
and some basic experimental results are provided to prove
its good behavior. The paper also includes some repetitive control
concepts and facts that teaching experience shows as essential to
understand the design process.

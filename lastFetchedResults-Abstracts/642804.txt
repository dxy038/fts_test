Objective
Hypocaloric diet–induced weight loss produces a coordinated decrease in plasma leptin levels and an increase in plasma ghrelin levels. The aim of the present study was to determine whether subjects who lose significant weight experience changes in circulating ghrelin and leptin levels.
Methods

A population of 66 obese patients was analyzed. Leptin, active ghrelin blood levels, and other cardiovascular risk factors were measured before and after 3 mo of a hypocaloric diet.
Results

Sixty-six patients (17 male, 49 female) gave informed consent and were enrolled in the study. Forty-six patients did not lose 5% of initial weight (group I, weight loss 1.4 ± 2.5 kg) and 20 patients lost weight (>5% of initial weight; group II, weight loss 7.1 ± 2.6 kg). In group I, active ghrelin levels increased (7.40 ± 8 versus 19.40 ± 32 pg/mL, P < 0.05) and leptin levels decreased (102.6 ± 86 versus 89.30 ± 76 ng/mL, P < 0.05). In group II, leptin levels also decreased significantly (69.80 ± 67 versus 53.50 ± 59 ng/mL, P < 0.05). Active ghrelin in this group did not show differences (24.20 ± 41 versus 10.30 ± 12 pg/mL, NS). In the multivariate analysis with a dependent variable (change in active ghrelin levels, pg/ml) in group II adjusted by age and sex, only basal fat mass and basal intake of protein remained in the model. In the multivariate analysis with a dependent variable (change in leptin levels, pg/ml) in group II adjusted by age and sex, only basal fat mass and BMI remained in the model.
Conclusion

Patients with weight loss secondary to a hypocaloric diet did not change active ghrelin levels and decreased leptin levels after treatment.

In the area of optical transmission systems, the RACE Project 1012-BLNT (broadband local network technology) was formed by Plessey, Siemens, Italtel and CSELT. The major objective of BLNT is to develop low cost customer access and switch technologies which are capable of supporting narrowband and broadband services. A method has been proposed by which optoelectronic transceivers for use in a broadband customer access connection could be produced at a cost low enough for major market penetration. The key technologies required for this process have been described, and early results showing appropriate performance in all the key elements, namely lasers, waveguide duplexers and silicon bipolar drivers and receivers, together with packaging aspects, have all been demonstrated. Combination of these elements is now in progress, and results from these activities have been presented, indicating the advanced status of all these technologies

Aiming at the defect of charging list mode of traditional annual charging system, this paper fully studied the characteristic of the algorithm based on directory tree. Combined father-son recursive algorithm with the database, the dynamically generated charging tree could be generated accurately and efficiently, the annual charging system could be also implemented. The application result shown that the method had the characteristic of more definite objective and the humanization, and could efficiently improve the work efficiency and the ability of the system service.

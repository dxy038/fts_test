This paper presents a novel dispatching rule composition method based on analytic hierarchy process for multi objective dynamic scheduling of single machines. By combining different elementary dispatching rules, the proposed method is capable of solving hetero-objective dynamic scheduling problems. Computer simulations were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Dynamic scheduling problems of various multi objective combinations were tested and the results were satisfactory. The features of the proposed method are discussed.

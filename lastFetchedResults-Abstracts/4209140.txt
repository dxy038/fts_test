This paper describes a power conversion system that implements bidirectional power flow between the electric grid and a battery, based on a full bridge inverter associated with a dual active bridge. A method for power flow control based on the agreement between battery pack and low voltage grid requirements has been developed to allow the large penetration of both, electric vehicles (EV) and renewable microgeneration. A laboratory prototype containing all functions required to implement a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power interface has been built. The hardware implementation is reported, including control scheme and high-frequency transformer design details. Converter key waveforms are presented to evaluate the power quality on batteries and grid, as well as its dynamic behavior. An experimental laboratory setup is described and results are shown to demonstrate the technical benefits for low-voltage (LV) microgrids, if electric vehicle charger includes a power flow control based on frequency-voltage droop concept.

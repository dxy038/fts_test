This paper discusses and evaluates the role of shared control approach in a BCI-based telepresence framework. Driving a mobile device by using human brain signals might improve the quality of life of people suffering from severely physical disabilities. By means of a bidirectional audio/video connection to a robot, the BCI user is able to interact actively with relatives and friends located in different rooms. However, the control of robots through an uncertain channel as a BCI may be complicated and exhaustive. Shared control can facilitate the operation of brain-controlled telepresence robots, as demonstrated by the experimental results reported here. In fact, it allows all subjects to complete a rather complex task, driving the robot in a natural environment along a path with several targets and obstacles, in shorter times and with less number of mental commands.

Inter-vehicle communications (IVC) is one of the most important technologies for realizing advanced intelligent transport systems (ITS). We deal with Vehicle-PEdestrian Communications (VPEC) as communication between vehicles and pedestrians. The objective of VPEC is to protect pedestrians from traffic accidents. In VPEC without any controls, pedestrians (p-nodes) transmit many packets to vehicles (v-nodes) to provide the position information of p-nodes. But, the battery capacity of p-nodes is small. It is necessary to suppress the transmission of p-nodes to obtain proper information exchanges. We present effective reflect-transmission schemes which can reduce needless transmissions from p-nodes on VPEC. In addition, we present silent control protocol, mask control protocol and distance-based priority control protocol as more effective protocols for the reflect-transmission scheme. The proposed protocols can operate the reflect-transmission scheme more efficiently. Further, we have carried out a VPEC experiment to verify the control behavior of VPEC. We outline the experiments and show some results obtained.

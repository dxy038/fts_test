This paper reports the initial results of OPNET simulation modeling of DSL Forum TR.59 and WT92 traffic management capabilities required in BRAS to deliver end-to-end IP QoS over an existing DSL access network and emerging architectures. TR.59 extends the role of the BRAS to include congestion management of the access network, provide IP QoS per user downstream and rate limiting upstream. The objective of the simulations and the results reported here is to demonstrate the feasibility of such an extension and to evaluate the efficiency of traffic management mechanisms in enabling the new required capabilities in BRAS.

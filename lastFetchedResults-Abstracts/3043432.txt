When designing very complex control strategy using hybrid technology, one usually faces the challenge of balancing effective realization of multi-control modeling with design simplicity. To better manage this difficulty we have used the agent paradigm as a simple and powerful bridge between asynchronous/distributed computation and Matlab environment. The proposed architecture has been used to design a complex hybrid control environment featuring multi-objective, Fuzzy C-means, and Genetic Algorithm in order to design hybrid control strategies suitable for the energy flows management on board of hybrid electric vehicles.

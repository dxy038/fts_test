As the penetration of distributed generation (DG) increases in distribution power systems, it causes voltage rises and voltage fluctuations in the systems. The DG units can be properly controlled to mitigate these power quality issues. There are several methods of controlling the DG units for achieving acceptable voltage profile. This paper investigates a decentralized control approach to handle voltage regulation problems in the distribution systems. The objective of this paper is to discuss the design of a multi-agent framework for a decentralized voltage control in the distribution systems. We discuss the selection, coordination and interaction of agents required to achieve the desired voltage profile.

Al-Tharthar reservoir together with much smaller Al-Habbaniya reservoir play vital role in securing water supply to agricultural users in a downstream basin of joint Euphrates-Tigris river basin. High dependency of farmers on water provided from the reservoirs causes permanent conflict of interests between short-term objective of the farmers to maximize their agricultural production and long-term goal of the reservoir operator to secure water supply in the future. Operation policy of the reservoir serves on one side as the mechanism to balance these two conflicting objectives, and as a tool to make decisions about water distribution among users. To improve efficiency of the reservoir operation, the research focused on various modifications of the existing operation policy has been undertaken. Since the results of the reservoir operation can be evaluated using 34 criteria, a Multiple Criteria Analysis of Discrete Alternatives tool has been applied to evaluate results of the operation policy modifications. The paper will present details of the research approach and conclusions reached in a course of the study.

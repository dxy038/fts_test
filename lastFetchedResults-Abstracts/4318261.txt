This paper proposes a novel spectrum sharing technique for an existing wireless local area network (LAN) system (primary user) based on IEEE 802.11a, and a new system (secondary user) equipped with the proposed spectrum sharing technique. Both systems are assumed to behave according to carrier sense multiple accesses with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. An objective of spectrum sharing techniques is to achieve higher secondary user´s throughput while the primary user´s throughput is maintained. We utilize one key parameter, the channel occupancy rate (COR), which is the channel usage rate of the primary or secondary system. The proposed spectrum sharing technique is the minimum CW size selection (MCWSS) for secondary users to control the COR of secondary system. We set an alternative objective which is to maximize the COR for secondary system while COR of the primary system is maintained. By computer simulations, we show that by the MCWSS secondary user can maintain the constraint for the primary system and achieve the target COR performance and it leads to the higher secondary user´s throughput performance, while maintaining the primary user´s throughput performance.

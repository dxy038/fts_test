This paper proposes a new isolated three-port bidirectional dc-dc converter for simultaneous power management of multiple energy sources. The proposed converter has the advantage of using the least number of switches and soft switching for the main switch, which is realized by using an inductor-capacitor- inductor (LCL)-resonant circuit. The converter is capable of interfacing sources of different voltage-current characteristics with a load and/or a dc microgrid. The proposed converter is constructed for simultaneous power management of a photovoltaic (PV) panel, a rechargeable battery, and a load. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed converter is capable of maximum power point tracking control for the PV panel, when there is solar radiation, and controlling the charge and discharge of the battery, when there is surplus energy and power deficiency with respect to the load, respectively.

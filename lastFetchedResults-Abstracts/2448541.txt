Several factors have been reported as risk factors for multiple sclerosis (MS); however, the main causes of the disease are still unknown. A geographical area with a low MS incidence is Ahvaz, Iran. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of several demographic characteristics, family history, and birth month with MS in Ahvaz. This was a case-control study including 155 MS cases and 155 controls matched for age, sex, and residential status. The participants were selected randomly, using a systematic method, from the MS patients referred to the MS Society of Khuzestan (Iran). The data collection tool was a standardized questionnaire designed by the authors to assess demographic characteristics. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics including mean, frequency, and standard deviation and inferential statistical tests including ?2, Fisherâ€™s exact test, and logistic regression using SPSS version 19. In both cases and controls, no significant associations were found between Arab ethnicity and incidence of MS, marital status and risk of MS in Ahvaz, or more than 15-year residency in Ahvaz, birth in Khuzestan, and month of birth and the risk of MS (P &gt; 0.05). However, there was a marginally significant association between living from birth to age 15 years in Ahvaz and MS (P = 0.05). Furthermore, there was an association between a family history of MS and the risk of MS in Ahvaz (P = 0.02), which was significant in univariate logistic regression (P = 0.006). The findings suggested that according to the ecological conditions of Ahvaz, a family history of MS may increase the risk of developing MS

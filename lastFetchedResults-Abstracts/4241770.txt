A lot of work have been carried out to find the efficient algorithms for QoS-aware dynamic web service composition. The multi-objective multi-choice problem as an evolutive multi-dimension multi-objective 0-1 knapsack problem (MMKP) can be reduced into the web service composition with multiple QoS constraints, while many approaches based on ant colony optimization (AOC) have been introduced in order for solving MMKP. This paper presents a novel QoS-aware dynamic web service composition optimization algorithm with improved AOC. The essence of the algorithm is that the problem of dynamic web service selection with QoS global optimality is transformed into a multi-objective multi-choice QoS-aware web services composition optimization (an evolutive MMKP), for the final purpose of our algorithm is to achieve Pareto Optimality.

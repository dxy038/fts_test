Since the infrastructures of the Cognitive radio network are more flexible than the conventional network, a novel network structure is required to adapt with such changes. Thus, we develop the joint design between the transport layer and MAC&amp;PHY layer in overlay Cognitive Radio networks.The objective is to achieve the maximum throughput rationally, concerned with the constraint of interference temperature of primary user, as well as with the service request conditions. Specifically, at the transport layer, taken into consideration of real resource supply, flow control schemes are modeled with Markov chains to maintain the stability and efficiency for the service. At the MAC&amp;PHY layer, on one hand, scheduling schemes obtains the greatest throughput with Channel Rearrangement; on the other hand, spectrum sensing schemes broaden the sensing range to search for more spectrum resources to satisfy the traffic load request. Simulation results show better performance on service access compared with conventional isolated design.

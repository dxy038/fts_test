Looking at the literature of Iran’s contemporary architecture, one can observe dissatisfaction with the existing situation in addition to acknowledging lack of identity in the contemporary architecture of Iran. Some scholars believe that the reason for the problem is alienation of architecture and people, and express concerns about the lack of mutual understanding on both sides. Others consider the similarity between different cities of the country as the symptom of a common illness. Nowadays, having a common identity-based architecture is a matter of national concern for the Iranian architecture society. However, almost no theory is available to provide answer for questions such as what is identity, which elements and conditions are involved in its formation and what is the relationship between identity and architecture.
Using comparative method, this study reviews the literature on identity and the procedure of its formation in a culture. Then, the analytical method is applied and four levels of culture –from subjective and abstract levels to objective and concrete ones- are distinguished. These levels are named paradigm, tradition, pattern, and cultural achievements. Furthermore, the role of architectural patterns is accentuated as a means of creating identity. Finally, the relation between architecture and the aforementioned levels as well as the role which can be played by them or is expected from them is discussed.

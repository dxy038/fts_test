The first system to transport native Ethernet data at a serial rate of 10 Gb/s is reported. Up to 8 asynchronous gigabit Ethernet signals are multiplexed to 10 Gb/s and directly modulate a Fabry-Perot laser at 1310 nm for 2-8 km transport over standard single-mode fiber bidirectional full-duplex communication between individual gigabit Ethernet hosts is demonstrated. System operation is entirely based on the physical layer signaling standards for gigabit Ethernet. Solutions to unique Ethernet synchronization and control problems are presented, and novel differences between multiplexed 8b/10b data and pseudorandom bit sequences are shown. Optical link performance and packet loss rates are presented.

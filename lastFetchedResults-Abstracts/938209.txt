The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between blood-lead levels ŽBLL., hematological, liver and
renal indicators among workers in a lead battery factory in Taiwan over a 10-year period. Blood samples were taken
periodically from 30 workers and BLL, HGB Žhemoglobin., RBC Žred blood cells., WBC Žwhite blood cells. and HCT
Žhematocrit. were measured. Levels of GPT Žalanine aminotransferase. and Crea Žcreatinine. in the blood were
assessed to indicate liver and renal function, respectively. The results showed that there was a general decrease in
BLL over the 10-year period Žexcept for 1993.. There was a similar trend for HCT, RBC and Crea. There was no
significant trend for the other health indicators. Four generalized estimating equation ŽGEE. models  correlation
model ŽA., threshold correlation model ŽB., instant change model ŽC. and lag change model ŽD.  were set up to
demonstrate the causal relationship between BLL and the other health indicators. Models A and C showed that BLL
correlated positively with RBC, but negatively with Crea. Model B showed that BLL correlated positively with GPT.
There were no significant correlations of BLL with the other indicators. Models C and D, ŽGEE with logit link
function to analyze the association between changes BLL and the other health indicators. showed that when BLL
increased, RBC and HCT increased, both longitudinally and cross-sectionally. The authors conclude that long-term
exposure to lead stimulates production of RBC and HCT, but the effect on liver and renal function was unclear.

With the rapid development of the globalization of economy, internationalization of S&amp;T and socialization of information, the internationalization of technology innovation which characterized by the research and development (R&amp;D) internationalization has been the new pattern of technology cooperation and innovation for country, region and enterprise, and also has been the source of the sustainable development of the whole economy. At present, Both OECD countries and China are facing increasing economic and statistics challenges at the issue of measuring the R&amp;D internationalization from different level. With detailed and systematic information, this paper attempts to measure and evaluate the R&amp;D internationalization through the establishment of an effective evaluation indication system. Considering the different results from the different evaluation approaches, we will combine the subjective and objective weight methods together for against the casualness and subjectivity in traditional method, followed by a consistency test between these results using the non-parametric statistical methods. In conclusions, some ideas are presented for ways to go further in the development of indicators on R&amp;D internationalization. Finally, we turn to the policy impact of globalization on Chinese government.

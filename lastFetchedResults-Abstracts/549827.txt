Carcinoma is the most common primary renal tumor in cattle, dog and horse. In cattle, aged females
are more susceptible than males. Bilateral renal involvement is common and rate of systemic
metastasis is low. The present study was performed in a Holstein cow in Najaf Abad abattoir of
Isfahan. Swelling and hardness in consistency of the kidneys and neoplastic foci of various sizes,
white to yellow in color that swelled up from the surface of the kidney were seen in macroscopic
examination. For microscopic examination tissue samples prepared from the lesions and were sent
to the lab in 0/10 buffered formalin. Sections were prepared from samples and were stained using
hematoxylin and eosin (H-E). In histopathology, the presence of neoplastic foci with fibrous and
collagenous stroma, polygonal or oval neoplastic cells with eosinophilic and foamy cytoplasm, clear
neoplastic cells with round or oval eccentric nucleus and dense chromatin network and absence of
fetal renal structures, renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed. This report seems to be the first case of
bovine renal cell carcinoma in Iran.

Objective Prevalence rates of mental
health problems in primary care vary according to
population and the type of measure used. This study
examined the prevalence of a full range of mental health
problems, including sub-threshold diagnoses, and the
socio-demographic risk factors for psychiatric disorders
among a population with low out-of-pocket
expenditures for medical care. Method Four validated
mental health assessment instruments, including the
CIDI-SF, were administered to a sample of 976 users of
primary care in Israel between the ages of 25–75 in eight
clinics throughout the country. Prevalence estimates
were obtained for seven psychiatric diagnoses, two
‘‘other mental health disorders’’ (somatization and
disordered eating) and five sub-threshold conditions.
Results The most common types of morbidity were
depression and disordered eating (20.6% and 15.0%,
respectively), followed by somatization (11.8%) and
general anxiety (11.2%). Among respondents, 31.1%
had at least one psychiatric diagnosis, 24.3% had ‘other
mental disorders’ and 15.5% had sub-threshold conditions.
Panic attack, disordered eating and somatization,
as well as a global measure of any psychiatric
diagnosis were significantly more prevalent among
women than men. Psychiatric diagnoses were also more
common among those in the age group 45–64, with less
education and insufficient income, the never married
and separated/divorced and those not working. No
significant differences were found between recent
immigrants, veteran immigrants and Israeli-born, between
Arab and Jewish Israelis or between secular or
religious sectors of the population. Conclusions This
study establishes the prevalence of the most common
disorders in primary care including PTSD, somatization
and disordered eating behaviors. The additional of
other mental disorders suggests that a more accurate
picture of mental disorders in primary care requires an
expanded assessment procedure.

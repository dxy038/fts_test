A cyber-physical system is a large and complex infrastructure. Due to the increasing connectivity, the power and cyber systems become more interdependent. Models of the interactions are needed between the power devices and information and communication technology (ICT). A broad range of cyber attacks has become a serious concern. Cyber attacks must be simulated to analyze the consequences on the power grid. Thus, the cyber system must be modeled explicitly and integrated with the power grid model. This paper describes the development and simulation of a novel co-simulation framework that integrates both the cyber and power systems. The objective is to implement the ICT model for real-time interactions with both the power grid and transmission operator. Different industrial grade environments have been developed to simulate the cyber-power interactions. ICT events that may affect the stability of the grid, e.g., cyber attacks, are simulated at the cyber system layer, and their impact analysis is conducted at the power system layer. The proposed co-simulation framework is validated with the IEEE 39-bus system.

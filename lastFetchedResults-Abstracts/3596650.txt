In this paper a new meter placement method is presented. The method is comprehensive in that all the important aspects of the problem-cost, accuracy, reliability, and bad data processing capability requirements-are incorporated into the method. The problem is solved in three stages. The objective in the first stage is to place a minimum set of measurements which satisfies the desired accuracy requirements. In the second stage, additional meters are placed to incorporate reliability requirements which are defined in term of loss of RTUs. In the third stage, additional meters are placed to improve the bad data processing ability of the state estimation in terms of detecting and identifying the bad data

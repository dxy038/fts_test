Objective: We sought to determine whether placental cytokine expression is altered in patients with preeclampsia. Study Design: Whole placental tissue was collected at cesarean delivery, and total ribonucleic acid was extracted. Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine cytokine expression. Product bands were quantitated by scanning densitometry, and results were expressed as a ratio of cytokine/housekeeping gene (cytokine expression index). Statistical analysis was performed by the Student t test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Placentas from 6 patients with preeclampsia and 4 normotensive patients were analyzed. Placental expression of interleukin 1β and interleukin 10 was greater in preeclamptic women than in normotensive subjects (median interleukin 1β cytokine expression index, 0.675; range, 0.394-0.953; vs 0.106; range, 0.084-0.166; P = .011; median interleukin 10 cytokine expression index, 1.042; range, 0.672-1.192; vs 0.126; range, 0.062-0.398; P< .011). Tumor necrosis factor α messenger ribonucleic acid was detected in placentas of preeclamptic subjects but not in normotensive control subjects. Conclusion: Placentas from preeclamptic patients demonstrated increased expression of interleukin 1β, interleukin 10, and tumor necrosis factor α. This may be in association with placental hypoxia and may contribute to the global endothelial dysfunction observed in preeclampsia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:915-20.)

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate whether intratumoral blood flow velocity measured by transvaginal Doppler ultrasonography would afford better discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal tumors.
STUDY DESIGN: One hundred two patients with adnexal tumors (72 benign, 30 malignant) were studied with transvaginal B-mode, color, and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography before surgery.
RESULTS: Sixty-five benign tumors (90.3%) had abnormal morphologic features suggesting malignancy, and blood flow was detected in 29 (40.3%). The peak systolic velocity was 13.1 ± 9.1 cm/sec and the resistance index was 0.563 ± 0.177. All malignant tumors had abnormal morphologic features and blood flow was detectable in all cases. The peak cystolic velocity was 23.9 ± 11.5 cm/sec and the resistance index was 0.488 ± 0.118. When 16 cm/sec was considered as the cutoff value of peak systolic velocity, the sensitivity and specificity of peak systolic velocity in detecting malignant adnexal tumors were 83.3% and 91.6%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the resistance index (cutoff value 0.72) was 93.3% and 68.1%, respectively. There was no significant difference in sensitivity between peak systolic velocity and resistance index. The specificity of the peak systolic velocity was significantly higher than that of the resistance index (p< 0.05). Moreover, the sensitivity of the peak systolic velocity did not significantly differ from that with transvaginal ultrasonography diagnosis (86.7%), and the specificity of the peak systolic velocity was significantly higher than that of transvaginal ultrasonography (69.4%).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that peak systolic velocity obtained from intratumoral abnormal morphologic features provides a superior means for differentiating malignant from benign adnexal tumors.

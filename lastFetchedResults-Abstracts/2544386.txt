<div><p class="Abstract"><strong>Objective:</strong> To determine the levels of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and Polybrominateddiphenyl ethers (PBDEs) as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in serum of primiparous women at the third trimester of pregnancy and identify the main determinants of POPs levels such as socio-demographic, lifestyle, and diet in Tehran.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> One- hundred eighty five serum samples from two simultaneous case-control studies were collected from September 2013 until August 2015.Ten most abundant PCB congeners (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) congeners 28, 52, 74, 99, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180 and 187) as well as eight PBDE congeners (IUPAC congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 and 209)were analyzed by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explain the relationship between total PCBs and total BPDEs and most detected congeners and some determinants, separately.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The mean (SD) age of the participating women was 27.82 ± 5.24 years. The geometric mean (SD) of total PCBs was 2.42 ± 2.26 and total PBDEs was 1.28 ± 1.41 ng/g lipid. Only the PCB 138, PCB 153 and PBDE 153 were detected in 100% of samples. We observed a significant relationship between the time of being indoors and total PBDEs (P = 0.03). Passive smoking was significantly associated with PCB 153 (P = 0.049). The results of the linear regression analysis showed the negative and weak association (P-value &lt; 0.05) between diet (egg and fat and oil consumption) and POPs in this population.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> It seems the most common route of exposure to PBDEs in our population is indoor pollutants. Meanwhile inhalation of smoke from environment is a route of exposure to PCB 153. Further study is needed to evaluate the effects of socio-demographics and especially dietary intake on POPs level.</p></div>

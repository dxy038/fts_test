Background: The lipids of the spermatozoa membrane are important for the fluidity
and flexibility of spermatozoa. However, spermatozoaâ€™s lipids are the main substrates
for peroxidation, which may provoke severe functional disorder of sperm.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the fatty acids composition of
spermatozoa in men with asthenozoospermia, asthenoteratozoospermia and
oligoasthenoteratozoospermia compared with normozoospermic males.
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed. The patients were 51
men with seminal parameters abnormalities undergoing infertility screening. The
patients were grouped into asthenozoospermic (n=15), asthenoteratozoospermic (n=21)
and oligoasthenoteratozoospermic (n=15). The patients were compared with 21 males
with normozoospermia. Sperm fatty acid analysis was performed using capillary gas
chromatography.
Results: Levels of stearic acid and oleic acid were significantly higher in
oligoasthenoteratozoospermic subjects compared with these levels in normozoospermic
males. Levels of arachidonic acid and DHA were significantly lower in the sperms of
oligoasthenoteratozoospermic males than normozoospermic men. Sperm motility and
morphology were correlated positively with levels of arachidonic acid and DHA while a
negative correlation was observed with levels of stearic acid and oleic acid.
Conclusion: In conclusion, impaired sperm function can originate from the disorder of
sperm lipid metabolism. Low levels of DHA and arachidonic acid in spermatozoa of
oligoasthenoteratozoospermic subjects may be the result of breakdown of them.

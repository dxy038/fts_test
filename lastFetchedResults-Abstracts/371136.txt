The objective of our study was to evaluate the behavior of ovine chondrocytes and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) on a matrix comprising type-I, -II, and -III collagen in vitro, and the healing of chondral defects in an ovine model treated with the matrix, either unseeded or seeded with autologous chondrocytes, combined with microfracture treatment.
For in vitro investigation, ovine chondrocytes and BMSC were seeded on the matrix and cultured at different time points. Histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, biochemical assays for glycosaminoglycans, and real-time quantitative PCR for collagens were performed. The animal study described here included 22 chondral defects in 11 sheep, divided into four treatment groups. Group A: microfracture and collagen matrix seeded with chondrocytes; B: microfracture and unseeded matrices; C: microfracture; D: untreated defects. All animals were sacrificed 16 weeks after implantation, and a histomorphometrical and qualitative evaluation of the defects was performed.
The in vitro investigation revealed viable cells up to 3 weeks; chondrocytes had a predominantly round morphology, produced glycosaminoglycans, and expressed both collagen markers, whereas BMSC stained positive for antibodies against type-II collagen; however, no mRNA for type-II collagen was amplified. All treatment groups of the animal model showed better defect filling compared to untreated knees. The cell-seeded group had the greatest quantity of repair tissue and the largest quantity of hyaline-like tissue.
Although the collagen matrix is an adequate environment for BMSC in vitro, the additionally implanted unseeded collagen matrix did not increase the repair response after microfracture in chondral defects. Only the matrices seeded with autologous cells in combination with microfracture were able to facilitate the regeneration of hyaline-like cartilage.

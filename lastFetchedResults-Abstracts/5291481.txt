This paper presents a tool for automating the design of road tunnels lighting systems. The tunnel lighting system must guarantee some minimal luminance values in order to ensure a easy driving and visual perception. The lights distribution, in different tunnel zones, is obtained in the proposed technique by using a genetic algorithm. The developed software framework automatically selects the best light type and its localization, according to a specified design objective, along the tunnel independently of the light manufacturer.

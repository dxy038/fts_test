A class of combinational circuits, called the (k,K)-circuits is presented, and a polynomial-time algorithm to detect any single or multiple stuckfault in such circuits is introduced. The (k,K)-circuits are a generalization of H. FujiwaraÂ´s (1988) K-bounded circuits. The fault detection problem is formulated as an energy minimization problem using the bidirectional neural net model proposed earlier. A minimizing point of the energy function corresponds to a test. A polynomial-time algorithm is presented here to solve the single and multiple fault-detection problem for the (k,K)-circuits by recursively eliminating variables in the energy function.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

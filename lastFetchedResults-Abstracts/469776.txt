Objective
This study investigated the association among the inducible 70-kd heat shock protein, cytokines, and microbial flora in the vagina in mid trimester pregnant women and subsequent preterm delivery.
Study design
Vaginal samples from 205 pregnant women, which were collected at 18 to 22 weeks of gestation, were analyzed for qualitative and quantitative vaginal microflora and for 70-kd heat shock protein, interleukin-1β, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and tumor necrosis factor-α by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pregnancy outcome data were obtained subsequently.
Results
The 70-kd heat shock protein was detected in 38 vaginal samples (18.5%). Its presence was associated with elevated vaginal pH, a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and elevated interleukin-1 receptor antagonist levels (P< .001). Among women with bacterial vaginosis, 70-kd heat shock protein–positive subjects had a >80% increase in median vaginal concentration of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (P< .05).
Conclusion
Vaginal 70-kd heat shock protein expression is associated with the down-regulation of the proinflammatory immune response to abnormal vaginal flora in mid trimester pregnant women.

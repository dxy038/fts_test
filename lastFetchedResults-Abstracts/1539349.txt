This paper is concerned with the problem of designing a robust reliable H ∞ control for uncertain stochastic systems with time delay (USSD) and time-varying norm-bounded parametric uncertainties in the system states. The faulty actuators are considered as a disturbance signal to the system which is augmented with system disturbance input. The main objective of the paper is presenting a state feedback controller that guarantees input-to-state stability (ISS) of the plant and an H ∞ norm-bound constraint on the attenuation of the augmented disturbance for all admissible uncertainties and actuator failures. The problem is solved by using Lyapunov functions together with the Razumikhin methodology. To clarify the proposed results, some illustrative examples are presented.

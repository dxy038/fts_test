The objective of this study was to determine the impact of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms (I, IIB, IIA and IIX) on pork quality traits of halothane (HAL)-negative (NN) and halothane-carrier (Nn) pigs. Gilts (n=32) were assigned to a 2Ã—2 factorial of genetic population (GP) and slaughter weight (WT; 120 and 135 kg). Classical meat quality characteristics were collected and MyHC content was determined on muscle samples. Regression equations for pork quality and carcass composition traits were determined. Only I/IIB accounted for variation in drip loss of NN gilts (R2=0.18), while GP related to drip loss in Nn gilts (R2=0.70). Type I MyHC content explained variation in ultimate (24 h) muscle pH of NN gilts (R2=0.09), while I/IIB, I/IIX and IIB/IIX were significant for Nn gilts (R2=0.99). I/IIA, I/IIX, IIB/IIX and GP accounted for variation in Hunter Color a (redness) values of NN gilts (R2=0.69), while IIB, IIA, IIB/IIA and GP were significant for Nn gilts (R2=0.97). Overall, fiber type composition accounts for a larger proportion of variation in the quality traits of Nn compared to NN gilts.

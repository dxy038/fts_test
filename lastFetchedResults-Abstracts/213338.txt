Background: Recent reports have suggested that ultrasound-guided embryo transfer
(UG-ET) might improve pregnancy rates.
Objective: To determine whether transabdominal UG-ET is a useful tool for increasing
pregnancy and implantation rates in patients undergoing IVF or ICSI.
Materials and Methods: A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in 180
patients in order to compare embryo transfer under abdominal ultrasound-guidance
(n=90) with embryo transfer by clinical touch method (n=90).
Results: The Clinical pregnancy rate was 21.1 % in the ultrasound-guided group and
15.5 % in the clinical touch group (p =0.3). The implantation rate in the ultrasound
guided group was 11.1% while this was 7.2% in the clinical touch group (p =0.12). The
percentage of difficult transfer was not significantly different in both groups, this was
8.9% in the ultrasound-guided group and 13.3% in the clinical touch group (p =0.47).
Conclusions: Although the clinical pregnancy and implantation rate are higher in UGET
group than the clinical touch group, but this difference was not statistically
significant.

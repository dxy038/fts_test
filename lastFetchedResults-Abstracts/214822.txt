Assessment of nasal airway is helpful in understanding nasal breathing function. Acoustic
rhinometry is one of the most commonly-used objective measurements of nasal airway. This test
has the ability to measure the volume and the cross-sectional area of the nose in different
distances. It also determines the site of minimal cross-sectional area. These variables are different
in various races. Defining these normal values in adult Iranian population, as a criterion for
diagnosis and treatment of nasal diseases can be very helpful.
One hundred eighty adult Iranians (18 – 60 years old) without nasal breathing complaints
underwent acoustic rhinometry. The mean volume and minimal cross-sectional area of the nose
and also correlation of these variables with age, sex, height, weight, smoking habit, and topical nasal decongestion were assessed.
In this sample, total nasal volume was 8.12±0.94 cm3 and total minimal cross-sectional area was
0.9±0.17 cm2 before decongestion. There was no correlation between these values and age, sex,
height, weight, and smoking habit. There was a significant increase in volume and cross-sectional area after decongestion.
Because of the differences in volume and minimal cross-sectional area in various races,
measurement of these values in Iranian population is a proper way for diagnosis of rhinologic
diseases and planning the appropriate treatment (medical or surgical). It is also helpful for
comparison of preoperative and postoperative results after nasal surgeries.

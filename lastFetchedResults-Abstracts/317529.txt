Our objective was to find out the incidence of signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint(TMJ) and disc displacement in patients with mandibular prognathism. Fifty-one patients were examined clinically and by axial computed tomography(CT). The incidence of TMJ signs and symptoms was 6/25(24%) in patients with simple mandibular prognathism and 12/26(46%) in patients with mandibular prognathism and asymmetry. No discs were displaced in patients with simple mandibular prognathism, but 15(58%) of the patients with mandibular prognathism and asymmetry had displaced discs. There was no association between signs and symptoms of TMJ and disc displacement. Patients with mild protrusion and severe asymmetry of the mandible had a high incidence of disc displacement, which interestingly was on the deviated side in 14 of the 15 patients affected. We conclude that skeletal morphology may have a role in the development of TMJ disorders but the mechanism is obscure

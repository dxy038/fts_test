Objective(s): Covering tissue defects using skin flaps is a basic surgical strategy for plastic and reconstructive surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chicken embryo extract (CEE) and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) on random skin flap survival (RSF) in rats. Using chicken embryo extract can be an ideal environment for the growth and proliferation of transplanted cells.
Materials and Methods: Forty albino male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups; each group consisted of 10 rats. BM-MSCs and CEE were transplanted into subcutaneous tissue in the area, where the flap would be examined. On the 7th postoperative day, the survival areas of the flaps were measured by using digital imaging with software assistance, and tissue was collected for evaluation.
Results: Survival area was 19.54±2 in the CEE group and 17.90±2 in the CEE/BM-MSC group when compared to the rates of the total skin flaps, which were significantly higher than the control group (13.47±2) (P<0.05). The biomechanical assessment showed a slight difference, although there was no statistically significant difference between the experimental groups and the control group (P>0.05).
Conclusion: The findings from this study demonstrated that in operative treatment with BM-MSCs and CEE transplantation could promote flap survival, but the biomechanical parameters were not contrasted with a saline injection.

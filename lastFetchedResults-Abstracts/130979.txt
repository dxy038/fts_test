Introduction: The objective of this study was assessing the insufficiencies, inefficiencies and ill-fittness of class, I,II partial dentures.
Materials and Methods: In this study 100 patients including 89 females and 11 males, with R.P.D class I and II kennedy prepared in the faculty, were examined.
Results: The following results were thereby obtained:
1- 26% of prostheses was for upper and 74% was for lower jaw.
2- 53% of prostheses were class I, and 47% class II.
3- 32% of the individuals had not even used their protheses for a week.
4- Type of clasp and rest place: 69% R.P.I., 4% R.P.A., 26% combination clasp, and 1% circumferential clasp.
5- Fitness of the total prostheses: 71%inappropriate and 29% appropriate.
6- Rocking 17% and ridge atrophy 11%.
7- Artificial teeth wear: 57% without wear, 35% low, and 8% high.
8- Coincidence between C.R. and C.O. 27%; V.D.O.: 43% normal, 20% short, 37% high.
9- Undercut and tilt in basic tooth: 74% with undercut and 26% without undercut; 15% destructive tilt.
10- Clasps status: 52% improper, and 48% proper.
11- Type of major connector and the percentage of its application: Ant-post. Bar 23% in upper jaw, Horse Shoe 3% in upper jaw, Lingual Plate 45% in lower jaw, Lingual Bar 29% in lower jaw.
Conclusion: It was concluded that most insufficiencies were due to ill- fittness of the dentures (71Y ). ill- fittness of the frames were seen in 46% of the cases which was by itself the cause of ill-fittness of the base, recordings, and the V.D.O& C.O.

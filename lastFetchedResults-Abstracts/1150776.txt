Copper electrodes with diameter of 9.5, 12 and 20 mm were used in electrodischarge machining (EDM) of AISI 1045 tool steel at two current setting of 3.5 and 6.5 A with the objective of determining possible correlation between the EDM parameter (current) and the machinability factors (material removal rate and electrode wear rate). Each machining test was performed for 20 min and kerosene was used as the dielectric fluid. The material removal rate of the workpiece material and the wear rate of the electrode material were obtained based on the calculation of the percentage of mass loss per machining time (wt.%/s). It was found that the material removal rate as well as the electrode wear rate were not only dependent on the diameter of the electrode, but also had close relation with the supply of current. Low current was found suitable for small diameter electrode, while high current for big diameter electrode.

This paper considers a tool provisioning problem in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) with an automatic tool transporter. The problem considered here is that of determining the number of copies of each tool type for a limited budget with the objective of minimizing makespan. This problem should be solved to decide the (additional) purchase of required tools when the FMS should be reconfigured due to change of part mix. To solve the problem, two heuristic algorithms are proposed. One is a composite search algorithm based on two greedy search methods, and the other is a search algorithm in which numbers of tool copies are determined based on tool groupings. In both algorithms, simulation results are used to find search directions. Computational experiments show that the latter search algorithm gives better results

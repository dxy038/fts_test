ParaServe is an intelligent parallel mass storage file server. Drawing on the concepts of RAID it utilizes arrays of volume production disk drives connected and controlled by a transputer based network to achieve as a primary objective, high I/O performance. These levels of performance are required by systems which provide database services, especially multimedia and video data, to a large number of users. The scalability of transputer arrays will provide the processing capabilities for the eventual incorporation of database processing facilities like select, join and sort

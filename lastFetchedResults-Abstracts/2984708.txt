This work presents a study of the influence of crossroads on the mobile average received power, and assesses a propagation model for crossroads in micro-cells. With this objective in mind, field measurements were carried out in Lisbon at the 900 MHz band, and the results were compared with predictions coming from appropriate models. In order to extensively assess the propagation model, the measurement campaign was carried out on both regular and irregular urban areas. Low mean errors (less than 5 dB) were obtained for regular scenarios, when the incidence on the street is far from being longitudinal, but for irregular ones it can present very high values. Thus, the model can be applied to some urban scenarios for a good estimation of the influence of crossroads on signal variation, mainly for interference estimation

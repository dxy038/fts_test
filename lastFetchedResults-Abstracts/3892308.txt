This note considers the robust supervisory control problems of uncertain nondeterministic discrete-event systems (DESs). The uncertain DES to be controlled is assumed to be modeled as a set of some possible nondeterministic automata. Then, the control objective is to achieve a given language specification and guarantee the nonblockingness of any nondeterministic automata of the set which are controlled by a robust nonblocking supervisor. Based on trajectory models, this note presents the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a robust nonblocking supervisor for a given uncertain nondeterministic DES

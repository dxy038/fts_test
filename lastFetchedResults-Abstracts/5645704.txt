This paper presents bitstream-based features for perceptual quality estimation of HEVC coded videos. Various factors including the impact of different sizes of block-partitions, use of reference-frames, the relative amount of various prediction modes, statistics of motion vectors and quantization parameters are taken into consideration for producing 52 features relevant for perceptual quality prediction. The used test stimuli constitutes 560 bitstreams that have been carefully extracted for this analysis from the 59, 520 bistreams of the large-scale database generated by the Joint Effort Group (JEG) of the Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG). The obtained results show the significance of the considered features through reasonably accurate and monotonic prediction of a number of objective quality metrics.

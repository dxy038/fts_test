With the development of image compress technology, video is used more and more often. For the complexity of the subjective video quality estimation, many researchers are pay attention to the objective video quality assessment. In this paper, we proposed a color video quality assessment based on edge-color distortion. First, the edge and the color distortion models are introduced. Then, the response functions of HVS to the two models are given by analyzing relation between predicted value of the two models and the subjective quality estimation. Finally, the functions are integrated into an equation which is used to measure the color video quality by using multiple linear regression analysis. The proposed method is tested on the video quality experts group (VQEG) Phase I FR-TV test data set. Experiments show that it has good correlation with perceived video quality.

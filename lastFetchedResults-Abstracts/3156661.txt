A Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Algorithm(MOPSA) is applied to the optimization of Intensity Modulated Radiation Treatment inverse planning. The test cases of irregular field under the condition of water phantom prove the practicability of the algorithm. The optimization results compared with other algorithms proposed by our group show that the algorithm has clearly advantages on convergence speed.

Abstract:
Introduction: The amounts of municipal waste are on the rise because of the urbanization and industrial development. If the Leachates are released into the water resources and soil, the biological balance of the environment will be disturbed. Once heavy metals are accumulated in the food chain, aquatic and human life are endangered. 
Objective: This laboratory research was conducted To evaluate the performance of activated sludge microbial populations in the removal of heavy metals of Compost Leachate.
Materials and Methods: This study was a descriptive- applied one, which attempted to evaluate the performance of suspended and attached growth biological treatment. Raw leachate was sampled from organic fertilizer factory in Guilan and two series of batch reactor with attached and suspended growth were applied within 360 hours of aeration under lab conditions. BOD5, COD, MLSS were measured, according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater and heavy metals were analyzed by ICP-OES before and after aeration treatment.
Results: The results showed that within 72 hour aeration, maximum efficiency of the attached growth system for the removal of BOD5 and COD were, respectively 80% and 78.28%. Efficiency of heavy metal removal within 48 hours of aeration for the attached growth system was subsequently Pb > Fe > Mn > Co > Zn > Hg > Mg > Cu > Cr > Ni > Cd > V and Pb > Mn > Fe > Zn > Cu > Mg > Co > Hg > Cr > Ni > V > Cd for suspended growth system.
Conclusion: As revealed, the biological treatment systems with attached growth have an acceptable efficiency in the removal of heavy metals, BOD5 and COD of compost leachate.

In this paper, we established the urban public safety risk monitoring index system, using AHP to determine the varying degrees of the evaluation quota and using TOPSIS to standardize the value of the evaluation quota. We collected the data in Beijing in 2008, evaluated the Beijing public security risk in quantitative. This method combines TOPSIS with AHP effectively and makes the evaluations means widely applied, and meanwhile it also makes the evaluation means easily used and to evaluation results more objective and more accurate.

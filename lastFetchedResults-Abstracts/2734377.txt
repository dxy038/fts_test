Wireless technologies are becoming an essential part of our daily life. These technologies are expected to provide a wide variety of real-time applications; hence, there is a vital need to provide quality-of-Service (QoS) support. One of the key mechanisms to support QoS is traffic regulation. The basic idea behind traffic regulation is to measure the network state (e.g., load) in order to adapt the rate of carefully selected application flows. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called FuzzyWMN, which can be used to implement traffic adaptation in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs).The objective of FuzzyWMN is to compute the rate adaptation to apply to application flows according to the current network state; it relies on two parameters to meet this objective: (1) packet delays between sources and destinations; and (2) buffer occupancy of network nodes. The proposed model combines the essential notions of both fuzzy logic theory and Petri nets; this enables FuzzyWMN to realize traffic adaptation in networks characterized by information uncertainty and imprecision due to the dynamic traffic behavior, channel interferences, etc. Extensive simulations show that FuzzyWMN achieves stable end-to-end delay and good throughput under different network conditions.

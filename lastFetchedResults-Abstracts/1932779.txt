The objective of the present studies was to determine the localization of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in testicular tissue collected from male alpacas at 12 and 24 months of age. In the testes of 12-month-old alpacas, positive staining for EGF was not detected. EGFR was localized to Leydig cells within the 12-month-old alpaca testis, but staining was absent within seminiferous tubules. At 24 months of age, EGF was localized to Leydig cells, peritubular myoid cells, Sertoli cells and germ cells of the alpaca testis, with a preferential adluminal compartment staining within the seminiferous tubules. EGFR was also localized to the Leydig cells, peritubular myoid cells, Sertoli cells and germ cells within the 24-month-old alpaca testis, but staining within the tubules was primarily within the basal compartment. Results indicate distinct temporal and spatial regulation of EGF and EGFR in the alpaca testis and support a potential role for EGF and its related ligands in alpaca testis development and spermatogenesis.

It established multi-objective optimal mathematic model and did research on solving methods based on game theory. First, n robots specified n players. Second, it decomposed the design variables set and took the design variables set of paths which belonged to each robot as strategy space of the corresponding players. Third, it established mapping relationships between payoff functions and objective functions of the game. Then each player took payoff function of its own as its objective and did single-objective optimization in its own strategy space .So this player obtained the best strategy versus other players. The best strategies of all players consisted of the strategy permutation of a round game. Finally, it obtains the final game solutions (the best non-collision coordinated paths of flocking task for multiple mobile robots) through multi-round games according to the convergence criterion.

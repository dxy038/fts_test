With the continued improvements in portable computing power and sensing systems it is becoming more common for groups of robots to cooperate to achieve a goal. When the robots are operating in an initially unknown environment, the most natural form of cooperation is multi-robot exploration. For many years frontier based approaches have been commonly used to assign target points for each of the robots in the group based on expected information gain and distance to travel. In this paper we present an expansion to these approaches allowing for the incorporation of multiple objective utility functions that allow adjustment of the exploration priorities both for the individual robots and the group as a whole. In addition, we discuss real world results of our algorithm including our first place finish at the Old Ram Shed Challenge and second place at the MAGIC2010 main competition.

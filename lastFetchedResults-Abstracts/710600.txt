Study objective
We report the case of a 7-year-old girl who underwent laparoscopic ovariopexy for a suspected ovarian torsion after a previous oophorectomy. We consider the role of elective ovariopexy of the contralateral ovary in the case of adnexal torsion.
Design
Case study and review of the literature.
Result
There was evidence to suggest a very recent adnexal torsion and an unusually long ovarian pedicle, with a possible familial linkage. The patient underwent laparoscopic ovariopexy for the remaining normal ovary, which was found to be loosely twisted at operation. After detorsion, ovariopexy was performed laparoscopically, by suturing the ovary to the back of uterus. There are no other descriptions in the literature of a familial linkage with ovarian torsion.
Conclusion
The case presented reminds doctors of the strong possibility of ovarian torsion in young girls presenting with pelvic pain. Laparoscopic ovariopexy for the contralateral ovary should be considered in all women with evidence of torsion, including children and adolescents, as is standard for testicular torsion.

Working out at a gym is a favorite pastime for many people these days. To gain a competitive edge, many gyms have installed systems to log exercise data. An individualÂ´s exercise data can be used to track personal progress, as well as to provide positive feedback and motivation. The majority of these recorded data comes from rotation based exercise equipment, such as stationary bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and rowing machines, because it is easy to log data with rotational sensors or electromechanical resistance. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no method of recording exercise data from gym equipment that utilizes weight stacks and pulleys as resistance. The objective of this work is to propose an exercise data logging system that collects data from retrofitted weight stack equipment using off-the-shelf sensors and microcontrollers. This data logger has been designed and implemented with a simple web-based user interface.

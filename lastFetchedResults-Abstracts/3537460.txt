Within the framework of classical estimation theory, there is no technically legitimate way to utilize knowledge that cannot be codified by either deterministic or strict probability models. The authors introduce a theoretically defensible approach called coordinated objective/subjective estimation (COSE) for the simultaneous incorporation of both objective and subjective knowledge in estimation. Also discussed is a technique, called heuristically constrained estimation (HCE) which is a particular interpretation of the Bayesian use of subjective priors. COSE, HCE, and classical maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation are applied to a tracking problem

To minimize the maritime accidents, it is universal agreed that the shipÂ´s officers who manoeuvring the ship must be well-trained. A ship bridge simulator is always proved to be one of the best ways to achieve the training objective, as it enables the navigator to expose to many realistic experiences. This study proposes a consideration of human performance (navigator) in such an environment by using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) or more specifically, Heart Rate R-R interval data, which can be obtained from Electrocardiogram (ECG). Upon analyzing the HRV data from navigator, a good assessment or anticipation on the performance of human factor in the interaction between human-ship can be achieved positively.

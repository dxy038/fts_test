Medical Informatics is the scientific field that deals with the storage, retrieval and optimal use of information and data in medicine. It is often called healthcare informatics or biomedicai informatics, and forms part of the wider domain of eHealth. The end objective of biomedicai informatics is the coalescing of data, knowledge, and the tools necessary to apply that data and knowledge in the decision-making process, at the time and place that a decision needs to be made. Ubiquitous healthcare is an emerging field of technology that uses a large number of environmental and patient sensors and actuators to monitor and improve patientsÂ´ physical and mental condition. Biofeedback is a training technique in which people are taught to improve their health and performance by using signals from their own bodies. Based on above, we pick up electrical signals from the brain(EEG) and translates the signals into a form that people can detect, by which we improve the brain function and mental condition. Moreover, a scenario of ubiquitous mental healthcare system has been established.

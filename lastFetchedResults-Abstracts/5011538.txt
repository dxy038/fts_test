Bidirectional current-mode capacitor multipliers for on-chip DC-DC converter compensation are presented in this paper. The increasing demand for portable devices is a driving force toward higher integration. Reducing physical area with the same or better performance is carried out. Based on TSMC 0.35&#956;m technology, we demonstrate that a small capacitor is multiplied by a factor about 200. It allows the control system compensating circuit of DC-DC converter be easily integrated on a chip and occupy less silicon area. The experimental results show that the DC-DC converter with proposed architecture is stable for wide loading conditions from 10mA to 400mA while input voltage is 3.3V and output voltage is 2.0V. The quiescent current consumed is 9&#956;A by single-ended capacitor multiplier and 19&#956;A by two-ended capacitor multiplier.

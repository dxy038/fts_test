&#8641; &#8220;Tools or Toy?&#8221; is the wrong question "7 &#8220;Expert or Novice?&#8221; is the question &#8641; Take/Select is a very good heuristic. &#8641; Tailoring to runtime or quality efficiency is very easy by the window size. &#8641; Take/Select with iteration is efficient, if no suitable pre-sorting is possible. &#8641; Do not use Branch&amp;Bound-Algorithm. Use A<sup>&#8727;</sup>. At least with monotonic objective function the look-ahead function h is for free. &#8641; Global heuristics (e.g. Greedy or Tabu-Search) have good runtime characteristics, even for large number of elements. They, however, sometimes stop in local optima. &#8641; With increasing window size (and increasing run-time) Take/Select\Â´s quality results improve.

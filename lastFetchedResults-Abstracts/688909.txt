The objective of this study is to outline how the ground-water quality is affected by geological factors, soil characteristics and subsurface structure. The results of 25 ground-water samples, and 30 soil samples of which 10 soil samples analysed chemically provide the basis of this study. Procedures to interpret water quality data are based on a combined use of the traditional graphical methods, ratios of Na+/Cl−and Ca2+/Mg2+, multivariate geostatistical methods and computation of the saturation indices (SI) of minerals. The results of soil analyses show that the grain size ranges from very coarse sand to clayey loams, and from well sorted and extremely poorly sorted. The soil salinity increases in old alluvial plains and decreases in the dissected wadis of limestone plateaux, while vertical distribution decreases with depth. It is found that the ground-water is supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite, and undersaturated with respect to gypsum. Calculated values of PCO2for the ground-water samples range from 2×10−4to 7×10−3with a mean value of 3×10−3(atm.). This indicates that the ground-water becomes charged with CO2during infiltration processes.

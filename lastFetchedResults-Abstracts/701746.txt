Waste nitrocellulose (NC) is regulated as a hazardous material. The objective of this study was to determine if NC exposed to denitrifying and sulfidogenic conditions would undergo sufficient removal of the nitro groups to yield a material that is no longer explosive. Enrichment cultures were established with methanol as the electron donor for nitrate-reducing conditions and lactate for sulfate-reducing conditions. NC was added to the cultures at 10 g/l. A statistically significant decrease in the nitrogen (N) content of NC occurred in both enrichment cultures, from approximately 13.1–13.2% in virgin NC to 12.2–12.4%. This was accompanied by an increase in nitrogen gas formation. The presence of a primary substrate (methanol and lactate) was necessary to affect this change; NC itself did not serve as an electron donor. In cultures that were carrying out denitrification but were then depleted of nitrate, with methanol still present, a slightly greater removal of nitro groups from NC occurred along with additional formation of nitrogen gas. NC did not have an inhibitory affect on the denitrification process but it did significantly slow the rate of lactate consumption and sulfate reduction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicated that NC exposed to denitrifying conditions was enriched in hydroxyl groups, consistent with removal of some of the nitro groups by hydrolysis of the nitrate esters. NC exposed to nitrate- and sulfate-reducing conditions and virgin NC were also compared based on their explosive properties using a small-scale burning test. The biologically treated NC exhibited somewhat less reactivity, but was still rated as explosive. The decrease in%N, increase in N2, and FTIR results demonstrated that NC does undergo biotransformation in the presence of nitrate- and sulfate-reducing enrichment cultures, but the extent of denitration does not appear to be adequate to yield a nonhazardous product.

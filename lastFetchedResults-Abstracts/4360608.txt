The paper presents an experimental approach to provide a guaranteed quality of service (QoS) over a satellite network based on the Internet protocol (IP). The results obtained represent part of the experimental activity carried out during the second year of the project &#8220;Integration of multimedia services on heterogeneous satellite networks&#8221;, called &#8220;ASI-CNIT project&#8221;. Both subjective metrics as mean opinion score (MOS) and objective metrics, as video and voice packet loss, jitter and transmission rate have been used to investigate the topic and to get proper configurations able to guarantee an high quality of service perceived by the users (PQoS-perceived quality of service). The integrated services approach along with the ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) has been chosen to reserve the network resources. The measures reported have been obtained by real operative sessions

In view of the coal plow of the load and energy consumption question, optimized the cutting and parameter movement for plow body of on improved genetic algorithm multi-objective optimization strategy. The optimized results indicate that the cutting consumption reduces 16.96%, productivity capability rises 23.38%, loading area uniformity rises 16.62%, productivity capability of coal plow obtains obviously rise, and cutting energy consumption of plow body are reduced.

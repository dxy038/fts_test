Objective: The bioscaffold can be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The scaffolds used in tissue engineering must have high porosity to facilitate accelerated angiogenesis for feeding cells and repelling cell waste outside the scaffold. In this experimental
study, we attempted to produce lung three-dimensional scaffold and assay its effect on cell penetration and migration.
Materials and Methods: In an experimental study, rabbit lung tissue was decellularized and used as a scaffold for rabbit blastema cells. The scaffolds were studied on the 15th day after culturing.
Results: Microscopic features revealed high porosity in the lung tissue scaffold. Electron microscopic imaging also showed collagen and elastin were intact, which are important properties in scaffolds designed for tissue engineering. Migration and permeation of blastema
cells into the lung tissue scaffold was also observed.
Conclusion: Rabbit lung tissue scaffolds have high porosity. Blastema cells successfully migrated toward and permeated the scaffold inside.

Knowledge management systems (KMS) are predominant in both theory and practice. However, are the same systems discussed in theory actualised in practice? By comparing and contrasting KMS in theory and practice, this paper demonstrates that they are indeed dissimilar. In theory, KMS have both subjective and objective components. In practice, only the objective component of KMS appears to be actualized; hence, these KMS in practice are essentially organisational memory systems at best and not KMS at all.

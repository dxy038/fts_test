Transmutation of long-lived fission products is one of the key issues in development and utilization of nuclear power in the world. In the study underway, we are trying to replace the burnable poison in LWR by a mixture of some LLFPs. The main fission isotope products which arc included in the high level waste(HLW) with the half life more than 500 years are: 79Se, 93Zr, 94Nb, 99Tc, 107Pd. 126Sn, 129I 135Cs. Our main objective is to employ such an isotope not only with long half life but also with high neutron absorption cross section and appropriate metallic properties within chemical structure. For the matter of calculations, ENDF/B6 as nuclear data library and a series of codes such as WIMS, CITATION, and ORIGEN were used. It has been shown that 99Tc could be used instead of boron in reactor.

An ad hoc network is an infrastructure less network which means it does not require any base station for the data transmission. The performance of these networks is impacted by the topology of the network where the mobility pattern and the number of nodes are the important metrics. This paper is intended to measure the throughput of the network as the density of nodes increases. We simulated the AODV routing protocol for calculating the performance metrics namely packet delivery fraction, Average end-to-end delay by varying network size through simulation using NS-2. The objective of this paper is to observe the behavior of the network as the density of the nodes increases.

Work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on laser radar imaging of a construction site is described. The objective of the NIST research is to make measurements required in a construction project quicker and cheaper than current practice and to do so without impacting existing operations. This can be done by developing techniques for real-time assessment and documentation in terms of 3-D as-built models of the construction process. Once developed, this technology may be used for other applications such as condition assessment of a hazardous environment where human intervention would be impossible.

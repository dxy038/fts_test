In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling static messages in FlexRay. We assume that static messages have precedence relations. This implies that each message must be sent after the transmission of all its predecessors. Our problem model supports slot multiplexing as defined in the FlexRay v3.0 protocol specification. Our objective is to provide a schedule that satisfies FlexRay specifications and precedence relations between messages and minimizes the bandwidth usage. To solve the problem, a scheme for transformation of the message scheduling problem to Strip Packing Problem (SPP) is proposed. We solve the optimization problem using a Linear Integer Programming formulation. We study our approach based on some advanced automotive control applications.

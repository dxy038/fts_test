Objective
etrospective study examined the association between symptoms of depression, anxiety, and mortality risk following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
s
essed 440 CABG surgery patients' scores on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and followed up mortality status for a median of 5 years, 10 months.
s
were 67 (15%) deaths overall during the follow-up period. Adjusted survival analysis showed that preoperative depressive symptoms were not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality. Survival analysis with preoperative anxiety adjusted for covariates showed a significantly increased mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR)=1.88 (95% CI=1.12â€“3.17), P=.02].
sion
rative anxiety symptoms were significantly associated with increased mortality risk after adjustment for known mortality risk factors. Future research should further explore the simultaneous role of anxiety and depression on mortality following CABG.

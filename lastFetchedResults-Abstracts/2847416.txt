According to the goal that total annual solar photovoltaic power generation in solar house is as large as possible, and unit power generation costs are as small as possible, multi-objective optimization model of installation and design is established; Efficiency - cost sorting algorithm based on heuristic is proposed. Finally, we applied the algorithm to the practical Photovoltaic cell installation and design, and obtained the reasonable laying scheme and inverter options of photovoltaic cell components connect.

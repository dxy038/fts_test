In this paper the optimal consumption-tracking problem of the singular dynamic input-output macro-economic model is solved by using a new method called artificial feedback technique. Here, the objective functional is chosen as the LQ cost based on a consumption-tracking principle, and the system equation is described as a singular linear difference equation with a non-regular pencil of matrices

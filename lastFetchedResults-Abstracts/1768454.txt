Shop floor performance has great influence on performance of a
manufacturing system. Traditionally, shop floor operational policies
concerning maintenance scheduling, quality control and production
scheduling have been considered and optimized independently.
Anyway, these aspects of operations planning have an interaction
effect on each other significantly and hereupon for improving the
system performance; they need to be considered commonly. The main
objective of this study is to provide a new approach in the quality
control process. x control chart has been used in previous models, but
in this study to improve the quality and increase the accuracy,
cumulative sum control chart which is useful for detecting small
changes by considering previous information of process is used and
causes 5% improvement in objective function in the case that x
control chart was used.

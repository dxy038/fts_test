The development literature on hazards and disasters indicates a visible paradigm shift from hazard assessment to vulnerability analysis and building community resilience. This shift has taken place just after the Kobe Earthquake in 2005, which necessitated the formulation of Hyogo Framework of Actions, the global framework for disaster risk reduction. One of the goals of this framework is to build the resilience of the communities prone to hazards and disasters. The objective of this paper is to analyze and review the frameworks on community resilience in the context of hazards and natural disasters and propose a community resilience framework for an earthquake prone area in Baluchistan, based on the findings of an extensive research carried out on vulnerability and resilience assessment. A household questionnaire survey was conducted among 200 residents of Quetta city, using random sampling method. Based on the findings, the paper has proposed a new community resilience framework, which can be used for upgrading the community preparedness, awareness, and finally leading to community resilience at the local levels.

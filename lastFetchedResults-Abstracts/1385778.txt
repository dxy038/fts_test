The main objective of this study was to evaluate an endoscopic examination protocol for routine dental examination in horses. The oral cavities of 300 standing, sedated horses were examined under field and hospital conditions with a rigid endoscope using a standardised technique that included examination of the occlusal, lingual (palatal) and buccal surfaces of all cheek teeth rows. The most common cheek teeth abnormalities detected were sharp enamel edges (present in 96.3% of horses), focal overgrowths (64.3%), fissure fractures (54.3%), diastemata (24.3%) and infundibular hypoplasia/caries (48.3%). Rigid endoscopy of the equine oral cavity was found to be a safe non-invasive diagnostic technique that appeared to be superior to clinical oral examination for detecting subtle cheek teeth changes.

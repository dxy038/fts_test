Objective: To assess the frequency of hepatitis B & C viral markers in patients with cirrhosis liver.Material and Methods: This descriptive case series was conducted in the Medical units of District Headquarter Hospital Daggar and Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar from January 2006 to December 2006 on 280 cirrhotic patients. All these patients were studied for hepatitis B & C viral markers.Results: Out of 280 patients, 156 (55.7%) were males and 124 (44.3%) were female with age ranging from 14 to 75 years and mean age of 56.3 + 16.4 years. Out of 280 patients, 129 (46.07%) were positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies. Seventy nine patients (28.21%) were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Sixteen patients (5.71%) were positive for both HBsAg and anti HCV. Fifty six patients (20%) were negative for seromarkers of both hepatitis B & C viruses.Conclusion: It is evident form this study that Hepatitis C is a leading cause of cirrhosis in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan, followed by HBV.

Objective: To find out the effect of decreased amniotic fluid index (AFI) on adverse pregnancy outcome at term. Methodology: This experimental study was conducted at Gynae "B" unit Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar from September 2004 to August 2005. A total of 100 pregnant women admitted in labour ward were included in the study. Fifty cases with an amniotic fluid index of <5cm comprised the patient group. Fifty controls having AFI>5cm were matched with the cases regarding age (Â±3years), parity and antenatal complication (hypertension, diabetes). AApart from demographic details, maternal outcome measures such as induction of labour; mode of delivery; meconium stained liquor; and fetal outcome measures such as Apgar score and admission to neonatal intensive care unit were recorded on a semi structured proforma for both the groups and analyzed by Chi square test using SPSS v 11. Results: Labour induction was significantly higher in patients having AFI<5cm as compared to the control group (p-value=0.009). Meconium stained liquor (p-value=0.023) and cesarean section rate for fetal distress (p-value=0.000) were higher in patients having AFI<5cm. Neonatal complications were found to be more frequent in the patients having AFI<5cm and these include, low Apgar score <7 (p=0.001) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (p=0.078). There was no perinatal mortality in both the groups. Conclusion: Amniotic fluid index of <5cm was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in the form of meconium stained liquor, induction of labour, cesarean section for fetal distress, low Apgar score and neonatal intensive care unit admission.

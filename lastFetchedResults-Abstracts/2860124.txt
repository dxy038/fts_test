The reduction of energy costs of manufacturing technologies is both an important and current objective for factory operators. But mostly, this idea to reduce the energy consumption is being implemented after the manufacturing technologies are installed. However, it would be more advantageous if efforts were made to save energy during the early planning process. To achieve an estimation of the energy consumption in this early planning stage, a new suitable forecast method is required. Therefore, this paper shows how the prospective energy consumption can be determined by using Methods-Energy Measurement (MEM). Based on the needs of production planners, future challenges and requirements for MEM are listed. Further-more, the concept of basic energy elements and their value determination techniques are introduced, and different possibilities are outlined and assessed. For an easier determination of the energy demands of a complex production cell or manufacturing equipment, standard equipment patterns will be designed. This template supports both planners and decision-makers to create reliable and standardized Resource Performance Indicators (RPI). Subsequently, the architecture of the MEM-calculation model is presented. This approach enables a holistic estimation of the energy consumption of manufacturing technologies and leads to higher levels of transparency. Furthermore, MEM contributes to identify and realize sustainable solutions in advance and as a result, increases the profitability of a factory.

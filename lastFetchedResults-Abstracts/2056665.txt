The main objective of this article is to study and analyze the process of revolution in Bahrain. With an overview, condition inside Bahrain following the revolution on Feb 14th 2011 and evidence of reasons for its failure have been studied. This question is raised that why the revolution in Bahrain has not toppled the ruling system yet. In response, studying different aspects of Islamic awakening and a comparative study of recent developments, this point is emphasized that Bahrainis' revolution has been depicted as unimportant and oppressed due to regional measures supporting Al Khalifa by Saudi Arabia on one hand and geopolitical importance of Bahrain for the United States. Therefore it seems that the importance of a small country such as Bahrain due to its strategic position neighboring oil-rich parts of eastern Saudi Arabia and being located in oil route of Persian Gulf have added to the scope of failure of the revolution in this country. Bahraini revolution is in a transition period which is comprehensible through defining an instability period and a limited predictability; since the orientation and the path of this deep social revolution is still unclear.

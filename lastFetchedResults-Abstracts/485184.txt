Background and Objective: Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is an infectious
disease in human which kills nearly three millions of people annually. Approximately, one - third of the
world populations are infected with this bacteria and 5 - 10% ofthem develop the active form of the disease.
Individuals are different in susceptibility to TB infection. These differences might be due to the host
characteristics especially genetic factors. TNF-a as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, playa key role in host
defense against tuberculosis. Presence of mutation in this gene can influence the effectiveness, performance
and capability of immune responses against TB infection. The Aim of this study was to investigate the
frequency ofTNF-a gene polymorphisms and its relation with susceptibility to the pulmonary TB.
Materials and Methods: Sixty healthy controls and 60 TB patients were enrolled. Genotype ofTNF.2]8, TNF
.244, TNF.J08, TNF -'57 and TNF.86J were determined using PCR-RFLP method. The results were analyzed by
Fisher Exact and X2 tests using SPSS v.14 and evaluated with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Results; The results of this study showed a significant di ITerence in TNF.,,,, and TNF ."7 regions between the
control and study groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Presence of mutation in TNF.30R and TNF .857 regions may increase the host susceptibility to
mycobacterium 'tuberculosis and genotyping of these regions can be used for screening of the high risk
individuals.

The primary objective of this paper is to develop a comprehensive method to learn the effect of knowledge management (KM) practices on organizational performance. The balanced scorecard (BSC) is applied to materialize this comprehensiveness. In order to prevent research dispersion, the selective indicators in KM are oriented to some critical success factors influencing KM implementation. In addition, the mentioned effect is analyzed by path analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate that KM practices maintain some impacts on the overall performance. Finally, KM practices only influence learning and growth among dimensions of BSC, significantly. Likewise, data analysis states other significant impact among performance dimensions in terms of BSC model.

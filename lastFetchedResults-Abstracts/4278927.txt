TD Based On LCC expands tolerance optimization based on the manufacturing cost to the product life cycle cost and The objective is to improve product quality to the six sigma level and keep lower LCC simultaneously. A set of new tolerance-LCC models are developed and integrated into Life Cycle Six Sigma(LCSS) methodology to realize the objectives of high quality and lower life cycle total cost.

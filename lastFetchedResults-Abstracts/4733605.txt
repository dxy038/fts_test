We present here a microfabrication process for multi-layer metal, multi-site, polymer-based neural probes. The process has been used to generate 1-, 2-, and 4-layer trace metal neural probes with highly uniform and reproducible electrode characteristics. Typically, increasing the number of metal layers is assumed to both reduce the width of the neural probes and minimize the injury and glial scarring caused at the implantation site. We show, however, that increasing the number of trace metal layers does not always result in the minimal probe cross-sectional area. A thorough design analysis reveals that the electrode size, along with other design parameters, have interacting effects on the probe cross-sectional area. Moreover, increasing the trace metal layers in the neural probes also increases the design and fabrication cost/time, as well as the likelihood of probe failure. Consequently, all of these factors must be considered when designing a multi-site, neural probe with the objective of minimizing tissue damage.

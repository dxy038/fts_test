In the French context of the health expenses control, the operating theatre planning, that represents 9% of hospitalÂ´s annual budget, presents a stake of first importance. The realization of the operating theatre planning is the fruit of the negotiation between the different actors of the block whose constraints and interests are often different. In this paper, we propose an algorithm of construction of an estimable planning, based on constraints satisfaction programming and whose objective is the minimization of the risk of no realization (RNR) of the planning. We present the results obtained at the time of the implementation of this model on a whole scenario of interventions to plan. Finally, we simulate the proposed planning in order to study the variations of RNR: robustness indicator and other performance productivity indicators.

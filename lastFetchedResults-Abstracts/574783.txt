Introduction & Objective: Etiological researches suggest that biopsychosocial dimensions are responsible for coronary heart disease (CHD). The main goal of the present research was to compare stressful life events and stress coping strategies in coronary heart patients (Acute Myocardial Infarction) and non-patients. 
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional research 102 patients (all males ) suffering from acute myocardial infarction and 162 non-patient individuals after matching were studied and compared with regard to psychosocial life events and stress coping strategies through coping response inventory (Moos, 1993) , scaling of life Events (paykel , 1971) and researcher made questionnaire. 
Results: The result established that myocardial infarction patients experienced more stress than the control group during one year before heart- attack and they used more inadequate stress coping strategies comparing with the control individuals. 
Conclusion: This study showed that stress and inadequate coping strategies are important variables for the development of coronary heart diseases.

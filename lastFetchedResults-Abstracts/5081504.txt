Wireless Sensor Network is one of the 21 ideals in 21 century, and health care is one of its many applications. Generally speaking, there are two keys for the successful construction of Wireless Sensor Network, one it the editing of appropriate data transfer protocol at the front end of the network, the next is the possession of robust database and effective network platform in the back end that can meet the need of the users. Based on the above two requirements, the customized wireless physiological sensor network designed by this research is based on the real environment of health care room, under the premise of "customer is number 1", comfortable equipment, effective database and simple network system are used to achieve the objective of omnipresent health care. Based on the experience and technology obtained from this real application, we hope to build more complicated U-healthcare system to be used by the health service center.

Background & Objective: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies in the world and an important public health problem in developing countries, especially among children and women. The objective of this research was determination of the effect of education on knowledge, attitude & practice (KAP) of mid- school girls about         iron-deficiency anemia.
Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 600 mid-school students were randomly selected and divided in two groups (300 students each group). Data were collected by a questionnaire.
A pre-test was taken for each group and 8 weeks after intervention (implementation of learning by lecture, discussion and distributing pamphlet), a post-test was taken. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistic using SPSS 11.5/win.
Results: Findings indicated no statistically significant difference between KAP among two groups after intervention. Logistic regression test showed that, father's education and job title were predictive factors.     
Conclusion: Implementation of longer period of educational programs and applying new educational methods to improve student's KAP on IDA are recommended.

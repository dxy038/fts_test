The research on the topological structure of major efficient solution set and optimal solution set is an important research topic in the study of multi-objective optimization. In this paper, the concept and properties of generalized &#945; - major optimal solution of infinite-dimensional multiobjective decisionmaking problem are studied. Under the condition that objective mapping is cone H<sub>&#945;</sub>-quasiconvex and cone H<sub>&#945;</sub>-bounded, the connectedness theorems of generalized &#945; - major optimal solution set are obtained and proven for infinite-dimensional multi-objective decision-making problems.

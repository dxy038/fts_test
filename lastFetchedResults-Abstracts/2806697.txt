The energy demand over the years has increased significantly over the year where as the supply of energy from the fossil fuels are continuously reducing at a faster rate. This has turned attention towards the non-conventional renewable sources of energy. One of such energy is wave energy. An oscillating water column (OWC) contributes to harnessing of wave energy. OWC is a cylindrical chamber, which encloses a bidirectional turbine. The turbine coupled with a generator captures and converts the mechanical energy into usable form of energy.

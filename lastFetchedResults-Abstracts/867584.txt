Complex production systems can produce more than one part type. For these systems, production rate
and priority of production for each part type is determined by production controllers. In this paper,
genetic fuzzy logic control (GFLC) methodology is used to develop two production control architectures
namely ‘‘genetic distributed fuzzy” (GDF), and ‘‘genetic supervisory fuzzy” (GSF) controllers. Previously
these controllers have been applied to single-part-type production systems. In the new approach the
GDF and GSF controllers are developed to control complex production systems. The methodology is illustrated
and evaluated using two test cases; two-part-type production line and re-entrant production systems.
Genetic algorithm is used to tune the membership functions of input variables of GSF or GDF
controllers. The objective function of the GSF controller minimizes the production cost based on workin-
process (WIP) and backlog costs, while surplus minimization is considered by GDF controller. The
results show that GDF and GSF controllers can improve the performance of production systems. GSF controllers
decrease the WIP level and its variations. GDF controllers show their abilities in reducing the
backlog level but generally, production cost for GDF controller is greater than GSF controller.

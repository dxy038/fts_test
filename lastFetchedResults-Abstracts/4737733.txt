The proposal of a centralized connection admission control (CAC) procedure in the network control center of a satellite DVB-RCS system, harmonized with techniques of request scheduling, is the main objective of this work. The behavior of such DVB-RCS system architecture, that uses a multispot beam geostationary satellite with regenerative payload, is deeply analyzed and tested. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques guarantees a good QoS to all supported service classes. Particular attention is offered to RBDC traffic sources because they are more sensitive to the delay jitter and consequently they are harder to manage.

The main objective of the present study was to meticulously investigate an inclusive set of physicochemical and handle properties (determined through Kawabata evaluation system) of bioscoured cotton fabrics. The application of a commercial pectinase preparation, Bioprep 3000L, for a range of concentrations and treatment times, could create a pectin-free textile with low wax content. Multiple regression analysis was used to describe the effect of enzymatic process variables on pectin and waxes removal.
Comparison of fabricsâ€™ properties such as wettability, whiteness, crystallinity index, and dyeing behaviour, confirmed that bioscouring could be as much effective as the conventional alkaline process. Uncovering the relationship between the composition of materials and their physicochemical properties was attempted. The application of higher enzyme concentrations generated fabrics with improved low-stress mechanical properties. Bending and shear rigidity, compressional resilience, as well as, extensibility of enzymatically treated cotton fabrics could be efficiently predicted by means of a single independent variable, the crystallinity index.

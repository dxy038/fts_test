Objective.
To review the existing research on physical activity and parenthood in order to establish direction for future research.
Method.

Articles were limited to English peer-reviewed journals, published from 1989 to 2007. Major findings from 25 independent samples were summarized based on common subtopics of: physical activity of parents compared to non-parents, physical activity barriers, employment and marital status, number of children, and theory-based work applied to parents.
Results.

Parenthood and physical activity involvement showed a negative relationship (meta-analytic d = 0.41 to 0.48, correcting for sampling error) when compared to non-parents. Mothers were generally less active than fathers. Associations were found between specific barriers and parental physical activity, but the relationship between physical activity and marital/employment status as well as number/age of children was inconsistent. Finally, the use of theoretical models applied to understanding early family development and physical activity has been limited.
Conclusions.

Parents with dependent children are clearly more inactive than non-parents and the topic has received disproportionably scant research considering the size of the effect. Current research has largely been focused on mothers, and has relied heavily on cross-sectional designs and self-report measures. Future work should focus on longitudinal designs across family development, gender and role interactions, and include social ecological frameworks and objective physical activity measurement.

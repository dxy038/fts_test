In this study at first, the transient performance of an solar absorption cooling  system  is simulated for an educational place in Tehran with a 1600 m^2 area by the commercial TRANSYS software including flat plate collector, stratification storage tank, natural gas fired auxiliary boiler, cooling tower, fan coil and etc, then The effects of different parameters such as collector’s area and slope, tank’s volume and auxiliary heater’s set temperature on the system performance from energetic and economic points of view are also studied and in the final step Two-objective optimization of solar absorption cooling system based on the solar fraction and life cycle saving as in objective functions is carried out by means of genetic algorithms and GMDH neural network. Simulation results of cooling system show that the best temperature of heater has to be set as minimum in the operating range. Moreover, with changing in collector area and tank volume simultaneously, it is observed that maximum solar fraction is captured with maximum collector area and maximum tank volume, and also maximum life cycle saving is captured with minimum collector area and minimum tank volume in present range. The final results indicate that the energy and economical performance stand inopposite behavior.

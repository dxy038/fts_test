In this paper, we investigate the ability of improved version of Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, namely SPEA2, as a multi-objective Algorithm. This algorithm is applied to design two power system stabilizers (PSSs) coordinately for multi-machine power system to damp the inter-area oscillation. To fulfill this desire, the parameters of the PSSs are coordinately determined by SPEA2 using two eigenvalue-based objective functions. Numerical results are presented on a 2-area 4-machines system to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method. In addition, to validate the results obtained by the SPEA2, the Real Genetic Algorithm (RGA) and the Real Immune Algorithm (RIA) are compared. A one line to ground fault is applied at a bus to show the effectiveness of the designed controllers. The simulation study shows that the performance of the proposed controller by SPEA2 performs better than RGA and RIA in finding the solution.

Cloud computing has emerged during the last decade to be widely adopted nowadays in several IT areas. It consists to propose market or not market-oriented resources as services that can be consumed in a ubiquitous, flexible and transparent way. In this paper, we deal with scheduling, one of the major cloud computing issue. According to the targeted cloud configuration, the addressed objectives and the accuracy of the view that one have of the cloud, we propose a taxonomy that identifies three levels of scheduling: service-level, task-level and Virtual Machine-level. We compare different cloud scheduling approaches from the literature and identify the common features and the differences between all the approaches according to each cloud scheduling level using different criteria. The reported results of the comparison show inter alia a weakness in the proposed schedulers, almost no Pareto multi-objective solving algorithms and very few realistic experiments facing the real cloud constraints.

This paper discusses the implementation of a mobile vaccine refrigeration system in eastern Kenya. The project objective was enabling the transportation of vaccines, while maintaining the cold chain in a remote area that lacks reliable electricity supply. Two parallel photovoltaic (PV) power systems were sized and installed. One of the PV systems was stationary, while the other was integrated and fitted on a truck used for the transportation of vaccines.

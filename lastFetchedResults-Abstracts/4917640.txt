The promise of ATM includes cost efficiency through consolidation of application-specific networks, as well as the opportunity to expand service offerings. But the goal of achieving efficiency in an ATM network competes with the goal of maintaining QoS. The objective, then of advanced traffic management, is efficiency with integrity: obtaining a statistical multiplexing gain, under high traffic loads, for diverse traffic types, while maintaining isolation between traffic classes, and fairness between users within each class

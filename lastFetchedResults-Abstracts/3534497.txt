The multiobjective optimization problem is of interest in almost all EM design problems. Fuzzy logic can be used in the definition of a decision making scheme for a compromise between conflicting objective functions. In the proposed approach a fuzzy &#8220;global performance&#8221; index of the design is defined. This parameter can be optimized by any scalar optimization algorithm. The fuzzyfication process, based on a set of linguistic rules defined by the user, is explained. Results obtained on multiobjective optimization problems, which show the good performance of the proposed approach, are presented and discussed. The problems discussed are the design of DC electromagnets and superconducting magnetic energy storage devices

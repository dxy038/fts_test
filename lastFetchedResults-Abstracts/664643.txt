The results of an integrated geochemical and mineralogical study conducted at the Agnico-Eagle gold-mine tailings impoundment, Joutel, Québec, are correlated with bacterial populations determined from an enumeration of 3 groups of Thiobacilli. The tailings were determined to contain approximately 5 wt.% sulphide–S, predominantly as pyrite, and up to 30 wt.% carbonate minerals, chiefly as dolomite–ankerite and siderite. The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential for the development of acidic drainage and dissolved-metal migration in carbonate-rich tailings impoundments, and to compare the results of the geochemical and microbiological characterization of the tailings. Sulphide-oxidation reactions have proceeded to a depth of 20–100 cm below the tailings surface. Pyrrhotite consistently shows more alteration than pyrite and arsenopyrite. Pyrrhotite is altered mainly through the replacement by goethite. The most abundant Thiobacilli are neutrophilic bacteria of the Thiobacillus thioparus type. The maximum most probable number values for these bacteria occur 20–40 cm below the tailings surface, a depth that coincides with the disappearance of oxide coatings. This observation, coupled with the sharp decline in gas-phase O2 concentration, suggests that rapid bacterially-mediated S–oxidation is occurring at this depth. The pore-water pH throughout the tailings varies between 6.5 and 8.5; no low-pH waters were observed in the impoundment. These neutral pH conditions are attributed to the effect of acid-consuming carbonate-mineral dissolution reactions, which are also indicated by increased concentrations of Mg and Ca and alkalinity in the shallow zone of the tailings. As a result of these acid-neutralization reactions, dissolved metal concentrations are low.

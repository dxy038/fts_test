Bulky electrolytic capacitors, which are often needed in dc systems to filter out voltage ripples, considerably reduce power density and system reliability. In this paper, a ripple eliminator, which is a bidirectional buck-boost converter terminated with an auxiliary capacitor, is adopted to replace bulky capacitors in dc systems. The voltage ripples on the terminals (i.e., the dc bus) can be transferred to the auxiliary capacitor, and the ripples on the auxiliary capacitor can vary in a wide range. Moreover, the average voltage of the auxiliary capacitor can be controlled either lower or higher than the dc-bus voltage, which offers a wide operational range for the ripple eliminator and also the possibility of further reducing the auxiliary capacitance. Hence, the total capacitance required can be much smaller than the originally needed. After proposing a control strategy to transfer the voltage ripples to the auxiliary capacitor, three control strategies are proposed to regulate the auxiliary-capacitor voltage to maintain proper operation. Intensive experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance.

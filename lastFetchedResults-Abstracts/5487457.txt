This paper proposes an input-series-output-parallel bidirectional dc-dc converter with an identically distributed control for 20 kVA solid state transformer. The proposed ISOP converter employs ZVS technique combined with low-voltage MOSFETs to achieve low switching and conduction losses under high frequency operation, and therefore high efficiency and high power density. The proposed control scheme provides plug-and-play capability and high-level fault-tolerance. Another advantage is the power rating can be easily extended further by directly connecting multiple ISOP converters in input-parallel-out-parallel. Finally, the simulation and experimental results of an ISOP converter consisting of three modules are presented to verify the theoretical analysis.

The probabilistic and the possibilistic methods of safety evaluation of structure under uncertain parameters
have been developed independently.When the structural system is defined with some of the input parameters
as possibilistic and others are sufficient enough to model as probabilistic, available literatures normally
start with either probabilistic or possibilistic description of all the variables. This may pose restriction
on necessary flexibility to the designer at early stage of modelling of the structural system. The primary
objective of the present work is to critically examine various emerging methods of transformation of the
possibilistic variables to equivalent probabilistic variables so that probabilistic safety evaluation approach
becomes compatible with the nature and quality of the input data. Relying on the fundamental concept
of equivalent transformations, i.e. the entropy based transformation and the scaling of fuzzy membership
function, the reliability analysis is proposed in the framework of second moment format. In doing so,
the bounds on the reliability indices based on the evidence theory are also obtained encompassing the
first-order reliability analysis for consistent comparison among alternative transformations. Finally, the
reliability computation under hybrid uncertainty is elucidated numerically with examples for comparative
study on the suitability of the transformation alternatives. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

Quaternized chlorpromazine, triflupromazine, and promethazine derivatives were synthesized and examined as antitubercular agents against both actively growing and non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Impressively, several compounds inhibited non-replicating M. tuberculosis at concentrations equal to or double their MICs against the actively growing strain. All active compounds were non-toxic toward Vero cells (IC50 > 128 Î¼M). N-Allylchlorpromazinium bromide was only weakly antitubercular, but replacing allyl with benzyl or substituted benzyl improved potency. An electron-withdrawing substituent on the phenothiazine ring was also essential. Branching at the carbon chain decreased antitubercular activity. The optimum antitubercular structures possessed N-(4- or 3-chlorobenzyl) substitution on triflupromazine.

This paper proposes two new distributed signaling protocols for fast automatic setup and tear-down of paths across the emerging interconnection models for IP-over-optical-networks. The first scheme is probe flooding-based routing (PFBR) algorithm with backward reservation while the second scheme is based on an adaptive routing algorithm called multi-path routing (MPR) where k paths are probed simultaneously. Our objective in developing these protocols is twofold: first, to simplify the specific signaling protocols or algorithms in the components of MPLS control plane; and second, to adapt the performance optimization algorithm to the requirements of different user applications by having the flexibility to vary the relative weight assigned to each of three performance metrics [call acceptance rate (CAR), call set-up time (CST), and routing distance (RD)]

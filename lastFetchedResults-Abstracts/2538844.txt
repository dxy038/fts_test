Background  Objectives: Kidney patients in each dialysis cycle are exposed to extremely large volume of water, which is in direct contact with the patientrsquo;s blood . Therefore, water used for this purpose should be treated with advanced methods before use for dialysis. The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of reverse osmosis systems to improve water quality used for dialysis fluid.

Material  Methods: This is a descriptiveanalytic study to Evaluation of Reverse Osmosis System of water treatment system for dialysis centers in Imam Alinbsp; Bojnurd ciry during 2015on 36 samples of water from the municipal water was reverse osmosis. Postharvest and transport of samples to the laboratory using the latest according to the standard methods for water and wastewater examination.

Results: The results of this study showed that the reverse osmosis systems significantly reduce the

amount of sulfate, nitrate, fluoride, hardness, sodium, potassium.nbsp; These amounts were lower than AAMI and EPH standards. 

Conclusion: Reverse osmosis systems could improve the quality of water used for hemodialysis. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that ahh the measured parameters in the hospitals werw below the standard levels. , indicating that removal efficiency reverse osmosis system parameters is desirable.

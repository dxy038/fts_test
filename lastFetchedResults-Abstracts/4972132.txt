Cognitive radio technology is considered to be an effective solution to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency. The dynamic spectrum allocation algorithm assigns the available spectrum to the secondary users. In this paper, we propose a spectrum allocation algorithm based on the graph-coloring theory. Unlike some already existed allocation algorithm, our algorithm considers the bandwidth matching between secondary usersÂ´ bandwidth requirements and the available channels. The interference avoidance to the primary users is also taken into account. Our objective is to optimize the total spectrum reward under the premise of fully protecting the primary users. Simulation results prove that this algorithm can improve the total spectrum reward, the satisfaction rate of secondary users, the protection rate of primary users, and the spectrum allocation efficiency.

The accurate selection of Web services is an important guarantee to develop the mature Web services technology. A three-part determining QoS model is proposed to improve the selection accuracy. The QoS Information Analyst role, which receives usersÂ´ feedback and analysis property of the collected information, is added to the model. A single task Web service set is selected by the multi-objective optimization algorithm in the model. Instance of Web service selection results from our prototype system implementation highlight the correctness of our solution.

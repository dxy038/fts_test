The environmental concern over the use of depleted uranium (DU) alloys as kinetic-energy (KE) penetrator for high strain rate applications has focussed the interest in tungsten alloys. However, in general, tungsten-based alloys exhibit about 10% lower performance than DU at high strain rate. This paper provides an update on some of the processing strategies adopted for fulfilling this objective.

Lying is a deliberate attempt to transmit messages that mislead others. Analysis of language behaviors
holds great promise as an objective method of detecting deception. The current study reports on the
frequency of use and acoustic nature of “um” and “like” during laboratory-elicited lying versus truthtelling.
Results obtained using a within-participants false opinion paradigm showed that instances of
“um” occur less frequently and are of shorter duration during lying compared to truth-telling. There
were no significant differences in relation to “like.” These findings contribute to our understanding
of the linguistic markers of deception behavior. They also assist in our understanding of the role
of “um” in communication more generally. Our results suggest that “um” may not be accurately
conceptualized as a filled pause/hesitation or speech disfluency/error whose increased usage coincides
with increased cognitive load or increased arousal during lying. It may instead carry a lexical status
similar to interjections and form an important part of authentic, effortless communication, which is
somewhat lacking during lying.

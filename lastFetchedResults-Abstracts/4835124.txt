The objective image quality evaluation model for coded image without using the reference is very useful for quality oriented image compression. In this paper, a new objective no-reference (NR) image quality evaluation model for JPEG coded image is presented, which is easy to calculate and applicable to various image processing applications. The proposed model is based on the local features information of the image such as edge, flat and texture area and also on the blockiness, activity measures, and zero crossing rate within block of the image. Our experiments on various image distortion types indicate that it performs significantly better than the conventional model.

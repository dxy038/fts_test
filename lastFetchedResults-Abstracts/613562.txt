Methods: This descriptive analytic-cross sectional study was conducted on 91 ICU nurses and data were gathered using a two-part tool consisting demographic data and REBA worksheet. Data were gathered by self-report(for demographic data) and observation(for environmental factors and  REBA) and descriptive and analytical tests were used data analysis using  SPSS17software.
Results: This survey showed that  REBA score in the majority of  intensive care units nurses (77.7%) was 4-7(medium risk with necessary need to change). The most ergonomic problem with level of moderate or more was seen in wrist area. Unfortunately, only 19.4% of samples had desirable ergonomic posture that had significant relationship with sample's work  position (P > 0.007) and less work experience years in ICU(P > 0.0001).  
Conclusion: In attention to unsatisfactory ergonomic in more than 80% of nurses while changing patients’ position, it is necessery to pay more attention and determine effective factors and necessery plans to improve body ergonomic to improve body posture and finally decrease injuries in nurses

In this paper, a constraint handling technique for multi-objective optimization of analog cells is presented. Selection-based constraint handling and fuzzy membership functions are combined to construct a new constraint handling method, multi-objective fuzzy selection (MOFS). This is integrated with multi-objective sizing, which has the following two advantages: (1) enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of handling specifications distinctly; (2) specializes in solving multi-objective analog sizing problems mimicking the designerÂ´s interactive design process, avoiding inflexibility of crisp constraint sizing methods.

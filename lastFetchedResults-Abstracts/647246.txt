The objective of using Sorbalit® (a mixture of “lime and carbon”) is to keep the limit of 0,1 ng TE/Nm3 for dioxines and furanes. The measurement results obtained from various plants all show emission values in purified gas that are considerably lower than 0,1 ng TE/Nm3. Very low values are equally obtained for other organic pollutants. Measurement results for the concentration of dioxines and furanes in the residual material are now. available from a wide range of plants. What is remarkable is the fact that all values registered so far have been below 1,000 ng/Nm3. For all plants operation along the principle of the “polishing filter” this process variant is the simplest, safest and cheapest way of coping with the problem of residual material and also takes into account the requirement of minimisation of residual materials.

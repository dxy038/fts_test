Summary form only given, as follows. The authors have developed a FEM software package for electromagnetism implementing the stages of preprocessing, solution and postprocessing. Portability and state-of-the-art algorithms were the initial premises taken into account in the design. To accomplish them, C++ language was chosen, having been successfully compiled in several Unix platforms. The main objective of this paper is to provide a general description, showing how the software package is structured using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). This language is being considered as an international standard (ISO) for information technology. The design will be described by using diagrams provided by UML to show its internal structure and behaviour. A class diagram, showing that the class problem is composed by a mesh (Mesh), the properties of the materials, including the loads, and the boundary conditions (material and BC).

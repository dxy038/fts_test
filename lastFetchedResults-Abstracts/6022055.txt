Studies have shown the importance of fish fins for cruising and accelerating. The fish moves its body and fins by the strength of muscles, which results in a reaction that allows the fish to cruise. The main objective of biomimetic robotic fish is to achieve these functions with mechanical equivalents. This leads to research and development of different types of robotic fish. To extend the modular and slider concepts developed in a previous work, the present work aims to design a compact undulating fin mechanism and study the dimensions for optimal workspace. Anguilliform is the type of undulatory modes of fish swimming considered in this work. This type of fish, like eels, generates propulsion by a muscle wave in its body, which progresses from head to tail. The proposed fin mechanism can also be used to imitate anal fins of knifefish. By going through the conceptual phase and motion studies, a robotic undulating finned body in modular and compact forms has been designed and constructed together with the currently developing control and power units. The prototype is being tested for the performance evaluation of speed and thrust force.

This paper proposes a new method for detection of the vortex presence in fluid flow based on an active acoustic system. The experiment that validates the theory was done on a reduced scale facility using ultrasonic transceivers. The main objective was to highlight the effect of a cavitation vortex on an applied wide band signal. In order to accomplish that, the Recurrence Plot Analysis (RPA) was investigated which emhasizes similar states of a dynamic process. The Tests were done from no vortex cavitation flow to vortex cavitation flow and backward.

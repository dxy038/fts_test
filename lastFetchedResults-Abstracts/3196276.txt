Manager is an articulate person, since managing is an art. Quantitative analysis about such person is vital. Workers are the essential part of any organization. Opinion mining is an important mechanism needed to measure the performance of top positioned workers. The main objective of this paper is to design a tool that will give opinion of the manager with respect to their attributes. Here relevant features of managers such as decision making, knowledge, communication skill, humility, inspiration and integrity are considered with weighted value. Subordinates view about their cardinality of that team leader are taken into consideration. Applying the mathematical model to the view points, reveals about their status, which is assigned with `moderate´, `good´ and `excellent´. This study also enhances that report by some more intrinsic feasible report about them. By this report, organization head may take decision on project allocation and provides suggestions to enhance their performance.

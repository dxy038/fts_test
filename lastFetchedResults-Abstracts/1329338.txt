This paper presents a comparison between the performance predicted by a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model and experimental measurements taken using a commercially available vortex tube. Specifically, the measured exit temperatures into and out of the vortex tube are compared with the CFD model. The data and the model are both verified using global mass and energy balances. The CFD model is a two-dimensional (2D) steady axisymmetric model (with swirl) that utilizes both the standard and renormalization group (RNG) k-epsilon turbulence models. While CFD has been used previously to understand the fluid behavior internal to the vortex tube, it has not been applied as a predictive model of the vortex tube in order to develop a design tool that can be used with confidence over a range of operating conditions and geometries. The objective of this paper is the demonstration of the successful use of CFD in this regard, thereby providing a powerful tool that can be used to optimize vortex tube design as well as assess its utility in the context of new applications.

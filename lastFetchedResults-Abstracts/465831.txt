Abstract
Objective:
Human and ovine fetuses demonstrate an enhanced rate of spontaneous and angiotensin II-stimulated swallowing. Angiotensin II and nitric oxide synthase have been localized to thirst centers in the brain. This study was performed to determine whether central nitric oxide contributes to the regulation of angiotensin II-induced fetal swallowing.
Study Design:
Six pregnant ewes with near-term singleton fetuses were chronically prepared with fetal vascular and lateral ventricle catheters and electrocorticogram and esophageal electromyogram electrodes. After a 2-hour control period, fetuses were administered serial lateral ventricle injections (1 mL) of angiotensin II (32 pg; time, 2 hours) and Nta-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (3 mg; time, 3 hours) and a repeat angiotensin II injection (3.2 Wg; time, 5 hours). All fetuses received an additional control study of lateral ventricle injections of artificial cerebrospinal fluid on a previous day.
Results:
Angiotensin II injection significantly increased meant SEM fetal swallowing (0.9:t 0.1 to 2.7:t 0.4 swallows/min). Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester significantly decreased fetal swallowing to below the basal rate (0.4 ± 0.1 swaliowstmin), and swallowing did not increase with the second angiotensin II dose (in the presence of nitric oxide blockade).
Conclusions:
These results demonstrate that inhibition of central nitric oxide suppresses fetal swallowing behavior in response to central angiotensin II. We speculate that tonic nitric oxide facilitates angiotensin II swallowing stimulation by maintenance of glutamate activation of hypothalamic AI-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.

The major objective of this paper is to report on the designed framework for utilizing IT to enhance knowledge sharing (KS) among educators. By using existing constructs derived from the information systems theories, namely: Social Exchange Theory (SET), Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Based on the three existing theories tested, 17 selected secondary schools were chosen as a case study in Tshwane South district. 103 questionnaires were distributed among the mathematics and science teachers in 17 different schools in Tshwane South district. Out the 103 distributed questionnaires only 96 were returned giving a response rate of 93.2%. A total of 84 were usable for data analysis and the other questionnaires were discarded due to the fact that, some of the questionnaires had missing information. This response rate was considered highly enough when compared to the number of mathematics and science educators per school. However, the 84 returned questionnaires were analysed by using SPSS. Based on the findings, this study indicates that higher levels of praise, recognition, respect, prestige and image of the educators increase knowledge sharing in the developed framework.

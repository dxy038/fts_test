A new version of the Residual Excited Linear Predictive (RELP) vocoder has been simulated. The objective has been to reduce the data rate required for good quality speech to 4.8 kbps. Results have indicated that it is possible to remove the hoarseness currently associated with low data rate RELP speech. Development of a pitch predictive ADPCM residual encoder and preliminary results on new harmonic generation techniques are discused. Taped demonstrations will be played at the conference.

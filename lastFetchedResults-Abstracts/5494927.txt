Stratified genetic algorithm was used in the optimized calculation of Wanjiazhai hydropower station, a multi-objective optimized model was established, two sub-populations of independent parallel were used to compute, the calculated values of network model and test values were compared, results showed that the two values are matched, the value of optimized load pressure fluctuation deviates from the average in 3mH2O, the actual power flow is also less, it is propitious to improve economic efficiency of the hydropower station.

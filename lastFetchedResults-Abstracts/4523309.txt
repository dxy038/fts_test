The objective of the paper is to motivate the use of neural networks and genetic algorithms to optimize a concrete mixture where it is used the tezontle as raw material in the production of conventional blocks. The paper describes the results of an experimental study to determine the engineering properties of a concrete mix using tezontle in coarse and fine size as aggregate substitutes. In addition, a model is generated and used to optimize the concrete mixture. It is shown that a substitute of a specific proportion of tezontle provides the desirable mechanical properties.

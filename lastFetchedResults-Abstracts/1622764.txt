The main objective of this research was to determine quantitatively the amount of structural sugar polymers (glucan, mannan, and xylan) and acid lignin, after decaying of a conifer wood Cupressus glauca Lam., exposed to brown-rot fungi Gloeophyllum trabeum (Persoon ex Fries) Murril. and Lentinus lepideus Fr. and white-rot fungi Trametes versicolor (Linnaeus ex Fries) Pilat and Ganoderma applanatum (Pers. ex Wallr.) Patouillard. Extractive and ash contents were homogeneous and showed low value. Chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques were important tools for detecting changes in the wood chemical composition. White-rot fungi showed two different class resistances with almost unchanged decay wood constituents. Brown-rot fungi removed the polysaccharides but not lignin. G. trabeum and L. lepideus had similar effects on chemical composition of cypress wood. This cypress wood showed lower mannan contents than xylan.

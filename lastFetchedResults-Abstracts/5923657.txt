In this paper, the system suggested for improvement of Bit Error Rate (BER) in WLAN IEEE 802.11a with Radio over Fiber (RoF) technology in downlink system to increase reliability of the system and to make it flexible and satisfy the future requirements. The downlink blocks operating at 1550 nm using 50 Km bidirectional Single Mode Fiber (SMF) with 64 QAM modulations using RF modulated frequency 5.8 GHz (UNII) and 54 Mbps data rate. The improvement of BER of 802.11a is done by using QAM modulation and components of RoF likes using SMF and Bessel filter. The evaluation of performance of BER is done by using OPTISYSTEM for simulation results.

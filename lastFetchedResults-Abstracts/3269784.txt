This paper presents the design of single-stage amplifiers with enhanced DC gain without the need of using any cascode devices or any positive-feedback or feed-forward techniques. Instead, two voltage-combiners are used in replacement of the traditional tail current-source that is normally employed to bias the differential-pair. Simulation results of a properly optimized circuit example, using AIDA-C a state-of-the-art multi-objective multi-constraint circuit-level optimization tool, demonstrate that DC gains above 50 dB can be achieved, together with high energy efficiency (a figure-of-merit of about 1300 MHz-pF/mA has been achieved).

Three-dimensional (3-D) imaging and analysis techniques can be used to assess the organization of cells in biological tissues, providing key insights into the role of cell arrangement in growth, homeostasis, and degeneration. The objective of the present study was to use such methods to assess the growth-related changes in cell organization of articular cartilage from different sites in the bovine knee. Three-dimensional images of fetal, calf, and adult cartilage were obtained and processed to identify cell nuclei. The density of cells was lower with growth and with increasing depth from the articular surface. The cell organization, assessed by the angle to the nearest neighboring cell, also varied with growth, and reflected the classical organization of cells in adult tissue, with neighboring cells arranged horizontally in the superficial zone (average angle of 20°) and vertically in the deep zone (60°). In all other regions and growth stages of cartilage, the angle was  32°, indicative of an isotropic organization. On the contrary, the nearest neighbor distance did not vary significantly with growth or depth. Together, these results indicate that cartilage growth is associated with distinctive 3-D arrangements of groups of chondrocytes.

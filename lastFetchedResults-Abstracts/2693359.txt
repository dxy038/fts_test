Bandwidth is an extremely valuable and scarce resource in mobile networks; therefore, efficient mobility-aware bandwidth reservation is necessary to support multimedia applications (e.g., video streaming) that require quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we propose a distributed bandwidth reservation scheme called the mobility-prediction-aware bandwidth reservation (MPBR) scheme. The objective of MPBR is to reduce handoff call dropping rate and maintain acceptable new call blocking rate while providing efficient bandwidth utilization. MPBR consists of a handoff time estimation (HTE) scheme that aims to estimate the time windows when a user will perform handoffs along the path to his destination, an available bandwidth estimation (ABE) scheme that aims to estimate in advance available bandwidth, during the computed time windows in the cells to be traversed by the user to his destination, and an efficient call admission control (ECaC) scheme that aims to control bandwidth allocation in the network cells. The simulation results show that MPBR outperforms existing schemes in terms of reducing handoff call dropping rate.

In order to further improve the quickness and robustness of Generalized Predictive Control for Cascade System(CSGPC), a PI-Type Predictive Control for Cascade System (CPIPC) is proposed. This paper introduce Proportion-Integral structure in objective function of CSGPC and make full use of intermediate information of cascade system to feedback control in time for enhancing systemÂ´adaptive capacity and improveing the quality of control system. The results of simulation show this algorithm has better robustness ,quickness and immunity,and reduce influence of the model mismatch for cascade system.

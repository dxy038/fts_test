Most games and other interactive virtual environments focus on rendering natural phenomena in the most believable manner by using accurate visuals and physics. However, not much effort has been put into accounting for the physics of sound. The simulation of the real behavior of sound through an environment, when considering the speed of sound, reflection, and absorption, is computationally expensive and is usually left aside. In this work, an algorithm that calculates sound wave propagation using a finite difference method is used and extended to present a novel approach to sound rendering. This approach reaches the objective more quickly, and the sound generated has no perceptible loss of accuracy. The approach is designed to be implemented in GPU architectures and eventually enable real-time results.

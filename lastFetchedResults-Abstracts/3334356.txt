The objective of this study is to propose the master-slave tendon-driven haptic robot hand system using Twist Drive. Twist Drive is one of transmission systems which is consisted of a pair of strings and rotary motor. This transmission system converts torque into a high pulling force by using a pair of strings twisted on each other. In this paper, Twist Drive system is verified at first. Next, Twist Drive system is implemented to the master-slave tendon-driven robot hand system to realize the downsizing of the actuator part. In order to realize haptic transmission, a method which can achieve 4ch-bilateral control and tendon-driven control, simultaneously is implemented. Here, to achieve the tendon-driven control, a method to keep the wire tension using compliance control based on hybrid angle is realized. The effect of the proposed system is verified through experiments.

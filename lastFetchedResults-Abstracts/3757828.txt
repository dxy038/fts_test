A system designed to test a tracking theory for finding the position of an object in a scene, even when it is entering or exiting, is described. The design of a servo system used to move the camera while tracking the object is proposed. The technique involves the fundamental frequency of the Fourier transform of the vertical and horizontal projections of the image. This technique will work with stationary or moving objects as well as with a stationary or moving camera. The objective is to apply this technique to find the line between the camera and the object, such that the robot arm could follow that line until it encountered the object, and then seize it. This technique may also be useful in performing camera calibration

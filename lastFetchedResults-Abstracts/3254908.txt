The main objective of developing an image watermarking technique is to satisfy both imperceptibility and robustness requirements. To achieve this objective, a hybrid image watermarking scheme based on discrete wavelet transform and singular value decomposition is proposed in this paper. In our approach, the edge information of an image is used to embed the watermark. In addition, we apply the particle swarm optimization algorithm to search the proper value of scaling factor which is used to determine the watermark strength. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the proposed approach is able to withstand a variety of image processing attacks.

The objective of the present work is to introduce a theoretical analysis of the elastic–plastic bending of tubes and sections with different shapes. Analytical methods are given in the form of equations to provide a quantitative method for predicting the moment for forming the section of the tube to a specific radius of curvature. The springback and the residual stress distributions are determined. The results of tube bending of the strain hardening material which has a constitutive equation in the form σ = Cɛn were compared with the results obtained by Al-Qureshi [Al-Qureshi, H.A., 1999. Elastic–plastic analysis of tube bending. Int. J. Mach. Tools Manuf. 39, 87–104] for perfect plastic material. The results obtained show that the present analysis is more realistic to represent the material behavior since the applied constitutive equation is in the form of power law equation σ = Cɛn.

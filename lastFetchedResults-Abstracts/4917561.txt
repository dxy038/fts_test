Electro-hydraulic actuator (EHA) system inherently suffers from uncertainties, nonlinearities and time-varying in its model parameters which makes the modeling and controller designs are more complicated. The main objective of this paper is to perform a robust control design using discrete-time sliding mode control (DSMC) with two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) control strategy. The proposed controller consists of feedback and feedforward combination which capable to reduce phase lag and steady state error during the trajectory tracking of EHA system. The feedforward controller is developed by implementing the zero phase error tracking control (ZPETC) technique which the main difficulty arises from the nonminimum phase system with no stable inverse. A point-to-point trajectory is used in the experimental works to evaluate the performance of the DSMC. Experimental results reveal that the DMSC with 2-DOF control structure is highly robust and capable to deal with the uncertainties and disturbances occur during the position tracking control for different point of trajectories. It is also shows that the proposed controller can achieve better tracking performance as compared to conventional LQR and PID controller.

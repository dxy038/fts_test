Objective
t if three-dimensional (3D) cine spatial frequency-temporal frequency Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique (k-t BLAST) is suitable for rapid evaluation of global and regional left ventricular (LV) functional parameters and to evaluate the influence of gadolinium administration.
als and Methods
ters describing global and regional LV function were evaluated in 50 subjects using a two-dimensional (2D) steady-state free precession (SSFP) and pre- and postcontrast 3D k-t BLAST techniques. Data analyses included contrast-to-noise ratio analyses, and statistical evaluations included Bland–Altman, Cohen's kappa and analysis of variance techniques.
s
Altman analyses revealed that the ejection fraction computed using the 3D k-t BLAST sequences before (bias±2S.D., 2.2±8.8) and after contrast administration (bias±2S.D., 2.7±7.6 mol) was comparable to the 2D SSFP technique. Similar agreement was noted for other global LV parameters. The myocardium-to-blood contrast in the apical slices was better in the 3D k-t BLAST sequence after contrast administration than before. Cohen's kappa values demonstrated good agreement between the sequences for evaluating regional wall motion.
sions
 BLAST can yield global and regional LV functional parameters comparable to those of the 2D SSFP technique in substantially shorter scan times. In 3D k-t BLAST images, myocardium-to-blood contrast in the apical slices is better after contrast administration.

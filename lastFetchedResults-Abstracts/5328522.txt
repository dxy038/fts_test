A multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization was applied to minimize the peak side-lobe levels of polyfractal arrays at several frequencies. These optimized polyfractal arrays are then individually examined and shown to possess low peak side-lobe levels over an ultra-wide range of frequencies. The mainbeam is steered away from broadside to show that even when steered, these arrays have extremely large bandwidths

This paper presents an approach based on multi-agent system (MAS) for encapsulating the features of traditional applications also called legacy systems. We focus our interest particularly on legacy based on Comment Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) technology. The encapsulation main objective is to simplify the possibilities for integrating this kind of application in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). We design an interface using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE), which enables automatic generation of code for CORBA clients and ontology classes. The proposed system creates for each feature to wrap a representative agent, and allows the composition of functions according to predefined templates. The system uses the Web Service Integration Gateway (WSIG) to publish capacities of representative agents as web services that will be used in a SOA.

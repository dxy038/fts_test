A single event upset (SEU) can affect the correct operation of digital systems, such as memories and processors. This paper proposes Markov based models for analyzing the reliability and availability of different fault-tolerant memory arrangements under the operational scenario of an SEU. These arrangements exploit redundancy (either duplex or triplex replication) for dynamic fault-tolerant operation as provided by arbitration (for error detection and output selection) as well as in the presence of dedicated circuitry implementing different correction/detection codes for bit-flips as errors. The primary objective is to preserve either the correctness, or the fail-safe nature of the data output of the memory system for long mission time. It is shown that a duplex memory system encoded with error control codes has a higher reliability than the triplex arrangement. Moreover, the use of a code for single error correction and double error detection (SEC-DED) improves both availability and reliability compared to an error correction code with same error detection capabilities.

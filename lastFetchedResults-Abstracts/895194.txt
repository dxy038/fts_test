The synthesis of heat integrated multi-component distillation systems is complex due to its huge search space for structural combination and optimization computation. To provide a systematic approach and tools for the synthesis design of distillation systems, a new method for modeling heat integrated columns is presented, and the operating cost objective function is minimized by improved harmony search algorithm (IHS). This paper studies a quick method for the synthesis of heat integrated distillation column sequences and IHS -based optimization strategy for the optimization of separation sequences with their heat integration.

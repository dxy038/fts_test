This study utilized cross-lagged longitudinal
models to examine prospective, bidirectional relationships
between witnessing violence and victimization and three
adjustment variablesâ€”delinquency, conduct problems, and
school connectedness. Participants included 603 early
adolescent boys and girls (78% African American, 20%
Caucasian). Witnessing violence was related to subsequent
lower levels of school connectedness and more conduct
problems. For Caucasian but not African American adolescents,
witnessing violence also predicted later delinquency.
Victimization was linked with lower school connectedness
over time, and for boys but not girls also with more conduct
problems. Only adolescent delinquency was associated with
subsequent witnessing violence and victimization

The paper first introduces the basic drive system of a kind of hybrid electric vehicle. It demands high power bidirectional flow capability, with wide input voltage range, and output voltage of energy storage devices such as super capacitors or batteries vary with the change in load. Then the selection and design of aforementioned converter is proposed in this paper. The converter which is like a half bridge topology, has high power flow capability and minimum device stresses that can suitably interface a super capacitor with the drive train of a hybrid electric vehicle. Furthermore, by comparing of the main characteristics and applications with some typical isolated bidirectional DC/DC converter, the proposed converter has low device rating and can be controlled by duty cycle and phase shift. At last, the most important characteristics of this converter is that it uses the transformer leakage inductance as the primary energy transfer element and control parameters, Simulation waveforms based on SIMetrix are given to demonstrate the goodness of this novel topology, and this converter is also suitable for high power application, in particular for controlling the charge-discharge of super capacitors or batteries that can be used in hybrid electric vehicle.

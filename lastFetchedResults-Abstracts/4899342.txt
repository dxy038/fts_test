In order to meet the need to POS for high accuracy real-time motion imaging in the high resolution earth observation system, an integrated navigation computer based on FPGA and DSP was designed. FPGA independently accomplished the synchronous sampling of GPS data and IMU multichannel pulse signals; the bidirectional communication between DSP and FPGA was in the interrupt mode by EMIF; the navigation algorithm was implemented by DSP, and the result was output through the serial port extended by FPGA. The design reduced the volume, weight, and power consumption of the navigation computer. Finally, laboratory and vehicle test were carried out, the result shows that the integrated navigation computer can ensure system accuracy and enhance real-time performance, and the design requirement is achieved.

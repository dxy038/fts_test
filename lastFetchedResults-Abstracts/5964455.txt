Structural optimization is of great importance to improve the static and dynamic performances, particularly in the industrial equipments working under dynamic loads and static loads simultaneously, like airplane, steamship and automobile. In this paper, we study the pseudo-density based topology optimization under static load and white-noise excitation. The mean square responses of the designated locations and the total strain energy under static loads are assigned as two kinds of design constraints while the total structural weight is considered as objective function to be minimized. The material properties of the elements are penalized by applying the RAMP interpolation model. The prestress of the structure related to the static loads is taken into account in the modal and dynamic response analyses. Several typical examples are solved using Conlin optimizer. Numerical results indicate the reliability of the proposed method and the effect of prestress upon dynamic responses.

Introduction: Cervical carcinoma continues to be a significant health care problem worldwide. In developing countries, where health care resources are limited, cervical carcinoma is the second most frequent cause of cancer death in women. Pap smear test is used for screening cancer and preinvasive disease.
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare pap smear adequacy with either Ayrespatula and Cervixbrush in the patients referred to a private medical office.
Materials and Methods: In this clinical-trial study, 400 patients who required pap smear test were included.The patients were divided into two groups, in one group ayrespatula and in the other cervixbrush was performed with blocked randomized method. All pap smears were evaluated with Bethesda system by a pathologist. The data adequacy, inadequacy, reason for unsatisfaction, parity and menopausal status were obtained and analysed using spss ver.16 and chi-square(x2) test.
Results: Adequacy of ayrespatula was 83% and adequacy of cervixbrush 88% (p=0.156). In nulipar women, adequacy of ayrespatula was 70% and adequqacy of cervixbrush 94.87% (p=0.04). In multipar women, adequacy of ayrespatula was 86.25% and adequqacy of cervixbrush 86.34% (p=0.982).In premenopausal women, adequacy of ayrespatula was 83.54% and adequacy of cervixbrush 90.48% (p=0.06). In menopausal women, adequacy of ayrespatula was 80.56% and adequacy of cervixbrush 75% (p=0.581). Most frequent cause of unsatisfactory pap smear in ayrespatula and cervixbrush was inadequate squamous cell representation.
Conclusion: Overall, adequacy of cervixbrush is similar to that of ayrespatula but adequacy of cervixbrush in nulipar women is higher than that of ayrespatula. More studies with larger sample size to achieve best results are recommended.

The objective of this study is to develop an active vibration control (AVC) system to suppress the relative displacement between lens set and granite platform using a micron positioning stage, installed between lens set and gantry. This control system applies Filtered-X LMS adaptive algorithm as the controller, and uses the vibration signal measured by accelerometer as input signal to generate a control signal that drives piezoelectric actuator to produce anti-force to suppress vibration of the micron positioning stage. The goal of this study is to reduce 50% amplitude of the horizontally relative displacement between the lens set and granite platform under a frequency range of 1 ~ 10Hz. Through the experiments of active control, it was verified that the vibration of stage is effectively decreased to 2 ~ 4&#956;m from 12 ~ 20&#956;m after control under the proposed frequency range.

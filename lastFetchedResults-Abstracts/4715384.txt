The University of Massachusetts is developing a dual-beam along-track interferometer with the objective of obtaining two components of surface velocity sufficient to yield a current vector estimate with a single aircraft pass. The instrument consists of a C-band chirp radar transmitter and a pair of along-track interferometers multiplexed into a common dual-channel receiver. The interferometers are squinted respectively forward and aft of cross-track. An FPGA-based data acquisition system permits real-time pulse integration, and a combined GPS/INS system is incorporated to provide velocity and attitude information. Current plans call for the instrument to be housed in a pod suitable for mounting on the inboard wing pylons of NOAA WP-3D research aircraft with network communication to an operator inside the aircraft

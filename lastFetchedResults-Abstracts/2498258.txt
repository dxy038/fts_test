Objective: Functional Dyspepsia ‎‎(FD) is a common symptom of ‎upper gastrointestinal discomfort. ‎Few data are available on the ‎role of psychotherapy in the ‎treatment of dyspeptic ‎syndromes. This study assesses ‎whether brief core conflictual ‎relationship theme (CCRT) ‎psychoanalytic psychotherapy ‎improves gastrointestinal and ‎psychiatric symptoms in patients ‎with functional dyspepsia‏.‏
Methods: A randomized, ‎controlled trial was planned in ‎two educational hospitals in city ‎of Babol‏. ‏
Forty-nine patients with FD were ‎randomly assigned to receive ‎standard medication treatment ‎with CCRT psychotherapy (24 ‎participants) or standard ‎medication treatment alone (25 ‎participants). The participants ‎completed the Patient ‎Assessment of Upper ‎Gastrointestinal Symptom ‎Severity Index (PAGI-SYM) and ‎Symptom Checklist-90-Revised ‎‎(SCL-90-R) questionnaires ‎before the trial, after the ‎treatment and at 1 and 12-month ‎follow-ups. The mixed-effects ‎‎(regression) model was used to ‎analyze the data‏.‏
Results: The results showed that ‎CCRT psychotherapy improved ‎all of the FD symptoms ‎‎(heartburn/regurgitation, ‎nausea/vomiting, fullness, ‎bloating, upper abdominal pain, ‎and lower abdominal pain) and ‎many of the psychiatric ‎symptoms (depression, anxiety, ‎somatization, interpersonal ‎sensitivity and paranoid ideation) ‎after the treatment and at 1-‎month and 12-month follow-ups‏.‏
Conclusion: Brief CCRT ‎psychoanalytic psychotherapy ‎can serve as an effective ‎intervention for promoting ‎gastrointestinal and psychiatric ‎symptoms in patients with ‎functional dyspepsia.‎

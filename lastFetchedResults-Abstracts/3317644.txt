In this work, we describe the Spanish interuniversity experience, known as &#8220;the AutomatL@bs project&#8221;, whose main objective is the design, development, and exploitation of a network of virtual and remote laboratories for the teaching/learning of control engineering across Internet. The methodology employed in the development of AutomatL@bs has considered (i) the technical details necessary to transform any traditional control laboratory in a virtual/remote web-based one, and (ii) all the aspects related to the integration of the web-based laboratories in a tool that gives support to the academic planning based on pedagogic goals. Also, the paper presents a description of three experimentation systems presented in AutomatL@bs.

This paper introduces a multiobjective grammar based genetic programming algorithm to solve a Web Mining problem from multiple instance perspective. This algorithm, called MOG3P-MI, is evaluated and compared with other available algorithms which extend a well-known neighborhood-based algorithm (k-nearest neighbour algorithm) and with a mono objective version of grammar guided genetic programming G3P-MI. Computational experiments show that, the MOG3PMI algorithm obtains the best results, solves problems of k-nearest neighbour algorithms, such as sparsity and scalability, adds comprehensibility and clarity in the knowledge discovery process and overcomes the results of monoobjective version.

The interface between neural prostheses and neural tissue plays a significant role in the long term performance of these devices. Conducting polymers have been used to modify the electrical properties of neural microelectrodes. The objective of this study was to evaluate recording chronic neural activity of neural microelectrodes that were modified with nanofibers-templated of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanotubes over seven week periods using impedance spectroscopy and signal-to-noise ratio measurements. PEDOT nanotubes-coated sites were found to have lower impedance and higher signal-to-noise ratio than control site.

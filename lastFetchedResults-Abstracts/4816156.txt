This paper presents a multi-objective optimization methodology for finding out the best transmission losses while simultaneously minimizing the system generation costs. A multi-objective design optimization tool for multiple TCSC has been developed. The optimal generation schedules and corresponding transmission losses along with optimal TCSC setting parameters for different case studies have also been reported. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been tested for IEEE-30 bus systems with multiple TCSC devices. The proposed model converges very fast and independent of initial conditions. It has also been observed that the proposed algorithm can be applied to larger systems and do not suffer with computational difficulties.

Objective. In most cases of classic Hodgkin's disease (HD), Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells clonally derive from germinal-center B cells. Within their rearranged immunoglobulin genes, somatic mutations rendering potentially functional immunoglobulin gene rearrangements nonfunctional were detected, indicating that H-RS cells do not express a B-cell receptor. Under physiologic conditions, these cells would undergo apoptosis within the germinal center. However, H-RS cells clonally expand, disseminate, and lead to clonal relapse of HD, indicating their resistance to induced programmed cell death. The underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated.
Materials and Methods. Analysis of receptor-ligand interactions in primary H-RS cells is difficult to perform due to their scarcity in vivo and their low proliferation rate in vitro. Therefore, two B-cellular H-RS cell lines (L1236 and L428) were used to test for the expression of CD95 by flow cytometry and for the induction of apoptosis after incubation with CD95L obtained from retrovirally transduced murine myoblasts. Sequence analysis of CD95 cDNA obtained from these H-RS cell lines was performed.
Results. Expression of CD95 on the cell surface was detected in both cell lines. However, after incubation with CD95L, the cells did not undergo apoptosis. To test whether mutations within the CD95 cDNA sequence caused resistance to apoptosis in H-RS cells, sequence analysis of CD95 cDNA obtained from L1236 and L428 was performed. In both cell lines, CD95 was not affected by somatic mutations.
Conclusions. Our results indicate that the two H-RS cell lines L1236 and L428 are resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis induced via CD95L, although wild-type CD95 is expressed. For further characterization of the mechanisms leading to prevention of apoptotic cell death in H-RS cells, it is necessary to determine impairments within the signaling cascade following CD95 activation.

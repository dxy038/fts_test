An improved dynamic model for a multi-zone circularly symmetric rapid thermal processing (RTP) system has been developed and validated. The model incorporates radiative, conductive and convective heat transfer mechanisms and allows for chamber heat-up as observed in real RTP systems. A multivariable nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) has been developed for this system. We investigate how the choice of the objective function in the NMPC formulation of a distributed parameter system impacts controller performance.

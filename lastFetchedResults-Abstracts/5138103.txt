Performance comparison between image compression methods is an activity difficult to realise because of the few standard environments for validation. The objective of this paper is to present OPENPRESS as a single open platform for validation allowing the integration of most of the current and future image compression methods, to facilitate their comparison and validation on a common and coherent set of reference images. Another goal of OPENPRESS is to ensure a broad distribution of these compression methods to the potential users. For that purpose, the proposed environment involves advanced computer science techniques like distributed computing, platform-independent software engineering, client/server decomposition, etc

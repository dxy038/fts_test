Fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) based on Euclidean distance function converges to a local minimum of the objective function, which can only be used to detect spherical structural clusters. In this paper, an improved Fuzzy C-Means algorithm based on a Normalized Mahalanobis distance by taking a new threshold value and a new convergent process is proposed. The experimental results of three real data sets containing image classification show that our proposed new algorithm has the better performance.

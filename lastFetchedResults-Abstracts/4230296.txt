This paper proposes an iterated-based algorithm to solve economic dispatch (ED) problem. The algorithm aims to determine the schedules of generating units in order to minimize the total generation cost. The problem is formulated mathematically as an optimization problem including objective function and constraints. Also the network loss as an important element for economic dispatch in power systems has been considered in the problem. The proposed method applied on 3-unit power system and the results were obtained and compared to classical and intelligent optimizations methods. The results clearly show that the proposed algorithm is capable of solving ED problem as well as other optimization methods.

The efficient management of industrial systems can be only in a system whose activities are synchronized thus enabling a good traceability. This is why the development of a reliable Information System is a primordial objective of industrial systems. To this effect, we elaborated in this paper a methodology of designing automated systems using participative methods on the one hand and we present the issues involved in upgrading the industrial systems on the other hand. In order to deal with these issues, we present a practical case of a grain silo. The methodology proposed is divided into ten steps and it is based on the use of two systemic methods: SADT and OOPP. This methodology allows us to validate the automation architecture to install in the grain silo.

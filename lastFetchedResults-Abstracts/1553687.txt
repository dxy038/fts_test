We formulate discrete-time analogues of integrodifferential equations modelling bidirectional neural networks studied by Gopalsamy and He. The discrete-time analogues are considered to be numerical discretizations of the continuous-time networks and we study their dynamical characteristics. It is shown that the discrete-time analogues preserve the equilibria of the continuous-time networks. By constructing a Lyapunov-type sequence, we obtain easily verifiable sufficient conditions under which every solution of the discrete-time analogue converges exponentially to the unique equilibrium. The sufficient conditions are identical to those obtained by Gopalsamy and He for the uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium of the continuous-time network. By constructing discrete-time versions of Halanay-type inequalities, we obtain another set of easily verifiable sufficient conditions for the global exponential stability of the unique equilibrium of the discrete-time analogue. The latter sufficient conditions have not been obtained in the literature of continuous-time bidirectional neural networks. Several computer simulations are provided to illustrate the advantages of our discrete-time analogue in numerically simulating the continuous-time network with distributed delays over finite intervals.

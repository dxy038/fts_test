This article objective is to introduce a novel WH-spread SC-I/OFDM system, created from the data symbol spreading with Walsh-Hadamard code in the time domain and suppressed carrier-interferometry (SC-I) code in the frequency domain to improve BER performance of the OFDM system. In the simulation, the signal is transmitted over frequency selective fading channel and affected by carrier frequency offset. As a result, it is concluded that WH-spread SC-I/OFDM performance is higher than both OFDM system and CI/OFDM system and achieves robustness to carrier frequency offset.

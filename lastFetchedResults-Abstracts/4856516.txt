Radiometers offer a relatively cheap and useful method for the measurement of Earth-space path attenuation. A programme of measurements shortly to commence in Malaysia is described. The primary objective of the measurements is to obtain reliable information on effective rain height. The principle instrument used is a vertically pointing, dual antenna, Dicke radiometer. The design of the radiometer and some environmental factors peculiar to tropical climates are also discussed

This paper describes a system consisting of a magnetoelectric voltage generator and AC-AC converter without reactive energy storage components in the DC link. AC-AC converter consists of a 12-pulse rectifier circuit and a current source inverter. A special feature of the converter is the usage of the inductance of the synchronous generator stator windings as input smoothing reactor of a current source inverter. The article describes the converter control system, main energy dependence of the system and results of mathematical modeling of the system.

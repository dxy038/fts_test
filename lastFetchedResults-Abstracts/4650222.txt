We introduce an approach to defuzzify a general fuzzy quantity, a general fuzzy number is approximated to its nearest symmetric trapezoidal fuzzy number. With the help of the above method, a fuzzy linear programming is converted to a linear programming with symmetric trapezoidal fuzzy variables. Moreover, using ordering measures of symmetric trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, The fuzzy linear programming is turned into a classical multiple objective linear programming. Then, fuzzy optimal solutions of a fuzzy linear programming are obtained by solving the above multi-objective linear programming.

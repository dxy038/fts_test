Parylene-C is a bio-inert, bio-compatible and relatively inexpensive material with many bio-medical applications from coatings for implantable devices to bio-scaffolds. The main objective of this research was to demonstrate a novel approach to accurately measure the mechanical properties of free-standing fibrous thin-film substrates (TFS) of parylene-C. For that purpose, a two-stage experimental protocol based on the use of moiré contouring technology was developed. In this protocol, local measurements employing an advanced moiré setup that uses non-conventional illumination (i.e. evanescent field) are first performed to gather high-resolution information on a small region of the specimen; then, global measurements based on shadow moiré are performed to monitor the overall behavior of the membrane. The protocol was first calibrated for an aluminum foil and then partially applied to the fibrous parylene-C TFS. Material properties extracted from experiments are f0ully consistent with the data reported in literature and the results of a hybrid identification procedure based on the combination of finite element analysis and nonlinear optimization. The results will help lay the foundation for developing a comprehensive understanding of the influence that morphology and stresses play in the ability to enhance and sustain cell growth and tissue development, for biomedical applications.

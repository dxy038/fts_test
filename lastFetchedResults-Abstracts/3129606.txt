Mesh-based clock distribution network has been employed in many high-performance microprocessor designs due to its favorable properties such as low clock skew and robustness. Such clock distributions are usually highly complex. While the simulation of clock meshes is already time consuming, tuning such networks under tight performance constraints is a more daunting task. In this paper, we address the challenging task of driver size optimization with a goal of skew minimization. The expensive objective function evaluations and difficulty in getting explicit sensitivity information make this problem intractable to standard optimization methods. We propose to explore the recently developed asynchronous parallel pattern search (APPS) method for efficient driver size tuning. While being a search-based method, APPS not only provides the desirable derivative-free optimization capability, but is also amenable to parallelization and possesses appealing theoretically rigorous convergence properties. We show how such a method can lead to powerful parallel sizing optimization of large clock meshes with significant runtime and quality advantages over the traditional sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. We also show how design-specific properties and speeding-up techniques can be exploited to make the optimization even more efficient while maintaining the convergence of APPS in a practical sense.

Objective
To assess the extent that 20 large jail systems and their respective public health departments collaborate to prevent and control tuberculosis (TB).
Methods

Data were collected through questionnaires sent to jail medical directors and TB control directors, interviews, and on-site observation in each of the jails.
Results

Only 35% of jail systems and health departments reported having effective collaboration in TB prevention and control activities. Four barriers were reported by a majority of the jail systems: funding (65%), staffing (60%), staff training (55%), and communication (55%). Lack of advance notice of a patient's release was rated as the greatest barrier to discharge planning. Fifty percent of the jail systems reported that they scheduled appointments for soon-to-be released patients with TB, and 10% did so for patients being treated for latent TB infection (LTBI). Fewer patients actually received appointments: seven (39%) of 33 released patients with TB had documentation in their medical record of appointments, and one of 46 released patients on treatment for LTBI had them. Characteristics associated with increased collaboration include having designated liaisons between jail systems and health departments and holding periodic meetings of staff.
Conclusions

Health departments and jail systems in the same jurisdiction have implemented recommendations regarding collaboration to a limited extent. Such collaborations need strengthening, especially discharge planning and evaluation of TB control activities.

This work reports the experimental study of airflow through macro-porous structural elements. Several perforated plates with holes of different geometry, arrangement, thickness and size were tested in the wind tunnel in two flow configurations, confined and unconfined. The objective of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, it aims at identifying the key parameters that define the flow through porous screens. Secondly, given that scaling laws for wind tunnel tests on porous structures are still missing, a scaling procedure for this type of elements is proposed.

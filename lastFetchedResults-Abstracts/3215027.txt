The purpose of Wi-Fi access point (AP) deployment is for users to receive ubiquitous communication quality. Therefore, developing methods for APs to achieve specific levels of coverage rate, budget fulfill rate, and budget fulfill rate within a limited budget is a vital issue. This study proposes a Wi-Fi AP deployment model that addresses diverse practical AP types, prices, and instances of multiple APs in a single location. We employs genetic algorithm (GA) to resolve multiple objective decision-making problem. An experiment is conducted to verify the proposed model´s feasibility. The empirical results show that the proposed model serves as a resolution based on users´ capacity requirement, and provides various deployment methods according to the weight of every decision-making condition. This study provides decision-makers with practical suggestions for Wi-Fi AP deployment.

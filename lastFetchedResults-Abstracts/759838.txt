A 5 year, ten wave longitudinal study of 338
adolescents assessed the association between two forms of
cognitive vulnerability (intolerance of uncertainty and fear
of anxiety) and worry. Multilevel mediational analyses
revealed a bidirectional and reciprocal relation between
intolerance of uncertainty and worry in which change in
one variable partially explained change in the other. Fear
of anxiety and worry also showed evidence of a bidirectional
relation, although change in fear of anxiety had a much
weaker mediational effect on change in worry than vice
versa. The findings show that relative to fear of anxiety,
intolerance of uncertainty may play a greater role in the
etiology of worry in adolescents.

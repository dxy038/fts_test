Nowadays, Electric vehicle parking (EVP) can be used as a distributed generation (DG) as an important opportunity. EVP is different with other DGs and can be used as a load or supplier, so it helps to flatten the grid load curve. Based on this matter optimal placement of EVP is an important matter. In this paper an optimal placement problem with considering multi-objective optimization is defined. Solving this problem, causes to improve some objects i.e. congestion, Voltage security margin (VSM), cost and voltage stability. To solve modeled optimization problem, an Elitist genetic algorithm optimization has been developed. This algorithm consists of continuous and discrete sections, so in addition placement, the optimal capacity of the selected parking can be calculated. These results have been analyzed and evaluated in different conditions and modified IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus networks are used as cases study.

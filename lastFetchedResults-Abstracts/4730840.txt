This paper introduces the concept of a new framework for power system restoration. Its objective is to minimize the large number of time-domain simulations that is usually necessary in order to find a suitable restoration sequence. The new method is based on rules that deal with specific problems encountered during restoration and that are formulated in the frequency and Laplace domain. Once a suitable restoration sequence is found, it can be verified by a single set of time-domain simulations. As an example for a specific rule, the assessment of motor starts during an emergency and black start procedure for thermal pourer plants is investigated. Simple analytical rules are developed that help to predict motor start-up times, currents, and voltage drops. The validity of the results is confirmed by time-simulations carried out with the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP)

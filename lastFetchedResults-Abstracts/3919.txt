Finite element solutions are presented for the optimal multiobjective design of symmetrically laminated rectangular plates subject to a combination of simply supported, clamped and free boundary conditions. The design objective is the maximisation of the biaxial buckling load and resonance frequency by determining the fibre orientation optimally with the effects of bending¯twisting coupling taken into account. The finite element method coupled with an optimisation routine is employed in analysing and optimising the laminated plate designs. The effect of boundary conditions and bending¯twisting coupling on the optimal ply angles and the buckling load are numerically studied. In addition, the multiobjective results are also compared to single objective design results.

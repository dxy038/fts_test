We present the two electromagnetic calorimeters of the ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) experiment at LHC (Large Hadron Collider). One is the high-resolution PHOton Spectrometer (PHOS) made of lead tungsten crystals and the other is the ElectroMagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal), a Lead-Scintillator sampling calorimeter. They are dedicated to the measurement and identification of direct photons, light neutral mesons such as π0, η and ω(782), and jets emitted in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies. The PHOS is capable of precisely detecting photons with momentum range between 0.1 GeV/c and 100 GeV/c and the EMCal can extend the prompt photon and light neutral meson momentum measurement beyond 200 GeV/c. The objective of the study is to explore the physics of strongly interacting QCD matter under extreme conditions of energy density.

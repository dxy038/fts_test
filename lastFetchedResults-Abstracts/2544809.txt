Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are common in children. The cause of URTIs is usually viral, but parents&#039; attitudes often contribute to inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, promoting antibiotic resistance. The objective of this study was to study the knowledge and behavior of mothers about antibiotic use in children under six years old with URTI. Ninty-seven mothers with children under six years were evaluated in a semi-kap study about antibiotic use in children under six years old with URTI. Sampling was done with the convenient method. Data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire. The mean age was 30.2 ± 7.2 years. Maternal knowledge was 8.2 ± 2.2 (scores ranged from zero to 12) and their performance was 4.1 ± 1.4 (scores ranged from zero to seven). Mothers had intermediate knowledge and performance. Knowledge was associated with mother and father&#039;s education, and mother and father&#039;s occupation (P &lt; 0.05), but was not significantly correlated with the number of children. (P &gt; 0.05) also, performance was associated with mother and father&#039;s education, and mother&#039;s occupation (P &lt; 0.05) but was not significantly correlated with the father&#039;s education and number of children (P &gt; 0.05). The study findings suggest that mothers&#039; knowledge and practice in the use of antibiotics is moderate, and lower parental education may lead to unnecessary antibiotic consumption and resistance.

ABSTRACT:The ability to increase salt tolerance in crop plants is a major breeding objective in many areas where saline and sodic soils limit crop production and in areas that experience significant fluctuations in soil salinity, including estuaries and intertidal zones. The Salt Overly Sensitive 1 ( SOS1) gene encodes a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter that plays an important role in germination and growth of plants in saline environments. This study presents the in silico and phylogenetic analysis of SOS1 gene in differentspecies based on coding sequences (complete cDNA. Results revealed the lengths of cDNA in 4 species (Aegilops tauschii, Triticum monococcum, Triticum aestivum and Aegilops speltoides ) are completely equal (3429 bp) that are belonging to the Gramineae family. moreover analysis of phylogenic tree showed that species classificated in three group, group 1 consist of 4 plant (Aegilops tauschii,Triticum monococcum, Triticum aestivum and Aegilops speltoides), group 2 consist of 4 plant (Lycopersicon esculentum, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, Salicornia brachiata, Vitis vinifera), group 3 consist of  only 1 plant (Arabidopsis thaliana).

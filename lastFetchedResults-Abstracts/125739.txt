BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE. The increase of serum level of FSH accompany with increasing age indicated a decrease in ovary response and fertility in A.R.T (Assisted Reproductive Technology) cycles. This study was done to evaluate the relationship between age of women and FSH level with the number of oocyte and the rate of fertilized oocyte.
METHODS: This study was done on 111 infertile couples who were in cycle of IVF in Babol Fatemeh Zahra infertility center during 1996-2001. The number of oocyte, fertilized ovum, serum level of FSH and LH were evaluated. Data was analyzed by SPSS soft-ware.
FINDINGS: The mean age of women was 30.2±6.4 years and mean of the numbers of oocyte and fertilized oocyte was 7.2±4.5 and 2.813.1, respectively. The mean of FSH and LH was 9.2±3.92 IU/ml and 10±4.1 IU/ml, respectively. There was a significant relationship between the number of oocytes and fertilized oocyte with the age of women. Fertilization rate was 70.3 % and there was not a significant difference in fertilization rate among age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, the age of women can be a predictive factor for A.R.T (I.V.F) programs.

The single-machine early/tardy (E/T) scheduling problem is addressed in this research. The objective of
this problem is to minimize the total amount of earliness and tardiness. Earliness and tardiness are weighted
equally and the due date is common and large (unrestricted) for all jobs. Machine setup time is included
and is considered sequence-dependent. When sequence-dependent setup times are included, the complexity of
the problem increases signi2cantly and the problem becomes NP-hard. In the literature, only mixed integer
programming formulation is available to optimally solve the problem at hand. In this paper, a branch-and-bound
algorithm (B&B) is developed to obtain optimal solutions for the problem. As it will be shown, the B&B
solved problems three times larger than what has been reported in the literature.

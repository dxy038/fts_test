Almost nothing is known about the distribution and status of the Himalayan serow, an IUCN category “near threatened” ungulate, formerly widely distributed from subtropical to subalpine regions, in the Nepalese Himalaya. Heavy hunting, together with habitat loss and fragmentation are believed to have caused local extinctions in many sites within its geographical range. Distribution pattern of this dense forest dwelling threatened ungulate thus indicates conservation status of the whole unique ecosystems of this region. The objective of this study was therefore to assess distribution and status of serow in the Nepalese midhills. We conducted surveys, based on sightings and indirect presence signs, in western Nepal, between the subtropical Bardia National Park in the south and mountainous Shey Phoksundo National Park in the north, during 2008–2010. We recorded serow in the Bardia National Park. Further to the north, we recorded it only in highly rugged and inaccessible areas in the high altitudes, which suggests their possible extinction in the midhill region. The serow presence was strongly positively correlated with hunting intensity and forest intactness index. The populations of serow, scattered in the region, are small and therefore likely to be sensitive to demographic stochasticity. This all may consequently lead to future extinction of serow in the entire region. This information can be used to aid further research and decision-making processes for conservation planning along altitudinal gradient of Nepal's Himalaya.

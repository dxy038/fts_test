Objective: To investigate the association of lipoprotein lipase gene intron 8 polymorphisms and Essential Hypertension in Han race Chinese. Methods and results: 116 patients with Essential Hypertension were enrolled and another 116 normal people were served as controls. All cases were examined for the genotypes of intron 8 in lipoprotein lipase gene by the methods of polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism, and the serum lipoprotein levels were also observed. Results showed that body mass index blood pressure and the serum triglyceride level were obviously increased in the Essential Hypertension group. The genotype and allele frequency of intron 8 in lipoprotein lipase in the Essential Hypertension group showed obvious differences compared with the control group. Serum triglyceride levels were higher in the patients with H+H+ genotype than in those in non H+H+ genotype of intron 8 in lipoprotein lipase by HindIII digestion. The systolic blood pressure showed a decreasing tendency among the H+H+ genotype, the H+H− genotype and the H−H− genotype individuals. Conclusion: The results suggest that lipoprotein lipase may be an important genetic factor associated with the Chinese Han race Essential Hypertension patients. The polymorphisms of intron 8 in lipoprotein lipase influence the blood-lipid metabolism, induce blood vessel rebuilding and play an important role in the invasion and development of Essential Hypertension.

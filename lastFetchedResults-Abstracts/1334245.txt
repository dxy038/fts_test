Objective: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been recognized as one of the most important opportunistic
pathogens in kidney transplant patients.
The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of CMV antibody in donors and recipients
before transplantation.
Material and Methods: In a cross sectional study from March 2008 to August 2009 we
prospectively studied donors and recipients who referred to our kidney transplant center.
All of routine pretransplante laboratory studies including liver function tests and CMV IgG and
IgM antibody were performed for them.
Results: A total of 148 patients (79 donors and 69 recipients) were included in the study.
Mean age of donors and recipients were 30 ± 8 years and 40 ± 18 years respectively.
Liver Function tests (SGOT and SGPT) were at normal range and marker of HBV infection was
negative in both groups but HCV antibody was positive in 2.89 percent of recipients (n=2)
and negative in all of donors.
CMV IgG antibody was positive in 100 percent of recipients and 98.73 percent of donors
(n=78).
CMV IgM antibody was negative in 98.55 percent of recipients (n=68) and 100 percent of
donors (n=79).
Conclusion: CVM infection is very common in donors and recipients candidate for kidney
transplantation in Khuzestan province and almost all of them in this study have CMV IgG
antibody.

XML is designed to facilitate data exchange between applications. However, XML and its schema languages do not express semantics but rather the document structure, such as the nesting information. Therefore, in the integration of XML, we should emphasize the semantics more than the document structures. In this paper, we provide a context aware framework, named BLCAA, which aims to enhance the XML semantic integration. In BLCAA, we generate both DAML+OLL context ontology and context instances. Through this bidirectional approach, we hope to achieve better context-aware computing in the XML semantic integration.

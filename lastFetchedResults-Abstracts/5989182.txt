It is argued that the instrumentation curriculum provides a number of opportunities for change through the use of modern ATE equipment in the electrical engineering laboratory. New interface buses like VXIbus provide opportunities for advanced digital interface design and implementation of custom instrumentation interfaces. The use of integrated software packages like LabWindows and LabView allows the creation of virtual instruments. Virtual instruments(VI) flexibly configure instrument assets so as to achieve a desired total instrument functionality. A VI environment can integrate stand-alone instruments as well as plug-in cards to achieve a complete instrument solution. An example of a digital systems design project supported by the availability of VXIbus ATE equipment is described. The objective is to carry out a simulation of a model of the VXIbus backplane with the use of simulation tools available

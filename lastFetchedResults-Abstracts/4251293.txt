This paper presents object-based image retrieval using a novel method based on perceptual grouping. The perceptual grouping is obtained by detecting the line edge from a square block using the two consecutive primitive edge differences detector. Object segmentation and recognition is the primary step of computer vision for applying for an image retrieval of higher-level image analysis. However, automatic segmentation and recognition of objects via object model is a difficult task without a prior knowledge about the shape of an object. Instead of segmentation and detailed object representation, the objective of the research is to develop and apply computer vision methods that explore the structure of an image object by two consecutive primitive edge differences (TCPD). For speed and efficiency, we extend the TCPD in a query image into several visual-pattern structures that are used to match the images from a large database. Computer simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides good performance compared with Iqbal and Aggarwalpsilas method and Jainpsilas method in terms of retrieval accuracy.

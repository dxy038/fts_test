
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Eighty percent of spontaneous abortion occurs in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Little information about the predictive value of ultrasound in predicting risks of spontaneous abortion is available. The aim of this study was to predict the risk of spontaneous abortion with the use of ultrasound markers.
METHODS: This prospective study was performed on 239 pregnant women with regular menstrual cycles. For all patients at 6-8 weeks of gestation with vaginal sonography, gestational sac diameter, yolk sac diameter, and crown Rump length was measured and embryonic heart rate (HER) was recorded with Color Doppler sonography. Then the patients were followed between 3-4 weeks to the end of 20 weeks of pregnancy. 
FINDINGS: Of 239 pregnant women, who were studied, the pregnancy is continued in 221 (92.5%) patients after 20 weeks of pregnancy and 18 (7.5%) pregnancies have been resulted in abortion before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Using Pearson correlation between gestational age and EHR in the ones who their pregnancies were without abortion showed that there was a significant relationship (r=0.31, p < 0.001). Among ultrasound variables to predict the risk of abortion during pregnancy EHR is more capable to predict than other variables (OR=0.85; 95%CI, 0.77- 0.94; p. value, 0.003).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study show EHR compared to other indicators of ultrasound in pregnancy has greater predictive value.

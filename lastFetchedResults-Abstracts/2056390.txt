The Turkish Accelerator Center Synchrotron Radiation, TAC-SR, is the first project for accelerator based synchrotron and applied researches supported by Turkish Republic Ministry of Development (TRMOD). This initiative taken by the Turkish Government aims at the construction of advanced research infrastructures based on particle accelerators, considered an important asset to support and foster the national research in science and technology. In this framework, the primary objective of the TAC-SR working group is to produce the preliminary design of the Synchrotron Radiation Source. Achieved beam emittance of the studied design is nominally 1.18 nm. Also, the frequency map analysis and the dynamic aperture calculations for the TAC Synchrotron Storage Ring are optimised. For demonstration, parameter sets and performance of some undulators are presented. It is seen that the insertion devices with the proposed parameter sets acquire competitive brilliance values to cover from 10 eV to 50 keV photon energy range.

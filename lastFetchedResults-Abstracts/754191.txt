The objective of the present paper is to understand general equilibrium implications of
international trade and globalization on energy consumption and environmental emission.
We applied Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modeling as our relevant
methodology following Shoven and Whalley (1984). Constructing an
Energy/Environmental Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), the present study attempts to
purport the effects of liberalized trade upon different macroeconomic aspects, energy
consumption and Green House Gas (GHG) emission through an Environmental CGE
model logically based on SAM. Assuming Electricity, Coal, Natural gas & oil, and Biomass
as the relevant sources of energy, attempts have been made to simulate various trade
related policies like import liberalization, foreign capital inflow and use of energy saving
technologies for examining the impact over macroeconomic variables and domestic
physical environment. Constructing an index known as Pollution Terms of Trade (PTOT)
our research finds that trade and globalization in most of the cases aggravated the problem
of GHG emission and has made India “Pollution Haven” by intensifying dirty industry
migration.

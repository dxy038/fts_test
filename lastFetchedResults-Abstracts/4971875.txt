A prototype data-transmission link is presented based on bidirectional transmission of infrared light. The link was applied in a 16-channel EEG recording system. The system uses a sample rate of 1 kHz per channel and an accuracy of 12-bits. The bidirectional transmission format employed allows regulation of optical output power and direction, as well as synchronization of the sample rate with the signal processing hardware. The maximum distance between the mobile and stationary section was 5 meters

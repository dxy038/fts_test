A new bottleneck definition from the perspective of the manufacturing system´s objective is proposed. A distinct bottleneck detection method based on orthogonal experiment (BD-OE) for job shop is proposed according to the definition. The method takes the objective of the manufacturing system as estimated index, carries out typical and finite number of experiments by combining different dispatching rules, to detect bottleneck machine which has the greatest effect on the estimated index. The method can detect bottleneck before the system running, and to guide the following production planning and preparation of necessity in advance for the improvement of the system´s performance.

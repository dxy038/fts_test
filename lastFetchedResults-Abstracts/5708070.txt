This paper proposed a infrared and anti falling sensor robot. The objective is to design an intelligent and autonomous robot. This work is a small scale prototype model which can be used with great versatility in other robotics applications. This can be achieved by changing programming of embedded processor. Further it can be extended to include ultrasonic sensors, cameras, so that it is ready to be used in real life situations. This obstacles sensing and anti falling sensor robot senses the edges and obstacles. A set of infrared sensors avoid it falling from heights. Movements and numbers of rotations are displayed on a local liquid crystal display (LCD) interfaced with 8-bit processor. As this project is a continual work in progress, this paper outlines the current state of hardware and software design. This paper covers the technical aspect of the robot design, as well as educational objectives, that are achieved.

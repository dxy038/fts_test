This paper focuses on how computer execution times and net present value (NPV) are affected by different groupings of tree-selection harvest controls, different procedures to determine harvest timing, and tree data aggregation. The problems related to stand management are viewed as a hierarchy, where the main problem is determining harvest periods and the subordinate problem is determining what trees to cut in a given set of harvest periods. The solution technique is a derivative-free search process, and the objective is to maximize the NPV of harvest revenues for a stand over a given planning horizon. The tree-selection harvest controls are based on diameter and species groupings. The procedure to determine harvest timing is based on Tabu search and fixed cutting cycles, respectively. Sensitivity analysis is performed for a selection of stands in southern Sweden, where each stand is represented by a set of inventoried plots. Both even-aged and uneven-aged management are considered. Solutions improved with the number of decision variables. The Tabu search procedure proved very efficient at determining harvest periods for the even-aged problems. For the uneven-aged problems, fixed cutting cycles approximated the harvest timing problem, but at considerably shorter execution times. It is suggested that aggregated data be used for determining harvest timing, after which, using the original nonaggregated data, the tree-selection problem for a given set of harvest periods can be resolved.

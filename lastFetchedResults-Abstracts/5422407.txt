The China-Myanmar-India railway is being built nowadays and it will cause vast change about transportation situation among relative countries. In future situation (before not very long time), the existence of dynamic "balance lines of relative international traffic cost" should be an objective fact, there must be "warping" phenomenon in the cargo transportation line selecting which contradicts to the watershed function of the balance lines, many factors lead to "warping" phenomenon, the balance lines and "warping" phenomenon have tight relationship with integrate China-Myanmar-India railway cargo transportation convention, it is rather clear for the balance lines to benefit many countries in a lot of aspects -- if its functions to be play fully. Maybe a lot of time needs, but, to bring into full play of the function of the balance lines should be a long-range objective, which deserves all relative countries to pursue - and it should get great uccess.

Previous studies have been shown that schizophrenic patient compared to healthy subject present abnormality in eye fixation tasks. But in these studies the evaluations of the eye movement are not objective. They are based on visual inspection of the records. The quality of fixation is assessed in term of absence of saccades. By using a predefined scale the records are rating from the best to worst. In this paper, we propose a new method to quantify eye fixation. in this method, our analyze examine the metric proprieties of each component of eye fixation movement (saccades, square wave jerks, and drift). A computer system is developed to record, stimulate and analyze the eye movement. A variety of software tools are developed to assist a clinician in the analysis of the data

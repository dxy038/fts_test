The main objective of the Chinese ChangÂ´E-3 (CE-3) lunar satellite is to achieve soft-landing and roving exploration on the lunar surface. A multibeam radar in the lunar lander is implemented to measure the echoes from the lunar rough surface during its descending and to derive the speed of the lander. In this paper, numerical simulation of multiangular radar echoes and speed inversions from Doppler frequency are presented. An area of the Lunar Sinus Iridum bay, as landing site, is specifically selected. The rough surface described with the real DTM data is first divided into triangular patches for numerical Kirchhoff approximation calculation. The radar echoes of multiangular radar beams of CE-3 during the landing are numerically simulated. The echo phase and the Doppler frequency are then derived to obtain the vertical speed.

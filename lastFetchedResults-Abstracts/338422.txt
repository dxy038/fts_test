Objective
In an attempt to maintain and expand human stem cells, many investigators have used xenogeneic, especially murine, stromal cells and fetal calf serum. Because of the possible transmission of infectious diseases, however, the safety of the delivery of grafts expanded in culture using xenogeneic cells and serum has been debated. Using primary human marrow stromal cells, we established a novel serum-free culture system to expand human primitive progenitors and transplantable stem cells.
Material and Methods

Cord blood CD34+ cells were cultured on a monolayer of human primary marrow stromal cells in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO), flt3/flk2 ligand (FL), and/or stem cell factor (SCF) under serum-free conditions. After 2 or 4 weeks of culture, cells were examined for clonogenic progenitors and severe combined immunodeficient disorder (SCID) mouse-reconstituting cells (SRC).
Results

In the presence of TPO, FL, and SCF, marrow stromal cells supported more than a 100- and 1,000-fold expansion of CD34+ cells and colony-forming units in culture after 2 and 4 weeks of incubation, respectively. In addition, cobblestone area-forming cells were expanded more than 18- and 60-fold after 2 and 4 weeks of culture, respectively. Furthermore, SRC assay demonstrated augmented engraftment by cultured cells.
Conclusion

This ex vivo expansion system should prove valuable in clinical settings in which stromal cells are available from recipients or stem cell donors.

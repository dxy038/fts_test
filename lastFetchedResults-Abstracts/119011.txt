Due to aggressive environmental stressors and increasing traffic loads, highway bridges are undergoing significant deterioration in both condition and safety. Timely and adequate maintenance interventions are therefore crucial to ensure the functionality of existing bridges in a network. Under budget constraints, it is important to prioritize maintenance needs to bridges that are most significant to the functionality of the entire network. In this paper, the network-level bridge maintenance planning problem is posed as a combinatorial optimization and is automated by a genetic algorithm (GA) to select and allocate maintenance interventions of different types among networked bridges as well as over a specified time horizon. Two conflicting objective functions are considered simultaneously: (1) The overall performance of a bridge network expressed by the time-dependent reliability of connectivity between the origin and the destination locations and (2) the present value of total maintenance cost over the specified time horizon. A variety of maintenance types, which differ in unit costs as well as in effects on bridge performance in terms of improvement in structural reliability levels, are used in the optimization. An event tree analysis is carried out to obtain a closed-form expression for the network connectivity reliability. As an illustration example, the GAbased procedure is applied to deteriorating deck slabs of an existing 13-bridge network located in Colorado. It is shown that the proposed maintenance planning procedure has the capability of both prioritizing scarce maintenance needs to deteriorating bridges that are most crucial to the network performance and cost-effectively distributing maintenance interventions over the time horizon.

Background and Aim: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common overuse injury occurring at the knee. Reduction of proprioception, pain, changes in muscle activity patterns are seen in PFPS. Therefore these patients may demonstrate less balance. Thus the main objective of this study was to determine the postural control in patients with patellofemoral syndrome and compare it with healthy subjects.



Materials and Methods: Ten subjects (age 31.1 &plusmn; 5.31, weight 59.6 &plusmn; 8.95, height 1.62 &plusmn; 0.05) presenting with PFPS were compared with 10 matched control subjects (age 27.2 &plusmn; 1.81, weight 60.6 &plusmn; 2.36, height 1.67 &plusmn; 0.01).

Pain was measured with VAS scale and patella position was assessed using the method first described by McConnell. Force Plate was used to measures COP paths in sagittal and frontal plane with open and close eyes.



Results: The data showed that COP paths were different between PFPS and healthy subjects with open eyes in sagittal and frontal plane (P< 0.05). Means of COP paths increase in patients with PFPS. No differences were detected between PFPS and healthy subjects with closed eyes in sagittal and frontal plane.



Conclusion: Body sways increase in patients with PFPS with open eyes due to pain, lateral tracking patella and reduction of proprioception in knee.

This paper describes a high-power-factor electric utility interface that is capable of bidirectional power transfer, i.e., to or from the electric utility. Bidirectional power transfer capability is essential in many servomechanical and power electronic drive applications. The circuit presented here is capable of serving as a rectifier, an inverter, or as a stand-alone power supply (when operated with a battery as a load). It performs these functions with significantly enhanced efficiency and construction simplicity in comparison to conventional boost-type high power factor rectifiers

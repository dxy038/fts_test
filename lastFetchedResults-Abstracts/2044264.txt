An investigation into the potential neutron detection efficiency gains that could be made to microchannel plates (MCPs) has been conducted by a GEANT4 simulation. Thin-film neutron converters are coupled to the upstream-side of the MCP. MCPs with and without pre-existing neutron sensitivity were examined. A study into potential film materials favors a Gd2O3 converter film utilized in thin-film and pillar geometries for straight-channel MCPs. The objective was to increase thermal neutron detection efficiency without sacrificing the spatial resolution of the system by studying (1) the balance between capture efficiency and charged particle product production and range to optimize detection efficiency, and (2) the extent of radial straggling that the reaction products undergo as they are transmitted through the neutron converter and MCP, which affects spatial resolution. Our investigation reveals that an increase in efficiency of 9.9% can be achieved for an MCP without preexisting neutron sensitivity using a film geometry neutron converter of 4-μm thickness. An increase in efficiency of 4.3% can be achieved for a neutron-sensitive MCP using a pillar-type converter of 4-μm thickness. Degradation of spatial resolution is not significant for either film or pillar geometries with thicknesses in the range 0.5–10 μm.

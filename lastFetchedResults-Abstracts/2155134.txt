The objective of work was to produce and characterize biodegradable films from rice flour, poly(butylene adipate co-terephthalate) (PBAT), glycerol and potassium sorbate, for application as active packaging for fresh lasagna pasta. The films were evaluated with respect to their optical, water vapor barrier, mechanical and microstructural properties. The mechanical properties and microstructure were evaluated after use as packaging material for fresh pasta for 45 days at 7 Â°C. The blends of rice flour, PBAT, glycerol and potassium sorbate showed good processability and allowed for the pilot scale production of films by blow extrusion process. The addition of 1 to 5% potassium sorbate as plasticizer agent of films in place of glycerol did not alter the film mechanical properties and a sorbate concentration greater or equal than 3% reduced the opacity, although increasing the water vapor permeability. The films could be used as active packaging for fresh food pasta, since they remained integral and easy to handle after application. The rice flour was shown to be an excellent material for the formulation of biodegradable films, since it is a low-cost raw material from a renewable source. The addition of potassium sorbate did not affect the extrusion process, and could be used in the production of packaging for use with foods.

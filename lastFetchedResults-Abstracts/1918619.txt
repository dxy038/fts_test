Abnormal (increased, but also decreased) vasodilative responses have been observed in patients with vasovagal syncope (VVS). The objective was to assess reactive vasodilation in supine patients with VVS and its relation to severity of the syndrome. Reactive vasodilation was also assessed after a simple therapeutic intervention (water drinking). Thirty-four patients were studied, all with recurrent VVS and a recent positive head-up tilt test result. Seventeen matched healthy subjects served as controls. Venous occlusion plethysmography was used to assess forearm blood flow (FBF) and forearm vascular resistance resistance (1) at rest and (2) during reactive hyperemia. Clinical severity of the syndrome was related to the intensity and duration of the vasodilative reflex. The same plethysmographic measurements were repeated 60 minutes after drinking 500 ml of water. Before water drinking, no difference was observed between groups in baseline measurements. However, duration of hyperemia was longer in patients (p &lt;0.05) and was related to the duration of the previous positive tilt test (r = −0.69, p &lt;0.05) and total number of each patient's symptomatic vasovagal episodes (r = 0.49, p &lt;0.05). After water ingestion, baseline FBF decreased in patients (p &lt;0.05) and remained stable in controls. In patients, duration of hyperemia decreased to normal values. Hyperemic FBF remained similar between groups. In conclusion, increased reactive vasodilative reflexes were observed in patients with VVS. They seemed to be of significant pathophysiologic significance. Water drinking can normalize them for ≥60 minutes.

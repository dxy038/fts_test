Background: Some evidences showed that the secretion of uterine tube, vagina and
follicular fluid (FF) affects X and Y-chromosome populations. Sperm selection with X
or Y chromosome can added to oocyte for gender desired. The isolation of X, Y sperm
have done and all efforts in this field are done to make culture media similar to in vivo
condition. The objective of this study was to find if the FF can influence the ratio of X
or Y chromosomes, therefore we added human FF to culture media to separate X and Y
sperms.
Materials and Methods: Normal semen sample from 36 healthy men were selected.
Then the samples were divided into control and experimental groups: control group
sperms have been incubated with conventional culture media (Ham's F-10) and
experimental group with conventional culture media + 10% human FF. For sperm
isolation, swim up technique was used. After 24 hours of incubation, slides smear were
prepared. Then, we used the Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) method to
evaluate the effect of follicular fluid on the population ratio of X and Y containing
sperms.
Results: Although the incubation of sperm in FF and Ham's F-10 increased Y sperm
(59.44 % in control and 61.42% in experimental groups) in comparison with X sperm
(40.56% in control and 38.5 in experimental groups) significantly (p < 0.05), but the Y
(or X) bearing sperm did not significantly change in experimental group in comparison
with Y (or X) bearing sperm in control group
Conclusion: This study showed that using the swim up method for collecting sperms
and adding FF to culture media can improve some sperm parameters, but did not has
significant effects on population of X and Y sperm.

Background & Objective: In Iran, evaluation is one of the most important bases of medical education and one of the best criteria for the categorization of medical universities. Therefore, we aimed to compare some methods of evaluation for medical students. 

Methods: The target group included all basic level medical students studying medical mycology during the fifth semester. The tested methods of evaluations were: development test, post-test, class reports, and final exam. Three groups of evaluation were compared as a course plan of mycology for nine sessions. 

Results: There was a significant direct relation between the midterm and final exam, so that the increased midterm and post-test marks caused improvement in the final exam. Moreover, there was a relative correlation between the class reports and final exam. 

Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that each tested continuous evaluation is able to improve the final exams.

The information visualization is important as it makes the appropriate acquisition of the information through the visualization possible. The choice of the most appropriate information visualization method before commencing with the resolution of a given visual problem is primordial to obtaining an efficient solution. This article has as its objective to describe an information visualization meta-model classification approach based on treemap, which is able to identify the best information visualization model for a given problem. The actual state of the visualization field is described, and then the rules and criteria used in our research are shown, with the aim of presenting a proposal for meta-information visualization model based on treemap, inspired upon the periodic table meta-model.

This paper addresses the dual objective of (a) rejecting a single near/far CDMA interferer and (b) ensuring a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) in preamble reception in the presence of the same interferer. It is shown that an adaptive A/D converter will reject the constant carrier envelope near/far signal very effectively. The collective effect of all other unwanted received signals in the CDMA signal set, treated as incidental additive Gaussian noise, is also evaluated

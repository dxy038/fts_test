The objective of this research study was to evaluate the proliferation of somatic and germ cells in the seminiferous epithelium of Alpine goats. A total of 47 goats reared in semi-intensive conditions were used, divided into age groups from birth up to 12 months of age. Following castration, testis fragments were included in plastic resin and were mounted in EntellanÂ® for histometric evaluations. In general, the total number of germ cells per seminiferous cord transverse section was low until 4 months of age. An increase was observed between 4 and 5 months, lasting until 9 months of age. From that age on, this number tended to stabilize, until 12 months. The population of support cells (undifferentiated support cells and Sertoli cells) remained constant from birth to the first month, when it peaked. This was followed by a reduction until the fifth month of age. From that age on, there was differentiation in mature Sertoli cells, and its population remained constant until 12 months of age. It can be concluded that Alpine goats were in the impuberal phase from birth to 3 months of age, prepuberal phase during the fourth month, reached puberty at 5 months of age, postpuberal phase from 6 to 8 months, and reached sexual maturity at 9 months of age. Overall yield of spermatogenesis and Sertoli cell index increased from puberty up to the 12th month of age.

Purpose: The objective of the study was to investigate the ethyl acetate extract of Morinda morindoides
(Baker) Milne-Redh (Rubiaceae) (MM-EA) properties against experimental diarrheoa induced by castor
oil in albino Wistar rats.
Methods: The ethyl acetate extract of Morinda morindoides (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg body weight)
was administered orally to three groups of rats (five animals per group) in order to evaluate the activity
of the extract against castor oil-induced diarrhea model in rat. Two other groups received normal saline
(5mg/kg) and loperamide (5mg/kg) as positive control. The effect of the extract on intestinal transit and
castor oil-induced intestinal fluid accumulation (enteropooling) was assessed.
Results: At oral doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg body weight, the plant extract showed pronounced
and dose-dependent antidiarrheal activity. The protective role of the extract at 1000 mg/kg was
comparable to that of the reference drug, loperamide (5mg/kg). The extract (1000 mg/kg) produced a
decrease in intestinal transit comparable to atropine (5mg/kg), and significantly (p<0.01) inhibited castor
oil-induced enteropooling. No mortality and visible signs of general weakness were observed in the rats
following the extract administration of up to a dose of 6000 mg/kg.
Conclusion: The results showed that the extract of M. morindoides has a significant antidiarrheal
activity which supports its use in traditional herbal medicine practice.

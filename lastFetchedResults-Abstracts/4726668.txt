Mobile, pervasive, ubiquitous learning is of great concern in several countries and projects around the world. The main objective of this new level of learning is to allow learners to perform activities using contextual information and deliver them suitable content, services anywhere at anytime. As research focuses on using contextual information to achieve this goal, a topic as access control based on context in Learning Management Systems seems to be undercovered. Our paper present several cases where it might be necessary to restrict and control access to learning materials/features/activities based on contextual information such as location, time, ...etc. We associate these elements (context and access control) and decide whether to grant access or to adapt a resource in a learning activity.

The performance of a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is closely related to the capability of the implemented routing protocol to adapt itself to unpredictable changes of topology network and link status. The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol is a one key of the proactive routing protocols for MANETs. It is based on the multi-point relays (MPRs) technique to reach all nodes in the network with a limited number of broadcasts. In this paper, we propose new versions of the original OLSR protocol based on a new mobility parameter, in the goal to enhance and adapt it in the presence of the mobility. For this objective we define new three criterions for MPRs selection. The first criteria take for selection, just the mobility of nodes at one-hop. The two others criterions are based on both mobility of nodes at one-hop and two-hops.

A general method is proposed to automatically generate a DfT solution aiming at the detection of catastrophic faults in analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. The approach consists in modifying the topology of the circuit by pulling up (down) nodes and then probing differentiating node voltages. The method generates a set of optimal hardware implementations addressing the multi-objective problem such that the fault coverage is maximized and the silicon overhead is minimized. The new method was applied to a real-case industrial circuit, demonstrating a nearly 100 percent coverage at the expense of an area increase of about 5 percent.

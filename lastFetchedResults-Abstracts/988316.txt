Porous latent heat thermal energy storage for thermoelectric cooling is simulated via a matrix-based enthalpy formulation, having the temperature as unknown, in a three-dimensional domain. The system is made up of two aluminum containers; the inner one contains the cooling objective in water suspension and the outer one the phase change material (PCM) in a porous aluminum matrix. The systemâ€™s charging and discharging processes are simulated for constant thermoelectric module cold side temperature under different porosities of the aluminum matrix. The mathematical modeling approach simplifies the analysis while the metal matrix in the PCM greatly improves performance. A direct application of the studied system is vaccine conservation in solar powered thermoelectric cooling systems.

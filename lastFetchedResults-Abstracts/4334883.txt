We design a dielectric cloak whose dimensions are of the order of the half the wavelength of the impinging wave. So that, the scattering multipoles of order n &gt; 1 are excited. Also, in this case the quasi-static approach is not valid. In our analysis, we consider a spherical core-shell system. A correct chosen of the shell parameters allow us to cancel the multipolar contributions to the scattering. It can be achieved by the minimization of the total scattering cross section (SCS). For this purpose, we have used genetic algorithms, where the SCS is employed as the objective function. Our analysis is performed with both Mie-Aden-Kerker theory and FDTD method implemented in FORTRAN 90 codes.

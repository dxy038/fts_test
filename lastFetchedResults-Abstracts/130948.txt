The objective of the present study was to determine the clinical features, underlying factors and treatment outcomes of infants with immune thrombocytopenic purpura(ITP). Due to lack of study on this age group a retrospective analysis of 62 infants with ITP was carried out from 1998 to 2002. Age, sex, clinical features, treatment outcomes and the rate of chronic ITP were evaluated. Among 62 infants with ITP, 39 male and 23 female subjects had an average age of 10.8 months. All patients had purpura and 12 of them had active mucosal bleeding, most commonly epistaxis. 44 patients had ITP after viral upper respiratory infection, one after chicken pox, 8 following vaccination and in 9 cases the cause of ITP was unknown. 55 patients received IVIgG, 39 only IVIgG, 16 IVIgG+prednisolone, 4 received nothing and 3 patients received multiple medicines. 46(74%) patients responded to a single course of treatment, 6 gave partial response and 6 patients no response. Among the patients 51(82.25%) had acute ITP and 11(17.75%) chronic ITP. Infants with ITP responded favorably to treatment and were less likely to develop chronic ITP. On the whole vaccination may play an important role in the etiology of ITP in infants.

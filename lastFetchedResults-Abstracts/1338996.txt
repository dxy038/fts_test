Objective: Individuals with schizophrenia show perceptual-cognitive abnormalities. Moreover, depression
and anxiety are integral components of the disease most of the times. Psychiatric patients under institutional
care experience lack of control and choice-making in their daily lives. Sensory room is an environment in
which individuals can choose, control and explore the stimuli around them. So, they can organize their
responses to their environment and restore and develop their skills, interacting through it.
Method: 48 people met the studyâ€™s inclusion criteria. They were evaluated with Lowenstein
Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment, Mini Mental State examination, and Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale. Then they were randomly and equally assigned to intervention and comparison groups.
The Intervention group received sensory room intervention and the comparison group had its traditional
therapies. After 32 treatment sessions, 14 participants in the intervention group and 7 participants in the
comparison group were excluded from the study and the tests were repeated for the remaining ones.
Results: Our findings did not show a significant effect of sensory room intervention on perceptualcognitive
performance and psychiatric status of people with schizophrenia (p >  0.05). In the reminding
domain, however, results indicated maintenance of the skill in the intervention group (p >  0.05), and its
exacerbation in the comparison group (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: No significant change in perceptual-cognitive performance and psychiatric status of
individuals with schizophrenia was found during the 3 month period of sensory room intervention, except
for reminding which did not change significantly in the intervention group, but regressed in the
comparison group after the intervention period.

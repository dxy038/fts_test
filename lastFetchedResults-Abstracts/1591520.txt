A health needs assessment questionnaire was developed and administered to 397 asylum seekers, 291 males and 106 females, in Sunderland and North Tyneside in the North East of England. The data from the questionnaires were analysed using SPSS Version 10. Individuals retained a copy of their own questionnaire to be used as a hand held record. There was much heterogeneity of country of origin, culture, religion and previous employment and language backgrounds within the sample. A range of health needs was identified which has implications for healthcare provision. Vaccination rates were low as was screening for tuberculosis and cervical cancer. Many asylum seekers identified symptoms related to mental health and requested help in this area. Access to dental treatment was an area of high priority for many respondents.

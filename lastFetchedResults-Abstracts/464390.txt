OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to establish reference values for six monoclonal antibodyâ€“based serum immunoassays applied in patients with carcinoma of the female genital tract. STUDY DESIGN: Sera from 938 healthy women (median age 48.0 years, range 37 to 76 years) were assayed for levels of CA 125, CA 15.3 (two methods), CA M29, CA M26, and mucin-like cancer antigen (MCA). RESULTS: Reference values, defined as those including 95% of healthy controls, were in women with unknown menopausal status as follows: CA 125, 37 U/ml; CA 15.3 (Centocor), 33 U/ml; CA 15.3 (Boehringer Mannheim), 28 U/ml; CA M26, 83 U/ml; CA M29, 13 U/ml; and MCA, 19 U/ml. Postmenopausal values were significantly lower for CA 125 and CA M26 and significantly higher for CA M29 and CA 15.3 (both methods). MCA serum levels were age independent. CONCLUSION: Reference values found were not in accord with those generally applied in gynecologic oncology. In addition, serum levels were influenced significantly by menopausal status (except with MCA). (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:107-14.)

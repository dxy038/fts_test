The objective of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of oxy-combustion treatments with the aim of restoring the catalytic activity and properties of H-zeolites deactivated in the oxidation of Cl-VOCs, namely DCA. The efficiency of regeneration treatments was analyzed by submitting the fresh H-BEA to cycles of reaction-regeneration-reaction. Conversion of DCA was monitored with time on stream and acidity, coke content and chlorine content on the catalyst surface was characterized before each step of the cycle. We found that deactivation process was reversible, since it was associated mainly to coking. Wet air regeneration was more efficient than dry air regeneration, especially for chlorine removal, although coke was only removed above 500 Â°C. The effect of multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration steps has been also quantified.

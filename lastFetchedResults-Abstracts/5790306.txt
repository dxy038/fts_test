As a kind of reasoning technique of artificial intelligence, case-based reasoning (CBR) has been successfully applied in many engineering field. Similar case retrieval is a key technology in CBR system. In order to improve the case retrieval efficiency, a case reasoning model based on gray relation and synthesize weight was proposed, applying the gray relational analysis in case reasoning and combining subjective and objective feature weight to calculate case similarity. Empirical results prove that this method can effectively improve the case retrieval efficiency and case reasoning accuracy.

Noise generated from modular bridge expansion joints during vehicle pass-bys has caused localized environmental problems in Japan and elsewhere. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanism of noise generation and radiation from a modular expansion joint installed in an expressway bridge. A numerical investigation was conducted in order to understand the dynamic characteristics of the joint and the acoustic characteristics of the sound field around the joint that measurements cannot reveal due to their limitations, such as the number of measurement locations that are required. Vibro-acoustic analysis was conducted by using the finite element method–boundary element method (FEM–BEM) approach: dynamic analysis of the joint was carried out by FEM and the sound fields inside the cavity located beneath the joint and outside of the cavity were analyzed by BEM. It was concluded that dominant frequency components in the sound pressure inside the cavity were due to excitation of the structural modes of the joint and/or acoustic modes of the cavity. For the expansion joint investigated, the sound field farther than about 35 m from the joint–cavity center could be considered as far field in the range of 50–400 Hz.

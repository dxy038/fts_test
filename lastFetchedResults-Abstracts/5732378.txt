In this paper the problem of detection and blind source separation (BSS) in multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) communication are discussed. In conventional detection techniques, transmitter has to transmit channel state information (CSI) constantly to the receiver. It affects spectral efficiency &amp; it decreases effective data rates also. As spectrum is a limited source, BSS approaches are promising options for MIMO detection. Spectrum efficiency is one of the main challenges in wireless communication system design. The main objective of this literature survey is to provide an overview of main BSS algorithms used in the detection of MIMO-OFDM and the working of BSS in this promising research field. For this, recapitulation is done of last few years research efforts, with SOS (second order statistics) and HOS (higher order statistics) BSS methods in MIMO.

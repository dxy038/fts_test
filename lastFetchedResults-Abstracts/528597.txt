Objective
Low birth weight (LBW or birth weight < 2500g) can be one of the serious problems
in children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the developmental status
of LBW preterm neonates admited at neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the
corrected ages of six and 12 months via the Persian version of Ages and Stages
Questionnaires (ASQ).

Materials & Methods
In a follow up study, fifty LBW preterm neonates admitted to Shahid Sadoughi
Hospital NICU in 2008 were evaluated for developmental status at 6 and 12
months of age using ASQ.

Results
Twenty four boys and 26 girls with a mean gestational age of 31.3 ± 2.7
weeks and a mean birth weight of 1480.3 ± 422.8 grams were evaluated.
Developmental delay in gross motor and personal social skills domains were
the most prevalent abnormal developmental status at 6 and 12 months of age.
Mean score in gross motor skills, personal social skills and problem solving
domains at 12 months of age were significantly higher in neonates with birth
weight 1500 grams.
Mean score in fine motor skills, communication and problem solving domains
at 12 months of age were significantly higher in neonates who were exclusively
breast fed.

Conclusion
LBW and preterm infants admitted to the NICU showed degrees of
developmental delay at the ages of 6 and 12 months, especially in the gross
motor and personal-social developmental domains on the ASQ. So, evaluation
and monitoring of development status of LBW should be emphasized for early
and timely diagnosis, investigation, and management.

CD44 is an adhesion molecule involved in cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. Recent evidence indicates a role of CD44 in tumor growth and metastatic potential of tumor cells. Moreover, it is widely known that the p53 tumor suppressor gene controls cell proliferation and loss of its normal function may lead to carcinogenesis. To investigate the role of these biomarkers in renal cancer, we analyzed the immunohistochemical distribution of CD44's expression on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues from 67 renal cell carcinomas and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters as well as with p53 suppressor gene expression. The monoclonal antibodies CD44 and p53 were applied to the tissues using the streptavidin biotin peroxidase method after microwave antigen retrieval. For CD44 and p53 more than 10% membranous and 5% nuclear staining, respectively, were estimated as positive. CD44's membranous immunoreactivity was detected in 24/67 tumors (35%) and mostly in carcinomas of clear/granular cell type. Nine tumors expressed nuclear immunoexpression of p53 protein (13.4%). Statistically significant correlation was noted between CD44 expression and nuclear grade (P &lt; 0.001), tumor stage (P &lt; 0.001), vascular invasion (P &lt; 0.05) and p53 expression (P &lt; 0.01). These results suggest that CD44s and p53 are markers of tumor progression in renal cell cancer.

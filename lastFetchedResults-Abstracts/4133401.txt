This paper presents a high-speed and low-power SRAM for portable equipment, which is operated by a single battery cell of around 1 V. Its memory cells are made up of high-threshold-voltage (high-V<sub>th</sub>) MOSFETs in order to suppress the power dissipation due to large subthreshold leakage currents. For designing peripheral circuitry, we use SRAMÂ´s special feature that input signals of each logic gate during the standby time can be predicted. Low-V<sub>th</sub> MOSFETs are assigned for the critical paths of memory-cell access. The leakage current in each logic gate is reduced by high-V<sub>th</sub> MOSFETs, which are cut off during standby. The high-V<sub>th</sub>, MOSFET in one logic gate can be shared with another logic gate in order to enlarge effective channel width. To shorten the readout time, a step-down boosted-wordline scheme suitable for current-sense readout and a new half-swing bidirectional double-rail bus are used. The data-writing time is halved by means of a pulse-reset wordline architecture. To reduce the power dissipation, a 32-divided memory array structure is employed with a new redundant address-decoding scheme. Also, data transition detectors and a charge-recycling technique are employed for reducing the power dissipation of data-I/O buffers. A 64-K-words&#215;16-bits SRAM test chip, which was fabricated with a 0.5-&#956;m multithreshold voltage CMOS (MTCMOS) process, has demonstrated a 75-ns address access time at a 1-V power supply. The power dissipation during standby is 1.2 &#956;W, and that at a 10-MHz read operation with the modified checkerboard test pattern is 3.9 mW for 30-pF loads

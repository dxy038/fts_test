Birmingham City Council, assisted by The MVA Consultancy, has undertaken the implementation of a trial system to deter illegal use of bus lanes. The system is being supplied to MVAÂ´s specifications by Golden River Traffic and their sub contractors Computer Recognition Systems. The main objective of the field trial is to evaluate the automatic detection system in terms of its: technical competence; impact on reducing illegal use of bus lanes; perceptions by the public; and a longer term potential. It is planned that the field trial will last around 3 months and will include a full programme of evaluation. The bus lane deterrence system depends on video camera and vision processing equipment mounted within a standard operational bus. The system detects vehicles in the bus lane ahead of it at a predetermined distance and transmits the registration number of offending vehicles to a variable message sign up to 200 metres ahead of the bus. A database of the registration numbers of exempt vehicles is held on the bus and these plates are ignored. The video record can be used for subsequent inspection and enforcement procedures whilst the variable message sign will advise the driver that he has incorrectly used a bus lane and will display his vehicle registration number

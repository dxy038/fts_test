Objective
ng of tongue function is an important part of rehabilitation of patients with brain damage. A standardized tongue-training task has been shown to induce cortical plasticity. This study tested the possible influence of the natural ability to roll the tongue and modulations of tongue-training parameters on tongue-training performance.

l of 44 healthy adult subjects participated. 29 subjects (15 with and 14 without ability to roll their tongue) performed 1 h standard tongue-training task. Another 15 subjects participated in 2 sessions: Standard and Modulation in randomized order. Standard session: 1 h tongue-training with fixed training parameters; Modulation session: 1 h tongue-training with modulation of training parameters every 20 min (3 different settings – A, B, C, with different timing of task). Perceived task difficulty was evaluated on a 0–10 numerical rating scale (NRS).
s
rticipants improved performance during training (P &lt; 0.001). The ability to roll the tongue did not influence tongue-training performance (P = 0.617). Modulation of training parameters influenced baseline training performance (P &lt; 0.018) and improvement (P = 0.039). The mean perceived difficulty on NRS was: Standard: 6 ± 2; Modulation: A: 6 ± 2; B: 7 ± 1; C: 4 ± 1. Perceived task difficulty (ρ = −0.740, P &lt; 0.001) and performance improvement (ρ = −0.610, P &lt; 0.001) were inversely correlated with baseline training performance.
sion
tural ability to roll the tongue did not influence tongue-training performance. Modulation of tongue-training parameters by alteration of timing of the training task influenced tongue-training performance and perceived task difficulty.

Objective: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta-herpesvirus that causes persistent infection in humans, as well as severe disease in fetuses and immunocompromised individuals. Although HCMV is not currently causally implicated in human cancer, emerging evidence suggests that HCMV infection may be specifically associated with malignancies such as gliomas. Gliomas are one of the most common brain tumors that affect humans. It is classified into four grades. In this study, we have developed and used a real-time PCR method for the detection and diagnosis of HCMV infection in glioma brain tumor samples.
Methods: Paraffin-embedded tumor samples were chosen from patients who referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital Neurosurgery Ward. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues by a DNA extraction kit. After designing specific primers for the HCMV US28 region, a real-time PCR method was developed for detection of HCMV US28. 
Results: The results of qualitative real-time PCR on 4/18 patients (22.2%) were positive. Two patients with positive HCMV results died.
Conclusion: This is the first study that has monitored HCMV genes in samples from glioma patients in Iran. Considering the results of this study and controversies associated with other studies, a more comprehensive study using this and other diagnostic methods is suggested.

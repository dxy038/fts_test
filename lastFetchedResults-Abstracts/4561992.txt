Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are gaining popularity because of the environmental consideration ldquoGo greenrdquo factor. In this paper a battery charging system based on a three level AC-DC converter and bidirectional DC-DC converter has been proposed and associated control strategy for the battery charging/discharging has been presented. It has been shown that with direct duty cycle calculation technique that unity power factor is achieved and total harmonic distortion is minimized. The simulation has been performed using Simulink. The plots are presented to show the battery charging/discharging and the converter characteristics.

The topological optimization of components to maximize crash energy absorption for a given volume
is considered. The crash analysis is performed using a DYNA3D finite element analysis. The original
solid elements are replaced by ones with holes, the hole size being characterized by a so-called density
(measure of the reduced volume). A homogenization method is used to find elastic moduli as a function
of this density. Simpler approximations were developed to find plastic moduli and yield stress as functions
of density.
Optimality criteria were derived from an optimization statement using densities as the design variables.
A resizing algorithm was constructed so that the optimality criteria are approximately satisfied. A novel
feature is the introduction of an objective function based on strain energies weighted at specified times. Each
different choice of weighting factors leads to a different structure, allowing a range of design possibilities to
be explored.
The method was applied to an automotive body rear rail. The original design and a new design of equal
volume with holes were compared for energy absorption

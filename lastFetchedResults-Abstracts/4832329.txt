The principal objective of this paper is to establish the relationships which exist among the parameters of a digital receiver system which includes, as a minimum, (1) an RF-to-Baseband translator, (2) an A/D Converter, and (3) a digital filter. Certain basic parameters describe the performance of each of these modules in the signal space in which each functions. By placing in evidence several fundamental relationships which exist among these basic parameters, one can provide for the establishment of system performance limitations and can provide a basis for system performance optimizations

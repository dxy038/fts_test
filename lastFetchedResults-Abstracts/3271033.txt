The Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) problems in power generation systems is to reduce the fuel cost by reducing the total cost for the generation of electric power. This paper presents an efficient Novel TANANÂ´s Algorithm (NTA), for solving ELD Problem. [1] The main objective is to minimize the total fuel cost of the generating units having quadratic cost characteristics subjected to limits on generator true power output and including valve point loading effects. The NTA is a simple numerical random search approach based on a parabolic TANAN function. This paper presents an application of NTA to ELD for different IEEE standard test systems.

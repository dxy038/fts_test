The Magnus effect is used in many fields. In this paper, the Magnus force generated by the cylinder is used to stabilize the ducted fan UAV. The cylinder´s Magnus effect is analyzed by on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method and a improved shape of the cylinder is presented. The aerodynamic characteristics of the cylinder´s Magnus effect is analyzed by CFD software, FLUENT. The multi-objective optimization of the improved shape of the cylinder is conducted. In the optimization the response surface methodology(RSM) and Genetic Algorithm(GA) are adopted.

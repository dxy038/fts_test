Inroduction & Objective: According to need to preserve the native breed snakes, in order to use humanitarian and environmental terms, In 2008, the environmental protection in vulnerable categories of the Red List Department of Environment (IUCN) (14),and serpents Zanjani is required for the survival of the species reproductive parameters noted. 
Material and Methods: For this purpose to study the reproductive parameters of Zanjani viper(Iran), microscopic and macroscopic level: Check the male reproductive tract, sperm vas channel concentration, motility and morphology, weight, testicular volume, the evaluation of spermatogenic cells in the tubules and measuring weight and body length, tail length is studied. Viper Zanjani ring of 11 males in the winter of 2011 Bostanabad area in East Azerbaijan, which is mountainous and cold climate, samples were taken.
Results: The results showed that the mean maximum body weight of 248.33 ± 32.81 g, body length 76.41 ± 4.12 cm in February, tail length 4.87 ± 0.62 inches in February and maximum size of the right testis 666.13 ± 110.58 cubic millimeter of the Month for February and left 667.52 ± 189.08 cubic millimeter was seen in March. The highest average length of the left and right channels, respectively, 19.5 and 16.66 ± 2.54 cm was corresponding to the months of January and February. Maximum average sperm concentration in February 15×104/ml, morphology January %88.61±12.18 normal sperm motility and the highest 33.79 ± 22.91 of March the motility of the proximal to the distal face was increased. 
Conclusion: According to the findings viper Zanjani male reproductive tract morphology, including three in the proximal, median and distal to the That looks like a pit viper, Crotalus durissus terrificus species of the temperate zone of south-eastern Brazil is and the rate of sperm production in the months of February and March may be due to the mating stage (autumn) is.

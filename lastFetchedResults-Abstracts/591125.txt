Radio as a sensory-hearing media depends on the perfect will not on the partial or imperfect will. This will is used sometimes by the administrative force of the director of media in order to plan some effective programs, and sometimes by the producer or media agent for the sake of influence on the audience in order to stimulate and instigate him/her. As its fundamental aim, this article would try to analyze the concept of will psycho- philosophically, and based on it; presents some ways to the genesis of motion in this media. Therefore, we would speak about will and its conceptual aspects firstly, and then about its objective and subjective aspects and finally we would conclude that every motion in a media like radio â€“ especially self-conscious motions- needs a will for popular freedom not time-local determinism.

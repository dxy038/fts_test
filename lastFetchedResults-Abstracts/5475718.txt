The first China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-J) launched in 1999 has been developed by China and Brazil. It carries on-board a multisensor payload with different spatial resolutions called: wide field imager (WFI), high resolution CCD camera (CCD) and infrared multispectral scanner (IR-MSS). The performance of these sensors can be evaluated through the point spread function (PSF) that enables an objective assessment of the spatial resolution. This work describes an approach to estimate on-orbit CBERS-I CCD spatial resolution using an image of a black square target on the Gobi desert (China), The results show that the spatial resolution in across-track direction is not complied to the design specification for all bands whereas the spatial resolution in along-track direction is conform to the specification for all bands, except the band 4.

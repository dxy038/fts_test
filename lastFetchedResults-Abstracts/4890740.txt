The objective of this paper is to summarize the study examples on the custom power controllers using digital simulation. They include applications of a high-speed static switch for rotary type distributed generators, a doubly-fed rotary frequency converter for wind farms and a high-speed voltage controller for distribution feeders. These controllers are used to enhance the reliability and/or power generators.

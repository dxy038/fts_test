The most successful multi-objective metaheuristics, such as NSGA II and SPEA 2, usually apply a form of elitism in the search. However, there are multi-objective problems where this approach leads to a major loss of population diversity early in the search. In earlier work, the authors applied a multi-objective metaheuristic to the problem of rule induction for predictive classification, minimizing rule complexity and misclassification costs. While high quality results were obtained, this problem was found to suffer from such a loss of diversity. This paper describes the use of both linear combinations of objectives and modified dominance relations to control population diversity, producing higher quality results in shorter run times

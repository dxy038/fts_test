This paper deals with some essential open questions in the field of optimal power flow (OPF) computations, namely: the limitation of the number of controls allowed to move, the trade-off between the objective function and the number of controls allowed to move, the computation of the minimum number of control actions needed to satisfy constraints, and the determination of the sequence of control actions to be taken by the system operator in order to achieve its operation goal. To address these questions, we propose approaches which rely on the computation of sensitivities of the objective function and inequality constraints with respect to control actions. We thus determine a subset of controls allowed to move in the OPF, by solving a sensitivity-based mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. We study the performances of these approaches on three test systems (of 60, 118, and 618 buses) and by considering three different OPF problems important for a system operator in emergency and/or in normal states, namely the removal of thermal congestions, the removal of bus voltage limits violation, and the reduction of the active power losses.

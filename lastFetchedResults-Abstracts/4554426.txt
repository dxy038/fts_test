This talk will present the results of an Army sponsored project. The objective of the project was to develop a semantic knowledgebase designed to offer increased visibility into the Army portfolio. The first step in this project was to develop a seed ontology of the Army´s enterprise architecture. The process used to develop the ontology was driven by a set of analytic questions that needed to be answered by queries to the knowledgebase. It was a collaborative, bottom-up effort from start to finish. The members of the team, ontologists and subject matter experts, worked together using a semantic wiki to gain consensus on the structure and meaning of the ontology. Once a suitable seed ontology was created, the project was increased in scale and the team began to collect large amounts of data, primarily about programs, software services, and capabilities within the Army´s portfolio, as well as common business processes, missions and operational environments. This data came from many different systems within the Army and other DoD agencies, it was integrated using the enterprise architecture ontology. As the knowledgebase was populated with data, the ontology continued to evolve within the collaborative environment to respond to new data sets and data needs. The knowledgebase has been used to analyze the contents of the Army portfolio enabling the Army to make more informed budgetary decisions and also gain a vastly better understanding of the software services that they have and how they can be combined and used to offer new, vital capabilities to soldiers at the tactical edge.

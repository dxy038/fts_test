
Objective: The present study aims to investigate thought control strategies in Generalized
Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and the relationship of these
metacognitive strategies with trait anxiety, as a construct of emotional vulnerability.
Methods: 60 patients with diagnosis of GAD and MDD and 30 control subjects (nonpatients)
were selected from the university students. Participants answered to Beck Anxiety Inventory
(BAI) , Beck Depression Inventoryâ€“II (BDI-II), Thought Control Questionnaire (TCQ) , State
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28).The data
was analyzed by Manova and Enter regression.
Results: The results showed that GAD group was distinguished from the control group by
their greater use of worry and punishment strategies. The depression group was differentiated
from nonpatient group by the greater use of worry strategy and lesser use of distraction and
reappraisal strategies. The GAD group was distinguished from MDD group by greater use
of reappraisal strategy and lesser use of worry strategy. Worry and punishment strategies can
positively predict (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001) trait anxiety while distraction and reappraisal
negatively predict (P< 0.001 and P = 0.047) it.
Conclusion: GAD and MDD patients use maladaptive thought control strategies more
frequently and these maladaptive metacognitive strategies can be predictors of trait anxiety as
an underlying pathology.

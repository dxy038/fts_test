Background: Jaundice is one of the most common problems occurring in the neonatal period. It is commonly managed by phototherapy with its inherent complications. However, this treatment modality may itself result in the development of hypocalcaemia and create serious complications including convulsion and related conditions.
Objective: To determine the effect of phototherapy on serum calcium level in full-term hyperbilirubinemic neonates.
Materials and Methods: This study was performed on 198 full-term jaundiced neonates (113 males and 85 females) receiving phototherapy. These neonates had complete normal physical examination. Plasma bilirubin and calcium levels were determined before and after 48 hours of phototherapy.
Results: Fifteen neonates (7.5%) developed hypocalcaemia. After 48 hours of phototherapy, there were significant differences between serum calcium levels from baseline values of 9.46±0.8 mg/dL to 9.12±0.83 mg/dL after 48 hours of phototherapy (p < 0.05). None of the hypocalcaemic neonates were clinically symptomatic.
Conclusion: Although phototherapy induces hypocalcaemia in term infants, but the incidence of phototherapy-associated hypocalcaemia is not too much.

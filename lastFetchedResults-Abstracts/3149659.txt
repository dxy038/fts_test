Production scheduling problem for complex manufacturing system has been the hotspot for research and industry communities. A priority rule-based scheduling algorithm has been proposed in this paper. The scheduling objective of this algorithm is to minimize the makespan, while maximizing the utilization of machines as much as possible. Some priority rules are represented, considering delivery date, number of operations, and processing time. These rules are applied to this proposed algorithm and the simulation results show that the algorithm achieves good results.

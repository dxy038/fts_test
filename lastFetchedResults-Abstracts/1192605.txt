The optimization of attitude control system is studied for a special flying vehicle. The vehicle is launched vertically and after a moment, it is rotated to the desired attitude by a reaction jet control system. In the first section of this article, the design process of the attitude control system that includes design of system details as well as the control loops is studied. In a new approach, the design parameters of the subsystems are divided into three sets of parameters, including predefined parameters, design (independent) parameters and dependent parameters. The dependency between the parameters causes some dependent parameters of a subsystem to be input (predefined) parameters of the other(s). So, it is necessary to extract the arrangement of subsystems calculations. Since the attitude control phase is the prerequisite of the guidance phase, it is necessary to attain the minimum rotation time from the vertical to the desired attitude. But, there are some constraints, such as the dynamics and saturation of actuators that causes some difficulties in reaching this goal. On the other hand, one must compromise between the desired mission and the system constraints. For this purpose, the multi-objective optimization approach is utilized to simultaneously reach all goals and satisfy all constraints. In this paper, the reaction jet control system design is defined as an optimization problem with 13 unknown design parameters and 13 system constraints. This problem is solved using the new-developed multi-objective Adaptive Real-coded Memetic Algorithm to simultaneously minimize rise time, overshoot and the actuator bandwidth. The design optimization is performed based on the non-linear 6DOF flight simulation results and considering all constraints such as the saturation of the control signals. Finally, the optimal design is compared with the classic design, obtained based on the trial and error approach.

In this paper, we present the design of the readout and control circuitry for a four pixel digital camera to give the graduate students experience in analogue and digital integrated circuit design. The main objective of this design project is to give the students an insight into design methods used in the industry. This design project is also targeted to give an opportunity for the students to learn about paper writing and/or documentation skills. Submicron technology, 0.6 micron CMOS process is used for the designing of the proposed four pixel digital camera readout circuit.

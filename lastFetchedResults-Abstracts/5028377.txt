The ability to accurately and efficiently store and retrieve geospecific environmental data is becoming increasingly important not only for use in the simulation domain, but also in future combat systems. SEDRIS is a technology that provides a common data format along with an SDK to manipulate that data. As the use of SEDRIS has increased, so too has the size of the data sets to the point that it can take days to fully process them. The military´s Objective Force efforts are expected to amplify the trend of increased data complexity while simultaneously demanding data availability far beyond today´s capabilities. The SEDRIS parallel and distributed interface (SPDI) was developed to facilitate the long term improvement in processing times by utilizing HPC hardware, and to also provide HPC versions of the basic SEDRIS applications. SPDI makes these capabilities available to a large community of SEDRIS users.

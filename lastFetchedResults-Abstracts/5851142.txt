In this paper we proposed a mathematical model for mission planning problem of collaborate jamming resource. In the practical problem of collaborate jam of warships and aircrafts computational time is limited stiffly, and the allocation scheme of multiple targets and multiple jamming devices should be dynamical in practical case. Moreover, the problem is multi-objective and multi-constraint conditions in nature. To resolve the inefficient of algorithms in existing papers we present a improved algorithm With Repair Process based on GA(WRPGA) to address the problems of scheduling of dynamic jamming resource with multi-objective and multi-constraint conditions. Computational results of our experiments have shown that the WRPGA with highly efficiency performance, the quality of optimize solution of WRPGA is better than IIGA which we present in early paper within moderate or acceptable computational time, the WRPGA can obtain dynamical allocation scheme in acceptable computational time for the problem of scheduling of jamming resource, our algorithm can be widely applied to the general mission planning problems neednÂ´t modify the algorithm.

For the purpose of simplifying the procedure of part task distribution and improve the quality of scheduling, a new manufacturing resources organization model based virtual manufacturing cells (VMCs) is proposed, it is formularized as 4-tuple {machine, subsidiary tools, process capability, machine Status}. Then, the procedure of VMCs formation is divided into two phases: resource selection and resource cluster. Finally, to solve the resource selection problem, a multi-objective cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (MOCCEA) is employed and a multi-objective optimization problem model is constructed, the model is aimed to maximize the sum of processing routesÂ´ similarity coefficient, minimize the total cost and time of transportation, and minimize the machine loading unbalance. A case has shown that the algorithm possessed good prospects of application in resource selection for VMCs formation.

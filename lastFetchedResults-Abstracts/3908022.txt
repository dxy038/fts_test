This paper presents a detailed study of planning virtual infrastructures (VIs) over a physical infrastructure comprising integrated optical network and data center resources with the aim of enabling sharing of physical resources among several virtual operators and services. Through the planning process, the VI topology and virtual resources are identified and mapped to the physical resources. Our study assumes a practical VI demand model without any in advance global knowledge of the VI requests that are handled sequentially. Through detailed integer linear program modeling, two objective functions - one that minimizes the overall power consumption of the infrastructure and one that minimizes the wavelength utilization - are compared. Both are evaluated for the virtual wavelength path and wavelength path optical network architectures. The first objective results in power consumption savings and the two optical network architectures provide similar performances. However, the trend changes for higher load values, due to the inefficient wavelength utilization that the first objective leads to. Finally, we compare the virtual infrastructures created by the two objectives through online traffic provisioning simulations. The objective minimizing wavelength utilization results in VIs suffering higher request blocking compared to the VIs created by the objective minimizing the overall power consumption.

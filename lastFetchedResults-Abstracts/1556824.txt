This paper presents an impulsive optimal control model for solving the optimal designing problem of the trajectory of horizontal wells. We take fully into account the effect of unknown disturbances in drilling. The optimal control problem can be converted into a nonlinear parametric optimization by integrating the state equation. We discuss here that the locally optimal solution depends in a continuous way on the parameters (disturbances) and utilize this property to propose a revised Hooke–Jeeves algorithm. The uniform design technique is incorporated into the revised Hooke–Jeeves algorithm to handle the multimodal objective function. The numerical simulation is in accordance with theoretical results. The numerical results illustrate the validity of the model and efficiency of the algorithm.

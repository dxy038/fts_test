The objective of the paper is to estimate the source and predict the target of a flying object (projectile) using image processing. This is achieved by taking successive 3D images of the object using two cameras and processing their corresponding data. It can be widely used in military applications where it is an intelligent and relatively cheap way to guess the source and target of projectiles, rockets or bombs

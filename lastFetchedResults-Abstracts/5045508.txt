In this paper, we describe a novel wireless system to facilitate the objective assessments of neurological movement disorders like dyskinesia. The ability of the prototype system to provide precise, objective biomechanical data about human motor performance has been demonstrated via controlled tests using a robotic arm. The system is designed to be used in clinical settings and will not require an extensive setup or training. The system may be used to supplement the clinical routine examinations by providing objective performance data to aid diagnosis or to monitor therapeutic success. In addition, it can be a useful tool for research on neurological movement disorders.

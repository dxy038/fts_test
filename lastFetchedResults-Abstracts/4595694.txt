We consider scheduling policies for maxmin fair allocation of bandwidth in wireless ad hoc networks. We formalize the maxmin fair objective under wireless scheduling constraints. We propose a fair scheduling which assigns dynamic weights to the flows such that the weights depend on the congestion in the neighborhood and schedule the flows which constitute a maximum weighted matching. It is possible to prove analytically that this policy attains both short term and long term fairness. We consider more generalized fairness notions, and suggest mechanisms to attain these objectives.

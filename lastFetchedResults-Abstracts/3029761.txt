An experimental system and interface that indicate the likelihood of deep venous thrombosis using objective numerical measures was developed, based on the conventional compression ultrasound examination. A sensorized ultrasound probe is used to acquire force, location and image data to assess a vessel segment for compression. Ultrasound image data is segmented using a modified Star-Kalman algorithm. A user interface displays the results using a 3-D representation. A tissue phantom was developed for testing and validation. Initial results with this phantom and healthy volunteers are presented.

Objective: The objective of this study was to identify nutritional indicators that predict MNA
(mini nutritional assessment) classification in hospitalized elderly patients. Method: This cross-sectional
study assessed the nutritional status of 109 elderly patients at the beginning of their hospital stay with
anthropometric and laboratory indicators and the MNA. Habitual energy intake (HEI) was also determined.
The assessed nutritional indicators were investigated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression
analysis to verify if they can predict MNA classification. The odds ratio (OR) and its respective confidence
interval (CI) of 95% were also calculated, and the significance level was set at 5% (p<0.05). Results: The
nutritional status of most patients (61.47%) was appropriate but 30.28% were at risk of malnourishment and
8.26% were malnourished. Statistical differences were found for those aged more than 70 years and for arm
circumference, body mass index, calf circumference, triceps skinfold thickness and mid-arm muscle
circumference. Initially, the predictive factors identified by univariate logistic regression were body mass
index (BMI) (p=0.0001; OR=0.825), calf circumference (CC) (p=0.0026; OR=0.832), arm circumference
(AC) (p<0.0001; OR=0.787), triceps skinfold thickness (TST) (p=0.0014; OR=0.920) and mid-arm muscle
circumference (MAMC) (p=0.0003; OR=0.975); later, multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that
first AC (p=0.0025; OR=0.731 (0.597 – 0.895)), then BMI (p=<0.0001; OR=10.909 (3.298 – 36.085)) and
finally TST (p=0.0040; OR=0.924 (0.876 – 0.975)) and MAMC (p=0.0010; OR=0.976 (0.962 – 0.990))
were factors that predict MNA classification. Conclusion: In the conditions of this study, first AC, then
BMI and finally TST and MAMC together were capable of predicting MNA classification.

In order to avoid data redundancy, many methods of compressing Bayer images before interpolation were proposed. Structure conversion presented by Koh has been an effective method for Bayer patterned images to improve the compression quality. On this basis, Xie proposed an improved structure conversion algorithm to further improve the compression performance. Combining the improved structure conversion using 9/7 wavelet transform with lifting scheme and set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm, this paper proposes an efficient method in digital cameras with color filter array (CFA). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the improved structure conversion algorithm both in objective and subjective aspects.

This paper designs a single phase, full bridge, grid-connected and bidirectional AC / DC converter with the method of average current control, which is based on DSP regular sampling. A nonlinear mathematical model formula of powder core permeability is modeled for DSP on-line dynamic calculation. Design method of powder core and inductor current feedback loop, and application examples are given.

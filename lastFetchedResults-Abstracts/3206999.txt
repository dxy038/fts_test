Node deployment is a fundamental issue to be solved in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). A proper node deployment scheme can reduce the complexity of problems in WSNs such as routing, data fusion, communication, etc. Furthermore, it can extend the lifetime of WSNs by minimizing energy consumption due to sensing and communication. This paper presents the development of a recently multi-objective optimization algorithm, the so-called multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). MOEA/D aims the relocation of mobile nodes in a WSN with the goal of providing maximum sensing coverage area, and with the constraint of minimizing the energy required for the relocation as measured by total travel distance of the sensors from their initial locations to their final locations. Simulation results clearly show that the non-dominated solutions have tradeoff between the travelled distance and coverage area.

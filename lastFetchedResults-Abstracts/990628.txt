Synthetic pyrethroids like permethrin are an important class of insecticides and have been used as active ingredients against various garden or household pests, e.g. houseflies, mosquitoes and fleas for indoor-extermination. Thus, pyrethroids could have a high persistence in indoor areas which could lead to permanent health hazards to occupants of contaminated houses.

The objective of this study was to develop a method for the determination of permethrin in indoor air on the basis of a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In air, permethrin is bound to particles, due to its physical and chemical properties.

For quantitative permethrin measurements for the optimisation of the sampling and extraction method, as well as, for the verification of the ELISA results, a liquid chromatography method was developed.

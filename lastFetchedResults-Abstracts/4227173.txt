The objective of this research is to construct a two-wheeled robot that can autonomously read music and sing songs with vocal voice. A musical notation editor was created so that users can easily create a hardcopy of a song and show it to the robot to have more interaction with the robot. The robot can read the music by its vision system and musical notation recognition program, and then sing the song by its voice synthesis system autonomously. The experiment results showed that the accuracy of singing the Mandarin song, a little bee, is about 95% in average, which demonstrated that the mobile robot is promising in entertainment application.

A non-linear cathodic protection problem arising from corrosion engineering is considered. The objective is
to present some iterative methods and study the convergence. We show both numerically and theoretically
that the Newton{Raphson iteration is monotonically lower-convergent and a proposed combined iteration is
alternative-convergent. In the combined case, the exact solution locates between two subsequent iterative
solutions. Boundary element methods are employed for the numerical calculation

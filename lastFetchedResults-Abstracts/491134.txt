Background: Tuberculosis has been one of the greatest murderers of human being during history and it is still expanding now. In accordance with its respiratory transmission, it is much more dangerous rather than other infectious diseases, say, AIDS. One of the prevention methods of this disease is B.C.G vaccine and its resulted scar can be used as a suitable criterion for its vaccine influence. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the scar situation after injection of B.C.G vaccine in infants and to assess parental awareness regarding this matter.

Methods: The studied sample were all the infants (4-12 months) who were injected B.C.G vaccine in the first days at birth and who were referred to three health centers in north of Tehran. This study was accomplished in six months during 2004. The necessary data was collected via completing questionnaires, observation and evaluation of scars, and interviewing parents.

Findings: 94% of infants had scar due to B.C.G vaccine. 44% of mothers had high, 29% moderate, and 27% low knowledge about B.C.G vaccine. There was a meaningful relation between mothers' education and their level of knowledge regarding B.C.G vaccine (p<0.01). Also, there was a meaningful relation between B.C.G. scar existence and gestational age of infants at birth (p<0.01).

Conclusion: In 6% of infants, no B.C.G. scar was noted which was associated with their low gestational age at birth.

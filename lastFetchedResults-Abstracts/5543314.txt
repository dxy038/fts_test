We present in this paper a new asymptotically stable scheme for motion control of Electric Vehicle with induction motor drives. The result is established considering a model that includes the electrical and mechanical dynamics of the induction motors, as well as the full body dynamics of high speed Electric Vehicle. The procedures we will follow consist of four steps. First, we design an inner control loop such that the overall System becomes a cascade connection of two nonlinear subsystems, i.e., the motor electrical dynamics and the electrical vehicle mechanical system as load. The output of the first subsystem, that is the generated torque, drives the electrical vehicle dynamics, and the other cross coupling are removed. Second, the torque required to track the desired wheel trajectory is evaluated by passivity approach. Third, we define a desired current behavior which reflects an objective of attaining field orientation. Four, we design a controller that insures the torques generated by the motors asymptotically track the desired torque. Parameters of electrical vehicle and motors are known. The local stability is obtained for controller with the nonlinear observer of rotor motor currents. Simulation results are presented with a electrical vehicle in Matlab-Simulink to illustrate the performance of the control law.

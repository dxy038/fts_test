After a brief introduction to the project site selection of industrial plant (PSSIP), a new model of PSSIP, with which the comparison between elements in the feasible set and ideal references out of the feasible set can be achieved, is proposed according to the Extenics and its matter element (ME) theories founded by a Chinese scholar Wen Cai. Firstly, the matter element of feasible schemes (MEFS) is not only established but also standardized by the eigenvalue of different evaluating indexes in this model. Secondly, the matter element of ideal references (MEIR) is established with the help of the value range analysis of all the eigenvalues of each MEFS and then the degree of nearness between MEFS and MEIR can be detected by Euclid Distance. Thirdly, in order to modify the model which can hardly embody the importance levels of different evaluating indexes, the compound weight considering both the subjective weight with priority judgment method and the objective weight with entropy method is raised in this paper. Fourthly, the comprehensive degree of nearness between MEFS and MEIR gained by the improved calculation of Euclid Distance with the compound weight can be used as the criterion to select industrial site. Finally, with a case study of a coal preparation plant in Shaanxi, China, it is suggested that the model of PSSIP based on ME analysis is practical and exercisable and its result is believable.

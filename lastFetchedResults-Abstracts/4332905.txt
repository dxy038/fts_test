To meet the need for additional performance and memory, IBM has defined an approach to insert VHSIC (very high speed integrated circuit) technology into the AP-102, while avoiding any changes to the external operational interfaces and, at the same time, minimizing effects on the existing operational flight software. The objective of the AP-102 upgrade effort is twofold: (1) to develop a high-performance replacement for the AP-102 CPU (central processing unit) card and memory card(s) with options for various amounts of memory via directly populating components, and (2) to modify the AP-102 battery backup unit to provide a 30-day warning plus additional current capacity. The AP-102A represents a significant improvement in performance, memory capacity, reliability, power, weight, and reduced logistics support, and will allow weapons systems to effectively incorporate new functions and capabilities to improve mission success

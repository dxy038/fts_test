This paper establishes an evaluation indicator system of clothing brand competitiveness from four aspects: brand loyalty degree, brand innovation ability, brand market ability and brand basic ability. Among those, brand loyalty degree reflects customer value of brands, while brand innovation ability, brand market ability and brand basic ability reflects enterprise value of brands. We select B-P neural network as the evaluation method. We have made empirical analyses based on the introduction of the evaluation mechanism of B-P neural network. The results of the analyses not only indicate that customer value is important for clothing enterprises and the amount of customer value reflects the strength of the competence of an enterprise, but also show that the application of B-P neural network to evaluate the competence of clothing enterprises is very effective, objective and accurate.

The objective of This work is to derive an efficient and optimal ordering method for genes produced by binary hierarchical clustering. The proposed method examines all possible 2<sup>n-1</sup> orderings in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity. Compared to the previously proposed methods, our proposed solution is efficient and optimal.

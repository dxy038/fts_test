This paper examines active crystals for high-performance nanotechnology-enhanced microscale opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS). With the ultimate objective to deflect the beam in three-dimensional space, we study opto-electromagnetically-active crystals. With novel technology and control paradigm, super-high-performance MOEMS can be designed. The design, analysis and optimization tasks are forefront fundamental and technological challenges for advanced microsystems with MOEMS. These MOEMS support advanced far-reaching technology and can be uniquely utilized in nanolithography, optics, informatics, communication, computing, imaging, microscopy, diagnostics, biometrics and other areas.

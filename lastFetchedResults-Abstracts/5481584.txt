In P2P overlay network, peers are able to directly share and exchange information without the help of a server. This results in a prompt and secure sharing of network resources and data handling. However, flooding algorithm that is used in distributed P2P network generated query message excessively. Our objective in this paper is to proposes a presents a restricted path flooding algorithm that can decrease query message´s occurrence to solve P2P network´s problems. It includes concepts as well as systematic procedures of the proposed scheme for fast path flooding in distributed P2P overlay networks.

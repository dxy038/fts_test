Abstract â€” The speech, being a fundamental way of
communication for the humans, has been embedded in
various essential applications like speech recognition, voicedistance-
talk and other forms of personal communications.
There are so many applications of speech still to be far from
reality just because of lack of efficient and reliable noise
removal mechanism and techniques for preserving or
improving the intelligibility for the speech signals. The broad
categories of speech enhancement techniques can be listed as
speech filtering techniques, beam forming techniques and
active noise cancellation methods. In this paper, our work
has two-fold objective. First is to improve the speech
recognition performance in multi-microphone environment.
Second, we attempted to analyze the performance of speech
recognition against the filter-bank parameters; filter length
and number of subbands. The experiments were performed
for 20 words including numbers and commands, 10 words of
numbers only and 10 words of commands only for different
values of filter bank parameters. The results obtained have
proved the speech enhancing capability of the beamforming
technique in multi-microphone network where noise and
echo-interference can degrade the original speech signal.

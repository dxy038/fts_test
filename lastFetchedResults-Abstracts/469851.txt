Objective
Partial hydatidiform moles infrequently progress to gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal duration of human chorionic gonadotropin surveillance.
Study design
We retrospectively reviewed the clinical follow-up of all women who were diagnosed with partial hydatidiform mole at our institution from 1983 to 2003.
Results
One hundred sixty-three patients were identified with a median age of 23 years (range, 14-42 years). Seventy-four patients (45%) attained undetectable levels of human chorionic gonadotropin; none of the patients had gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Forty patients completed the 6 months of recommended follow-up; 6 patients conceived during surveillance, and 28 patients did not return for any further office visits 1 to 5 months after achieving remission. Eighty-three patients (51%) were lost to follow-up before normalization of human chorionic gonadotropin. Six women (4%) had stage I gestational trophoblastic neoplasia during surveillance.
Conclusion
Our results support the suggestion that a single undetectable human chorionic gonadotropin level after evacuation is sufficient follow-up to ensure remission in patients with partial hydatidiform moles.

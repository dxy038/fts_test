Objective
duals with bipolar disorder face a nearly two-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality relative to the general population. Endothelial dysfunction precedes cardiovascular disease and serves as a quantifiable phenotype for vasculopathy. We investigated whether individuals with bipolar disorder had poorer vascular function than controls using a caseâ€“control design.
s
mple of 54 participants included 27 individuals with bipolar disorder and 27 age- and gender-matched controls. Participants underwent an assessment of metabolic (weight, lipids, and insulin resistance) and vascular parameters (endothelial function using flow-mediated dilation; arterial stiffness using pulse wave velocity and estimated aortic pressure).
s
ipants had a mean age of 32 years and 41% were female. No significant differences were found between groups in endothelial function or arterial stiffness. Individuals with bipolar disorder demonstrated 100% greater insulin resistance.
sion
ck of clinically significant differences in vascular function in this young sample suggests any increased risk either occurs later in the course of illness or is largely due to behavioral risk factors, such as smoking, which was balanced between groups. Substantial insulin resistance is identifiable early in course of illness, perhaps secondary to treatment.

This paper is proposing the Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) controlled bidirectional DC-DC converter with the mechanism of switching between upper and lower switches for solar power storage in the battery and presented the simulation results for the same. The proposed bi-directional DC-DC converter is designed at high gain in both buck and boost modes. The implementation of this algorithm for charging and discharging control considered for the battery storage system is efficient. In both the modes of operation of the bi-directional DC-DC Converter are controlled with the help of voltage mode control. The feasibility of proposed converting is verified by the simulation.

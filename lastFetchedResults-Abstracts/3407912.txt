This paper presents a novel approach for dealing with the structural risk minimization (SRM) applied to a general setting of the machine learning problem. The formulation is based on the fundamental concept that supervised learning is a bi-objective optimization problem in which two conflicting objectives should be minimized. The objectives are related to the empirical training error and the machine complexity. In this paper, one general Q-norm method to compute the machine complexity is presented, and, as a particular practical case, the minimum gradient method (MGM) is derived relying on the definition of the fat-shattering dimension. A practical mechanism for parallel layer perceptron (PLP) network training, involving only quasi-convex functions, is generated using the aforementioned definitions. Experimental results on 15 different benchmarks are presented, which show the potential of the proposed ideas.

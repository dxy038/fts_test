How to evaluate enterprise´s technological innovation ability by scientific, normative and quantitative method? We all realize that this kind of evaluation method is significant to succeed in carrying on enterprise´s technological innovation and establishing and keeping enterprise´s competition advantage. Firstly, this paper classified enterprise´s technological innovation ability into four evaluation indexes based on literature research. Secondly, we analyzed the general process of enterprise´s technological innovation capacity evaluation and established an evaluation model based on entropy theory and osculating value method. Finally, we took three new and high tech-enterprises as an example to evaluate and order their technological innovation abilities. The result indicated that this evaluation method is simpler, more objective and effective than traditional evaluation method of enterprise´s technological innovation capacity.

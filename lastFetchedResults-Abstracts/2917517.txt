Many mineral transformer oils contain contaminant PCB´s at low levels (generally less than 1000 ppm). This contamination occurred during bulk transport. International standards and inter-government agreements (eg North Sea Conference in 1991) will limit permitted contamination to no greater than 50 ppm. Since mineral oil resources for napthenic grade transformer oil are limited and removal of PCB´s are the objective, the technology of chemical dechlorination of PCB´s while simultaneously reclaiming the mineral oil was investigated along with PCB removal alternatives. This process known as `PCB-Gone´ is moderate in its reaction yet very effective in destruction of the PCB molecule

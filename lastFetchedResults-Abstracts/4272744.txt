In this paper eccentric salient pole synchronous machine (SPSM) models based on modified winding function approach (MWFA) and finite element (FE) are compared. The objective is to identify the eccentricity specific harmonic components present in the line current and field current of the synchronous machine unambiguously through simulation. By comparing the results it is found that the MWFA based model is better suited because not only it is computationally faster but also identifies the fault specific harmonic components with better clarity. These results are confirmed through experiments.

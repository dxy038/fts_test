The objective of robust design is to optimise the mean and minimize the variability that results from uncertainty represented by noise factors. The various objective functions and analysis techniques used for the Taguchi based approaches and optimisation methods are reviewed. Most applications of robust design have been concerned with static performance in mechanical engineering and process systems, and applications in structural dynamics are rare. The robust design of a vibration absorber with mass and stiffness uncertainty in the main system is used to demonstrate the robust design approach in dynamics. The results show a significant improvement in performance compared with the conventional solution.

Background: Studies have shown that Physalis alkekengi reduces implantation and
induces antifertility in rat. In Iranian traditional medicine it is believed that this plant
has abortifacient and antifertility activities.
Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of Physalis alkekengi ripe
fruit hydroalcoholic extract (PFE) on uterine contractility and its possible
mechanism(s).
Materials and Methods: Extraction of Physalis alkekengi fruit was carried out by
maceration method (70% alcohol). Uterus was dissected out from adult non-pregnant rat
(Wistar) and contracted by KCl (60mM) or oxytocin (10mU/ml) in an organ bath
containing De Jalon solution and the effect of PFE on the uterine contractions was
investigated. Furthermore, the role of ?- and B-adrenoceptors, opioid receptors, nitric
oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate synthesis inhibitors on the extract effects
were evaluated.
Results: KCl- and oxytocin-induced uterine contractions were inhibited (p < 0.001) by
the cumulative concentrations of the extract in a concentration dependent manner.
Incubation of uterus with propranolol (1?M) and L-NAME (100?M) attenuated the PFE
antispasmodic effect (p < 0.05). But the PFE effect was unaffected by phentolamine
(1?M), naloxone (1?M) or methylene blue (10?M). In Ca2+-free with high potassium
(60mM) De Jalon solution, cumulative concentrations of CaCl2 (0.1-0.5mM) induced
uterine contraction concentration-dependently (p < 0.001). Uterus incubation (5min) with
PFE (0.25-1.75mg/ml) attenuated the CaCl2â€“induced contractions (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: It seems that the extract induced antispasmodic effect mainly via calcium
influx blockade and partially through blocking B-adrenoceptors and nitric oxide (NO)
synthesis. However, neither ?-adrenoceptors nor opioid receptors or cGMP synthesis
were involved.

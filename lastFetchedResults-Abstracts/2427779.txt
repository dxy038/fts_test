One the most important manifestation of underground mining activities is its potential influence on the initiation and reactivation of the slope movements. However, an adequate attention has not yet been paid to these problems. The goal of this study is to analyze the possible influence of present and former mining activities on the selected set of model slope deformations in the Ostrava–Karviná Coalfield and also to describe a methodology for their observation for the application to similar conditions and influence. Three different methodologies applied in three different case studies of slope deformations, where the subsidences are still active. In the first case study (Doubrava Vrchovec) inclinometer was not used, in the second (Doubrava Ujala) case study only one inclinometer was installed in landslide body, and in the third case study (Staříč) two inclinometers were installed as one of them was inside of the landslide body while the other inclinometer was outside. For evaluation of the impact, isocatabase maps, terrain deformation parameters calculated for the point lying on the slope deformation surface, length measurement by zone extensometer and dilatometer measurement in cracks was also provided. In order to show that inclination of both boreholes is an evidence of underground mining impact, localization of inclinometer measurement on boreholes in the active part as well as in the near vicinity was found as very important. Thus, the study contributed to a more objective knowledge of these problems of interest for the professional public and also for the state administration to solve problems associated with the utilization and settlement of such affected areas.

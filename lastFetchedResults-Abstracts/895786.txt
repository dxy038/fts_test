Background: Paralytic ileus after abdominal surgery causes abdominal distention, pain, accumulation of gas, nausea and vomiting. Chewing gum can increase bowel movements and reduce the transient period of paralysis.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of gum chewing in the reduction of paralytic ileus following cholecystectomy.
Methods: This interventional study was conducted on 40 patients undergoing cholecystectomy in Kerman University of Medical Sciences, 2011. After surgery, they were randomly allocated to intervention (gum chewing) and control groups. Patients in the intervention group chewed sugar free gum 3 times a day for an hour each time after full consciousness. The first bowel sounds, flatus passage and defecation were recorded in both groups. Data were analyzed using student T-test. 
Findings: The first gas passing was reported 21.05±12.8 and 40.8±15.9 hours following operation in intervention and control groups, respectively. The first defection was occurred 38.1±29.8 and 58.25±18.6 hours after operation in intervention and control groups, respectively. The first bowel sounds were heard 4±1.02 and 4.9±1.3 hours post-operatively in intervention and control groups, respectively.  In all three cases, the differences between two groups was statistically significant.
Conclusion: With regard to the results, gum chewing is an inexpensive and useful approach that reduces paralytic ileus following cholecystectomy.

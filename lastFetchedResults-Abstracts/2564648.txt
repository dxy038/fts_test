In recent years, increasing use of public urban transportation and road networks causes that route planning is now becomes a necessary element in the transportation networks more than ever. Multimodal network is a special case of the transportation network in which we are able to use different transportation modes. In this network, the sequence of the transportation modes is as important as the sequence of nodes in determining the optimal route take into account the constraints. In this paper, a multiobjective mathematical modeling multimodal network has been presented. In addition to minimize the number of changing modes, cost and the time are also considered in the objective function. An approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming has been developed. Furthermore, the experimental analysis shows that the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in compared to NSGAII algorithm. Moreover, a real case study based on the public transportation system in Tehran is solved by our model.

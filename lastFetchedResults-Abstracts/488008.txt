The main question in this article is whether it is possible to prove the existence of the materially objective world. The author first reviews different Muslim philosophers' ideas on this topic, including those of Farabi, Ibn Sina, Bahmanyar, Shaykh Ishraq, and Muhaqiq Tusi. Then he focuses on Mulla Sadra and peruses various aspects of his viewpoint.
The methodology of the author is analytical-rational, in which all the premises, whether explicit or implicit, are brought to the fore, and discussed.

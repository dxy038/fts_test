In this paper, a new method is proposed for network loss and voltage deviation minimization in distribution networks. The proposed method makes use of multi-objective meta-heuristics (MOMH) that evaluates a set of the Pareto solutions systematically. The power networks become more deregulated and competitive due to the power liberalization. Hence, the cost minimization has been recognized as one of the most important factors in distribution systems. To compete with other players, saving the cost is of main concern in distribution companies This paper focuses on network reconfigurations and capacitor control to minimize the two objective functions of the network loss and voltage deviation minimization. The formulation may be expressed as a combinatorial optimization problem. It needs to use MOMH to evaluate a set of the Pareto solutions for the two objective functions. As MOMH, this paper uses SPEA2 to solve the minimization problem. The proposed method is successfully applied to the 69-node distribution system.

Importance and applicability of numerical flow analysis to environmental science are outlined. Fluid phenomena in the ocean, rivers, atmosphere and the ground are investigated by means of numerical methods and in turn proposals for the control, restoration and counterplans against the so-called environmental disrupters which disorder natural environment as well as ecological systems in nature. All such environmental disrupters diffuse in and are transported by environmental fluids. Those disrupters sometimes react on some other chemicals to generate offensive odor and even more poisonous materials. Environmental fluid dynamics is effective for the evaluation, prediction and restoration of the environmental damage. In this paper we focus our attention on the dynamical analysis of the diffusion and advection processes of environmental disrupters in environmental fluids. The first objective is to make an attempt to formulate a mathematical model for environmental fluids. The second objective is to exhibit some results of numerical simulations of the motion of offensive odor or pollutants in the atmosphere over a complex geographical topography.

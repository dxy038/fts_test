Objective
To investigate possible relationships between patient and clinical factors and patient satisfaction with new complete dentures.
Methods

Patients attending King's College London Dental Institute, Guy's Hospital, London, for new complete dentures were recruited. Relevant history was recorded and the edentulous mouth and existing dentures, where present, were examined at the beginning of treatment. The edentulous mouth, the previous and new dentures were re-examined at the first post-insertion visit. Three months after this visit, patients were sent a postal questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling techniques.
Results

723 patients were recruited. Significant relationships were found between quality of complete dentures, quality of residual alveolar, adaptability factors and patients’ satisfaction with complete dentures.
Conclusions

Quality of the mandibular residual alveolar ridges, retention and stability of the mandibular dentures, accuracy of reproduction of retruded jaw relationship and patient adaptability were powerful determinants of patients’ satisfaction with new complete dentures.

The socialization of emergency rescue, diversity of emergency resource requirements, time variety of emergency demand and resource replenishment, raise new challenges to emergency logistics. The urgency of emergency logistics demands the highest possibility of resource supply to disaster point. Moreover, the cost of emergency logistics should be minimized in economic view. Through discretizing the plan time into time periods, and the presumption of predictable demand and replenishment of emergency resources, a multi-objective optimization model of multiple supply points, multiple resource types and single disaster point was proposed for emergency resource distribution to minimize the times of emergency resource shortage and the transport cost. The simulation study shows that the model can be solved quickly by optimization engine, and by analyzing the results of optimization, the resource types of shortage and the supply periods ought to be reinforced can be discovered.

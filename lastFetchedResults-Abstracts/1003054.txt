Background and Objective: Uterus of rat with polycystic ovary (PCO) may show pathological features. We provided pathological evidence for the rat uterus with NO-induced PCO.   
Materials and Methods: Wistar rats (weighing 200-250 g) were kept diestrous to receive L-arginine (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 9 days/once a day. Control group solely received saline (1 ml/kg, 9 days/once per day). At the end of the treatment period, all animals were surgically studied. The ratsâ€™ ovaries and uteri were examined biometrically and collected in 10% formalin. The pathological data were collectively determined.
Results: The treated ovaries of rats showed polycystic characteristics when compared with the control. The uteri of treated rats also showed pathological changes as compared to those that belonged to the controls. 
Conclusion: The pathological aspect of rat uterus may be linked with the cystic characteristic of ovary in PCO model. This study provides pathological evidence for uterus of rat with PCO.

Although many mesh generation methods have been developed, difficulties still exist in generating high-quality structured hex-meshes for specific local geometric features such as holes and columns in three-dimensional models. In this paper, a mesh generation approach is proposed to overcome the problem of meshing local features having regular structure with high quality. Firstly, analyze the featureÂ´s geometry information and customize its mesh process. Secondly, introduce parametric design into the optimization of mesh customization. Scaled Jacobian and aspect ratio are taken as indexes of the objective functions. Thirdly, an optimized module of the feature is set up by integrating the meshing scheme into program. By establishing a knowledge base of optimized modules corresponding to geometric features, a local feature can be automatically meshed according to its geometry information. Experiments in this paper reveal that the method is applicable and stable for generating high-quality meshes for local geometric features with regular structure.

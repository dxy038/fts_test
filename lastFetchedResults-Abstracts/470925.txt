Objective
The objective of the study was to determine the impact of overactive bladder on sexual function from a preliminary analysis of the Multicenter Assessment of Transdermal Therapy in Overactive Bladder with Oxybutynin study.
Study design
The Multicenter Assessment of Transdermal Therapy in Overactive Bladder with Oxybutynin study was an open-label, prospective trial of 2878 subjects with overactive bladder, treated with transdermal oxybutynin for 6 months or less. The impact of overactive bladder on sexual function before and after treatment was assessed via item responses from the King's Health Questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory-II (kappa-test).
Results
At baseline, 586 (23.1%) reported that overactive bladder had an impact on their sex life. Coital incontinence in 569 (22.8%) decreased after treatment to 438 (19.3%). Effects of overactive bladder on subjects' sex lives improved in 19.1% (worsened in 11.2%), and the effect on relationships with partners improved in 19.6% (worsened in 11.9%). Reduced interest in sex, reported by 52.1% at baseline, improved significantly. (all P< .0001).
Conclusion
Overactive bladder negatively affects sexual function. Treatment with transdermal oxybutynin improved sexual function and marital relationships.

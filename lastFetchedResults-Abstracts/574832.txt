Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) model is a simple and flexible tool to evaluate the organizationâ€™s strengths and weaknesses to implement the necessary resources in an appropriate manner. The primary objective of this research is to present an improved model for IPA (i.e. Importance-Performance-Simplicity Analysis) to assess the simplicity of improvement about each of the attributes lying in the matrix and to prioritize them in each quadrant for improvement. Since the attributes lying in quadrant 2 of IPA are very important for customers and, at the same time, has a low level of perceived performance, this paper suggests that management started improvement of these attributes according to the prioritization. In this model, the attributes are prioritized based on simplicity of changes for management while preserving its simplicity of use. For this purpose, Force Field Analysis (FFA) as a simple and effective tool is used for the IPA model. Finally, an example was presented in order to make the model clear.

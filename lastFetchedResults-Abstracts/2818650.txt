Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is formed by deploying several sensor nodes in a region of interest for gathering information. The measured events are broadcasted via many sensor nodes to reach the sink node. In this scenario, there is a possibility for the presence of one or many jamming nodes which can introduce jamming attack into the network, which is a typical Denial of Service (DoS) attack. To escape from jamming Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum technique is used where in the information will be transmitted with different carrier frequencies at different intervals of time. Therefore the intruder node might not be able to detect the data carrier frequency at an instant. In order to get synchronized, all nodes in sensor network should have same hopping pattern. The objective is to generate an indefinite length of uncorrelated frequency hopping pattern, to ensure secured communication between sensor nodes with low memory. The idea is to build security architecture within all wireless sensor nodes present in the network to provide secured radio channel selection for data transmission from source to sink nodes.

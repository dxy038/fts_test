It has been shown that network coding can lead to significant improvement in network capacity and reduction in power consumption for multicast traffic in wireless networks. In this paper, we study the problem of supporting multicast in wireless sensor networks. The objective is to jointly maximize the network lifetime and minimize the number of packets undergoing network coding. We formulate the problem of establishing coding subgraph in the network as a linear programming problem, which is suitable for distributed implementation. We propose a new set of information flow variables, which enables us to determine the rate of performing network coding. Simulation results show that the network lifetime achieved by our proposed scheme is 20% higher than the maximum lifetime Steiner tree algorithm.

Objective: The appropriate interaction between a blastocyst and the endometrium is essential for successful implantation. Numerous factors, including hormone receptors (progesterone receptor),
cytokines [leukemia inhibitory factors (LIF)], and adherence molecules such as E-cadherin
are
involved
in
the cross-talk
that
occurs
between the embryo
and endometrium.
Studies

show
that
a
lack
of
these
genes
impact
endometrial
receptivity.
In
this
study,
we
compare
the

expression levels of E-cadherin, LIF, and progesterone receptor (PgR) genes in blastocysts that have been obtained from superovulated mice to those obtained from natural cycles.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, for the experimental group, a total of 17 virgin female NMRI mice (6- 8 weeks old) were injected with 7.5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin

(PMSG). Their blastocysts (approximately n= 120) were flushed out after 3.5 days, following administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The control group consisted of blastocysts from 62 female mice that were mated with male mice. The natural cycle blastocysts were flushed out from the female mice uteri 3.5 days after mating. The expression levels of Ecadherin,
LIF,
t
PgR genes
were
examined
by
quantitative
real-time
reverse-transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
(RT-PCR).
Data
were
analyzed
by
the
studentâ€™s
t-test
(one
sample
t-test).



Results: Expression levels of all studied genes were significantly lower in the hormonetreated
group compared to the natural cycle blastocysts (p < 0.05). 
Conclusion: Although ovarian stimulation is utilized to obtain more oocytes in ART cycles,
it seems that this could disadvantageous to
implantation because
of the decrease in
expression levels of certain
genes. Because of the
important
roles of E-cadherin,
LIF,

and
progesterone
receptor in
the implantation process,
we have shown
lower
expression

levels
of
these genes in mouse blastocysts obtained from
ovarian-stimulated mice
than those
derived from the natural cycle.
The
results observed in
this study have shown the

possibility
of an unfavorable effect
on implantation and pregnancy rate.

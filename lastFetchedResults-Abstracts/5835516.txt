A grasp with an admittance center will have the following three consequential advantages: (1) the disturbing forces and motions experienced by the grasped object result in motions and forces on the respective degrees of freedom only; (2) the task of specifying the behavior of the object then reduces to that of specifying the behaviors of a finite number of linear second-order systems; and (3) each degree of freedom of the grasp will then be a linear second-order system and will always be stable. Since all such degrees of freedom are dynamically decoupled, the grasp as a whole will be stable. Contributing to achieve such a behavior in articulated multifingered grasps is the prime objective of the work

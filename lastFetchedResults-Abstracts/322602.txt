Several stratagems are used in protein bioinformatics for the classification of proteins based on sequence, structure or function. We explore the concept of a minimal signature embedded in a sequence that defines the likely position of a protein in a classification. Specifically, we address the derivation of sparse profiles for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) clan of integral membrane proteins. We present an evolutionary algorithm (EA) for the derivation of sparse profiles (signatures) without the need to supply a multiple alignment. We also apply an evolution strategy (ES) to the problem of pattern and profile refinement. Patterns were derived for the GPCR ‘superfamily’ and GPCR families 1–3 individually from starting populations of randomly generated signatures, using a database of integral membrane protein sequences and an objective function using a modified receiver operator characteristic (ROC) statistic. The signature derived for the family 1 GPCR sequences was shown to perform very well in a stringent cross-validation test, detecting 76% of unseen GPCR sequences at 5% error. Application of the ES refinement method to a signature developed by a previously described method [Sadowski, M.I., Parish, J.H., 2003. Automated generation and refinement of protein signatures: case study with G-protein coupled receptors. Bioinformatics 19, 727–734] resulted in a 6% increase of coverage for 5% error as measured in the validation test. We note that there might be a limit to this or any classification of proteins based on patterns or schemata.

Movement of materials, plant and site operative from one place to another on construction sites and construction workplaces are of paramount importance to site planners as savings in travel distance can reduce cost and increase productivity. In addition, risks on construction sites can be reduced if the use of vehicles and mobile plant is properly managed by setting out paths avoiding high risks areas. The work reported in this paper presents a framework for supporting path planning analysis of construction sites based on multi-objective evaluation of transport cost, safety, and visibility. This paper investigates the use of fuzzy-based multi-objective optimisation approach in making a more informed strategic decisions regarding the movement path of people and vehicles on construction sites, and detailed decisions regarding travel distance and operational paths on workplaces, enabling site planners to examine paths scenarios that are subjected to a high degree of uncertainty and subjectivity.

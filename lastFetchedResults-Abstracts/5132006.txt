This paper studies probabilistically reliable multicast in wireless mesh networks (WMNs), utilizing MAC layer re-transmission and wireless broadcast advantage to improve both the multicast throughput and the delivery rate. We first present a new multicast routing metric which we call the expected multicast transmissions (EMT). EMT captures the effect of link packet delivery ratio, MAC layer retransmission and wireless broadcast advantage at the same time. The EMT of a MAC layer multicast transmission is the expected number of data transmissions (including retransmissions) required for a packet to reach all the recipients. The EMT of a multicast tree is the sum over the EMT of each forwarding node. Then, we propose a probabilistically reliable on-demand (PROD) multicast protocol with the objective of minimizing the EMT of the multicast tree. Simulation results show that, in comparison with existing approaches, PROD reduces the end-to-end packet loss ratio by up to 30% and improves the multicast throughput by up to 25%. In addition, it reduces the number of transmissions per packet by up to 40% and thus significantly reduces the network overhead of the multicast session.

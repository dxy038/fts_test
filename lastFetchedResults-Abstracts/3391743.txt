A bidirectional associative memory using switched-capacitor (SC) filter techniques (SCBAM) is introduced and verified experimentally. The discrete-time equation that characterizes SC filter design is shown to be applicable in recalling <e1>m</e1> stored vector pairs that can be encoded in a correlation matrix <e1>M</e1>. The elements of <e1>M</e1> (and <e1>M</e1><sup>T</sup>) are represented by the values of the capacitor ratios used in the SCBAM. The SCBAM exhibits similar error correcting properties as the normal BAM, making it a good candidate for analog VLSI neural network implementations

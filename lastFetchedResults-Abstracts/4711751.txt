In this paper, we propose the distributed algorithm for joint optimal cross-layer design in multi-radio multi-channel multi-hop networks. The main objective of this work is to joint optimize injected rate and resource allocation in MRMC networks. In this regard, we formulate the optimal design problem as a mathematic programming where the channel load and input traffic are jointly optimized under the interference limited model. To solve this programming effectively, we decompose the problem to some sub-problems, which are conducted in parallel at each node. The algorithms can be viewed as jointly optimization on the link layer and the transport layer so that end-to-end objectives are met. We provide simulations show that the proposed distributed algorithm is highly efficient for MRMC networks.

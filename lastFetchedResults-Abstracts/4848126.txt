In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling n jobs in an s-stage hybrid flowshop with batch production at the last stage with the objective of minimizing a given criterion which consists of three parts: the total weighted earliness, the total weighted tardiness and the total weighted waiting time. The batch production under our study is referred to as serial batches. To solve the problem we proposed an efficient GA approach.

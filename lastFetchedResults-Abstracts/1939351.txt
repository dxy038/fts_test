Inroduction & Objective: The monoclonal antibodies are the specific proteins that used widely in targeted therapy. Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody that is used for treatment of breast cancer. In this study, the radiolabeling of Herceptin antibody with technetium was evaluated as the first step in the production of a new radiopharmaceutical agent.
 Materials and Methods: All the quality control tests include radiochemical purity, immunoreactivity, stability in phosphate buffer and human blood serum were determined and finally the biodistribution study of this complex in souris mice was performed. 
Results: The radiochemical purity of the complex was 97±2%. The stabilities in phosphate buffer and in human blood serum at 24 hours post preparation were 84±1% and 75±2%, respectively. The immunoreactivity of the complex was 86±3%. No specific accumulation of activity was found in mice organs.
Conclusion: The findings showed that the new radiopharmaceutical can be a promising candidate for diagnostic applications in wide spectrum of human cancers.

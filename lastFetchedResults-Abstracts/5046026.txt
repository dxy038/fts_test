In this paper, we address virtual network embedding problem. Indeed, our objective is to map virtual networks in the substrate network with minimum physical resources while satisfying its required QoS in terms of bandwidth, power processing and memory. In doing so, we minimize the reject rate of requests and maximize returns for the substrate network provider. Since the problem is NP-hard and to deal with its computational hardness, we propound a new scalable embedding strategy named VNE-AC based on the Ant Colony metaheuristic. The intensive simulations and evaluation results show that our proposal enhances the substrate providerÂ´s revenue and outperforms the related strategies found in current literature.

In this paper, we present a compressive sensing-based image denoising algorithm using spatially adaptive image representation and estimation of optimal error tolerance based on sparse signal analysis. The proposed method performs block-based multiple compressive sampling after decomposing the sparse signal into feature and non-feature regions using simple statistical analysis. For minimization of recovery error and number of iterations, the modified OMP method estimates the optimal error tolerance using the average variance in the recovery step. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed denoising algorithm better removes noise without undesired artifacts than existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both objective (PSNR/SSIM) and subjective measures. Processing time of the proposed method is 5 to 10 times faster than the standard OMP-based method.

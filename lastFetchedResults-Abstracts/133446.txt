Introduction: Blink Reflex (BR) is an electro diagnostic test, which is equivalent to the corneal reflex. BR responses are classified as RI, R2 and R2c. Abnormalities of these responses have been reported in brainstem lesions. Objective: This article aims to survey diagnosis of brainstem strokes by BR in comparison to MR1 findings.
Materials and Methods: Twenty-two brainstem stroke patients were evaluated. Brain MRI and BR were obtained within the first 48 hours in all of them. Ten control cases of similar age and sex were enrolled to the study for determination of normal and abnormal range of BR responses. At last MRI finding were compared with BR responses.
Results: from the total of 22 patients, MRI did 21 correct diagnosis of brainstem and BR did 20. BR correctly diagnosed one case, not diagnosed by MRI, and two cases with normal BR was diagnosed by MRI.. BR responses were also analyzed in midbrain, pons , modullary and cerebellar lesions . Brain MRI and BR were successful in diagnosis of the brainstem lesions in 95.4% and 90.9% cases respectively, and each test revealed some cases unidentified by other method.
Conclusion: In diagnosis of brainstem lesions, it is better to use clinical findings, MRI and etectrophysiological tests together. This policy can minimized the undiagnosed fraction of brainstem stroke and may prevent a catastrophic outcome.

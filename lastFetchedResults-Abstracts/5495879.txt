The authors provide a framework for conceptualizing the interaction between a development group in a technology-intensive firm and a customer organization. Once the objective of the link has been established, the framework can be used to identify the tasks which must be planned for to increase the likelihood of the success of the link from the development groupÂ´s viewpoint. The focal point of the framework is the structure of the collectivity charged with the interaction. The authors conceptualize a multilayered interpretation of this structure and then use it to examine eight interactions which differ in terms of end-objectives. A set of inferences regarding the structure of collectivities charged with benchmarking, technology trials, information monitoring, joint planning, business account development, quality conformance, standards coalition, and transfer of technology is generated

In this paper, we propose a linguistic summarization procedure for describing long-term trends of change in human behavior. Our objective consists of defining methods that provide information to elders, caregivers, social workers or even family in an understandable language. We adapt a measure that we defined in previous work on soft cluster partition similarity for comparing behaviors that are adapted over time. From that measure, we are able to produce a time series that numerically describes change in behavior over time. In this article, the resulting time series is partitioned and linguistically summarized depending on a userÂ´s (caregiver, social worker, etc.) desired time resolution. Simulated resident behavior is used in order to explore a range of different scenarios and the response of the proposed linguistic summarization process is investigated.

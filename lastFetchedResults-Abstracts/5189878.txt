Game theory methods have advanced various disciplines from social science, notably economics and biology, and engineering. Game theory establishes an optimal strategy for multiple players in either a cooperative or noncooperative manner where the objective is to reach an equilibrium state among the players. A Stackelberg game strategy involves a leader and a follower that follow a hierarchy relationship where the leader enforces its strategy on the follower. In this paper, a general framework is developed for feedback control of an Euler Lagrange system using an open-loop Stackelberg differential game. A Robust Integral Sign of the Error (RISE) controller is used to cancel uncertain nonlinearities in the system and a Stackelberg optimal controller is used for stabilization in the presence of uncertainty. A Lyapunov analysis is provided to examine the stability of the developed controller.

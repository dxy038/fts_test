    The objective of this study was to find out the most suitable date of seed sowing in respect to quantitative and qualitative growth of Pinus brutia and Cupressus sempervirens var. horizontalis seedlings in forest nursery from September 2003 to September 2005. In respect to quantitative parameters of both studied species (mean collar diameter, mean height), the sowing date in autumn was better than the spring (P < 0.01). In respect to qualitative parameters and survival of seedlings there was no significant difference between the sowing dates for Pinus brutia. However, for Cypress the autumn sowing date was better than spring (P < 0.01).

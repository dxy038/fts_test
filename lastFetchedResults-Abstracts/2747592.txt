This paper presents a solution for multi-objective economic dispatch problem with transmission losses semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation. The vector objective is reduced to an equivalent scalar objective through the weighted sum method. The resulting optimization problem is formulated as a convex optimization via SDP relaxation. The convex optimization problem was solved to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions. The diversity of the solution set was improved by a nonlinear selection of the weight factor. Simulations were performed on IEEE 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus test systems to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Solutions were compared to those from one of the well-known evolutionary methods. Results show that SDP has an inherently good convergence property and a lower but comparable diversity property.

In this paper the authors analyse the algorithms and the relevant numerical optimisation techniques for the design of magnetic power devices, with reference to cast-resin distribution transformers. A numerical optimisation algorithm based on genetic algorithms and its application to the design technique is described. Objective functions to be minimised are discussed. Numerical results allow to evaluate the efficiency and the reliability of the proposed method

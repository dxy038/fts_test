Correctional Service Canada (CSC) operates 57 Institutions equipped with a range of mission critical Security, Communications and Access Management systems. These include CCTV assessment, intrusion detection, radio communications and door control systems. User Interfaces range from colour graphic touch screens to knobs, push buttons etc. Operational and technical challenges include the following issues: 1) sub-system technology is vendor specific, 2) reliability is critical in a challenging environment, 3) system maintenance is expensive, 4) inconsistent "Look and Feel" resulting in usability issues, 5) costly to add new systems, multiple, legacy and proprietary protocols &amp; connectivity approaches, legacy installations are cable intensive, 6) minimal operator or maintenance training crossover, 7) procurement requirements drive "silo" system implementation. The objective is to develop a "next generation" systems architecture that will: "abstract" the subsystem user management interfaces, ensuring all sub-systems can be managed using a simple, consistent graphical user interface, accessible using a web browser; model the data and behaviour of the edge devices, doors; cameras, sensors, etc. and normalizes it; allowing them to be managed by and provide notifications to standard software based applications; support inter-domain interoperability; use an industry standard communications protocol, likely with extensions, such as BACNet or SNMP, for edge device to application server connectivity; use TCP/IP over fibre as the preferred transport, network and physical technologies; integrate legacy sub-systems into the application server using mediation software; define the look and feel of the graphical icons that represent the edge devices and the physical environment in which they are placed, so that each domain is presented in a consistent manner. Developing and adopting this architecture will allow Correctional Service Canada to address the challenges of its unique e- - nvironment and support the definition, procurement and deployment of subsystems more effectively.

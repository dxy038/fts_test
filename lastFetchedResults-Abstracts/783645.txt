Objective To examine cross-informant
agreement and whose information (parents, teachers,
children) about childhood bullying and victimization
carry the strongest weight to late adolescent psychiatric
outcome. The importance of frequency of bullying in
such predictions is addressed. Methods Information
from 2,713 boys about bullying and victimization at the
age of eight was correlated with information about
psychiatric disorder at 18–23. Results Agreement
between informants was poor. Teachers reported
higher levels of frequent bullying than others, whereas
children reported the highest percentage of victimization.
All three informant groups’ reports of ‘‘frequent
bullying’’ predicted later psychiatric disorder. Teachers’
reports of ‘‘frequent victimization’’ was the strongest
predictor of later psychiatric disorder. Informants’
report about ‘‘infrequent bullying’’ showed at most a
rather low risk of adverse outcome. When the associations
between bullying/victimization and psychiatric
outcome were adjusted with total psychopathology
score at age 8, none of the associations remained significant.
Conclusion ‘‘Frequent bullying’’ behaviour of
boys is a marker of present and later psychopathology.
The education system and school health-care service in
mid- childhood are of great importance for the early
detection of bullying and prevention of later adverse
outcomes. A closer integration of these systems in the
context of school should be promoted.

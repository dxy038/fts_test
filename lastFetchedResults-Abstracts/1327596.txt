Recently, risks in construction projects have been gradually increasing due to the upsizing of construction projects and the introduction of diverse new methods of construction. Risk management is employed to address potential risks, and on most construction sites risk management is implemented based on managers' intuition. Furthermore, risk analysis information is presented based on complicated numerical analysis, which reduce its usability in practical work. The purpose of this research was to develop a risk management visualization system that can analyze the degrees of risks in construction projects using objective quantifying methodologies for gathering risk information. The information is then presented based on the degree of risks involved. This system can be utilized as a tool to effectively respond to various types of construction risk information. To this end, the fuzzy and analytic hierarchy analysis (AHP) techniques are used as methods to quantify risk information. To visualize the risk information analyzed, a simulation system for visualizing risk information is developed along with a four-dimensional (4D) CAD system. The proposed system is applied to a sample construction project to verify its usability. A work space optimization method that considers risk information and work space is also suggested for further development of the system.

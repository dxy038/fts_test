At Mercer University, we have developed an online interactive chaotic pendulum. This pendulum is unique in that it is not a computer simulation but an actual device that can be remotely controlled through the Internet. Our objective is threefold. We are attempting to provide an educational resource for chaos, demonstrate a new technology, and experiment with a new method of laboratory education. As students vary the driving frequency, they can watch the pendulumÂ´s motion switch from simple periodic motion to chaotic motion. The control software incorporates several mathematical analysis functions so that students can view the pendulum data in different ways. Students can conduct experiments using the pendulum, download their data, and conduct their own mathematical analysis

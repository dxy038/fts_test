This paper presents a new adaptive control approach to power system secondary voltage control (SVC) problem using synchronized phasor measurements as control feedback. The objective is to improve overall system voltage profile by appropriate management of reactive power sources against any unexpected load disturbances. The proposed method is adaptive in the sense that load disturbances are estimated on-line for computing the feasible control inputs for the minimization of the worst case load voltage deviation. That is, the resulting worst load voltage change can precisely remain within the range of predefined constraint using the feasible control inputs. Moreover, the computational burden of the proposed method is low such that it is suitable for on-line applications. Extensive simulation studies on the IEEE 14-bus and the IEEE 30-bus systems have been conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over the traditional robust method.

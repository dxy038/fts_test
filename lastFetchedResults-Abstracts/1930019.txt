The objective of this study was to determine if there is an association between level of milk production and duration of estrus as determined by standing activity recorded by a radiotelemetry system. Holstein cows (n=267; 50 DIM) were fitted with a transmitter that allowed continuous recording of standing activity. Cows were housed in a free-stall barn and milked twice daily. Ovulation was confirmed for all estruses (n=380). Average milk production for the 10 days before the day of estrus was used to classify cows as lower (&lt;39.5 kg/day) or higher (≥39.5 kg/day) producers at the time of estrous expression. Follicle size and serum estradiol (E2) concentrations were determined in a subset of cows (n=71) on the day of estrus. Duration (6.2±0.5 h versus 10.9±0.7 h; P&lt;0.0001), standing events (6.3±0.4 versus 8.8±0.6; P=0.001), and standing time (21.7±1.3 s versus 28.2±1.9 s; P=0.007) were shorter for estruses from higher (46.4±0.4 kg/day; n=146) than lower producers (33.5±0.3 kg/day; n=177). Milk production was correlated with the duration of estrus (r=−0.51; P&lt;0.0001; n=323). Higher producers had lower E2 concentrations than lower producers (6.8±0.5; n=31 versus 8.6±0.5 pg/ml; n=40; P=0.01) in spite of larger pre-ovulatory follicle diameter (18.6±0.3; n=31 versus 17.4±0.2 mm; n=40; P=0.004). Interestingly, E2 concentrations were not correlated with diameter of the pre-ovulatory follicle (r=−0.17; P=0.15) but milk production was correlated with both E2 concentrations (r=−0.57; P&lt;0.0001) and diameter of the pre-ovulatory follicle (r=0.45; P&lt;0.0001). Thus, high milk production decreases duration of estrus probably due to decreased circulating concentrations of E2.

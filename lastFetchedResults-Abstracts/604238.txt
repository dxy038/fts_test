ABSTRACT: In this paper, static and expansion planning of electric power distribution networks were studied using a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm under load uncertainty is presented. This paper consists of two sections. At first by using a novel PSO algorithm, static and mono objective planning was solved for electric distribution network. This work involves both network topology and size of branchesâ€™ conductor. In these stage uncertainties is ignored. The purpose of this stage studying effectiveness of PSO algorithm in distribution networks planning. In the next stage expansion and multi objective planning for electric distribution networks is presented those uncertainties as the important parameters in design distribution network design are considered. Two main objectives in multi objective planning are reduction real power loss cost and improve distribution network reliability (with reduce total non-delivered energy). Finally in order to selection best network (lossless and reliable) a criterion namely Infeasibility Rate (IR) of network is used. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulations were carried out on standard distribution systems (21 and 23 bus).

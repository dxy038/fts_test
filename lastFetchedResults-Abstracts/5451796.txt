In the paper, the electrochemical sensor consists of the potantiostat with glucose test strip electrode and the automatic test system to readout the electronic signal related to the concentration of Glucose is proposed. The structure of an Op-based potentiostat is improved, analyzed, and implemented. The working operations are very complicated, and having some processing property. These performances will directly influence to oxidation-reduction reaction through the cyclic voltammetry bounded from 0.4V to-1.4V is applied on the three-electrode. The readout circuit of potentiostat is successfully designed and simulated by HSPICE. The readout data is automatically accessed by the NI DAQ card and the coordinated Lab view programming the test schedule to control the related instrumentation with GPIP to obtain the experiment result for various glucose concentrations. The glucose detection system associated with the improved Op-based potentiostat and an automatic test system is realized. The objective of this paper was to investigate the improved OP-based three-electrode potentiostat used in electrochemical glucose biosensor system to obtain more accuracy the measurement results. The experiment result show that the potentiostat is produced more linearity output range of voltage from 4.4V to 0.6V corresponding to the measured concentration of glucose due to 50-600mg/dl range, respectively. The architecture of the potentiostat can be intergraded for VLSI design. There have a great potential in the portable bio-detection system for the health-care and bio-medicine applications.

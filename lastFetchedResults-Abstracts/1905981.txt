Abstract â€” This paper uses a hybrid PSO-GA for solving the
combined economic and emission dispatch problems with
real and reactive power constraints. The objective of
Economic Load Dispatch is to minimize the overall cost of
generation with required constraints. This paper
concentrates on both the total production cost and total
emission taken into account with satisfying constraints.
Hybrid PSO-GA algorithm combines the advantage of PSO
and GA. PSO algorithm can be used during the first stage of
solving the optimization problem near the global optima. The
last particle of the PSO is taken as the initial population of
GA and it continues to further refine the optimized solution.

Queuing mechanisms and scheduling policies play significant roles in guaranteeing performances of core routers and assured QoS (quality of service) for different traffic in today´s Internet. Based on current buffered crossbar switching fabric, by employing system level design method and objective oriented technology, we design and implement a simulation platform for queuing mechanisms and scheduling policies´ development. Inheritability and extensibility attributes are obtained by designing traffic sources, queuing mechanisms and management policies separately. Besides, it can carry out end to end performances´ evaluation with little modification. Finally in this article, we present some simulation results for existing scheduling policies, displaying the good performances of our platform.

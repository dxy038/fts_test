A simple Genetic Algorithm has been applied to the scheduling of multiple pumping units in a water supply system with the objective of minimising the overall cost of the pumping operation, taking advantage of storage capacity in the system and the availability of off peak electricity tariffs. A simple example shows that the method is easy to apply and has produced encouraging preliminary results

This exertion explains the built-in photovoltaic based dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) for alleviation of voltage hang down and engorge mitigation. Photo Voltaic (PV) model, DVR model and local grid model are implemented and the results of simulation are presented. In order to improve the efficiency of the PV system Incremental Conductance (INC) algorithm based Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) is connected. The cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter is used for exchange of real and reactive power to the sensitive load from PV system. Modeling of the proposed system was developed by MATLAB Simulink. The objective of the proposed system is to study the system behaviour, which allows the renewable energy sources for mitigating voltage disturbances.

Under different excitation bandwidth, the number of the resonant modes that will be excited from the radar target will be different. As a result, different numbers of resonant modes will be involved in the target recognition process and the performance of target recognition may also be affected. The objective of this paper is to study how the variations of the excitation bandwidth that may affect the performance of resonance based target recognition. In particular, the E-Pulse technique is chosen and numerical examples of two stick model aircrafts will be used to investigate this problem.

A novel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA)-Jumping Genes Genetic Algorithm (JGGA) is used to design planar Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) antennas. The optimization procedure aims at finding an antenna not only with low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) and small size, but also with stable radiation pattern and stable radiated power over the ultra-wide band. There are five objective functions and they are based on VSWR, antenna size, radiation pattern and gain. Both the simulated and measured results are given and they are in reasonable agreement. The group delay which is an indication of linearity between two proposed antennas is also good.

In this paper, a two-stage receiver structure for interference cancellation in multiuser spatially multiplexed multiple-antenna systems is presented. A space-time equalizer is used in the first stage for joint coantenna/cochannel-interference suppression and shortening of the effective channel for each transmit stream of the desired user. The channel shortening, combined with independent detection, helps reduce the complexity of the second stage Viterbi equalizer, which is used for separate intersymbol-interference equalization for each of the streams. Three objective functions are proposed for determining the coefficients of the space-time equalizer using a direct training data-based approach, which does not require estimation of the interfererÂ´s channel. Simulation results show good symbol error performance as compared to existing algorithms with asynchronous multiple-input multiple-output interferers

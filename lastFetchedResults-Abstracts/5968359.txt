The objective of this paper is to propose a framework of ERP systems implementation success that helps project managers to deal with large and complex ERP systems implementation projects. The framework is designed to evaluate and to select activities or alternatives to improvement the degree of performance by the success factors by using the analytic network process (ANP) and the priority matrix (PM). The experience with the application of ANP in a framework of ERP systems implementation success suggests that it offers guidelines in the evaluation and selection of alternatives.

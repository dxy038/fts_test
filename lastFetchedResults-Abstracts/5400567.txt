A novel ultra wideband bell-shaped antenna which operates at 3.1-10.6 GHz is introduced. Using the HFSS software the antenna parameters are optimized to achieve the best VSWR. By keeping the return loss at the acceptable range, the highly reduced-size of the designed antenna is proposed as well. The sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the effect of some geometrical parameters on the antenna performance. In order to avoid the antenna interference with the neighbouring WLAN, we have provided the notch-band design for the bell-shaped antenna. This is done by forming a half-wave resonant U-shape slot on the radiating element of the antenna. It is observed that the proposed antenna shows a good return loss with nearly uniform H-plane radiation pattern at the objective frequency range. The results suggest the applicability of the bell-shape antenna in the UWB radio.

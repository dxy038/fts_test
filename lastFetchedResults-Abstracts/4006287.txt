The objective of this paper is to present a simple sensor based on FaradayÂ´s Law together with an integration and amplifying stage and used this for measuring fast current pulses. Its behavior in time and frequency is tested by measuring Partial Discharges (PD) in electric insulation systems following the guidelines given in the standard IEC 60270. The measurements are also taken with two other sensors, a commercial high frequency current transformer and a resistive transducer, with the aim of comparing the results obtained with the proposed probe and obtaining an estimation of its sensitivity. An estimation of the uncertainty of the measurements is also calculated obtaining an error similar to other commercial devices.

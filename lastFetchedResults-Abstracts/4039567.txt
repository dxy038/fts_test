The Guest EditorsÂ´ primary objective in organizing this Special Issue was to provide additional impetus for research in hardware security. Currently, the field is heavily dominated by testing, CAD, and IC researchers. They hope that researchers from other security fields will find the problems and the proposed solutions published here both interesting and important. Ten Special Issue papers are represented in this collection.

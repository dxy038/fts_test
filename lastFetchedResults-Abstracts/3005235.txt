The effectiveness and the efficiency of the product development process has always been a major objective for academic researchers and practitioners alike. The results achieved so far suggest that there is no single factor that could explain alone the performance of the product development process. For this reason we have been investigating the impact of the technology-training relationship on the ability to develop new products. Following a case-based methodology, and a two-stage process, we have gathered data from 11 and respectively 3 companies from the county of Cluj, Romania. We have found that an overemphasis of the technical issues could influence the content of the training programs and consequently the ability of a company to develop new products.

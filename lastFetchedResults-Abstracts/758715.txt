Variational methods are among the most accurate techniques for estimating the optic flow. They yield
dense flow fields and can be designed such that they preserve discontinuities, estimate large displacements correctly
and perform well under noise and varying illumination. However, such adaptations render the minimisation of the
underlying energy functional very expensive in terms of computational costs: Typically one or more large linear
or nonlinear equation systems have to be solved in order to obtain the desired solution. Consequently, variational
methods are considered to be too slow for real-time performance. In our paper we address this problem in two ways:
(i) We present a numerical framework based on bidirectional multigrid methods for accelerating a broad class of
variational optic flow methods with different constancy and smoothness assumptions. Thereby, our work focuses
particularly on regularisation strategies that preserve discontinuities. (ii)We show by the examples of five classical
and two recent variational techniques that real-time performance is possible in all cases—even for very complex
optic flow models that offer high accuracy. Experiments show that frame rates up to 63 dense flow fields per second
for image sequences of size 160 × 120 can be achieved on a standard PC. Compared to classical iterative methods
this constitutes a speedup of two to four orders of magnitude.

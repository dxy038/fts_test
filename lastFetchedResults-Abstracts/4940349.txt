The objective of this paper is to provide preliminary results and analyses based on measurements conducted at 240MHz, 360MHz, and 700MHz in a forest area. Special attention is given to the temporal and spatial foliage attenuation fluctuation due to wind and rain influences. It is found that the temporal variation closely follows the Rician function and is easily influenced by wind and rain. The spatial fluctuation is obvious due to the rich scattering environment.

This poster briefly introduces two resource-virtualization techniques needed for the creation of virtual(ized) grids: virtual networks and virtual application services. The former provides bidirectional network connectivity even in the presence of firewalls, network address translation gateways and proxies by creating virtual routers and virtual IP space. The later allows automated creation and deployment of legacy applications into grids by generating a virtual application service that allows the execution in shared resources of multiple isolated application instances with customized behavior.

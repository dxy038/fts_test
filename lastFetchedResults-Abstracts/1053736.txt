A general and controlled bidirectional growth strategy enable a very rapid and efficient construction of oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s possessing functional groups such as methylthio and thioacetate groups at both ends. The strategy employs only one reaction type with good to moderate yields to grow the conjugated chains. The synthesis is efficient and can give 23 benzene rings and 22 carbonâ€“carbon triple bonds in the conjugated chains. The compounds are fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy.

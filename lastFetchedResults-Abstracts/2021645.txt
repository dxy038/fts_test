Objective: The present study wasdesigned to investigate the analgesic effect of oral and i.p. administration of alcoholic Viscumalbum (V.A) fruit extract as a rich source of alkaloid substances.
Materials and Methods: Experimented animals were divided into control and treatment groups. The treatment rats received different doses of the V.A fruit extract, which was prepared from alcoholic smashed fruits. Then, the animals from each group were subjected to pain scoring experiments such as hot plate and formalin tests. 
Results: The results of the experiments i.e., antinociceptive effect of i.p. V.A extract (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) and oral application method V.A (6.25% food pellet) were compared with others and morphine sulfate and naloxone as positive and negative control groups, respectively. The extract at doses over than 100 mg/kg (i.p.) could potentially alleviate the pain in hot plate and both phases of the formalin test. Besides, there was a marked antinociceptive effect of the extract (over than 200 mg/kg) in oral method in hot plate and both phases of the formalin tests. Meanwhile, the effective doses of morphine sulfate as positive control were observed at doses over than 15 mg/kg (i.p.).
Conclusion: In summary, by comparing the analgesic effect of different doses of morphine sulfate with V.A fruit extract in i.p and oral conditions and regarding to the extract LD50, it is concluded that the V.A fruit extract has a potent, semi-absorbable, and nearly safe ingredient which can exert a potential analgesic effect in acute and chronic pain

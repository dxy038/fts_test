In this paper, joint energy-efficient resource allocation for both the base station and users is studied for time division duplex (TDD) systems with carrier aggregation (CA). We aim at balancing the energy efficiency (EE) between downlink and uplink, as well as the EEs among individual users, by joint bandwidth and power allocation on each carrier component (CC). We formulate the optimization problem into maximizing the weighted summation of EEs for the base station and different users, where the weights are used to reflect the levels of importance. The objective function of the problem is a sum of several fractional functions, therefore, nonlinear sum-of-ratios programming needs to be used to solve it, which has not been exploited in resource allocation problems yet. Specifically, a novel transformation is performed to formulate an equivalent but better tractable problem, based on which we develop an iterative algorithm to find the global optimum of the considered problem. Numerical results validate the feasibility, fast convergence, and flexibility of the proposed algorithm in terms of EE balancing.

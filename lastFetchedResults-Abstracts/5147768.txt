This paper presents the performance of a computationally implemented model of a FACTS device known as the Advanced Series Static Compensator (ASC). Thus, firstly, the mathematical models that govern its operation, based on the vector theory are addressed, so that the adopted control strategies are deducted from them for such compensators, which are addressed in sequence. Finally, in view of the main objective of this article, some case studies have been carried out via computer simulation, in typical systems of ASC utilization.

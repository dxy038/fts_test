This paper contains a summary and evaluation of an experimental research project carried out at the ICITECH laboratories, Valencia, Spain. The project consisted of the construction of a full-scale building that included a process of shoring, clearing and striking (SCS). The experimental model was used as the basis for the development of a FE model, including an evolving calculation, with the objective of simulating the construction process used, as well as studying the evolution of concrete properties during the test. The FE model was verified with the results obtained from the experimental model. Two further FE models were then developed from the original model and used to simulate the construction of the same building using two different construction processes: one involving shoring and striking (SS) and the other shoring, re-shoring and striking (SRS). Finally, the SCS was compared to the SS and SRS processes, respectively, and an analysis was made of the advantages and disadvantages of each one. The paper breaks new ground in that for the first time ever a comparative study is made of the three most frequently used shoring techniques.

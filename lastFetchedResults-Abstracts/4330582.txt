This paper presents a new cross-layer resource allocation model for multiuser OFDM systems, where the packet arrival process, delay QoS in the application layer and the subcarrier conditions for all users in the physical layer are considered in the MAC layer design. The objective of the proposed cross-layer resource allocation is formulated into a constrained optimization problem, which incorporates the three layers into an integrated framework. To solve the problem effectively, we propose a complexity-reduced elitist selection genetic algorithm (ESGA). Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Due to its low computational complexity, our proposed algorithm is very suitable for implementation in a practical system.

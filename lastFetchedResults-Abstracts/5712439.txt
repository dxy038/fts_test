Nowadays, working in a reconfigurable scenario, the identification of the placement constraints that will be used to implement each module used to define a reconfigurable system, is an important problem that needs to be solved. The proposed approach exploits results of different area constraints assignment techniques in order to optimize a given objective function. This approach can easily be extended to support global optimizations over several (all) configurations of the reconfigurable system under development.

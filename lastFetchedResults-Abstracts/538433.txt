Background and Objective: Virtual reality is a computerized technology with virtual environment and objects, which people manipulate virtual environment voluntarily through active participation. Aim of the present study was to determine the effect of sensorimotor play in virtual environment on eye-hand coordination of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.

Materials and Methods: In this single blinded, randomized, controlled trial, eye-hand coordination of a convenience sample size of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (n=16) in Ahvaz city was measured in 2 equal groups. Treatment protocol consisted of one and half hours sessions of sensorimotor play in virtual environment for 4 weeks, every other day. Measures were conducted pre, post and 3 months after the treatment period by Bruininks-Oseretsky test of motor proficiency. Sample randomization and data analysis by repeated measure ANOVA were conducted by SPSS-16 software with alpha level set at 0.05.

Results: Data analysis for Bruininks-Oseretsky test of motor proficiency was indicative of significant difference in virtual reality group compared to control group in visual motor coordination (mean change- virtual reality: 1.53, control: 0.03) and upper limb coordination (mean change- virtual reality: 1.23, control: 0.06). Follow up analysis showed retention of results in both groups.  

Conclusion: Sensorimotor play in virtual environment through its characteristics such as interactive and motivational environment, repetitive practice, and augmented feedback can improve eye-hand coordination in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.

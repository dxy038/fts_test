The Boumerdes 2003 earthquake which has devastated a large part of the north of Algeria has raised questions about the adequacy of framed structures to resist strong motions, since many buildings suffered great damage or collapsed. To evaluate the performance of framed
buildings under future expected earthquakes, a non linear static pushover analysis has been conducted. To achieve this objective, three framed buildings with 5, 8 and 12 stories respectively were analyzed. The results obtained from this study show that properly designed frames will perform well under seismic loads.

 Background Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Diabetic Nephropathy
                            (DN) are currently a major public health threat. Objectives The
                            objective of this paper is to define the leading causes of CKD and DN
                            and their complications among Lebanese patients. Patients and Methods In
                            this study, 380 hemodialysis patients were included, regardless of their
                            socioeconomic status or nationality. Results In total, 89.5% of patients
                            were over the age of 40. The main cause of CKD was hypertension (55.3%),
                            followed by polycystic kidney disease and repeated urinary tract
                            infections (34.2%). The nutritional analysis of patientsâ€™ dietary
                            history showed that 52.6%, 31.6%, and 47.4% of patients exceeded their
                            Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of protein, caffeine, and sodium,
                            respectively. In terms of the consequences of CKD, men were more prone
                            to anemia and water retention than women. However, women were more
                            affected by cardiovascular disease and malnutrition. Concerning age,
                            anemia was more prevalent in younger patients than in older ones.
                            Conclusions The high prevalence of behavioral and pathological factors
                            and the resulting consequences of CKD suggest a major awareness of the
                            Lebanese population of the risks of chronic kidney disease and the
                            necessity of the prevention of CKD by following a healthy lifestyle and
                            managing any existing diseases.

In this paper a generalized multi-phase space vector theory is considered for developing the space vector modulation of a three-phase to six-phase AC to AC converter. The modulation is based on the control of the voltage vectors in the first d-q plane, while imposing the remaining voltage vectors in the second and the third planes (x-y, 0+-0-), being zero. The duty cycles of the bidirectional switches are obtained using space vector modulation theory. The proposed converter system offers full control of the input power factor, no limitation on the output frequency range and nearly sinusoidal output voltage. The proposed space vector algorithm can be fully implemented on a digital platform. The theoretical analysis is confirmed by digital simulations which is further verified using real time implementation.

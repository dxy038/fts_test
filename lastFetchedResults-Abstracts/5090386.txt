In 2012 a consortium of 21 partners from 16 EU countries launched the PV GRID project having as objective to reduce barriers hampering the large-scale integration of photovoltaic systems in distribution grids across Europe. This goal will be pursued through an analysis of barriers and solutions and the formulation of regulatory and normative recommendations. In a first step, technical solutions for increasing the grid hosting capacity have been identified. The suitability of the technical solutions has then been analyzed. The methodology for this analysis is presented in this paper.

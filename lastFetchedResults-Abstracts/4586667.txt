The increase in unconventional, urban warfare situations in US military operations creates the need for reliable data networks allowing military commanders and their troop´s maximum communication capability in urban environments. Currently, military commanders at the higher echelons are afforded decision support tools utilizing robust data and voice communication networks. Decision-making in smaller operational units, such as Platoons and Squads, could benefit from improved communication and situational awareness capabilities. The CS^2 team objective is to design and evaluate a mobile command support system to maximize communication between Platoon leaders and their Squads. The team´s study uses simulation programming environments to model the capacity and connectivity of wireless network communication in urban operations. The design alternatives to be modeled consist of various network topologies with different bandwidth capacities. Human factors and physical system requirements are evaluated analytically. The results of this modeling and analysis will be used to identify the most effective and reliable design alternative.

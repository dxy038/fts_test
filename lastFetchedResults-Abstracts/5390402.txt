This paper describes and evaluates a predictive algorithm for bandwidth conservation and enhanced situation awareness. In such a system, knowledge of position and intent of the participants involved in the operation must be readily available, and distributed to other units by communications link. This objective can be achieved by predicting position tracks of each unit ahead in time, based on past kinematic history. If the predicted position is within error requirements, then the track estimate is not transmitted over the communication link, which results in considerable savings in bandwidth. However, if the prediction error exceeds such tolerance, a linear predictive algorithm based on linear regression is used to encode the error. The encoding sequence, in addition to the current unit location, is transmitted to other units by means of communication links. Receiving units, equipped with an identical software package can reconstruct the unitÂ´s location from information contained in the encoded sequence and past track history. Analysis of this algorithm is presented and its performance is validated by simulation

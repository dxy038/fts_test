In this paper, the function expansion based topology optimization is employed to the optimization of the waveguide dispersion property and the optimum design of low-dispersion slow-light photonic crystal waveguides (PCWGs) is demonstrated. In order to realize low-dispersion and large group index, the objective function to be optimized is expressed by the weighted sum of the objective functions for the desired group index and the low-dispersion property, and the weighting coefficients are updated through the optimization process.

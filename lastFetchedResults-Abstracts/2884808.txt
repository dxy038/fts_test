This paper introduces a new optimization-based IGAA approach to pursue a better RFID topology design with more favorable reader deployment and system performance. The new approach adopts an advanced multi-objective fitness function and improved genetic annealing algorithms (GAA) to enhance and outperform existing RFID topology designs. The operation is simple and effective: Involving a gene-stirring operation to help preserve good genes and locate optimal solutions for reader deployment. Experimental evaluation shows that when compared with related approaches, IGAA can yield better solution quality with less search time.

This paper is concerned with synthesis of static output feedback (SOF) control satisfying multi-objective performance criteria. Closed loop robust stability is studied for both sector-bounded and passive uncertainties. Given an initially stabilizing SOF gain K<sub>o</sub>, an estimate of the set of stabilizing gains is obtained using Monte Carlo based randomized calculations. A synthesis algorithm combining both semi-definite programming and genetic algorithms (GA) is proposed. To improve the efficiency of this hybrid algorithm, the GA employs a projection-like operation to translated the candidates into the interior of the set of stabilizing gains in a neighborhood of K<sub>o</sub>.

The objective of the present study was to investigate enhanced anti bacterial activity of chitosan nanoparticles incorporated ofloxacin nanoconjugate against clinical isolate of human pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Nano drug conjugate was prepared by ionotrophic gelation of chitosan with sodium tri poly phosphate and ofloxacin as the model drug. Synthesized nanoconjugate was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and the anti bacterial activity was studied against Pseudomonas aeruginosa adopting well diffusion assay with different concentration. Scanning electron microscopy of drug nanoconjugate revealed spherical particles with the size range of 60-100nm, Further confirmation with FTIR showed distinct absorbed peaks. EDX revealed all the elements in the nanoconjugate. The tested pathogenic bacteria susceptible to all the concentration with the increased zone of inhibition. This result suggests that the synergistic activity of nanoparticles with antibiotics which will lead to new generation of antimicrobial agents with highest efficacy to prevent pathogenic infection.

Introduction: Many clinical studies have evaluted different dentin bonding agents in treatment of dentin hypersensitivity(DH). But the use of acid is controversial and the effect of self-etch bonding agents isn't clearly defined.
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare two dentin bonding systems, prompt (self-etch bonding system) and excite(with and without acid) in treatment of DH.
Materials and Methods: This clinical study had a double-blind, randomized, subject design and was performed on 41 sensitive teeth with DH. We had 3 groups e, (we used excite without acid), e2 (excite with acid) and p (prompt). Two stimuli(cold water 20c and compressed air) and two methods for evaluation((VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) and respones time))in 3 times (before treatment, immediately after treatment and two weeks after it) were used.
Results: All treatments showed significant reductions in DH. In the VAS scores, no significant difference was found. But in the response time, the groups el, P significantly showed better results than group e2.(P<0.05) Conclusion: Treatment effects were improved in all groups with time. Use of acid before the bonding agent had a negative effect but there was no significant difference between prompt and excite(without acid etching). It's worth nothing that the measureement of response time to stimulus campared to the VAS method is more accurate in evaluation studies of pain rate.

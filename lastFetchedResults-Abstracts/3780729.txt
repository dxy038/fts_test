An internal fault in a synchronous generator produces an effect similar to increasing the number of grouped coils in the stator winding, making it necessary to use additional time-variant inductances to represent the condition, with the ensuing increase in modeling complexity and computation time required for its solution. In this paper, a new model for the simulation of internal faults in synchronous generators is presented. The model is based on the so-called voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) representation, a contemporary reference frame, which has proved to be numerically more efficient than the classical phase-domain model used to study internal faults in synchronous generators; making it a better fit for large-scale, multimachine power systems applications, the long-term objective of this research work. An implementation for electromagnetic transients program (EMTP) type solutions is presented together with a test case where internal faults are applied, producing results that are in close agreement with results available in the open literature. Furthermore, an external perturbation is also carried out and results match exactly those produced by an equivalent VBR implementation.

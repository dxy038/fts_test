After nearly 30 years of war, health services in Vietnam were devastated. Pediatric Hospital Number 1 (PH1) in Ho Chi Minh City was severely overloaded, mortality rates for readily treatable diseases were high, and staff competence and motivation were low. In 1988, PH1 introduced primary health care (PHC) concepts into the policy of the hospital. The approach included identification of priority diseases that are most easily treatable (diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, Dengue haemorrhagic fever, malnutrition, and common paediatric emergencies including malaria); establishment of training programmes through paediatric priority training units for medical staff of PH1 and health centres (district and commune services), and health education for the patients' carers; promotion of outpatient treatment to avoid unnecessary admissions; use of appropriate technology such as essential drugs and application of WHO guidelines; support for health centres; transfer of responsibility for decision-making from one central authority to each department; and community participation, by which we sought small contributions from families who could afford to pay. Since the new approach was implemented, the numbers of admissions have fallen substantially. Mortality rates have decreased greatly (diarrhoea by 80%, Dengue fever by 64%, and acute respiratory infections by 41%). Support from foreign non-governmental organisations has enabled training and research to enhance staff skill and knowledge and supply of necessary equipment. Fund mobilisation from patients is unlikely to be substantial in developing countries, but budget should not be regarded as the sole factor that affects mortality rates. Better use of the limited resources available has enabled us to achieve our objective of decreasing the hospital mortality rates.

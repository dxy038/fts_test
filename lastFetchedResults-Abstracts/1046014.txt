Laser measurement and laser processing techniques have been gaining strong attention from various applications. This research aims at the development of a novel optical device, and in order to fulfill the objective, characteristics of the thermal lens effect is studied. This phenomenon has the optical property of a divergent lens since the refractive index distribution on the optical axis is formed when the liquid medium is irradiated. One reason for the refractive index distribution is the temperature distribution in the liquid medium when it is irradiated. In this research, as a fundamental step to develop the fluidic optical devices, the interaction between a refractive angle of the probe beam and the temperature distribution on the thermal lens effect is investigated.

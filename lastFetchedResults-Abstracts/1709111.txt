The objective of this work is to discuss the adequacy of cohesive and continuum damage models for the prediction of the mechanical behaviour of bonded joints. A cohesive mixed-mode damage model appropriate for ductile adhesives is presented. The double cantilever beam and the end-notched flexure tests are proposed in order to evaluate the cohesive properties of the adhesive as a thin layer under mode I and mode II, respectively. A new data reduction scheme based on the crack equivalent concept is also proposed to overcome crack-monitoring difficulties during propagation in these fracture characterization tests. An inverse method to determine the cohesive parameters of the trapezoidal softening law is discussed. A continuum mixed-mode damage model is developed in order to better simulate the cases where adhesive thickness plays an important role. The model is applied to evaluate the effect of adhesive thickness on fracture characterization of adhesive joints. Some important conclusions about the advantages and drawbacks of cohesive and continuum damage models are reported.

In this paper, the problem of initial alignment for Inertial Navigation System (INS) is discussed. Based on the Lyapunov transformation, INS error model of stationary base is established. Then, the initial alignment for INS can be transformed into the robust filter design problem for linear systems with multiple disturbances. A robust multi-objective filter is constructed for the concerned INS with disturbance rejection and attenuation performance, where the drift estimations are applied to reject the inertial sensor drifts and mixed H 2 / H âˆž filter is adopted to attenuate Gaussian noises and norm bounded disturbances. Finally, simulations for stationary base alignment of an Inertial Navigation System are given to show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

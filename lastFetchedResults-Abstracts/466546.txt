Objective: Preeclampsia is reportedly accompanied by increased plasma lipid peroxidation. However, to date the assays that have been applied to measure lipid peroxides have been relatively nonspecific. A highly specific high-performance lipid chromatographic–chemiluminescence technique was used here to measure lipid hydroperoxides in plasma and red blood cells of patients with preeclampsia and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome. Study Design: Lipid peroxidation products, both lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and free radical scavenging enzyme activities were measured in either plasma or erythrocytes of patients with normal pregnancies (n = 36), preeclampsia (n = 28), or HELLP syndrome (n = 10). Results: Whereas lipid hydroperoxides were undetectable (<0.02 μmol/L), plasma TBARS and glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma and erythrocytes were significantly increased in patients with HELLP syndrome. There were no differences in glutathione transferase and reductase activities or superoxide dismutase activity between the groups. Conclusions: We were unable to corroborate results of studies that suggested that increased TBARS are representative of circulating plasma lipid hydroperoxides in preeclampsia. However, elevated glutathione peroxidase activity and TBARS are in line with increased oxidative stress in preeclampsia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:166-72.)

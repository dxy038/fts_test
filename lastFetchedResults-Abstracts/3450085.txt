The objective of this paper is to theoretically demonstrate how the operational frequency affects the efficiency of a low-speed generator. Due to the varying nature of underwater currents, the voltage from a current power converter has to be rectified first and then digitally reconverted into a stable alternating current. When designing a direct drive generator for water current power conversion, the operational frequency is, thus, a free design parameter and not a fixed value determined by the grid. Finite element method was used to determine the efficiency and weight. A higher frequency means larger frequency-dependent losses, but also a lighter machine. Even at the highest frequency in this study, the frequency-dependent losses were not high enough to overcome the gain of a lighter machine. If a large generator diameter can be allowed, the water current power converter should be designed with as high operational frequency as possible.

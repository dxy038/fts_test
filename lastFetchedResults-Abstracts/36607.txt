A new multidimensional chromatographic method is described in which material separated into lipid-class bands on silica-coated quartz thin-layer chromatography (TLC) rods (Chromarods) is desorbed using a pyrolysis unit interface and introduced directly into a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer for molecular species analysis. Steryl esters, wax esters, hydrocarbons, ketones, and fattyacid methyl esters (FAMEs) are thermally desorbed without pretreatment. In order to desorb free sterols, monoacylglycerols (MAGs), aliphatic alcohols, and free fatty acids, the esters are converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives on the rod. Triacylglycerols and phospholipids are converted to FAMEs by thermochemolysis with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The method's utility is demonstrated with lipids from seawater particulate matter by first confirming the identity of lipid bands with the appropriate standards. The wax ester-steryl ester TLC band contained no more than 8% steryl esters. Wax esters of up to C42 arc detected. In six individual acyl lipid classes, C14-C22 fatty acids are detected with C^acids predominant in all but wax esters. C16-C22 MAGs are identified in the complex acetone-mobile polar lipid band. The method successfully extends the scope of latroscan TLC-flameionization detection on Chromarods, which is a widely used technique for lipid-class analysis. Modification of the pyrolysis probe to handle intact TLC rods is a future objective.

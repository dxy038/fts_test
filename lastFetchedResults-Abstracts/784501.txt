Objective: To determine whether the metabolism of glucose or ketones differs in the healthy elderly
compared to young or middle-aged adults during mild, short-term ketosis induced by a ketogenic breakfast.
Design and participants: Healthy subjects in three age groups (23±1, 50±1 and 76±2 y old) were given a
ketogenic meal and plasma -hydroxybutyrate, glucose, insulin, triacylglycerols, total cholesterol, non-esterified
fatty acids and breath acetone were measured over the subsequent 6 h. Each subject completed the protocol twice
in order to determine the oxidation of a tracer dose of both carbon-13 (13C) glucose and 13C- -hydroxybutyrate.
The tracers were given separately in random order. Apolipoprotein E genotype was also determined in all
subjects. Results: Plasma glucose decreased and -hydroxybutyrate, acetone and insulin increased similarly over
6 h in all three groups after the ketogenic meal. There was no significant change in cholesterol, triacylglycerols or
non-esterified fatty acids over the 6 h. 13C-glucose and 13C- -hydroxybutyrate oxidation peaked at 2-3 h postdose
for all age groups. Cumulative 13C-glucose oxidation over 24 h was significantly higher in the elderly but
only versus the middle-aged group. There was no difference in cumulative 13C- -hydroxybutyrate oxidation
between the three groups. Apolipoprotein E ( 4) was associated with elevated fasting cholesterol but was
unrelated to the other plasma metabolites. Conclusion: Elderly people in relatively good health have a similar
capacity to produce ketones and to oxidize 13C- -hydroxybutyrate as middle-aged or young adults, but oxidize
13C-glucose a little more rapidly than healthy middle-aged adults

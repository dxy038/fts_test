A tri-port MIMO antenna designed for Micro/Pico-Cell application is proposed. It is based on printed elements with X-shaped arms, which are oriented to 0&#176;, 120&#176; and 240&#176; in the azimuth plane. The arms of these elements are connected, with which a self-decoupled structure is formed. The mutual coupling between adjacent elements is below -15dB. Meanwhile, it size is compact and bidirectional radiation patterns with around 4dBi Gain and 92&#176; 3dB beam width is achieved, which can provide good pattern diversity and full azimuth coverage in real applications.

Failure detection is a basic service for building dependable systems. The large scale distribution of computing systems naturally makes failure detectors much harder to build. Moreover, providing QoS (quality of service) guarantees in this context is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is twofold: (1) proposing a complete set of classification criteria to compare different failure detection mechanisms, and based on these criteria (2) surveying the main failure detection solutions for large scale distributed systems.

Objective: To investigate the associations between markers of systemic and vascular inflammation, and indicators of vascular morphology and function. Methods: In 59 apparently healthy individuals, we measured serum levels of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin. Endothelium-dependent (EDV) and -independent (EIDV) vasodilatation was evaluated in the forearm by venous occlusion plethysmography and local infusions of methacholine and sodium nitroprussid. Endothelial function index (EFI) was expressed as the EDV/EIDV ratio. The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery was investigated with ultrasound (far wall). Results: EFI was inversely related only to ICAM-1 (r=âˆ’0.31, P<0.02) by univariate analysis. This association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, blood pressure, smoking and serum cholesterol. EFI did not relate to hsCRP, VCAM-1 or E-selectin. Neither hsCRP, nor the adhesion molecules were significantly related to carotid artery IMT. Conclusion: ICAM-1 was related to endothelial vasodilatory function, but not to IMT, suggesting that endothelial inflammatory activation is related to an impaired vascular relaxation in apparently healthy individuals.

The pulse diagnosis is an essential method in traditional Chinese medicine and the pulse wave embodies the abundant physiological and pathological information about the health status. In order to obtain the complete and objective pulse tactile information, the sensor for detecting pulse tactile image was developed. By adopting this sensor the image sequence of the pulse motion was collected from the radial artery. A method of acquiring the pulse wave based on digital image correlation was presented. Then the single point pulse signal and the multi-dimensional pulse signals from the pulse tactile images were detected. The results show that the pulse tactile signals can be objectively obtained by the presented method. It provides a new idea and approach to the objective study on the pulse diagnosis.

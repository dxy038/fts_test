The objective of the research is to review the underlying principles based on performance in the health care sector. Performance indicators such as efficiency, acceptability, equity and quality are some of the measures considered. The research demonstrates the use of emerging technology (e.g., RFID - Radio Frequency Identification) to reduce health care costs and also facilitate the automating and streamlining of healthcare management process (e.g., patient and equipment identification) in hospitals. It outlines the design and application of real-time RFID-enabled Hospital Information System (HIS) applications.

The constrained Kaiman filter-based adaptive algorithm has fast convergence and robustness towards direction-of-arrival (DOA) mismatch. This motivates its usage for interference suppression in phased arrays. The constraints related to high gain towards the desired source and minimum mean square error are imposed in the weight adaptation. The objective is to steer the mainbeam towards the desired direction and simultaneously nullify the interfering sources impinging the array from different directions. It is shown that the output SINR of the algorithm is higher than the well-known gradient-based improved LMS algorithm.

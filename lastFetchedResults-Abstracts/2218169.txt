Background: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is the most serious and potentially life-threatening iatrogenic complication associated with ovarian stimulation during Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) protocols. OHSS typically is a result of ovarian expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which increases vascular permeability. Objective: Comparison of albumin and cabergoline in the prevention of OHSS. Materials and Methods: 95 high risk infertile women for OHSS (more than 20 follicles in both ovaries at day of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) injection) were randomly divided into two groups. First group including 48 women received 10 unit intravenous albumin at starting oocyte retrieval, and second group including 47 women received 0.5 mg/day dopamine agonist (Cabergolin) at day of HCG injection till 8 days. The dosage of human Menopausal Gonadotropin (HMG) used, total number of follicles developed, number of oocytes retrieved, serum E2 concentrations during the luteal phase, development of ascites, number of embryos generated, clinical pregnancy rate, results of the in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycles and incidence and severity of any OHSS were evaluated. Results: There was evidence of a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of OHSS in the cabergolin group (53.7%) versus albumin group (46.3%) (p=0.04). But there was no significant difference of a reduction in severe OHSS (p=0.62). There was no difference in clinical pregnancy rate too. Conclusion: Administration of cabergolin can prevent incidence of OHSS and does not appear to effect on its severity.

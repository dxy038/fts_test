Objective(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the use of complementary medicine by cancer patients, in two comprehensive clinics, in Tehran, Iran.
Methods: A specially designed questionnaire was completed for 625 cancer patients after informed consent was obtained.
Results: The age of the participants ranged from 25 to 80 years, with a mean of 47.61 years (SD=+ 15.1). The majority was married (77%) and 219 (35%) reported that they used or were using complementary medicine.
Users and non-users differed significantly in educational level. The most commonly used CM methods were prayer and spiritual healing (n= 178, 81%), bio-energy therapy (9%) and homeopathy (6%). The main sources of information on complementary medicine were previous information (75%), and information obtained from relatives or friends (22%). Only 7% of users had received relevant information from their physicians. Two-Thirds of users stated that they preferred to receive CM treatment from their physicians.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that cancer patients frequently use complementary medicine after diagnosis and they would rather receive such treatment from their physicians. It seems that doctors should ask patients explicitly about their use of complementary medicine when they obtain medical history. They must also have greater knowledge of complementary medicine to offer better advice to their patients.

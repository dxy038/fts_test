Objective
vide a comprehensive review of the mechanisms of growth of mandibular condyle, the roles of angiogenesis enhancers and inhibitors during endochondral ossification in mandibular condyle and newly developed delivery methods for local gene delivery that may represent strategies to regulate condylar growth.

ive review.
s
enesis is the crucial step in mandibular condylar growth for it regulates the transformation from cartilage to bone. Angiognesis enhancers, especially VEGF and FGF, play important roles in the process of new blood lumen formation and invasion. On the other hand, angiostatin and endostatin inhibit angiogenesis by targeting endothelial cells and several signal cascades. Delivery methods such as liposomes, stem cells and virus vectors have been studied. Recombinant AAV-mediated gene therapy is considered as one of the most promising strategies of condylar growth management.
sion
diated gene therapy using VEGF or angiogenesis inhibitor will be a promising way to regulate condylar growth at an early stage.

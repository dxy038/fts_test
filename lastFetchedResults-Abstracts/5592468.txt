Many research efforts have been made for supporting mobile users in wireless ad-hoc network where there is no infrastructure such as wired base stations or central entities used in cellular wireless network and wireless LAN, respectively. Although many routing protocols have been proposed, the proposed routing protocols assumed bidirectional wireless links, which means that the transmission ranges of all nodes are the same. The assumption is not realistic, and in this paper we deal with the environment where the transmission ranges of all nodes may be different due to differences in wireless radio power. The routing protocol suggested previously by our group, called &#8220;K-hop cluster-based dynamic source routing protocol&#8221; is modified to handle the situation. In addition, we propose a scheme where each node has its adaptive K value according to the movement rate. By simulation, the proposed solutions proved to be efficient and realizable

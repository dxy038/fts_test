In practical situations, distribution network loads are the mixtures of residential, industrial, and commercial types. This paper presents a hybrid optimization algorithm for the optimal placement of shunt capacitor banks in radial distribution networks in the presence of different voltage-dependent load models. The algorithm is based on the combination of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm. For this purpose, an objective function including the cost of energy loss, reliability, and investment cost of the capacitor banks is considered. Also, the impacts of voltage-dependent load models, considering annual load duration curve, is taken into account. In addition, different types of customers such as industrial, residential, and commercial loads are considered for load modeling. Simulation results for 33-bus and 69-bus IEEE radial distribution networks using the proposed method are presented and compared with the other methods. The results showed that this method provided an economical solution for considerable loss reduction and reliability and voltage improvement.

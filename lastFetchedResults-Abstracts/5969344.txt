The dual-objective optimization of surface discussed in this paper means that the optimal surface is not only smoothing but also corresponded to the shape of the back of the body. Since surface can be built with family of curves which are optimized with the same two objectives, the mathematical model of surface´s constructional curve is critical to the success of dual-objective optimization of surface design. First, this paper proposes an improved energy method which is a combination of the conventional energy method and the least squares theory. Then, describes the steps of mathematical modeling of surface´s constructional curve on the basis of the improved energy method in more detail. A surface design of seat back, one kind of typical dual-objective optimization design problem, is used to discuss the performance of this method. It is shown that the dual-objective optimization problem of surface design can be solved well with this proposed method.

This paper proposes a novel method that uses ´inconsistency of ranks measure´ to evaluate color calibration techniques. The objective of color calibration techniques that is concentrated in this paper is to circumvent illumination problems. Calibration techniques are used to help improving color matching within the same image. Moreover, ´sequence swapping distance (SSD)´ is also proposed in this paper as a new measure of rank similarity. It is developed based on a string edit distance concept. Finally, an example case of how to use the proposed inconsistency of ranks measure is presented. This proposed measure can certainly reflect the efficiency of color calibration methods.

Head injuries are among the most common types of trauma seen in North American emergency departments, with an estimated 1 million cases seen annually. “Minor” head injury (sometimes known as “mild”) is defined by a history of loss of consciousness, amnesia, or disorientation in a patient who is conscious and talking, that is, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 to 15. Although most patients with minor head injury can be discharged without sequelae after a period of observation, in a small proportion, their neurologic condition deteriorates and requires neurosurgical intervention for intracranial hematoma. The objective of the Canadian CT Head Rule Study is to develop an accurate and reliable decision rule for the use of computed tomography (CT) in patients with minor head injury. Such a decision rule would allow physicians to be more selective in their use of CT without compromising care of patients with minor head injury. This paper describes in detail the rationale, objectives, and methodology for Phase I of the study in which the decision rule was derived.

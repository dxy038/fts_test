By means of elementary unitary transformations and GershgoringÂ´s theorem, new sufficient conditions for the stability of interval matrices are proposed. Moreover, this paper presents a schematic algorithm for computing the stability margin of an interval system involving an optimization step, where the objective function is the spectral condition number of the nominal eigenvector matrix

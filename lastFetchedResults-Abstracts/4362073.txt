The objective of exploratory analysis is to gain a broad understanding of a problem domain before going into details for particular cases. Its focus is on understanding comprehensively the consequences of uncertainty, which requires a good deal more than normal sensitivity analysis. Such analysis is facilitated by multiresolution, multiperspective modeling (MRMPM) structures that are becoming increasingly practical. A knowledge of related design principles can help build interfaces to more normal legacy models, which can also be used for exploration

Stereo vision is a commonly known and well studied principle for depth acquisition. In many applications such as indoor surveillance a low number of applied stereo sensors is desired for covering a certain scene to almost full extend. This should keep system costs low. However, the limited field of view of classical two-lens stereo cameras counteracts this objective. To overcome this limitation we present a novel configuration of three omnidirectional cameras in order to calculate a full hemispherical depth map.

Urban buses must deal with the challenge of decreasing local nuisances such as air pollution and noise. Hybrid driveline could be a technological response to these requirements. In this context, the Transport and Environment Lab of the INRETS is collaborating with a French body manufacturer with the aim to develop and optimize a plug-in series hybrid microbus. Our study is lead as following: (1) Understand the microbus operation thanks to measurement done on bus site operating conditions (2) Develop a complete model of the vehicle based on the LTE developed VEHLIB library.(3) Propose and implement a new energy management laws in order to optimize the consumption of the internal combustion engine and the distance driven per battery charge. Our paper deals with the second and a part of the third objective.

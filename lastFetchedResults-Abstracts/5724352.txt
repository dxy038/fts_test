The Miyako lsland Mega Solar Demonstration Research Facility has two objectives. The first objective is to examine the impact on the power system from installing large scale renewable energy such as photovoltaic power. The second objective is to study measures for power system stabilization by analyze data from PV and rechargeable battery. This pilot project will be conducted for three years (until March 2013) by the Okinawa Electric Power Company, Inc. This paper will explain the overview of the Miyako Island Mega Solar Demonstration Research Facility, then explain in detail about each device such as photovoltaic system and storage battery and end with the report of favorable demonstration results recorded from the execution of the research.

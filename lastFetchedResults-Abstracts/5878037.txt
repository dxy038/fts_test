Summary form only given, as follows. An overview is presented of a software package designed to illustrate several neural network paradigms. It is an improved version of an earlier package encompassing a greater number of paradigms. The package is primarily developed for educational purposes to illustrate the network training process. The package covers most of the commonly used neural network paradigms and consists of nine different programs to simulate nine paradigms. These include: perceptron, Adaline, Madaline, Hopfield, brain-state-in-a-box (BSB), backpropagation (BP), bidirectional associative memory (BAM), counterpropagation (CP), and spatio-temporal pattern recognition (SPR). The package allows experimentation with all aspects of the paradigms, such as network topology, neurodynamics, network dynamics, and network training algorithm. The programs are written in BASIC and can be run on any IBM-PC or compatible machine. The package is also available for free distribution.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

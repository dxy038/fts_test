The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is an important scientific problem addressed in distribution management. In classical VRP, the vehicle load is often regarded as a constant during transportation; therefore, the loading cost associated with the amount of the load on the vehicle, are neglected in the objective function when optimizing a vehicle routine. However, in real-world, the vehicle load varies from one customer to another in a vehicle route. Thus, the vehicle route without considering the effect of loading cost may lead to sub-optimal routes. In this paper, we investigate VRP with loading, which considers the costs associated with the amount of the load on the vehicle when determining the vehicle routes. This paper presents a new Pareto-based multi-objective approach that uses a Multi-objective Scatter search strategy for solving a multi-objective formulation of the VRP that aims to minimize the total distance of the vehicles used to service the customers, while also minimizing the imbalance of workloads (distances travelled/goods delivered by the vehicles). This new approach is evaluated in comparison with two well-known multi- objective algorithms, MOPSO and MODE. The results obtained when solving a subset of benchmark problems show the good performance of this approach. The results demonstrate that the suggested method is highly competitive.

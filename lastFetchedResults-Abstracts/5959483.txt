Majority of teaching quality evaluation uses fuzzy comprehensive evaluation at present. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is good at dealing with the subjective evaluation information. But it is not good at dealing with the objective evaluation information. To solve the problem, the paper used two mathematical models which were fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and Markov chain to handle the information which acquired from the higher education teacher quality evaluation system. The paper overcame the disadvantage that all systems only used fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to deal with the information before. It combined the subjective evaluation with the objective evaluation and illustrated that the use of two models made the evaluation result more scientific and more accuracy.

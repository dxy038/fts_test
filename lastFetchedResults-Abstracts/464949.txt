Objective: Our purpose was to determine the association between the presence of bacterial vaginosis, fetal fibronectin, and a short cervix and the risk of spontaneous preterm birth of twins.
Study Design: We prospectively screened 147 women with twins at 24 and 28 weeks' gestation for more than 50 potential risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. We also measured cervical length with ultrasound scans and tested for the presence of bacterial vaginosis. Fetal fibronectin level was evaluated every 2 weeks from 24 to 30 weeks' gestation. Outcomes included spontaneous preterm birth at <32 weeks, <35 weeks, and <37 weeks.
Results: Among twin as compared with singleton pregnancies, a cervical length ≤25 mm was more common at both 24 and 28 weeks, a statistically significant difference. There were no significant differences in most other risk factors. Of the factors evaluated by means of univariate analysis at 24 weeks, only a short cervix (≤25 mm) was consistently associated with spontaneous preterm birth. The odds ratios and 95% confidence interval for spontaneous preterm birth at <32 weeks, <35 weeks, and <37 weeks were 6.9 (2.0 to 24.2), 3.2 (1.3 to 7.9), and 2.8 (1.1 to 7.7). At 28 weeks, a cervical length ≤25 mm was not a strong predictor of spontaneous preterm birth. At both 28 weeks (odds ratio, 9.4; confidence interval, 1.0 to 67.7) and 30 weeks (odds ratio, 46.1; confidence interval, 4.2 to 1381), a positive fetal fibronectin result was significantly associated with spontaneous preterm birth at <32 weeks. Bacterial vaginosis at 24 or 28 weeks was not associated with spontaneous preterm birth of twins. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association between cervical length ≤25 mm at the 24-week visit and spontaneous preterm birth and also confirmed that at 24 weeks the other risk factors were less consistently and often not statistically significantly associated with spontaneous preterm birth. Of the risk factors evaluated at 28 weeks, only a positive fetal fibronectin was associated with a significantly increased risk for spontaneous preterm birth.
Conclusions: Most known risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth were not significantly associated with spontaneous preterm birth of twins. At 24 weeks, cervical length ≤25 mm was the best predictor of spontaneous preterm birth at <32 weeks, <35 weeks, and <37 weeks. Of the risk factors evaluated at 28 weeks, fetal fibronectin was the only statistically significant predictor of spontaneous preterm birth at <32 weeks.

Objective
Prevalence of allergies is different around the world. Allergic rhinitis is a
common chronic disease in children.
Intelligence quotient (IQ) is an indicator of efficacy and many factors including
chronic diseases may affect it. This study compares the IQs of children diagnosed
with persistent or perennial allergic rhinitis with healthy children.
Material & Methods
This was a comparative study that was conducted from June 2011â€“May 2013
in an academic referral clinic. In this study, 90 patients aged 6- to 14-yearsold
who were diagnosed with persistent or perennial allergic rhinitis and were
compared to 90 age and gender match healthy patients from their respective
families. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was used to divide and
calculate overall IQ, verbal IQ, and practical IQ. The t-test and chi square were
used to analyze quantitative variables and qualitative variables, respectively.
Results
In this study, out of total 180 children, 90 (50%) in the case group and 90
children (50%), the control group participated for IQ comparison. One hundred
(57%) were male and 80 (43%) were female. The overall IQ for allergic rhinitis
patients and healthy patients was 109.2 and 107.5, respectively. This difference
was not considered significant. Furthermore, there was no significant difference
between the IQ scores of males and females.
Conclusion
Although allergic rhinitis is a chronic disease and effects quality of life, there
were no identifiable negative effects on IQ.

This paper has made a exploratory research on the evaluation of desulfurization projects of thermal power plants, which is an important reference to classify them by grade, and then Chinese current price compensation policy for the desulfurization projects could be adjusted according to the classification of them. This paper proposes a new perspective by introducing fuzzy cluster sorting method to evaluate the desulfurization projects. According to the evaluation objective, it has constructed the best and the worst standard objects respectively, and inserted them into the original sample matrix as the cluster kernels, then it obtained the similarity coefficients for each sample to either standard and corrected them, then based on the corrected similarity coefficients the samples were sorted. This method is applied to the evaluation of desulfurization projects of thermal power plants, and the results have remarkable accuracy and a reasonableness.

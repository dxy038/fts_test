Objective:
We sought to compare the uterine effects of raloxifene with those of continuous-combined hormone replacement therapy.
Study Design:
This randomized, double-blind 24-month study involved 136 postmenopausal women who received raloxifene 150 mg/d or conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg/d with medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg/d. After baseline evaluations, endometrial biopsy specimens were obtained, and endometral thickness was measured annually by means of transvaginal ultrasonography. Statistical analyses were performed with an intention-to-treat approach.
Results:
In the raloxffene group at the end point of the study 94.4% of biopsy specimens showed normal benign postmenopausal endometrium and 5.6% were classified as benign stimulatory endometrium. In the continuous-combined hormone replacement therapy group at the end point of the study 78.7% of biopsy specimens showed normal benign postmenopausal endometrium, 19.1 % were dassified as benign stimulatory endometrium, and 2.1 % showed benign abnormal postmenopausal endometrium. Mean endometrial thickness was unchanged from baseline with raloAfene and was increased significantly by 0.5 mm at 12 months with continuous-combined hormone replacement therapy.
Conclusions:
Raloxifene 150 mg/d did not increase endometrial thickness or cause endometrial proliferation in healthy postmenopausal women. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:568-74.)

A hexapole corrector system was constructed for compensation of the spherical aberration of the objective lens of a transmission electron microscope. Implementing this system on a commercial 200 kV instrument with a field emission gun the spherical aberration correction was demonstrated and an improvement of the point resolution from 0.24 nm to better than 0.14 nm was realized. Applying the new instrument to structure studies on Si/CoSi2 interfaces it was demonstrated that an outstanding additional advantage of aberration correction is the substantially reduced contrast delocalization in high-resolution images.

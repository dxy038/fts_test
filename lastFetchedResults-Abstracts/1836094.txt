TiO2 coatings were manufactured by the High Velocity Suspension Flame Spraying (HVSFS) technique using a nanopowder suspension. Their microstructure, nanohardness, tribological properties and photocatalytic activity were studied and compared to conventional atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) and HVOF-sprayed TiO2 coatings manufactured using commercially available feedstock. The HVSFS process leaves a fairly large freedom to adjust coating properties (thickness, porosity, anatase content, hardness, etc…) according to the desired objective. Layers with higher anatase content and higher porosity can be produced to achieve higher photocatalytic efficiency, better than conventional APS and HVOF TiO2. Alternatively, dense protective layers can be deposited, possessing lower porosity and pore interconnectivity and better wear resistance than as-deposited APS and HVOF layers. In all cases, HVSFS-deposited layers are thinner (20 µm–60 µm) than those which can be obtained by conventional spraying processes.

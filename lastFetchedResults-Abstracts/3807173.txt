The problem of scheduling independent parallel tasks with the consideration of setup time on a d-dimensional hypercube system is investigated. The objective of this problem is to find a schedule with minimum finish time; such a scheduling problem is NP-hard. Therefore, a heuristic algorithm is proposed and its performance bound derived

This paper describes the recruitment, training and development of engineering personnel to meet the operational and maintenance requirements of the new North East Line (NEL) mass rapid transit (MRT) rail system in Singapore. The objective was in response to the establishment of the Power and Overhead Catenary System (OCS) department in the organizationÂ´s new rail business area. The department oversees the entire electricity needs of the operating railway. It is also responsible for operating and maintaining the NEL MRT medium voltage AC power distribution network and DC traction power system for train propulsion. The NEL MRT had to be primarily safe and reliable for public use. SBS Transit as operator of the NEL MRT has an obligation to maintain the railway safe and reliable for the commuters. Technical personnel with relevant background had to be recruited, trained and developed so as to equip them with the necessary engineering skills and core competencies to meet the high demand of a fully automated MRT system. Such training and development programs are imperative prior to commuter service. The development of in-house technical courses and its implementation for the new trainees are described. Railway related courses and training courses for local statutory requirements are also described.

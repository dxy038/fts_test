This paper presents the comparison of Force-Free Control (FFC) against a Impedance Control (IC) method in cartesian space. The study of interaction forces between a robot arm and the environment is carried out. Main objective of this investigation is to find how to regulate and tune force-free control for safe and feasible operation. And how proposed force-free control compliances against an external force given from the environment, and compares the behavior with general impedance control method. A concise description of analyzing procedure is given for modeling and simulation of a robot arm and also how it interacts with environment under force-free and impedance controls schemes. The modeling and comparison are made by adopting Matlab/Simulink environment. Furthermore, the intention is also focused to make use of actual industrial robots whose factory fitted dynamical control loops are not accessible.

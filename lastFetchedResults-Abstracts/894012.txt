In this research, Method of Fundamental Solution (MFS) is coupled with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to determine the optimal phreatic line
in unconned seepage problems. To model the unconned boundary (phreatic line), a
formulation with 
oating geometry is derived. Regarding the use of fundamental solution
of the Laplace equation, expressed in the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), a boundary type
of the mesh-free method can be established. In this research, an objective function, based
on principle of minimum potential energy, is formed to control the position of unconned
boundary. MFS and PSO are utilized simultaneously to t the phreatic line, using 4th
degree polynomials, satisfying the 
ow continuity and energy principle. Eciency and
accuracy of the proposed method are veried through examples. The obtained results are
in a good agreement with other numerical and experimental models.

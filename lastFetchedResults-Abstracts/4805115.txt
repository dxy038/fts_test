A multi-objective 0-1 integer programming model is established in order to solve the complex problem of cast batch planning for steelmaking and continuous casting which is considered as vehicle routing problem. To solve the complex multi-constrained, multi-objective cast batch planning model for steelmaking and continuous casting, a method is proposed which combines rules with ant colony algorithm. The algorithm is tested by online data. Results show that the proposed algorithm can quickly workout the optimal cast batch planning for steelmaking and continuous casting, and can lay the firm groundwork for application to production process in the future.

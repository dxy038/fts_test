In this note we discuss the application of adaptive controller design techniques in a manufacturing process. As an example, we consider the process of oxidation of silicon in dry oxygen. This process consists of a single batch step where silicon wafers are introduced in a chamber and are oxidized for a time period at high temperature. Our objective is to determine the oxidation time such that a prescribed oxide thickness is grown on the silicon.

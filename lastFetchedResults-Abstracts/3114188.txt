The objective of this work is to eliminate the problems associated with the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of the single carrier transmission with frequency domain equalization (SC/FDE) system. This could be achieved by adapting the constant envelope type modulation (continuous phase modulation CPM), which, by nature, normalizes the PAPR for the SC/FDE. Ultimately, a comprehensive treatment of the problems of the PAPR is obtained. The central question always is whether the constant envelope modulation scheme suits the block-wise transmission, which is required for SC/FDE. Also, the adaption preserves the phase continuity of the constant envelope signals.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein that stimulates angiogenesis and plays a role in ulcer healing. The pathogenesis of the aphtha is unknown and few studies have been undertaken on the subject and have reported conflicting results. The present study aimed to determine the level and role of VEGF in four clinical stages and pathogenesis of the minor aphtha.
METHODS: In this case-control study, unstimulated saliva of the 18 patients with minor aphtha in four clinical stages (prodromal, preulcerous, ulcerative and healing) and 18 persons of control group, by asking them to spit their saliva was collected. Saliva VEGF (pg/ml) level were assessed using ELISA method. The results were compared with each other and with control group.
FINDINGS: Saliva VEGF level (pg/ml) in prodromal, preulcerous, ulcerative and healing stages was 21.32±12.94, 14.5±11.1, 10.49±9.46 and 13.26±12.06, respectively, and in control group was 20.15±57.83 pg/ml. Statistically significant differences in clinical aphtha (4 stages) were seen (p=0.002). The lowest VEGF level was observed in ulcerative stage in comparison to control group (p= 0.02). VEGF level in prodromal stage was higher than ulcerative (p=0.006) and healing stages (p=0.014), but no significant VEGF difference was observed between healing and ulcerative stages (p=0.158), healing and preulcerous stages (p=0.619) or prodromal and preulcerous stages. (p=0.066)
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, the changes in VEGF level especially its decrease in ulcerative stage have a role in the pathogenesis of the formation of minor aphthous ulcer but the minor aphtha is not resulted from high angiogenesis.

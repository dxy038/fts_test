In general, optimization techniques involve numerous repeated objective function evaluations. As a consequence,
optimization times can become very large depending on the complexity of the model to be
optimized. This manuscript describes the development of an adaptive response surface method for optimization
of computation-intensive models, capable of reducing optimization times. The response model
to be optimized is not built from a pre-defined number of design experiments but is adapted and refined
during the optimization routine. Different approximation models are applicable in combination with the
developed optimization technique. The proposed optimization technique is evaluated on a standard test
problem as well as a finite element model design optimization with multiple parameters.

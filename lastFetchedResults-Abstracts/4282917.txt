Covariance shaping least squares estimator is a new kind of linear estimator based on covariance shaping in quantum signal processing (QSP) framework. In this paper, we apply the covariance shaping least squares (CSLS) estimator to the detection of MIMO systems that leads to a new detection algorithm, covariance shaping MIMO detection algorithm. We derive the formalism of covariance shaping MIMO detection algorithm, and analyze its performance by numerical experiments. The results show that the performance of system is better than that of detection algorithm with zero-forcing and MMSE solutions, and the objective covariance matrix plays an important role in the proposed scheme.

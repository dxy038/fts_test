In this paper, we propose a dynamic wavelength-allocation scheme for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) fiber-radio ring-access networks. This scheme can be used to improve the use efficiency of wavelengths at the burst traffic load on the fiber-radio networks. Moreover, a novel bidirectional wavelength add-drop multiplexer (B-WADM) is designed on the backboned ring, which can connect the working and standby sub-rings. It can provide the self-protected function that uses just a few optical devices under link failures. Furthermore, we carry out this study through the simulation and analysis for carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), channel capacity, and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of the fiber-radio network. Finally, we set up an experimental network to demonstrate its performance. The experimental results illustrate that this fiber-radio architecture can provide the robust, flexible, and reliable characteristics for large radio terminals.

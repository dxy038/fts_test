This article presents application of an efficient and reliable heuristic technique inspired by swarm behaviours in nature namely, gravitational search algorithm (GSA) for solution of multi-objective optimal power flow (OPF) problems. GSA is based on the NewtonÂ´s law of gravity and mass interactions. In the proposed algorithm, the searcher agents are a collection of masses that interact with each other using laws of gravity and motion of Newton. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed scheme, multi-objective OPF problems are solved. A standard 26-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems with three different individual objectives, namely fuel cost minimisation, active power loss minimisation and voltage deviation minimisation, are considered. In multi-objective problem formulation fuel cost and loss; fuel cost and voltage deviation; fuel cost, loss and voltage deviation are minimised simultaneously. Results obtained by GSA are compared with mixed integer particle swarm optimisation, evolutionary programming, genetic algorithm and biogeography-based optimisation. The results show that the new GSA algorithm outperforms the other techniques in terms of convergence speed and global search ability.

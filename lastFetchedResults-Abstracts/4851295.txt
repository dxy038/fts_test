The objective of economic dispatch (ED) problem is minimizing the operating cost, and finding the point where the total output of the generations equals the total power that must be delivered. In that point the incremental cost of power generation is also equal for all generators. Considering the presence of uncertainty and inaccuracy in the data, fuzzy set theory is an appropriate method to solve the economic dispatch problems. In this paper, a modified fuzzy economic dispatch is formulated to solve the problem under the competitive electricity market uncertainties. Also, available spinning reserve is optimally allocated to market participants. The formulated optimization problem it then solved using the evolutionary programming (EP). The advantage of the proposed approach, in compression to classical method, is shown in one application example.

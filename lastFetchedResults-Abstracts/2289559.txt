was held according to article 121 and separate from the annual summit
of the assembly of member nations with the aim to expand the power of
international law through giving more authorities to the court from May 31
to June 11, 2010, in Kampala, Uganda.
Methodology: This research is descriptive-analytic and has used library
sources and international documents.
Findings: In this conference, two groups of issues are dealt with. The first
group includes the issues related to the contents of Rome constitution which
includes correction of article 8 of Rome statute, possibility of deletion
of article 124 of the constitution, and the definition of aggression and
specifying the terms to exert authority of the court on that crime. The second
group, i.e. the assessment of international criminal court achievements,
includes issues such as complementary authority, the direct impact of Rome
statute on victims and damaged societies, peace, justice, and cooperation.

its work by issuing 6 resolutions and 2 manifests, which through defining the
crime of aggression, specifying the terms to exert authority of the court on it,
and facilitating the inclusion of internal armed aggressions in article 8, has
expanded the active and potential power of international law and, also, by
restating article 126 of the constitution, attempts to encourage non-member
nations to join the constitution and consolidate it.

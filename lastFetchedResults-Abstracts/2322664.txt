Inroduction & Objective: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men after skin cancer. Guava Fruit with scientific name Psidium guajava L. are considered as an important source of phenolic compounds and antioxidant effect.  In this study, the cytotoxic effect of aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of Guava fruit and effect of the extracts on DU-145 cell line was and its effect on prostate cancer cells was studied. 
Materials and Methods: Guava fruit was collected from Sistan and Baluchestan region. The aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts were prepared from this plant. Class of DU-145 cells was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator, and under different concentrations of aqueous extract of 24, 48 and 72 hours were incubated. MTT assay for cell survival in the presence and absence of extract was used to calculate the percentage and absorbance at 540 nm was measured by ELISA. Data were assessed using SPSS software(* = P-value  <  0.05 , N=12).
Results: The results showed that the aqueous and alcoholic extract Guava fruit is a cytotoxic effect. Further studies showed that the cytotoxic effect of aqueous extracts of the ethanol extract is much stronger.

Increasing the capacity of optical networks while have the objective of lowering the total consumed energy per bit is challenging. By exploiting several dimensions, i.e. wavelength, space, time, polarisation and multilevel modulation simultaneously, a single laser can offer formidable capacity performance with potentially reduced energy consumption per bit. Up to 43 Tbit/s has been demonstrated.

Synthesis of state-feedback controllers is considered for a homogenous platoon operating under the leader and predecessor following scheme. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub>-type synthesis. The performance specifications are shaped by the string stability objective and prevention of extensive control effort, as well as by the concerns about the communication problems with the leader. Sufficient LMI conditions are then provided for the synthesis of common state-feedback gains. Some aspects of the developed approach are illustrated in the longitudinal control of a vehicle platoon.

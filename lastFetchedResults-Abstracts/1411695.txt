In studying barriers to commercialization of new ideas, there are two approaches: one is the objective approach investigating the objective and observable barriers to commercialization. The other is the subjective one, focusing on the perceptions and interpretations of actors regarding the given barriers.
The present qualitative study, inspired by phenomenological perspective, follows the second approach. Accordingly, drawing on focus groups interview technique, a total number of three groups, comprising of six students each, from the members of “Elites National Institution”, by purposive sampling selected and consequently interviewed. Interviews are then implemented, extracted, and subsequently analyzed. Analysis of data is done within “Collizzi” framework.
Findings of the study concerning elites experience in dealing with barriers to commercialization of ideas, in three levels of description, interpretation and explanation, signify the formation of problematic elite, namely, the subject who is lonely in the socioeconomic field, premature in education field, and wanderer in bureaucratic field. Researchers suggest the concept "accomplishment of the elite" as a solution to fill the gap between objective approach towards the elite and the subjective one towards the problem, i.e., their own experience as elite.

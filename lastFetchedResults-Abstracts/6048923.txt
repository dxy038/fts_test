Supply bottlenecks or sudden changes in legal regulations may lead to the situation that certain factor combinations for producing some commodity cannot be used any longer. In this case it is important to know alternative factor combinations leading to a product with identical characteristics represented by a Pareto-optimal objective vector of a multiobjective optimization problem. Here, we present a biobjective approach that finds equivalent inverse images of a given Pareto-optimal objective vector, provided they exist.

This paper revolves around the evaluation of the achievable throughput in the context of an IEEE 802.11p-based vehicular subnetwork scenario where a completely isolated source vehicle, S, desires to communicate with a distant stationary Roadside Internet Gateway (RIG), D. Multi-hop inter-vehicular communication is exploited for the purpose of establishing a path between S and D along which downstream cooperative vehicles serve intermediate packet relays. The formation of such a path is governed by the vehicular traffic behaviour as well as the per-hop contention-oriented data forwarding process. Following the formation of a continuous chain of in-range cooperative vehicles between an arbitrary source-destination pair (S,D), a stochastic analytical framework is developed with the objective of determining the probability of successful data transfer from S to D taking into account the per-hop vehicle contentions for channel access. Then, theoretical expressions for the achievable per-hop as well as the end-to-end throughput are presented. Simulations are conducted for purpose of validating the presented analysis and evaluating the considered subnetworkÂ´s performance.

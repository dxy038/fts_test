For integration testing processes, testers need to find test sequences of classes in order to execute interactions. One major problem of test order is the presence of cyclic dependency calls. Many researchers have proposed techniques to solve this problem by removing relationships to break cycles and then create test stubs. Therefore, one major purpose of integration testing is minimization of test stubs. This paper presents an approach to find test sequences by using object-oriented slicing technique to alleviate using test stubs. The main objective of using object-oriented slicing is to break cycles by slicing classes for partial testing instead of removing relationships for test stub construction. With this approach, the cost of implementing test stubs is decreased.

Objective- Right ventricular infarction (RVI) is a common complication of inferior wall infarction and usually leads to a greater mortality and in-hospital complications. This study aims to evaluate the value of TIMI risk score in the prediction of in-hospital and long-term mortality in RV infarction. Methods- Five hundred patients with acute inferior infarction were surveyed in this study. Inhospital complications and mortality of these patients were collected, and they were followed on average for about 31 months. Results- RVI was diagnosed in 24% of the patients. In-hospital morbidity (RVI: 56.7% vs. non- RVI: 34.4%; P<0•001) and mortality (RVI: 28.3% vs. non-RVI: 8.9%; P<0.001) were increased in patients with RVI. Any one-point increase in TIMI risk score led to a 3.5پ}1.4 percent increase in in-hospital mortality (P=0.001). Long-term mortality, however, did not reveal such a correlation with TIMI risk score (P=0.1). Out-of-hospital mortality in a mean follow-up period of about 31پ}8.7 months was 24.3% in the RVI and 12.1% in the non-RVI group (p=0.02). Conclusion- RV infarction significantly increases in-hospital complications and mortality of inferior infarction. Any one-point increase in TIMI risk score leads to a parallel increase of inhospital mortality but there is no such a correlation between TIMI risk score and long-term mortality (Iranian Heart Journal 2006; 7 (4):26-30).

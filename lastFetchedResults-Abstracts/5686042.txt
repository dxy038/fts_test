Multi-objective light ray optimization is proposed in this paper. This optimization is on the foundation of FermatÂ´s principle. Its characteristic is using the Fermat of refraction and reflection to solve Multi-objective problems. Also a new Nor-inferior principle is proposed by using gray system. The new principle can successfully increase the uniformity of solutions. In the section of experiment uses the ZDT series of test functions to compare with MOPSO and NSGA-II. The results show that the optimization has fast convergence speed and high efficiency.

This work is intended to be an objective introduction to the topic of secure image transcoding for ubiquitous P2P environments. The focus of the article is on the "XMLization" (or computer imaging in XML) in general, and SVG in particular. This article develop a framework for achieving such goal using the JXTA delivery infrastructure, the Batik or the XSL APIs for transcoding and the XML encryption based on lightweight encipherment techniques. The ultimate goal is development of a comprehensive secure medical imaging delivery system which can work effectively for ubiquitous and P2P environment.

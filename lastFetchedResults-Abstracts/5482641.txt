Because of the quantity of demand power depends on the power consumption of power demands on the loads, the utility grid has to secure a supply of electric energy which is larger than the required power consumption under peak load-condition. It means that the waste of electric power could be heavy at the other time than peak-load period. To avoid the waste of power, a 10kW rapid-charger system which has a function of load compensation at the peak-load condition is proposed in this paper. At the peak-load condition, the rapid charger transfer charged energy in the battery of electric vehicle to the grid. The 10kW rapid-charger for electric vehicle is comprised of the three-phase AC-DC PWM converter and isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter. Proposed V2G operation is verified through simulation experiment performed by 10kW rapid-charger.

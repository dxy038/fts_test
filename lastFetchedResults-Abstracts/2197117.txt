In recent years, reverse logistics, especially its integration with direct
logistics, plays an important role in decreasing supply chain costs. In this
paper, we consider a closed-loop multi-objective, multi-product and multiperiod
supply chain. The first objective function is minimization of
transportation costs between inter- and intra-center processing costs, as well
as the centers’ construction costs, and the second one is minimization of
released carbon dioxide due to transportation. We formulated this problem as
a mixed integer programming model. The problem’s complexity is of type
NP-Hard. The consideration of multi-product and multi-period by two
objectives is the big advantage of this model compared to the previous
models. This model also takes into account the released carbon dioxide
inside the centers and among them due to transportation as a constraint. In
the first step, the two objectives are changed into the same phase and then
integrated by using multi-objective planning. In order to validate the model
and study the impact of objectives’ weights, several problems are generated
and solved with CPLEX 12.3. Finally, the results are analyzed and
discussed.

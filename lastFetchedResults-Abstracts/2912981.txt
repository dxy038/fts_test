Reports some results and conclusions from a research and development programme aimed at a demonstration of the application of very high performance integrated circuit (VHPIC) technology to a `Universal RadioÂ´. The programme has been carried out as a collaborative venture with the UK Ministry of Defence, and exploits UK developments in fine geometry CMOS and bipolar silicon technology. This programme exploits both 1.25 &#956;m CMOS and 2 &#956;m bipolar technologies developed under the Alvey initiatives. The objective has been to develop both circuit techniques and integrated designs for the critical analogue to digital converter and the digital signal processor for use in high performance radios. The demonstration equipment is a very high performance VHF/UHF communications receiver in which all signal processing from the channel filter to the audio or data outputs is realised by DSP

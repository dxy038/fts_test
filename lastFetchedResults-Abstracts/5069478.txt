Based on fuzzy C-means method and the characteristics of kernel-based method, the algorithm of kernel-based fuzzy clustering is presented, in which the objective function of fuzzy C-means is substituted by Gaussian kernel objective function. The approach of kernel-based fuzzy C-means clustering is used in the classification and recognition of remote sensing images, and the result shows that it can effectively improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing images compared with the traditional fuzzy C-means clustering.

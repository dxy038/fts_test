In this paper, an optimum design technique is developed which can be applied to bridge decks based on FRP materials with more complex objective functions and constraints than those of existing materials. The proposed optimum design technique is applied to determine optimum geometry for bridge decks and properties of the FRP material by carrying out three-dimensional numerical modeling. In addition, FRP deck modules have been produced using the pultrusion method after considering the proposed optimum cross-section shape and property of the material, and several tests have been performed to validate the performance of the developed GFRP deck.

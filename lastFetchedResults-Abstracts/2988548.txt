In this work, we propose to cope in a joint and cooperative way with two types of problems that were addressed within distinct approaches so far: (a) the estimation of dense velocity (or displacement) fields of fluid flows, using a robust extension of the minimization-based approach proposed by Horn and Schunck; (b) the extraction of kinematic entities of particular interest from the fluid mechanics point of view: vortices, sinks, and sources. As concerns the second item, we extend Rankine vortex model, and thus design an original non-linear parametric model of the motion stemming from vortices, sinks and sources. We make interact this parametric model with the dense flow field within a global objective function, and we design a specific alternate scheme to perform the minimization of this function

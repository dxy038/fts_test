Common methods of controlling river pollution include establishing water pollution monitoring stations located along the length of the river. The point where each station is located (sampling point) is of crucial importance and, obviously, depends on the reasons for the sample. Collecting data about pollution at selected points along the river is not the only objective; must also be extrapolated to know the characteristics of the pollution in the entire river. In this work we will deal with the optimal location of sampling points. A mathematical formulation for this problem as well as an efficient algorithm to solve it will be given. Finally, in last sections, we will present numerical results obtained by using this algorithm when applied to a realistic situation in a river mouth.

This paper is concerned with a local learning method of a multi-objective behavior coordination for a mobile robot. The multiobjective behavior coordination plays a role in integrating outputs of basic behavioral modules. A behavioral weight is assigned to each behavioral module represented by fuzzy rules, production rules, and so on. By updating these behavioral weights, the mobile robot can take a multi-objective situated action. However, the coordination rule is designed suitably static environments and the mobile robot must learn or update coordination rule in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. Therefore, we propose a local episode-based learning which is a learning method using self-reference of the relationship between previous perception and action in short-term memory.

The control of time-delayed linear differential inclusions with stochastic disturbance is discussed. The feedback law is constructed by the convex hull Lyapunov function. The design objective is to make the closed-loop system exponentially stable in mean square. Finally, a simulation is given to show the effectiveness of this control design.

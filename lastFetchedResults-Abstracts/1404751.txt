Background and Objective: Proper method and machine for corneal evaluation is an important factor in many anterior segment interventions. This study was performed to compare the mean keratometry (K) readings obtained with an IOL Master and Pentacam for intraocular lens power calculation in normal subjects with no history of refractive surgery.
Materials and Methods: Mean K values were obtained with the automated (IOL Master) and Scheimpflug keratometer. Scheimpflug readings obtained from simulated K (SIMK) and Holladay equivalent K (EKR) were analysed. Specific formula for a defined intraocular lens was considered according to the IOL Master, Pentacam SIMK and EKR data. 
Results: 100 eyes undergoing PRK were evaluated. The mean age of patients was 27 ± 4.3 year old. 
The mean corneal power by IOL Master, SIMK and the EKR was 44.52 D ± 1.54, 44.08 D ± 1.46 and 44.25 D ± 1.48, respectively. The mean intraocular lens power by these three machines was 17.15 D ± 2.14 and 17.6D ± 2.2 and 17.53 D ± 2.14, respectively. There was a statistically significant correlation between IOL Master and SIMK and EKR corneal power and intraocular lens power calculated by the three aforementioned techniques (P  <  0.001). There was a statistically significant difference between mean corneal power by IOL Master, SIMK and EKR and intraocular lens power calculated by IOL Master, SIMK and EKR. (P  <  0.001)
Conclusion: Despite the high correlation between the mean corneal power of automated keratometry, SIMK and EKR, also indicated a high correlation between intraocular lens power calculated by automated keratometry, SIMK and EKR. There was a statistically significant difference between them and the values were not interchangeable.

In this paper, a set of comprehensive evaluation index system for selection of transmission and transformation station site was established, based on the analysis of status of transmission and transformation station site project from Baotou to Hohhot. In order to make subjective coincide well with objective, AHP was used to determine the various evaluation index weight and the method of support vector machine classification was introduced into comprehensive evaluation of transmission and transformation station site project, because of many factors involved in the comprehensive evaluation of transmission power station site project. In the article, the empirical study and comprehensive evaluation of transmission and transformation station site project from Baotou to Hohhot were made respectively, so the scientific of the evaluation was improved. This project research also increases capability and reliability of power supply for distribution system in western Inner Mongolia.

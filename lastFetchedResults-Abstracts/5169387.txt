This paper proposes a novel method for solving the two-sided matching problem, in which the preferences provided by agents are in the form of scores. Firstly, the problem description of two-sided matching with scores is given. Then the related concepts on satisfaction degree are given. Considering the satisfaction degree of each agent, a multi-objective optimization model is set up. The linear weighted method is used to convert the multi-objective optimization model into a single objective model. The matching result is obtained by solving the model. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the use of the proposed method.

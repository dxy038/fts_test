Abdominal tuberculosis continues to be endemic in the developing world and has shown a resurgence in the West. Computed tomography (CT) evaluation is singularly informative as it demonstrates involvement of the bowel, peritoneum, lymph nodes, and solid organs in a single examination.

Genitourinary tuberculosis and tuberculosis in AIDS are excluded as they merit separate discussions.

Objective
To determine the role of ketogenic diet in the treatment of intractable
epilepsy in children.
Materials & Methods
Sixty six consecutive children (1-16 years old) with intractable epilepsy
whose seizure were not neurodegenerative nor febrile in origin were
recruited. They received the ketogenic diet and we evaluated its effect
on seizure frequency for 3 months. All these children had more than five
seizures per week despite adequate therapy with at least 3-4 anticonvulsant
medications. Carbohydrates were initially limited to 10 gr/day and fats
constituted 75% of the total energy requirement. Response to the diet
was categorized as free of seizure, 99%-75%, 50%-75%, 25%-49% and
lower than 25% reduction (resistant to therapy).
Results
Fifty five patients (84%) out of 66 children initiating the diet continued it
after 1 week. After 3 months, 80% of the patients kept the diet. After one
week, one month and 3 months, there was a more than 50% decrease
in the frequency of the seizures in 40 (60%), 50 (75%) and 39 (59%) of
the patients, respectively. Three patients (4.5%) were seizure-free after
1 week, 12 (18%) were seizure-free after one month and 12 (18%) were
seizure-free after three months and a significant relationship was found
between seizure reduction and the type of epilepsy (p < 0.017).
Conclusion
The ketogenic diet should be considered as an alternative therapy for
children with intractable seizures. It is more effective than many of the
new anticonvulsant medications and is well tolerated by children and
their families.

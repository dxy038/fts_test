Objective: to investigate the biological activity of subeschar tissue fluid (STF) and its probable mechanism in the genesis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome(SIRS). Methods: the changes of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), white blood cell count (WBCC) as well as the major organ function were observed in the animals injected with STF. The inflammatory mediators TNF-α and IL-1 in the supernatants of macrophages cultured with STF were assayed. Results: the HR, RR and WBCC were elevated in animals after injection with STF. STF showed a deleterious effect on function and structure of the major visceral organs. Macrophages were activated to produce excessive TNF-α and IL-1. Conclusion: the findings suggest that STF may be one of the inducing factors involved in the genesis of SIRS and the development of MODS in the early postburn stage.

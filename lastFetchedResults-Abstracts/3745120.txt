This note addresses the problems of stability analysis and stabilization of systems presenting nested saturations. Depending on the open-loop stability assumption, the global stability analysis and stabilization problems are considered. In the (local) analysis problem, the objective is the determination of estimates of the basin of attraction of the system. Considering the stabilization problem, the goal is to design a set of gains in order to enlarge the basin of attraction of the closed-loop system. Based on the modelling of the system presenting nested saturations as a linear system with dead-zone nested nonlinearities and the use of a generalized sector condition, linear matrix inequality (LMI) stability conditions are formulated. From these conditions, convex optimization strategies are proposed to solve both problems

The bonding effectiveness of restorative materials to tooth tissue is typically measured statically. Clinically tooth/composite bonds are however subjected to cyclic sub-critical loads. Therefore, in vitro fatigue testing of dental adhesives should predict better the in vivo performance of adhesives. The objective of this study was to determine the fatigue resistance of two representative adhesives, a self-etch and an etch&rinse adhesive, bonded to enamel and dentin. Therefore, tooth/composite interfaces were cyclically loaded using a miniaturized version of a rotating beam fatigue testing device. Subsequently, the load at which 50% of the specimens fail after 105 cycles, was determined as the median micro-rotary fatigue resistance (μRFR). For both adhesives, the μRFR was about 30–40% lower than the corresponding micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) to both enamel and dentin. Analysis of the fracture surfaces by Feg-SEM revealed typical fatigue fracture patterns. It is concluded that resin/tooth interfaces are vulnerable to progressive damage by sub-critical loads, with the 3-step etch&rinse adhesive being more resistant to fatigue than the 2-step self-etch adhesive.

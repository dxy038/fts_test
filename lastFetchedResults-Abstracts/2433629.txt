Objective (s): One of the most important strategies to achieve equity is facilitating population access to health services. As such geographical accessibility modeling was suggested. This paper as part of a larger study on geographical accessibility modeling to medical laboratory services in Iran reports the findings from the city of Takab, Iran.
Methods: The detail of methodology and accessibility modeling are reported elsewhere. In brief, study units included existing medical laboratories, which were active by the end of March 2013 and located within the city borders. Data were analyzed using Geographic Information System (GIS). Spatial analysis performed using the ArcGIS software. The criteria ranking scores for site selection were unacceptable, poor, somewhat poor, somewhat good, good and excellent. 
Results: Takab is located in the west Azarbiyejan Province. According to the accessibility model, the sites for new medical laboratories were identified for Takab. The total area needed was estimated to be about 2000 square meters (in the horizontal expansion of city) and ranked as somewhat good, good and excellent. It is possible to establish 9 new medical laboratories (laboratories outside of hospitals and clinics) in Takab city.
Conclusion:The model was accurate in identifying new sites. However, it seems that the accuracy of selected sites should be confirmed by field visits and opinions of local experts.

In this paper, we propose a Petri Net decomposition approach for solving the bi-objective conflict-free routing for AGV systems. The objective is to minimize the deviation of delivery time and to minimize the total transportation time. The dispatching and conflict-free routing problem for AGVs is represented as an optimal firing sequence problem for Petri Net. A Petri Net decomposition approach is applied to solve the multi-objective optimization problem efficiently. The convergence of the algorithm is improved by reducing the search region. The effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with that of the conventional method. Computational results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

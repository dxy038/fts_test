Background & Objective: Having an access to safe drinking water, which is considered as one of the health indicators by World Health Organization (WHO), has great importance for relevant authorities of different communities. Thus this study aimed to determine amounts of heavy metals and compare them with national and international standards.
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study, drinking water samples were taken from 41 main drinking water supplies in villages of Torbat-e Heydariyeh city according to the standard method and  transferred to the laboratory. These samples were analyzed by mean of atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AA240FS).Finally, obtained data were analyzed using Arc-GIS (v. 10.3) and excel (v.2010) softwares.
Results: The attained results revealed that the mean concentrations of metals including Cadmium, lead and Chromium were (0.59±0.17), (1.8±1.7) and (33.5±33.4) mg/l, respectively, in drinking water wells of rural regions of Torbat-e Heydariyeh . These amounts were in optimal ranges. While chromium concentrations were more than recommended permissible levels of WHO and national standards in 11 villages.
Conclusion: The mean concentrations of measured metals were lower than the recommended permissible levels by WHO in more cases of considered wells in villages of Torbat-e Heydarieh=. However, forregions in which the concentrations of heavy metals do not meet the standards, a comprehensive study is recommended to determine the heavy metal-related diseases in dry and wet seasons.

Environmental, economic and technical benefits of photovoltaic (PV) systems make them to be used in many countries. The main characteristic of PV systems is the fluctuations of their output power. Hence, high penetration of PV systems into electric network could be detrimental to overall system performance. Furthermore, the fluctuations in the output power of PV systems make it difficult to predict their output, and to consider them in generation planning of the units. The main objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid method which can be used to control and reduce the power fluctuations generated from large grid- connected PV systems. The proposed method focuses on using a suitable storage battery along with curtailment of the generated power by operating the PV system below the maximum power point (MPP) and deployment of a diesel generator. These methods are analyzed to investigate the impacts of implementing them on the economic benefits that the PV system owner could gain. To maximize the revenues, an optimization problem is solved.

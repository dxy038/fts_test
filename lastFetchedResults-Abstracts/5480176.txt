A quadratic-based model of a power system is used to formulate a generalized optimum power system flow problem. The conditions for feasibility, convergence, and optimality are included in the construction of the optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm. The algorithm is capable of using hierarchical structures to include multiple objective functions and selectable constraints. The generalized algorithm using sensitivity of objective functions with optimal adjustments in the constraints yields a global optimal solution. The generalized algorithm includes special cases of the OPF that reduces the computational burden when the number of constraints is equal to the number of variables and can select the constraint sets that are binding or nonbinding. The package is flexible and can accommodate other models and solution methods. The algorithm has been tested using different objective functions on actual power systems, and optimal solutions were reached in relatively few iterations. The potential of the method for online application is being investigated with several utility companies

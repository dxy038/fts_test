The objective of the present experiment was to examine the effect of substituting different quantities of soyabean protein for casein on renal function and lipid metabolism in rats with chronic renal failure induced by a five-sixths nephrectomy. Experimental animals were subjected to a nephrectomy and fed either casein or soyabean protein (200 or 100 g/kg diet). The diets were isoenergetic with identical fat, Na, K and P contents. Rats ingesting 200 g casein/kg diet showed a significantly (P<0·05) accelerated course of chronic renal failure, while the soyabean-protein groups showed retarded progression of the experimentally induced renal disease and hypercholesterolaemic effects. Rats in the low-soyabean-protein diet (100 g/kg) also demonstrated increased serum albumin and decreased serum triacylglycerol, total cholesterol concentrations and blood urea-N; however, the low-casein diet significantly (P<0·05) increased serum triacylglycerol. Results of the present study show that the replacement of casein by soyabean protein was related to the rate of progression of renal failure and improvement in lipid profiles in serum of five-sixths nephrectomized rats.

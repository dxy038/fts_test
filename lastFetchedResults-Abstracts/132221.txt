Objective(s): To evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) in children and young adults with thalassemia and its potential risk factors.
Methods: Two hundreds and twelve thalassemic patients aged 10-20 were enrolled in the study. In all patients height, weight, body mass index, growth indices, pubertal development, calcium intake and serum ferritin were assessed. BMD was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar). BMD z scores between -1 and -2.5 were identified as iow bone mass and z scores less than -2.5 were considered severely low bone mass.
Results: Prevalence of severely low bone mass was 50.7% in lumbar spine, 10.8% in femur and 7.9% in both areas. There was no statistically significant between males and females. Low bone mass was observed in 39.5% and 37.5% of patients in lumbar and femoral areas. Patients with severely low bone mass in lumbar spine were older than the others (P<0.00I).
Conclusion: The data confirm significant reductions in BMD in Iranian thalassemic patients. Further research is needed to identify risk factors and preventive methods recommend.

Objective
This study was undertaken to determine whether there is an association among pelvic organ prolapse, constipation, and dietary fiber intake.
Study design
Sixty consecutive women with prolapse were compared with 30 control women without prolapse. All women completed 2 validated questionnaires to assess constipation and dietary fiber intake. Multivariate analysis was performed.
Results
The risk for constipation was greater in women with prolapse than controls (odds ratio 4.03, 95% CI 1.5-11.4). Median insoluble fiber intake was significantly lower in women with prolapse (2.4 g) than controls (5.8 g, P< .01). The increased risk for constipation was reduced but remained significant after controlling for age and insoluble dietary fiber intake (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-13.5).
Conclusion
Women with pelvic organ prolapse are at a higher risk for constipation than controls. This increased risk for constipation is partially explained by lower intake of dietary insoluble fiber by women with prolapse than controls.

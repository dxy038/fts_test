A Family of Low Cost Monopropellant Propulsion Modules for small satellites was developed at EADS-ST. The Objective was to develop a "plug-in" module that could be easily adapted for use with various satellite platforms and missions. An ITAR-free version is also being developed. Concurrent engineering and a success-oriented qualification philosophy are being used to achieve qualification in a very short time.

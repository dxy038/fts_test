A simple model for the components that make up a rapid thermal processing system is given. These components are the furnace, the pyrometer used to measure temperature, and the control system that utilizes the pyrometer measurement to control the power to the lamps. The models for each of the components are integrated in a numerical code to give a computer simulation of the complete furnace operation. The simulation can be used to investigate the interaction of the furnace, temperature-sensing technique, and the control system. Therefore, the interplay of heat transfer (furnace) properties, optical (pyrometer) parameters, and control gains can be studied. The objective is to define variability in wafer temperature as process parameters change. The following three applications of the model are included: (1) a simulation of open-loop operation; (2) a simulation of the ramp up and subsequent operation with a step change in wafer optical properties; and (3) a simulation of the rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition of polysilicon on silicon oxide which demonstrates the applicability model for actual processes. A technique for correction of pyrometer output to improve temperature control is also presented

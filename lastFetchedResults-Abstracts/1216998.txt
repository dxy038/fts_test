Ultra-fast cooling (UFC) is an advanced technology in hot rolling field. Through this technology, great changes on the run-out table are produced in the strip cooling process. In order to adapt to these changes, a new generation of hot strip cooling control system after rolling was developed based on the UFC basic principle. The system can not only accomplish temperature of UFC delivery side, coiling temperature, cooling rate, etc, and multi-objective accuracy control, but also offer more flexibility and new attractive possibilities in terms of cooling pattern on the run-out table, which could be of prime importance for the production of some difficult steels. In addition, through the time-velocity-distance (TVD) profile prediction combined with speed feed-forward control and coiling temperature feedback control, the coiling temperature control precision can be effectively improved during accelerative rolling in the system. At present, the system has been successfully used in the conventional strip production line and CSP short process production line, and its application effect is perfect.

Background: Because of the relationship between sesame oil consumption and reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate, research on dietary intake of sesame oil is necessary. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dietary supplementation with virgin sesame oil (VSO) on lipid profile in rats.
Methods: This experimental study was conducted in 28 adult male rats weighing 240-350 g. The experimental groups were fed with a diet supplemented with 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 ml/kg/day VSO via gastric gavage for 30 days and the control group received saline. Serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL were measured. Data were analyzed using one way ANOVA with LSD as post-hoc test.
Findings: Serum cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL levels were significantly decreased in the experimental groups compared to the control group. HDL was increased in a dose dependent fashion, but the difference was statistically significant for the 0.5 and 0.75 ml/Kg/day groups compared to the control group.
Conclusions: With regards to the results, virgin sesame oil supplementation decreased serum lipids that is probably due to the effects of antioxidants and unsaturated fatty acids.

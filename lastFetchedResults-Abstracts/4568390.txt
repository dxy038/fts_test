We present a dynamic framework for 2D complex filter implementation that is based on a multi-objective optimization scheme that generates Pareto-optimal realizations from the Energy-Performance-Accuracy (EPA) space. The EPA space is created by evaluating the 2D complex filter realizations in terms of their required energy, accuracy, and performance. Dynamic EPA management, carried out via Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) and Dynamic Frequency Control, then consists on selecting Pareto-optimal realizations that meet time-varying EPA requirements. We demonstrate dynamic EPA management by applying a complex filter to a standard video sequence.

BACKGROUND: Production risk and its impact on the efficiency of production units is one of the main issues in the farm management.OBJECTIVE:This studyreviews the relationship oftechnicalefficiency with production riskoffish farmsin theKamyaranCounty.METHODS:Required dataquestionnaireswere collected from 55farmsin the Kamyaran.Toachieve objective,study employed the stochastic frontiermodelwheretheproductionfunctions, risk and technicalinefficiencyis estimated simultaneously.RESULTS:Resultsshowed that fish production is significantlyinfluenced by labor, fry and feed. Feed and fry are found to be risk- increasing inputs and labor is revealed to be a risk- reducing inputs. Furthermore, it is revealed thatlabor,experience, memberofthe cooperativeand frequency of participation intrainingsignificantly decreasestechnicalinefficiency of farmers. CONCULUTION:The estimated technicalefficiencyshowed that efficiency score(73%) is overstated when the estimating function is modeled withoutthe risk component. Thereforeit would be better that in measuring of farm efficiency we also consider the farm production risk.

Objective
Determine predictors of medication refillâ€“seeking behavior in ED patients with chronic illness.
Methods/Design
Prospective cross-sectional ED survey conducted for 6 weeks.
Setting
Public hospital ED (>140 000 visits per year).
Subjects
ED patients (>18 years) taking chronic medications for congestive heart failure, diabetes, and/or hypertension.
Results
Of 1168 patients surveyed, 344 (29%) presented to the ED secondary to running out of medications and requiring a medication refill. Univariate predictors included age younger than 50 years, non-Hispanic ethnicity, low income (<US$5000 per year), self-pay payor status, and being told to call a primary care physician before medication would be refilled. Lack of knowledge about refill or pharmacy numbers on the medication bottle resulted in patients being more than twice as likely to be in the ED for a medication refill (odds ratio 2.4 [1.6, 3.6] and 2.0 [1.3, 2.9], respectively).
Conclusion
Presenting for medication refills is common in ED patients with chronic illness

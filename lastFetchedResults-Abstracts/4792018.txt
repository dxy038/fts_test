Advanced phase change medium of over 30GB data capacity has been proposed and the recording characteristics of the medium have been described. The medium has L-H polarity, Bi-substituted GeTe-rich pseudo-binary alloy film as the recording layer, and thin metal absorption control layer. The recording measurement was carried out by using a blue laser light source with the wavelength of 405nm and an objective lens with NA of 0.85. Both CNR and ER have been improved by the use of the Bi-substituted GeTe-rich composition. XE has been reduced by the use of the absorption control layer. The bER measurement demonstrated its capability for over 30GB data capacity.

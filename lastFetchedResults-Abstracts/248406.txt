The objective of this paper is to describe the object-oriented implementation and computational e¦ciency of
a multibody dynamics algorithm for planar mechanical systems. The underlying formulation uses a unique
combination of orthogonal projection techniques and graph-theoretic methods to automatically generate
the equations of motion in terms of ÔbranchÕ co-ordinates that are selected by a user. The direct analogy
between the physical components in a multibody system and the ÔobjectsÕ in Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP) methods is exploited in a C##implementation of the dynamic formulation. Issues associated with
this OOP implementation are discussed, and the results of computer simulations are presented and
examined for di¤erent sets of user-selected co-ordinates

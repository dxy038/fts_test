OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between major depressions and glucose control index in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One- hundred thirty four patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and HbA1c were measured in patients. Linear mixed-model analysis was applied to determine the relation between HbA1c levels and depressive symptoms.
RESULTS:  Groups of patients with and without depression were similar in age and BMI. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between HAM-D scores and HbA1c level. Depressive scores were significantly higher in diabetic patients with hypertension (P = 0.0001) and on insulin treatment (P = 0.005). There was a significant positive relationship between HAM-D scores and disease duration. (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed that there was no significant association between the level of depressive symptoms and HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes

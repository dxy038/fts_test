Random sampling was conducted. Collected data were analyzed by covariance analysis method. Undergraduate students were randomly selected and divided into two groups each consisting of 15 students. Pretest and posttest were conducted in order to gather data and measure learning level of the students. Findings indicated that there is a significant correlation between mean score of two different groups.

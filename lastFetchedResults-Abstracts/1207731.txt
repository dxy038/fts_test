The objective of the present study is to carry out a reviewon the relationship
between religiousness and trust via metaanalysis of conducted researches
that have been done in Iran.
For this purpose, amongthe18 existing investigative documents in Tehran
University, Shahid Beheshti University, Allahmeh Tabatabai University, and
Tarbiat Modarres University, a number of 16 met the requirements to be
regarded as metaanalysis, which have been done during the last ten years.
On this basis, research sample size indicates 8245 people from different
walks of life among Iranian people.
The findingsthat stem from the combination of studies probability and
reviews over the impactcoefficient showed that there is ameaningful
relationship between religiousness and trust. This finding confirms the major
hypothesis of this researchIt has been reported in researches there is a direct
connection andthe average rate of this connection is about 0.4. Also, another
hypothesis of this study is the impact of using different statistical tests on the
results coming from religiousness and trust.The results proved to be far from
sensible. Hence, it shows that using different statistical tests have no
influence on the amount of resulted correlation between religiousness and
trust.
Samplegroupsâ€™ hypothesis, on the amount of religiousness correlation and
trust in the result of variance analysis, did not make any sense, and the
hypothesis was eventually refused.
Last but not least, the hypothesis of studying field impact on the
correlation of religiousness and trust, which was achievedas the result of
variance analysis proved to be meaningless. Therefore, it can be concluded
that, religiousness, apart from ground factors of research consisting of
sample groups, studying field and statistical test using in researches, directly
impacts the way people socially trust one another.

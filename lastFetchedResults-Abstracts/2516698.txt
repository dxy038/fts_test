Background and Aim: The most important healthcare reform in Iran during the last decade has been implementation of the family physician and referral system in rural areas and small towns with a population of less than 20000. The program was expanded (as a pilot project), with small modifications, to rural areas of 2 provinces, namely, Fars and Mazandaran. This study was initiated to assess the achievements, challenges and weak points of the pilot project before deciding to expand it to other provinces.

Materials and Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in winter 2013. Data were collected using document desk reviews, semi-structured interviews with key informants, and focus-group discussions. Relevant family health policy makers, managers and service providers in the two provinces were invited to the meetings. The data were analyzed and categorized based on the content analysis method.

Results: The data showed that the family physician program is faced with several challenges regarding objectives; stewardship; service providing; and human, financial and information resources. It is to be noted, however, that the program has had achievements such as increased access to services, increased coordination among insurance organizations and medical universities, and organizing and managing health files.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Conclusion: The program should not be expanded to other provinces before redesigning in order to assure that it is more complete and comprehensive and create commitment and adequate guarantee among stakeholders. It is essential that all the stakeholders agree on general and specific objectives of a 5-year program and prepare an operational plan for each specific objective.&nbsp;

Background: Although effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy could be alleviated if women quit early in pregnancy, most do not. Relapse rates among quitters are high.

Objective: To test the effects of a low-intensity, smoking-cessation/relapse-prevention intervention delivered by clinic staff and providers and based on stages-of-change constructs of the transtheoretical model and brief motivational interviewing techniques.

Methods: A quasi-experimental prospective cohort design employed in obstetric, in-patient, and pediatric care delivery settings of a large health maintenance organization in Portland, Oregon. Subjects were pregnant smokers registered for their first prenatal visit. Primary outcome measures were sustained (self-reported) quit rates during pregnancy and smoking abstinence between 6 and 12 months after delivery.

Results: Regression analyses found statistically significant improvement for intervention women in sustained pregnancy quit rates (OR=2.7, CI=1.2–5.7) and on smoking abstinence between 6 and 12 months after delivery (OR=2.4, CI=1.1–5.3).

Conclusions: While these outcomes are based on self-report only, they emerged despite variable delivery of the intervention across clinics and represent clinically meaningful improvements in rates of nonsmoking. The intervention supports women who want to quit smoking during pregnancy and improves the likelihood of their remaining nonsmokers for the long term.

This paper proposes the use of content base image retrieval (CBIR) techniques for indexing and retrieval of handwritten documents in Thai language. Issues associated with Thai handwritten documents are the lack of spacing between words, multi-level alphabets and different writing styles. This causes low recognition rate based on automated techniques such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This paper also examined off-line signature recognition techniques in order to adapt to Thai handwriting system for matching data. The objective of the proposal is to develop a semiautomated method to index and retrieve Thai handwritten documents based on sampled keywords by combining CBIR and signature recognition techniques.

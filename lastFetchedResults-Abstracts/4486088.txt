An architecture-independent analysis approach is described for evaluation of control systems designed to provide compliant manipulator/task interaction. Two issues are highlighted: a safety bound that provides an explicit, quantitative design objective, and an examination of typical task dynamics and their impact on the difficulty (complexity) of control design. Two examples of control design within this framework are presented, demonstrating the need to consider safety bounds of the type proposed

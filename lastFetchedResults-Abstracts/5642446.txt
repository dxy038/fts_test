We constructed a full text retrieval system for the scanned Hangul document images. The system consists of three parts; preprocessing, recognition, and retrieval. The retrieval algorithm uses recognition results up to k-ranks. The algorithm is not only insensitive to the recognition errors, but also has the advantage of user controllable recall and precision. For the objective performance evaluation, we used the scanned images of Journal of Korean Information Science Society provided by KISTI. The system was shown to be practical through the evaluation of retrieval performances.

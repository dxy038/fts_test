Objective: The computer game industry has the highest growth rate in en¬tertainment industries. Children and adolescents spend a lot of time playing these games and are influenced by them. However, no system has yet been developed for rating these games in Iran. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to design an age-based rating of computer games considering Iranian and Islamic culture. Method: The study was performed using Delphi method. We contacted 17 distinguished psychiatrists and psychologists in the field of child development; and 8 of them accepted to participate in the study. They completed a 187 item questionnaire on the content of computer games and appropriate ages for those contents, which were gathered and analyzed in two stages. Results: In the second stage, the ratings became more congruent. The ratings of the second stage were added up and a final rating was considered for each of the items, which are presented in a table in the article. Discussion: There was much less disagreement among special¬ists in subjects related to sex, gambling, alcoholic beverages and substance use, and violence. These are the fields which have been more extensively studied; therefore, their corresponding guidelines could be recommended with higher certainty. However, specialists had more disagreement in items related to discrimination, insulting, and values; and more quantitative and qualitative studies are necessary to further investigate these issues.

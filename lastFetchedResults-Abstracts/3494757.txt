A deblocking filtering method that reduces the blocking artifacts that result from the use of the illumination change-adaptive motion compensation method, which was already adopted in the current multiview video coding (MVC) standard, is introduced. When the macroblock (MB)-based illumination compensation method is used to compensate local illumination changes in multiview video sequences, the neighboring MBs could have different illumination values that represent the average values of the luminance MBs, horizontally and vertically. This phenomenon causes horizontal/vertical blocking artifacts on the MB boundaries due to the difference in illumination between the neighboring MBs. The proposed deblocking filtering method is designed to reduce this phenomenon by using the adequately modified boundary strength derivation process of the current H.264/AVC deblocking filtering mechanism. The proposed deblocking filtering method improves the subjective video quality and provides slightly better objective video quality in multiview video sequences.

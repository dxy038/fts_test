Parametric Web application cost estimation is referred to the usage of mathematical model to derive the estimated effort and duration of Web application development. Typically, majority of Web application developers are applying expert judgment and estimation by analogy in Web application development. This paper is focusing on feasibility study of WEBMO (Web model), a parametric Web application cost estimation model, in Web application development within Klang Valley in Malaysia. WEBCOMO, a parametric Web application tool is developed based on WEBMOpsilas methodology to fulfill the objective of the study.

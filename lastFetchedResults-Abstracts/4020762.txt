Atmospheric noise received on a vertical aerial is compared with a locally-generated keyed signal to estimate the level at which the signal is 95% intelligible. This method was used in earlier high-frequency equipment and has been adapted for the range 15&#194;&#191;500 kc/s. The apparatus and its method of operation are described. Results obtained at a number of sites are discussed in relation to more objective measurements. In particular, deduced noise powers are compared with existing world-wide predictions, revealing some differences.

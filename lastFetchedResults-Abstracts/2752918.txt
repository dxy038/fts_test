This paper proposes a new magnetic planetary geared permanent magnet brushless (MPG-PMBL) machine for hybrid electric vehicles. According to the dynamic performances in hybrid electric vehicles, the proposed machine needs to offer the advantages of high power density, high efficiency, and low torque ripple. To realize these goals, a multi-objective optimization design method based on the combined design of experiments approach and response surface method is presented, where three key optimization objectives of the efficiency, total loss, and cogging torque are selected. After the optimization, some reasonable key design variables are determined and the proposed MPG-PMBL machine is newly designed and built for evaluation. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results verify the validity of the proposed optimization method.

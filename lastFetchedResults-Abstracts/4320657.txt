A multi-cell cascaded power amplifier with a high output voltage capability, wide load range and high bandwidth is presented in this paper. The cascaded power amplifier is formed by combining a low-voltage linear power amplifier in series with multiple inverter cells. Therefore the cascaded power amplifier combines the advantages of a linear power amplifier with the advantages of a switched mode power amplifier. A high output voltage and bandwidth of 20kHz is achievable using very simple modulation and feedback control design. The dc voltages for the inverter cells and linear power amplifier are provided by an isolated, bidirectional dc-dc resonant converter. The dimensioning and physical structure of a 1.2kW, plusmn400V cascaded amplifier is given, and shows that a compact, flat system design is possible. Finally, digital simulation results verify the theoretical analysis of the amplifier

Objective
In contrast to embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are able to give rise to all cell types of the body, somatic stem cells have been thought to be more limited in their differentiation potential in that they are committed to generate only cells of their tissue of origin. Unexpectedly, some recent data suggest that somatic stem cells isolated from one tissue can also generate cells of heterologous tissues and organs, implying that somatic stem cells have a greater potential for differentiation.
Methods

To explore further the developmental potential of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) we injected cultured NSCs as neurospheres into preimplantation blastocysts and determined the seeding by donor cells in tissues of developing chimeric fetal and adult animals.
Results

We frequently detected progeny of injected NSCs both in embryos and in adult animals. In embryos we observed transient seeding of donor cells to hematopoietic tissues and generation of NSC-derived cells that express globin genes and an erythroid-specific cell-surface marker. In adults progeny of NSCs were mostly detected in neural tissues. The observed low level of chimerism of wild-type NSCs was increased if we injected stem cells expressing a bcl-2 transgene, without changing the seeding pattern.
Conclusion

These results suggest that cultured NSCs, following their injection into blastocysts, generate at mid-gestation erythroid-like cells but later, in adult chimeric mice, engraftment mainly persisted in neural tissues.

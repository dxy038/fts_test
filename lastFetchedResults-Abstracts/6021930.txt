The objective of this paper is to present a multi-media design for manufacturing (DFM) course developed in our university and to emphasize the importance of such interactive courses in relationship with other forms of instruction as students expect today to receive more individualized training. Multi-media instruction offers multiple benefits to education, including a wide range of instructional options and, with adequate instructional design, considerable reduction of the learning time, the time of expert teachers, and when large numbers of students are involved, the cost of learning. The multi-media "DFM" course for design of electronic modules/micro-systems is part of an European project, Elect2eat (E-learning education and continuing training to electronics assembling technology), which is a public, multi-lingual training system. Another European project, mSysTech (E-training microsystems technologies), starts from this multi-media "DFM" course, being focused on the transfer of innovation in the field of micro-systems in Romania and Bulgaria. Its main objective is adapting and implementing the e-learning environment with training materials based on simulations and demonstrations to improve skills in micro-systems technology.

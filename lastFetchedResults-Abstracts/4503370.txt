Considering the feature of intensive node mobility in aviation communication networks, a hop-by-hop network coding algorithm based on Ad Hoc networks is proposed in this paper. A typical network was built in a network simulator, and receiving accuracy rate and receiving delay were collected, to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in scalable networks with different traffic modeling. The simulation results prove that the presented algorithm has better performance in enhancing receiving accuracy rate and shortening receiving delay, compared with traditional networks without network coding. It also applies to both bidirectional and directional traffic flows, and achieves better performance in large-scale networks. Therefore, this algorithm has great potentials in large-scale multi-hop aviation communication networks.

According to concern regarding the growth of these children, this study was carried out to compare height and weight between 5-6-year-old boys with ADHD and those without ADHD in Ahvaz, Iran Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 32 5-6-year-old ADHD boys with the Conners’ rating scale (CRS) of ? 15 were compared to 32 non-ADHD same-age boys with CRS of  <  15. Exclusion criteria were some special disease with negative effect on growth and psychostimulant treatment. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) curves were used to determine the growth status. Results: Comparison between ADHD and non-ADHD boys regarding mean height (111.95 ± 6.12 vs. 110.77 ± 6.22 cm), weight (19.39 ± 3.65 vs. 19.19 ± 3.75), and body mass index (15.44 ± 1.82 vs. 15.54 ± 1.67) showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Our study does not support an association between problems in growth outcomes and ADHD in 5-6 years old boys

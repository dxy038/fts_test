This paper describes an objective quality measure for image sequences based on a model of the human visual system (HVS). When developing an appropriate HVS based model it is important to consider the structure of the pictures and of the coding errors introduced by the compression scheme. This is because they are both unlike the simple and artificial stimuli used in psychophysical tests to obtain HVS parameters. An analysis of the important features of coded pictures is given, and a perceptual quality model incorporating these features is described. Additional uses of a multi-dimensional quality measure are also discussed

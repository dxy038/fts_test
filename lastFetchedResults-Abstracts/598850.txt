Problem statement: The advancements in machine tools to maximize the production by increasing spindle speeds have caused vibration in machine tools. The two functional requirements of machine tool bed for machine tools are high structural stiffness and high damping, which cannot be satisfied simultaneously if conventional metallic materials such as cast iron are employed. Hence there is a need to replace cast iron with alternate materials. Approach: The objective of this study is to improve the stiffness, natural frequency and damping capability of machine tool bed using a composite material containing welded steel and polymer concrete. Welded steel material has high stiffness but low damping and polymer concrete has high damping but low stiffness. So in this study, a machine tool bed made of sandwich structures of welded steel and polymer concrete is designed and manufactured. Modal and static analyses were conducted numerically and experimentally to determine the modal frequencies, damping ratio, deformation and strain. Results: The results at first mode showed that the natural frequency improved by 24.7% and damping ratio was 2.7 times higher than cast iron. The comparison of strain and deformation also showed significant improvement. Conclusion: This study proposed a hybrid welded steel bed as a replacement for cast iron as a machine tool bed material and the results showed that the static and dynamic characteristics were superior to cast iron.

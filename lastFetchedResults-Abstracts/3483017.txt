A noncontact power feeding and data-transmission system for an underwater sensor installed at an ocean observation mooring buoy is proposed. Magnetic properties of the proposed system are evaluated with the use of software package ELF/MAGIC. We have experimentally confirmed that sufficient power of about 180 mW can be supplied to the sensors and bidirectional signal transmission between sensors and the water-surface located buoy can be accomplished

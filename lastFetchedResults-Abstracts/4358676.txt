In this paper, some of the lamp models proposed to date are reviewed. The way to obtain easily a very simple model, valid for the design process is shown. The objective is to make possible ballast design, minimizing the number of previous tests on the lamp, by using the available manufacturer data in order to obtain the behavior of the lamp with the best accuracy possible for the design stage. The limits of the approximation are then considered, and the criteria in order to obtain a robust design against variations of the lamp behavior due to environmental conditions, aging, or operation stage are shown

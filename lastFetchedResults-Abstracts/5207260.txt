This work presents a strategy to track and describe the boundary of an environmental surface using a sequence of incomplete boundary images coming from an UAV with a camera onboard. The algorithm uses all captured images to feed the trajectory, which drives the UAV towards the next point to take the next shot, until the identification is completed. The multiple patterns of the input image make the problem difficult. Our approach orders the points of the image to identify the existent edges, and computes the trajectory as a minimization problem using a multi-objective function that gathers information about the boundary and the polynomial that fit in these edges.

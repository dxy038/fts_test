We present objective measurements of source-to-ear responses obtained in a previously established human echolocation experimental paradigm. We identify the auditory cues that allow humans to perform echolocation tasks in that specific scenario and we discuss the salience of those cues with respect to more complex scenarios. This work allows us to formulate an experimental protocol for conducting more detailed and informative subjective listening test experiments in human echolocation.

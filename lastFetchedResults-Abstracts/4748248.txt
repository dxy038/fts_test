A hybrid system of cellular mode and the peer-to-peer (P2P) mode is considered in this paper, where the cellular uplink resource is reused by the P2P transmission. In the objective of overall system throughput maximization, we addresses the problem of distributed power control of P2P transmission in the hybrid system model. Some preliminary results of the problem are presented first to investigate the optimal solution of the problem. Based on these results, by applying the game theory approach, that is, potential game, an asynchronously distributed power control scheme is devised. The associated properties of the proposed scheme are analyzed, including the global convergence, the conditional optimality and the Lyapunov stability. In the end, simulation is conducted to study the performance of the proposed scheme, which shows satisfying results.

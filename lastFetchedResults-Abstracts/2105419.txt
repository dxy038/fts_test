Objective (s): To translate and evaluate the the myocardial infarction dimensional assessment scale (MIDAS), as a disease-specific quality of life scale in patients with myocardial infarction in Iran. 
Methods: After permission, the questionnaire was translated. Then face validity, content validity, concurrent validity and criterion validity were assessed. In order to evaluate the construct validity, known-groups comparison (patients with and without smoking) was performed. For criterion validity the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used. Cronbach's alpha coefficients and the test retest were used to assess the scale reliability.  
Results: One hundred patients with myocardial infarction participated in the study. The criterion validity showed high and significant correlation between most the MIDAS and the SF-36 scores. The Cronbachâ€™s alpha for the scale ranged from 0.74 to 0.887 and test-retest reliability (ICC) within 2 weeks, in all dimensions was greater than 0. 90.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that the MIDAS is a valid and reliable disease-specific scale and can be considered for measuring health outcomes in research and clinical settings.

Data integration between various systems of complex product manufacturing enterprises and the resource management issues are the focus of the attention of the management sectors. To solve the problem, the ship manufacturing, for example, this paper detailed analyzing the characteristics of its data storage and description, and according to the MOF element model mechanism, using rule-based routes to extract management elements metadata that can standardize swap data and carry management elements information. We also combined static data and dynamic management needs, under the combination of subjective and objective to semantic similarity algorithm of computing the semantic similarity of two concepts, given the ideas and detailed extraction method of management elements metadata. The metadata not only effectively carried data semantic and structural information, laid a solid foundation for the integration of heterogeneous data.

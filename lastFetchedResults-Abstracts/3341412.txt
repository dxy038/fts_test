Today, software systems tend to be split into multiple components that can operate, both, autonomously and in a networked way, in order to pursue a common objective. Such a polymorph approach to system architectures requires novel specification techniques. A system-of-systems conceptualization enables addressing emergent behavior, while letting the involved components and systems operate independently of each other. This property requires system interoperability and can be achieved by bigraph-based modeling. A flexible abstraction mechanism as well as a strong typing of system interaction enable system interoperability in evolutionary environments. Consequently, the composition and decomposition of bigraph-based models support the emergence of novel behavior. We evaluate the potential of this approach based on its capability to represent system-of-systems according to the distinguishing characteristics proposed by Boardman and Sauser as well as by orchestrating two independent systems.

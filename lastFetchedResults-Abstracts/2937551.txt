Objective methods for analysing the performance of SAR segmentation algorithms, in terms of segment homogeneity, are discussed. Tests are based on the segmentations generated by two algorithms, RWSEG and ANNEAL, of an ERS-1 image of an agricultural scene. Homogeneity is assessed using the coefficient of variation of segments and the ratio of the original and segmented images. The relation between these approaches and the effect of segment size are discussed. The measures of homogeneity which are derived correspond to the results of a visual comparison

Modular robots needs networking for coordination and it is particularly true for MEMS micro robots. A promising communication technology is nanowireless networking which could be integrated directly into MEMS micro robots, in our case, the catoms of the Claytronics project. A first step towards this objective is to design a wireless simulator able to deal with modular robots. This simulator called Vouivre is integrated in DPRSim a modular robot simulator developed by Intel Research. This paper describes Vouivre and its integration in DPRSim which is an interesting case of integrating different timelines in one simulator. Experiments validate our design and show the interest of using wireless communication in modular robots.

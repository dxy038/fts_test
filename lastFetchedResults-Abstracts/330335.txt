Abstract
Objective. To evaluate a method for the assessment of the consistency of unset resin composite.

Methods. Fourteen commercial resin composites were selected, which had a range of consistencies as assessed subjectively. The material was placed in a cylindrical mold with 8 mm diameter and 8 mm depth, and a glass rod with 4.37 mm diameter driven into the composite at 24.4 mm min−1 for 6 s, i.e., to a depth of 2.44 mm. The maximum force reached during the 6 s period was recorded, and used as a measure of consistency.

Results. Consistency values ranged from 0.33 N to 31.3 N, with the highest values being found for some of the recently introduced ‘packable' materials. The reliability of the test was high.

Significance. The test may be useful as a standard method of assessing resin composite consistency.

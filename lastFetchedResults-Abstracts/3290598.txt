This paper presents a user study on an implemented Internet-based teleoperation robot named TeleBot. The objectives of the study were to: a) test the usability of TeleBot, b) compare two commonly used devices to control TeleBot, and c) understand further development and requirement of TeleBot by examining how operators use TeleBot to complete a specific task. A task-oriented user study that included navigating TeleBot to a specific location and use TeleBotÂ´s arm to touch a &#8220;X&#8221; marking placed on the door, was designed. Eight participants performed the same task using two different types of device. Both objective and subjective data were collected during the study. The results indicated that a) TeleBot demonstrated a certain level of usability; b) showed that the gamepad was slightly easier to use for teleoperation and finally c) deduced further developmental area for TeleBot.

Owing to the complexity and uncertainty of the risk factors of electric power communication network, as well as the fuzziness of data, it has given the risk evaluation method of the electric power communication network based on compatibility rough-fuzzy set after analyzing the problem. The risk evaluation model of the electric power transmission network has established, and after analyzing the actual data using this method, the possibilities of each compatibility class belonging to the different decision-making class are determined and objective risk evaluation rules are obtained. The results indicate that this method is effective and feasible, and it has certain guiding sense to risk management.

The mission reliability of a multiple working mode system is subject to the changes of working modes adopted during phases of different missions, which can be improved through optimization of the working mode strategies under different system states. In this paper, a computing method is proposed for the mission reliability and the mission cost of a multiple working mode system within the planned time. Then, an optimization model for the mission reliability is put forward with the system working mode as its strategic variability, mission reliability as its optimization objective and mission cost for its constraint. Furthermore, the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model are testified through a case study.

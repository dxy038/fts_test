This paper examines the use of eigenvector orientation method to detect the onset of subsonic and supersonic flutter of panels modeled by finite elements. The accuracy of the eigenvector orientation method for prediction of the flutter boundary (indicated by a gradual loss of orthogonality between two eigenvectors) is demonstrated by using the examples of a swept-back cantilever plate model at subsonic speed and a simply supported plate model at supersonic speed. Piezoelectric layers are assumed to be bonded to the top and bottom surfaces of the simply supported plate in order to provide bending moments to control motions of each finite element. An approach of optimal control design is presented to actively suppress the possible flutter based on linear quadratic regulator theory and the nonlinear modal equations of motions. To illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of using the piezoelectric layers as controllers, several cases are studied and presented. The effects of varying locations of control moments are studied so as to fulfill the objective of adjusting the flutter speed to be within a desirable range. The results illustrate that the control moment manipulation can offset the flutter occurrence and additionally generate a lead time for possibly executing flutter control.

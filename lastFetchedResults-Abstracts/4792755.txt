In the reference of ISO/IEC 9126 software quality model, this article establishes a comprehensive evaluation system of the software dependability. At the same time, it uses the concept of entropy to combine subjective weights and the entropy of objective weights to determine the weight values of measurements in the evaluation system. On this basis, take advantage of the trapezoidal-semi-trapezoidal which is used to depict the degree of membership in the fuzzy mathematics to divide software dependability and put forward a detailed dependability evaluation process and method based on fuzzy mathematics evaluation. Preliminary experimental results show that software dependability evaluation system based on fuzzy mathematics theory is convenient and practical. The factor weights determined by an objective entropy values and the expertÂ´s subjective weights combine the subjective and objective factors. The results of evaluation is objective, rational and more effective to reflect the current level of dependability. It lays the groundwork to the study of software dependability evaluation.

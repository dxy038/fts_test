The effect evaluation of chemical emergency response plans before implementation is an important research topic. Most researchers focus on the evaluation of chemical objective process and ignore the impact of human behaviors on the emergency response process. In order to study the uncertainties of human behaviors, a dynamic evaluation method of emergency response plans based on ACP (Artificial system, Computational Experiments, Parallel Execution) is presented in this paper. A model indicating the logic interactive relationship between chemical equipments and human is constructed by using hierarchical Petri nets. The emergency response reliability of people with different attributes is obtained by conducting computational experiments. And the significant attributes of reliability is analyzed through the orthogonal experimental design. The method provides feasibility for the comprehensive evaluation of chemical emergency response plans.

Emperor Jones in O'Niell's play passes through a terrible night in which he confronts with himself. Reviewing his actions, Jones is caught by revolutionaries. In his short reign, he was dependent on a spell that had captured him and his people. This delusion is what captures Macbeth's mind, too.

The objective is to see how different cultures comment on the fate of tyrants.

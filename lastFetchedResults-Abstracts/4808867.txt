Micro sourcing to generate income is an economic initiative that offers opportunities to people outside the traditional workforce and those with low household income level. Under Digital Malaysia, micro sourcing industry has been identified as a potential industry to uplift the income of the population in the bottom 40 percent household income (B40). The B40 in Malaysia is defined as household income level of less than RM 2,300 per month. The huge potential impacts of micro sourcing industry provide motivation for this research. Thus, the objective of the paper is to develop a full awareness of the situation through Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis in helping with both strategic planning and decision-making. A workshop was held to gather information from stakeholders and to discuss on the internal Strength and Weakness and the external Opportunity and Threat of micro sourcing. The findings from the SWOT analysis will provide perspective, and will reveal connections and areas for action. The analysis will also build on the strengths, minimize the weaknesses, seize opportunities and counteracts threats.

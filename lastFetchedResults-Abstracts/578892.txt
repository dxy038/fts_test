Objective: This study was designed to investigate the antinociceptive effect of curcumin in diabetic rats by using the formalin and hot tail immersion tests. 
Methods: Wistar rats were divided into the following six groups:  control; curcumin-treated control (50 mg/kg); diabetic; sodium salicylate (SS)-treated diabetic; and two curcumin-treated diabetic groups (10 and 50 mg/kg). Curcumin was administered seven days after streptozotocin injection for a total of five weeks. 
Results: High-dose curcumin treatment of diabetic rats reduced the pain score in both acute and chronic phases of the formalin test (p < 0.05). SS-treated diabetic rats had a reduction in pain score only in the chronic phase of the formalin test (p < 0.05). In the hot tail immersion test, diabetic rats showed a significant reduction in tail flick latency compared to the control group (p < 0.01). High-dose curcumin treated diabetic rats showed significantly increased latency relative to untreated diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Diabetic rats also showed a significant increase in the tissue level of malondialdehyde (MDA; p < 0.01). High-dose curcumin treated diabetic rats had a significantly reduced level of MDA (p < 0.05). 
Conclusion: Chronic administration of curcumin could attenuate the nociceptive score in both the acute and chronic phases of the formalin test in a streptozotocin-induced experimental model of diabetes mellitus and increase thermal pain threshold. The beneficial effect of curcumin is partly attributed to attenuation of lipid peroxidation in the periphery.

If infectious medical waste is not recycled appropriately, it will be harmful to the environment and human health. So it has drawn the societyÂ´s attention. From the perspective of system optimization, the integrated optimization problem of locating the centralized disposal facility, controlling the inventory of infectious medical waste, and scheduling the routes of collection vehicles is studied according to the characteristics of recycling infectious medical waste. A multi-period location-routing-inventory problem (LRIP) with fuzzy volume of recyclable medical waste is developed to minimize the total system cost and transportation risk. And a two-phase heuristic algorithm is also proposed to solve the model. The results of a numerical example show that the integrated optimization of the fuzzy multi-objective LRIP is helpful to enhance the management efficiency and reduce the transportation risk in recycling infectious medical waste.

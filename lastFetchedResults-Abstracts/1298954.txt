Advanced oxidation processes like Fenton and photo-Fenton have been effectively applied to oxidize the persistent
organic compounds in solid waste leachate and convert them to unharmful materials and products. However, there
are limited data about application of Fenton-like process in leachate treatment. Therefore, this study was designed
with the objective of treating municipal landfill leachate by Fenton, Fenton-like and photo–Fenton processes to
determine the effect of different variables, by setting up a pilot system. The used leachate was collected from a
municipal unsanitary landfill in Qaem-Shahr in the north of Iran. Fenton and Fenton-like processes were conducted
by Jar-test method. Photo-Fenton process was performed in a glass photo-reactor. In all processes, H2O2 was used
as the oxidant. FeSO4.7H2O and FeCl3.6H2O were used as reagents. All parameters were measured based on
standard methods. The results showed that the optimum concentration of H2O2 was equal to 5 g/L for the
Fenton-like process and 3 g/L for the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. The optimum ratio of H2O2: Fe+2/Fe+3
were equal to 8:1 in all processes. At optimum conditions, the amount of COD removal was 69.6%, 65.9% and
83.2% in Fenton, Fenton-like and photo–Fenton processes, respectively. In addition, optimum pH were 3, 5 and 3
and the optimum contact time were 150, 90 and 120 minutes, for Fenton, Fenton-like and photo–Fenton
processes, respectively. After all processes, the biodegradability (BOD5/COD ratio) of the treated leachate was
increased compared to that of the raw leachate and the highest increase in BOD5/COD ratio was observed in the
photo-Fenton process. The efficiency of the Fenton-like process was overally less than Fenton and photo-Fenton
processes, meanwhile the Fenton-like process was at higher pH and did not show problems

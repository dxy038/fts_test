This paper introduces a novel technique for Metal Artefact Reduction (MAR) in the previously unconsidered context 3D CT baggage imagery. The output of a conventional sinogram completion-based MAR approach is refined by imposing an upper limit on the intensity of the corrected images and by performing post-filtering using the non-local means filter. Furthermore, performance is evaluated using a novel quantitative analysis technique, using the ratio of noisy 3D SIFT detection points identified, as well as a standard qualitative comparison (visual quality). The objective of the quantitative analysis is to evaluate the impact of MAR on the application of computer vision techniques for automatic object recognition. The study yields encouraging results in both the qualitative and quantitative analyses. The proposed method yields a significant improvement in performance when compared to algorithms based on linear interpolation and reprojection-reconstruction; especially in terms of reducing the occurrence of new artefacts in the corrected images. The results serve as a strong indication that MAR will aid human and computerised analyses of 3D CT baggage imagery for transport security screening.

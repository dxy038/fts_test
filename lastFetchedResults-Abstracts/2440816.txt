Based on the inherent capability of automatic modulation classification (AMC), a new spectrum sensing method is proposed in this paper that can detect all forms of primary users’ signals in a cognitive radio environment. The study presented in this paper focuses on the sensing of some combined analog and digitally primary modulated signals. In achieving this objective, a combined analog and digital automatic modulation classifier was developed using an artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN classifier was combined with a GNU Radio and Universal Software Radio Peripheral version 2 (USRP2) to develop the Cognitive Radio Engine (CRE) for detecting primary users’ signals in a cognitive radio environment. The detailed information on the development and performance of the CRE are presented in this paper. The performance evaluation of the developed CRE shows that the engine can reliably detect all the primary modulated signals considered. Comparative performance evaluation carried out on the detection method presented in this paper shows that the proposed detection method performs favorably against the energy detection method currently acclaimed the best detection method. The study results reveal that a single detection method that can reliably detect all forms of primary radio signals in a cognitive radio environment, can only be developed if a feature common to all radio signals is used in its development rather than using features that are peculiar to certain signal types only.

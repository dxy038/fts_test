In this paper, an novel fuzzy controller is proposed to obtain a collecting main pressure stable for the collecting main pressure control in coke oven with unbalanced loadings, multi-parameters, nonlinearities, and disturbances. The fuzzy control system consists of several fuzzy pressure controllers for collecting pipeline pressures and blast fans speed, and a feed-forward decoupling control unit for the disturbance in the collecting main pressure control system. In the fuzzy controller, several fuzzy pressure controllers are regulated by close-loop control loop. Each fuzzy pressure controller uses feedback control to minimize the pressure error in the loop, and the decoupling controller uses fuzzy technique to compensate the interactions in the collecting main pressure control system. The decoupling controller predicts the disturbance amongst the control parameters, and modifies the compensation of the fuzzy pressure controllers. The experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy controller can effectively achieve the objective of collecting main pressure stable in the requirement range with high load.

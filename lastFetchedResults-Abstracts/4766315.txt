In this work we propose Multi-Objective Artificial Bee Colony for solving multi objectives problems. This algorithm is applied on a base case cogeneration optimization problem with two-objective functions named the modified CGAM problem. The first objective function is exergetic efficiency that should be maximized. The second objective function is the total cost rate that should be minimized. then the effects of more important parameters such as: equivalence ratio, NO<sub>x</sub>emission and unit cost of fuel will be investigated on the exergetic and economic performance of the system.

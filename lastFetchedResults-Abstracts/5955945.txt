The paper concerns with an induction machine that operates with one stator phase open and with the stator winding neutral connected to the centre of a bank of DC-link capacitors after the converter reconfiguration due to a failure in the supplying inverter. This reconfiguration allows the drive to continue in operation and prevents the driven equipment from damage. In this case a zero-sequence component of stator currents can arise. It relates to the third space harmonic of the current layer along the air gap. The method of symmetrical components is employed to describe the system, which enables higher space harmonics to be taken into account. It is shown that the third harmonics of the current layer and of the magnetic flux in the yoke may have significant effect on the properties and behavior of the induction machine under these circumstances. The main objective of this work is to derive the mathematical description and develop a numerical model of the system under investigation. The correct function of the developed model has been verified by comparing the results obtained in numerical simulation with the results obtained in experiments.

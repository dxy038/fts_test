With the aging population trends in developed countries, there is an increased expectation of the application of assistive robots. A variety of robots have been developed to address this challenge. Although there are many technical problems to be solved, the lack of objective evaluation indexes for evaluating the benefit to the users is one of the important problems to be addressed before the commercialization of the assistive robots can be realized. The ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) is a classification of the health components of functioning and disability, and is being utilized in medical, healthcare, and welfare fields. The ICF has a basic framework to evaluate healthcare and welfare equipment, including robots, and it will be the basis of the evaluation indexes for assistive robots. In this paper, we present the development of evaluation indexes, and provide the results of preliminary experiments which were conducted using iARM and RAPUDA robots performing a certain lifting task. The experiments illustrate the issues involved in the development of ICF-based indexes for assitive robots.

This study applies fractal theory into the system integration of service enterprise, and proposes the concept named SOA-based service integration. Through analyzing the fractal characteristics of service integration, this article proves the applicability of fractal theory to the service integration based on three main reasons. Through the establishment of the layered model of service integration structure, we propose several key points during the implementation of service integration to utilize fractal theory. In this article, we talk about three aspects to achieve fractal management of SOA-based service integration. With the principle of similarity, service-integrated enterprises should construct layered fractal units to adapt to overall objective and environmental changes. After the fractal units constructed, they can try to gain dynamic adaptive capability to adapt to mutable environment via intercommunion and elicitation, collaboration, and reconfiguration of fractal cells, so that the service enterprises can respond to future in definition rapidly and make changes immediately.

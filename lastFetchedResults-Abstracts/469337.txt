Objective
This study was designed to assess the opinions and understanding of patients about hormone replacement therapy (HRT) since the release of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) HRT trial data, which was widely publicized in the lay press.
Methods
All patients between the ages of 45 and 65 years seen in the last 3 years in the University of Florida Women's Clinics were mailed a survey asking about their attitudes and perceptions of HRT.
Results
A total of 6468 surveys were mailed with the return of 1076 completed surveys (16.6%); 78% of the respondents were menopausal and 65% had taken HRT. Of the women taking HRT, 70% stated it was for symptom relief and 30% for long-term benefits, including protection from heart disease (10%), Alzheimer's (4%), and osteoporosis (16%). Attitude changes about HRT since the release of WHI results were reported in 42% of respondents. Women currently on HRT had a more positive view of therapy (88%) compared with respondents overall (58%). Despite a great deal of media attention given to the topic of HRT, many women dramatically overestimated the risks of HRT, with 31% believing HRT increases the risk of heart disease 10% to 30% per year and 53% believing HRT increases the risk of breast cancer 10% to 30% per year. Despite this overestimation of risks, only 35% of respondents would not recommend HRT to a friend.
Conclusion
This study suggests that WHI results did not impact attitudes about HRT in the majority of women taking HRT, as they were usually on therapy for relief of menopausal symptoms. However, there is a great need for consumer education about the attributable risks of HRT, approximately 1 per 1000 per year for heart disease, stroke, DVT, and breast cancer, so they can better weigh the benefits of HRT versus the risks.

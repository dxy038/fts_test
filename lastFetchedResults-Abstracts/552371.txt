Introduction: Allergic inflammation in upper airways can act as a predisposing factor for infectious ear diseases. There are some evidences about the role of allergic rhinitis (AR) in chronic otitis media with effusion, but its role in establishing Chronic Supportive Otitis Media (CSOM) has not been clearly shown.

Objective: To assess the relationship between allergic rhinitis and CSOM in patients referring to Amiralmomenin hospital, Rasht, Iran

Materials and Methods: 61 adult patients with established CSOM were considered as case group and 58 patients with minor head and neck trauma as control group, they were evaluated for the presence of allergic rhinitis. All case and control group were over 15 years old and underwent skin prick test for 23 common regional aeroallergens. Allergic rhinitis was defined with positive symptoms and signs of AR and positive skin prick test.

Results: Allergic rhinitis was diagnosed in 15(26.20%) and 8 (13.80%) of patients and controls, respectively (P=0.065).By logistic regression equation after corroding the age factor and the difference between two groups became significant (x2=0.026, OR=3.27, CI=1.15 - 6.57). Indoor allergens, especially mites and molds, were the most prevalent allergens among both groups, but Outdoor allergens like grass pollen have a low prevalence. Conclusion: The prevalence of AR in the CSOM patients is more than the controls.

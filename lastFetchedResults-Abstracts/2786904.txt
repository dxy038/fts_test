Patent litigation has become an important strategic instrument through which firms exercise their patent rights, reflecting competition and conflicts between R&amp;D contenders.

Therefore, the objective of this paper is to investigate the patents that Non-Practicing Entities would be interested in, the characteristics of patents that they would consider valuable, and the difference between patents under litigation or not.

This paper presents a dynamic programming methodology for finding the optimum preventive maintenance schedule of generating units in a deregulated power system. The objective function is to maintain the units as earlier as possible. Various constraints such as spinning reserve, duration of maintenance and maintenance crew are being taken into account. In a case study, using the power system of [1] with six generating units, and implying dynamic programming, we obtain one optimum solution and seven other feasible solutions.

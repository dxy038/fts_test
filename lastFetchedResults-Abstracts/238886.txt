The objective of this work was to provide a method of predicting important parameters (composting time, highest temperature, final and lowest pH values, cumulative CO2 evolution, and percentages of material losses) that characterized the composting process of synthetic food waste in terms of weight fractions of protein and fat. Experimental results showed that final products of all 12 experimental runs passed multiple maturity tests. Quadratic equations obtained by the multi-regression analysis were also developed for quick estimation. The models were tested for real kitchen waste and the agreements between experimental and predicted results were fair.

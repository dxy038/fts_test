Numerical climate models such as Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) are nowadays among the one of the most computationally demanding applications. Climate and weather research experiments performed with models such as WRF are complex tasks because of modelsÂ´ requirements. In order to manage that, we are going to develop a scientific gateway called WRF4SG to cover WRF users needs to manage climate and weather research experiments. The main objective of this work is to establish how WRF4SG is going to assist WRF users in their experiments.

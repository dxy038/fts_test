"Software technology" will provide concise, hands-on information on hot software technologies early in their life cycle. Its objective is to promote sharing of technology experiences from a user perspective. We\´ll look at promising software components, technologies, and development tools and ask questions about their maturity, applications, readiness, and business cases. Early adopter experience will be highlighted, including how to deal with conflicting product development standards. Our vision is to interpret the software technology hype cycle and provide down-to-earth, useful information for practitioners. The inaugural column is on GUI programming for Microsoft Windows. Although this topic isn\´t new-we\´ve struggled with it for decades-both Windows and its supporting GUI technologies are changing.

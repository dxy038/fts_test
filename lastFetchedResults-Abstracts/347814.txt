Objective: Muscle pain is known to influence muscle activity but the details of its effects on the mechanical properties of single motor units (SMU) have not been described. We have recently reported a decreased firing rate of SMU in the human masseter muscle during painful contractions with a constant force output. Force output can be modulated by the SMU discharge rate in relation to the contractile properties of SMU. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to measure the mechanical properties of SMU in the masseter to clarify the mechanism which underlies the decrease in SMU firing rate during jaw-muscle pain.
Methods: A spike-triggered averaging (STA) technique was used to determine the mechanical properties of low-threshold SMU in the masseter muscle recorded with fine wire electrodes during a voluntary isometric contraction. The twitch amplitude, contraction time, and half-relaxation time were determined from the averaged force records before and during experimental jaw-muscle pain induced by injection of 0.2 ml (100 Î¼g/ml) capsaicin in 8 healthy subjects. Injections of 0.2 ml isotonic saline served as a non-painful control in 11 healthy subjects.
Results: The twitch amplitude was significantly increased during capsaicin-evoked muscle pain (P<0.001) without significant changes of half-relaxation time and contraction time. No significant changes in SMU twitch properties were observed during the control injections.
Conclusions: Potentiation of twitch force could be a possible compensatory mechanism to maintain a constant force output during painful isometric contractions when SMU firing decreases. This finding therefore provides new information on the adaptation of motor function by muscle pain.

The description of the planetary magnetic anomalies is a difficult task that combines either aeromagnetic or in-situ magnetic field measurements, and further laboratory characterization of the local rocks. In the case of extraterrestrial planets this is a very difficult and costly task. With the objective to develop predictive algorithms prior to in-situ measurements, two complimentary lines of work have been undertaken: 1) characterization of magnetic minerals which occur in great abundance in extraterrestrial crusts; and 2) development of finite element method models (FEM) using the properties of these minerals to model possible scenarios and the variation of their magnetic behavior with temperature and temperature gradient swings on the superficial layers of the planets. The ultimate objective is the future comparison between the measurements developed by instruments on board Martian landers and rovers and the developed models.

Objective (s): The aim of this study was to assess educational environments of outpatient clinics in teaching hospitals affiliated to a medical university in Tehran, Iran.
Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in four clinics (internal medicine, gynecology, pediatric and surgery) of teaching hospitals by an ACLEEM questionnaire. Data were analyzed by performing correlation, t-test, and ANOV.
Results: In all 157 residents participated in the study. The total means score was 110.9 out of 200 indicating that residents were positive (according the interpretation guide of the ACLEEM). There were significant differences between male and female residents on information, communication and technology domain scores. In addition we found that there were significant differences among teaching hospitals on 4 domains: Quality of Clinical Teachers, Protected Time for Non-Clinical Activities, Information, Communication & technology, and Clinical supervision.
Conclusion: The overall results showed that residents were positive about teaching environment. Thus, it is recommended that the focus in teaching hospitals should be on factors that make positive influence on residentsâ€™ evaluation.

The objective is to demonstrate a new approach for approximating the free space radiation pattern of an antenna, through the non-anechoic environment data. The key point of this method is to describe the non-anechoic environment using the impulse response of it both in time and angular domain. And the free space radiation pattern can then be extracted through further processing of the measured data. Examples have been presented in this work to show it as a useful alternative to widely used classical methods.

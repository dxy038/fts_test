Objective: Our purpose was to analyze our experience with cephalhematomas detected prenatally by ultrasonography. Study Design: Seven cases of cephalhematomas were identified prenatally among 16,292 fetuses having comprehensive ultrasonographic examinations between 1993 and 1996. The course of pregnancy and the neonatal outcome were reviewed in each case. Results: Cephalhematomas appeared as an echogenic bulge posterior to the occipital region (5 cases) or at the temporal region of the fetal head (2 cases). Conclusion: Cephalhematomas, which are believed to be a result of operative delivery, can also originate, in utero, antepartum. Premature rupture of membranes appears to be an associated factor.

We focus on the design and implementation of a new model of trust based on the formalizations of reputation, self-esteem, and similarity within an agent. We universalize reputation through the use of values found within all multiagent systems. The following values are manifested within multiagent systems: responsibility, honesty, independence, obedience, ambition, helpfulness, capability, knowledgability, and cost-efficiency. Manifestations of these values lead to a more universalized approach to formalizing reputation. This new model of trust is examined within the context of an e-commerce framework. It is analyzed with respect to stability, scalability, accuracy in attaining e-commerce objectives, and general effectiveness in discouraging untrustworthy behavior. Based on the experiments, the model is scalable and stable dependent upon the agent population of buyers and sellers. It achieves its primary objective of discouraging untrustworthy behavior as measured through the acceleration of Gross Domestic Product growth over time.

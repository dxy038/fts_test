This paper presents a method for quality control by bank placement based on an optimal control theory and the finite element method. The shallow water equation is employed for the analysis of the flow condition and the advection-diffusion equation is used for the analysis of pollutant concentration. The optimal control theory is utilized to obtain a control value for the objective state value. The shear-slip mesh update method which is suitable for the rotational problem of body is employed. To solve the optimization problem, the time domain decomposition method is applied as a technique of storage requirements reduction. The Sakawa-Shindo method is employed as a minimization technique. The Crank-Nicolson method is applied to the temporal discretization. A method for optimal control of bank placement has been presented.

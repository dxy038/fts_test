The process of designing a set of good DNA sequences is an essential problem and one of the most practical and important research topics in DNA-based computing and the DNA nanotechnology area. In this field of research, a DNA sequence design problem is defined as a multi-objective problem, and it is evaluated using four objective functions, h-measure, similarity, continuity and hairpin. In addition, two constraints, GC content and melting temperature (Tm), are used to maintain uniform chemical characteristics of the sequences. In the authorsÂ´ previous research, an ant colony system (ACS) was proposed to solve the DNA sequence design problem based on nearest neighbour. The Watson-Crick base pair &#916;Go37 was used as the distance between nodes for the thermodynamic parameters in the problem models for the heuristic approach in the ACS algorithms. In the current study, a non-heuristic approach and four new models using the heuristic approach are proposed, and results from the models are compared.

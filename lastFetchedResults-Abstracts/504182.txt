The objective of this study was to fit a hydrothermal
germination model to germination data for a seedlot of
radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don). Seeds were
incubated for 50 d at constant temperatures and water
potentials (T ¼ 12.5–32.58C,C ¼ 0 to 21.2MPa). Most
seeds completed germination within 50 d, but for low C
and/or non-optimal temperatures (T , 17.58C,
T . 258C) many seeds did not complete germination.
In general, germination data conformed to the hydrothermal
model. Departures from the model were
encountered for slow-germinating seeds at suboptimal
temperatures (T # 208C). To account for these departures,
two alternative hydrothermal models were fitted
with an additional term for an upwards shift in seed base
water potential with increasing time to germination. The
alternativemodelsmore correctly predicted germination
time than the original model. Similarly, reduced
percentage germination at supra-optimal temperatures
(T . 208C) was explained by including a term in the
hydrothermal model which shifted the base water
potential of seeds upwards towards zero, which in turn
reduced the predicted rate that hydrothermal time
would be accumulated by seeds. The rate of this
upwards shift in base water potential was dependent on
time to complete germination and ambient water
potential as well as supra-optimal temperature.

We consider a damped sine-Gordon equation with a variable diffusion coefficient. The goal is to derive necessary conditions for the optimal set of parameters minimizing the objective function J. First, we show that the solution map is continuous under a weak assumption on the topology of the admissible set P. Then the solution map is shown to be weakly Gâteux differentiable on P, implying the Gâteux differentiability of the objective function. Finally we show the Fréchet differentiability of J. The optimal set of parameters is shown to satisfy a bang–bang control law.

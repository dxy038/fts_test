One of the significant matters in realm of relationship between morality and
criminal policy is the discussion which revolves around the morality of
punishment application. In criminal policy as well as the public policy, we
observe the practices and approaches in which any purposes justify the
resorting to penal instruments; we can call them penal instrumentalism. In
this essay we are seeking for conceptualization and representation some
indicators for recognizing it between a set of measures of criminal policy.
For this purpose, after making a clear boundary between this concept with
other similar concepts such as populism, consequentialism, utilitarianism,
and pragmatism, we have divided the indicators of an instrument-based
criminal policy into objective and subjective categories. The first, is involved
in resorting to criminal matters as the most accessible instruments,
ignorance of the evident legal principles, and the evident moral principles.
The latter, is involved in intending to achieve a goal, interests or a practical
good, and finally resorting to a quick and easy resolution or relief.

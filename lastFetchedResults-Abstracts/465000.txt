OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the gene expression of ETA and ETB receptors within the different uterine segments of nonpregnant, normal pregnant, and preeclamptic women. STUDY DESIGN: Biopsy samples from the cervix, isthmus, and corpus uteri were obtained from eight nonpregnant, nine term pregnant, and seven preeclamptic women. The concentration of ETA and ETB receptor messenger ribonucleic acid were determined by a solution hybridization technique with complementary ribonucleic acid probes. Results are presented in counts per minute per microgram of total nucleic acid as mean Â± SEM. RESULTS: The expression of messenger ribonucleic acid encoding the ETA receptor was generally higher in the upper than in the lower uterine segment in nonpregnant, normal pregnant, and preeclamptic myometrium, whereas the opposite pattern was seen with regard to ETB. During normal pregnancy the concentrations of ETA receptor messenger ribonucleic acid in the corpus and ETB receptor messenger ribonucleic acid in the isthmus were significantly elevated compared with those in nonpregnant women. This enhanced gene expression was, however, not observed in the preeclamptic group. CONCLUSION: Our finding of segmentally differentiated endothelin receptor gene expression is compatible with a role for endothelin-1 in stimulating uterine contractions through ETA receptors during spontaneous labor and suggests a relaxing effect of the ETB receptor on the myometrium.

Multi-focus fusion is an important technique to integrate focal information from a set of input registered images. In this effort, a novel image fusion algorithm based on multi-scheme is presented. Given an over-complete Gabor dictionary, through matching pursuit signal decomposition algorithm, each source image can be described by sparse combinations of these atoms. Then the coefficients of the fused images are constructed according to different fuse rules. The last experiment results show that our algorithm can achieve better fusion effect than traditional wavelet image fusion method or spatial frequency method, whatever from subjective visual effect or objective metric.

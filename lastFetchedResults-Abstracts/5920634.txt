The objective of this research is to construct aviation logistics network of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region facing to China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (GZARFCAFTA). The gravity model is incorporated in the air nodes evaluation through which the gravitations of both domestic and ASEANpsilas major air nodes to Guangxipsilas major air nodes are calculated, then the gravitations are sorted and nodes of different importance in different aviation logistics network are selected, and eventually the hierarchical aviation logistics network of GZARFCAFTA is constructed by applying the theory of non-strict hub-and-spoken airline network. This research presents a method of designing aviation logistics network combining quantificationally evaluating air nodes and airlines designing, which has important guiding significance for the construction of actual network.

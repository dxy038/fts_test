Built environment has a substantial impact on the economy, society, and the environment. Along with the increasing environmental consideration of the building impacts, the economic assessment of green buildings has gained substantial importance in the construction industry. This paper applies artificial neural network to economic evaluation of green buildings and builds a three-layer green building economic evaluation network model. Based on the Green building economic evaluation index system, this paper collects sample data and uses Matlab to train, stimulate and test the network model which demonstrates the consistency of the last stimulating results and the actual evaluating results. Meanwhile, as an objective and scientific evaluating method, utilizing artificial neural network to do economic evaluation of green buildings can reduce the impact of subjective factors effectively and make the results more objective.

An approximation of NewtonÂ´s method has been used recently in routing algorithms in computer networks, which is based on the assumption that the matrix of second derivatives of the objective function (Hessian) is diagonal. It is demonstrated that in message-switched networks some specific nondiagonal elements exist and therefore the Hessian is not diagonal. Moreover, it is found that these elements are of the same order as the diagonal ones.

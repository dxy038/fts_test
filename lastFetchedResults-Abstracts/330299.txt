Objective: The release of elements from eight types of commonly used dental casting alloys into cell-culture medium was measured over a 10-month period. The release of elements was determined to provide information about the long-term biological risk these alloys may pose to the oral tissues. The current work extends previous studies of shorter time periods, and is more relevant to the in vivo situation, where dental alloys are present intraorally for years.

Method: The alloys were Au-, Ag-, Pd-, and Ni-based with nobilities ranging from 0 to 95 at.%. Alloy samples (n=12) were exposed to cell-culture medium. The medium was changed every 30 days for 10 months. Elemental release into the medium was measured by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Differences in mass release were determined using ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison intervals (α=0.05).

Results: The release of elements continued through 10 months, and it appeared that the release was constant throughout most of the experiment. Higher initial rates were suspected but not verified. Most alloys reached a constant rate after <100 days of exposure to the medium. Long-term element release was not generally intuitive based on the amount of an element in an alloy or the overall nobility of the alloy. Total mass lost over the 10-month period ranged from <2 μg/cm2 for the Au–Pd alloy to 55 μg/cm2 for the Au–Ag–Cu alloy (Tukey interval at α=0.05 was 0.8 μg/cm2). By comparison, pure Cu lost 4500 μg/cm2 during this period.

Significance: Tests which assess biological risk from elemental release must consider longer-term release because elemental release continues for extended periods. Longer-term mass loss from a given alloy is often not intuitive based on its overall composition or noble metal content.

The objective of this work is to study COD and BOD reduction of domestic wastewater using discarded material based mixed adsorbents (mixed adsorbent carbon, MAC and commercial activated carbon, CAC) in batch mode. Under optimum conditions, maximum reduction and maximum COD and BOD reduction achieved using MAC and CAC was 95.87% and 97.45%; and 99.05% and 99.54%, respectively. Results showed that MAC offered potential benefits for COD and BOD removal from wastewater.

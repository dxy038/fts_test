In this paper we describe the design and control of an inverted pendulum type robot on two wheels. The objective of the design is to provide a flexible platform intended for teaching and research, which provides rich opportunities for application of signal processing, control design, distributed control systems and consideration of implementational issues. In addition, a design constraint has been to use low-cost components. Issues such as selection of hardware and sensors, signal processing, modeling and control are treated. Special attention is given to the problem of obtaining high accuracy velocity estimates using analog encoder signals.

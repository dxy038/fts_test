Power supply companies face the risk of economic loss by not managing their assets. Consequently, companies in the sector are attempting to implement systems for managing the life cycle of their most critical assets based series of standards ISO 55000. Among these critical assets are the power lines. In the context of ISO 55000, companies should consider maintenance schemes centered on the condition monitoring, and even on the reliability, methodologies for assessing the risk of their overhead lines, and information systems in which the condition, the operational history, failure reports, executed maintenances, involved cost, etc., are recorded for further analysis. These systems serve to support the decision-making process. As a consequence, the asset manager will be able to decide the most appropriate actions over the overhead lines in order to achieve the objective for which the line was conceived in a manner consistently and sustainable. In this way, it is possible to improve security and reliability of the power system. In this paper, several aspects to be considered when an electric company wants to implement an overhead line management system are exposed.

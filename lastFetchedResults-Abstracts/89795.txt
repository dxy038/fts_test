The Regional Producer Network (RPN) functioned across southern Australia as the primary delivery mechanism of the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) Program for 5 years (1996–2001) and the Harvest Year (2001–2002). It consisted of a network of Producer Committees that provided on-ground organisation to coordinate extension activities in the 11 SGS regions. The operation of the RPN was modelled on a participation mode called Interactive Participation. The main objective was to support the adoption of a large-scale practice change in the high rainfall zone towards more productive, profitable and sustainable grazing systems. Strong producer leadership developed and information exchange improved to achieve a high level of impact on management skills among those producers motivated to improve their grazing operations. The characteristics of Interactive Participation were incorporated into the processes and operation of the RPN. Defined and structured methodologies were used for collective and context-specific learning within the framework of a producer network that encouraged interaction. The strength of Interactive Participation was that producers saw participation as a right and not just a means to achieve the program goal. Each region took control over local decisions including the allocation of available resources. The process engaged all sectors of the program (producers, researchers, management and funders). The experiential extension procedures used systematic and structured learning activities to support producers who were committed to learning, on-farm change and improvement to grazing management. In developing a coordinated approach to their operation, the Producer Committees engaged grazing industry researchers, public and private extension practitioners and community groups. This collaboration strengthened local organisations and developed community confidence in the grazing industries.

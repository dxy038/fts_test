Ultra-High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) is characterized by a unique combination of extremely low permeability, high strength and deformability. Extensive R&D works and applications over the last 10 years have demonstrated that cast on site UHPFRC is a fast, efficient and price competitive method for the repair/rehabilitation of existing structures. More recently, an original concept of ECO-UHPFRC with a high dosage of mineral addition, a low clinker content, and a majority of local components has been applied successfully for the rehabilitation of a bridge in Slovenia. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the global warming impact of bridge rehabilitations with different types of UHPFRC and to compare them to more standard solutions, both on the basis of the bridge rehabilitation performed in Slovenia. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology is used. The analysis shows that rehabilitations with UHPFRC, and even more ECO-UHPFRC, have a lower impact than traditional methods over the life cycle.

Structural performance of driven the central axis for permanent drum magnetic separation was researched. Modeling software Solidworks was applied to establish the model and COSMOS was used to analysis the stress. Objective of this paper was to sum up merits and drawbacks of permanent drum magnetic separation. Based on practical use experience of separator, the central axis was modeled and did stress analysis. Compared with ordinary the choice of a structure, the new design of the central axis structural was optimized. To ensure that the selected operation flow, more reliable, to reduce maintenance and repair of equipment work, lowering operating costs. By modeling analysis, safety factor was up to 1.3, which had meet safety requirements.

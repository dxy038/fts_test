Intelligent and functional textile fibers have attracted interest worldwide due to their high potential applications in electrochromic display, battery or sensors. Polyaniline (PANI) is considered as a promising material among many conductive polymers to adapt on textile structure because of its excellent environmental, thermal and chemical stabilities. The main objective of our research was to obtain the flexible electrical conductive fiber using PANI with polyethylene terephtalate (PET) fiber. Chemical PANI coating on PET yarns were performed by absorption of fiber through Pani-DBSA solution using ´Sol-gel´ processes. The electrical conductivity, morphological and mechanical properties of conductive fibers were investigated. These fibers are supposed to be used in FICC in order to realize data transfer among electrical devices, sensors etc.

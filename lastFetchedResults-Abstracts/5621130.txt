Significant progresses in the area of short-term scheduling of batch processes have been achieved in the pass two decades. The main objective of this paper is to present a review in this challenging area. Based on time representation, existing scheduling approaches are classified into discrete and continuous time formulation and their strengths and limitations are also examined. Furthermore, some applications of the scheduling in the real world are described. Finally, we give the perspective of the short-term scheduling.

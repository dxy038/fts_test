Connection admission control and routing are two important mechanisms in the provision of quality of service (QoS) in IEEE 802.16-based wireless mesh networks. In this paper, we propose a joint admission control and routing scheme for multiple service classes with the objective to maximize the overall revenue from all carried connections. QoS constraints such as handoff dropping probability can be guaranteed. Multiple service classes can be prioritized by imposing different reward rates. We formulate the problem as a decision process, and apply optimization techniques to obtain the optimal admission control policies. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by numerical and simulation results. We show that the proposed joint admission control and routing scheme can produce maximum revenue obtainable by the system under QoS constraints.We also show that the optimal joint admission control policy is a randomized policy, i.e., connections are admitted to the system with some probabilities when the system is in some states.

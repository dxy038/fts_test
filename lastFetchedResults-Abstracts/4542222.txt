This paper has the objective of study the influence of complementary split ring resonator dimensions in an UWB microstrip patch antenna. A good agreement between capacitive effect and the different dimensions used could be observed and an antenna with an effective frequency range filter could be achieved to prevent 802.11a and 802.11n interference, as part of X band frequency.

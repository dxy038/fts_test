Boiler and Turbine control object in thermal power plant is a strongly nonlinear control system. Multi-model method is an effective way to solve the problem of nonlinear. While most multi-model controller have been designed according to the nonlinear strength of boiler-turbine control object without considering economy performance. In this paper, operation economic has been considerate. The operation condition has been classified using thermal power unit history data; then the improved K-means method has been used to get k clusters of the data for the specific operation condition and fuzzy association rule was used to get the target of the data respectively from each cluster. Finally, combined with the non-linear intensity, multi-objective optimization method is used to get the non-linear intensity distribution operating points with higher economic performance, which provides basis for designing the multi-model coordinated control system considering energy-saving and non-linear change-rate.

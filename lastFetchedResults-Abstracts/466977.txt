Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate oral methotrexate tablets in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Study Design: Patients with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy were offered oral methotrexate tablets rather that intramuscular injection. Oral methotrexate was given in 2 divided doses 2 hours apart at a dose of 60 mg/m2 with standard 2.5 mg methotrexate tablets. Patients were followed up with the use of the same protocol that was used typically for intramuscular methotrexate. Results: Nineteen of 22 patients (86%) were successfully treated. There was no statistical difference between patients who were treated successfully or unsuccessfully, with respect to initial human chorionic gonadotropin titers (P= .55), ectopic size (P= .77), or methotrexate dose (P= .18). Nineteen of 22 patients (86%) had increased pain during treatment. Outside of pain, gastrointestinal side effects were the most common. Thirty-two percent of patients required more than one treatment cycle. Conclusion: Oral methotrexate can be used to treat ectopic pregnancy successfully, but there are few advantages to recommend its use over intramuscular methotrexate.

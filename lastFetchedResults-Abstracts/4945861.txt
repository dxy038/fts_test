In this paper, we present a sampling design for the weak signal detection in additive non-Gaussian noise. We employ the theory of spherically invariant random processes (SIRP) to express the non-Gaussian noise. Our approach for the design of sampling schemes is based on the class of Ali-Silvey distance measures. A design objective function for this problem is derived and is maximized to obtain the sampling scheme for the detection problem under consideration. Its detection performance is compared with that of the uniform sampling scheme by means of a numerical example. Comparisons show that our sampling design results in a superior performance

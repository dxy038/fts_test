Introduction: Preterm birth is a complex condition and although its exact causes are still unknown, the risk factors can

change with the seasons. Several hypotheses of how environmental factors may affect the length of gestation have been

suggested. Accordingly, they are usually assumed to act instantaneously at the time of delivery.

Objective: To assess the seasonal variations in the proportion of preterm births in Rasht, northern Iran

Materials and Methods: We performed a descriptive analytic study using 1378-1388 registration data. The study

population comprised 3770 live singleton births born within 20-37 weeks of gestation at Alzahra Maternity Hospital in

Rasht, Guilan.

Results: Out of 62841 deliveries, 3770 cases (5.99%) were preterm births. The highest and the lowest relative frequencies of preterm birth were in summer and autumn (6.65% and 5.34%, respectively) and the relative frequencies of preterm birth in the spring and winter were 5.93% and 6.06%, respectively. As revealed, the proportions of preterm births in Rasht with humid and temperate climate have a clear seasonal pattern with two peaks periodicity, first in summer and second in winter. The relative frequency of preterm birth can change with months of the year significantly (X2 (11) =96.57, P<0.001). The highest and the lowest relative frequencies were in June and October (7.17% and 5.19%, respectively)

Conclusion: Establishing a seasonal pattern of preterm birth can have important implications for the planning of health care services. Developing knowledge about the respective bioenvironmental factors associated with preterm birth can play a critical role in reducing and surveillance of such conditions and the related complications.

The world-wide adoption of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) as the target technology of the broadband integrated service digital network (B-ISDN) has created a lot of interest in the management and control of high speed networks. The issue of virtual path (VP) resource management in an ATM network is still the subject of much consideration in the international standards fora. Rather than police every connection individually, it might be better to police the aggregate traffic stream of all the connections on a VP. To achieve this objective, the paper addresses the problem of dimensioning a jumping window virtual path policer. The results suggest that when services are segregated on separate VPs by their traffic characteristics and target quality of service (QoS), the jumping window can be used effectively to police the superposition of the connections on the VP

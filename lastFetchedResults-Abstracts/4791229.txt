The paper presents the algorithm in robust constrained model predictive control for uncertain piecewise affine with time-invariant state-delay system using saturated linear feedback controller. Polytopic uncertain piecewise affine with time-invariant state-delay system is considered, and polytopic description for saturated function is used in the formulation. The robust performance index is presented based on the modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. An infinite horizon worst-case performance function is used as online optimization objective subject to inputs constraint. The optimization objective is cast as a Linear Matrix Inequalities optimization problem. The feasibility of piecewise affine control law design at the initial sampling time implies the sufficient condition of robust stability of the closed-loop system. The simulation example illustrates that the improved algorithm is suitable and effective.

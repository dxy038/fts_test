Objective
e is a vital tissue that can be changed by physiological and pathological condition. The purpose of this study was to clarify the morphology and permeability of dentine that changed by wearing process.
s
 extracted human molars with enamel attrition and dentine was exposed and 20 intact human extracted third molars that had not reached occlusion were used. Ten teeth per each group were observed under light microscope (LM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Remaining 10 teeth per each group were subjected for evaluation of dentine permeability.
s
LM, the transparent dentine and reactionary dentine were found in the attrition group but were not found in the group unaffected by attrition. When the transparent dentine were examined under the TEM, it was found that dentinal tubules were partially or completely occluded by growth of peritubular dentine or by precipitation of needle-like or rhombohedral crystals in transparent dentine. In reactionary dentine, tubular dentine structures that were comparable to those in secondary physiologic dentine were observed whereas atubular dentine demonstrated occlusion of tubules by high mineral substances or by peritubular dentine under the TEM. Permeability of dentine from worn teeth was less than those from unoccluded teeth significantly.
sion
 in dentine by wear resulted in the formation of reactionary dentine and transparent dentine that illustrated various types and degrees of tubular occlusion. These decrease the dentine permeability.

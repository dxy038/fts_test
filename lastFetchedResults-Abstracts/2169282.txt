The relatively high prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat (RTE) turkey products is of great concern. The overall objective of this study was to develop antimicrobial edible coating formulations to effectively control the growth of this pathogen. The antimicrobials studied were nisin (500 IU/g), Novagard CB 1 (0.25%), Guardian NR100 (500 ppm), sodium lactate (SL, 2.4%), sodium diacetate (SD, 0.25%), and potassium sorbate (PS, 0.3%). These were incorporated alone or in binary combinations into five edible coatings: alginate, κ-carrageenan, pectin, xanthan gum, and starch. The coatings were applied onto the surface of home-style poached and processed deli turkey discs inoculated with ~ 3 log CFU/g of L. monocytogenes. The turkey samples were then stored at 22 °C for 7 days. For poached and processed deli turkey, the coatings were found to be equally effective, with pectin being slightly less effective than the others. The most effective poached turkey treatments seemed to be SL (2.4%)/SD (0.25%) and Nisin (500 IU/g)/SL (2.4%), which yielded final populations of 3.0 and 4.9 log CFU/g respectively compared to the control which was 7.9 log CFU/g. For processed deli turkey, the most effective antimicrobial treatments seemed to be Nisin (500 IU/g)/SD (0.25%) and Nisin (500 IU/g)/SL (2.4%) with final populations of 1.5 and 1.7 log CFU/g respectively compared to the control which was 6.5 log CFU/g. In the second phase of the study, home-style poached and store-purchased roasted (deli) turkey inoculated with the pathogen at a level of ~ 3 log CFU/g were coated with alginate incorporating selected antimicrobial combinations and stored for 8 weeks at 4 °C. Alginate coatings supplemented with SL (2.4%)/PS (0.3%) delayed the growth of L. monocytogenes with final counts reaching 4.3 log CFU/g (home-style poached turkey) and 6.5 log CFU/g (roasted deli turkey) respectively while the counts in their untreated counterparts were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) reaching 9.9 and 7.9 log CFU/g, respectively. This study therefore demonstrates the effectiveness of using alginate-based antimicrobial coatings to enhance the microbiological safety and quality of RTE poultry products during chilled storage.

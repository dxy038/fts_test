We propose bidirectional fiber-optic code division multiple access networks based on the multiwavelength optical code, and the feasibility of the network is demonstrated experimentally. Encoders/decoders are implemented with AWG routers and fiber delay lines, and incoherent light sources are used. Due to the loop-back configuration of the AWG router-based encoder/decoder, bidirectional transmission is possible in the proposed access network. Decoding of broad-spectrum encoded signals (/spl Delta/f=1.6 THz, /spl Delta//spl lambda/=12.8 nm at 1550 nm) after transmission over a 40-km fiber link was performed with dispersion compensation.

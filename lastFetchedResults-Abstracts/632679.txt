This study examined the impact of “acculturation gaps” on family adjustment of 115 adolescent refugees
from the former Soviet Union and their parents. Acculturation and acculturation gaps were assessed with
respect to the American and Russian culture and separately for identity, behavioral, and language competence
dimensions of acculturation. Acculturation gaps were operationalized in two different ways in
analyses: Difference scores were computed between parent and adolescent acculturation levels and used
to predict family conflict and disagreement, and moderated regression analyses examined the main effects
and interactions of parent and adolescent acculturation variables in predicting family conflict and disagreement.
Results suggest the importance of some gaps for family discord, not others. In particular, gaps
in American identity, American behavior, and Russian language were associated with greater family discord.
Results also suggest the relative advantages of using the moderated regression approach to assess
the impact of the acculturation gap and using bidirectional and multidimensional acculturation measures
in acculturation gap research.

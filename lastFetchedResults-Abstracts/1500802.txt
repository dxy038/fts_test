The increased demand for energy, climate change, and energy security concerns has driven the research interest for the development of alternative fuel from plant origin. Biodiesel derived from plant oils, which include edible and non-edible oil have gained interest for the last two decades as alternative for diesel around the world. Among these plant origin oils more than 95% of biodiesel production feedstocks come from edible oils, because they are readily available in many regions. The major advantage of these feedstocks is the properties of biodiesel produced from them are suitable to be used as diesel fuel substitute. But the consequence is the increase demand of the feedstock for food as well as fuel. A sustainable alternative fuel should be derived from renewable non-food biomass sources. The main objective of this review is to give an overview on the synthesis of biodiesel through esterification and transesterification using non-edible oil resources which are available in India, and available processes for synthesis of biodiesel (acid-, base-catalyzed transesterification reactions (homogeneous and heterogeneous), their importance, and which is the commercial process also discussed here.

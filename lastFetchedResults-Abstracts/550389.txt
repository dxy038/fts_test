Salt and drought stress are of high importance in seed germination and seedling establishment. Priming has been successfully demonstrated to improve germination and seedling emergence in seeds of many crops, particularly seeds of vegetables and small seeded grasses. Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn provides thin and sensitive seedlings. This species could be considered as a suitable plant for seeding plans in arid and semi-arid regions as well as saline soils of Iran. The objective of current research was to evaluate priming methods for increase of germination properties and initial growth parameters under salinity and drought stress. For this purpose factorial experimental completely randomized design in three replications were performed. First factor was priming treatments; the second third factors were Iso-osmotic solution and the stress levels, respectively. The results showed that the effect of main treatments and their interactions (pre- treatment, levels of stress) was significant on germination speed (P< 0.05). Increase of stress levels resulted in decrease of germination so that in -8 bar germination stopped. Totally, it was found that applied treatments were not affective for improvement of germination and initial growth properties under stress conditions.

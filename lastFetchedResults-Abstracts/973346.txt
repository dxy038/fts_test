The objective of this study is to investigate how the surface characteristics of indium phosphide (InP) can be modified through the use of atomic hydrogen (H*) cleaning and silicon interfacial control layers (Si ICL), prior to the deposition of MgO dielectric layers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows that the InP native oxide can be successfully removed using atomic hydrogen cleaning at a substrate temperature of 300 °C. However, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images display evidence for the growth of metallic In island features after H* cleaning, and subsequent deposition of MgO thin films on the H* cleaned surface resulted in high levels of interfacial indium oxide growth. It has also been shown that the deposition of thin (∼1 nm) Si layers on InP native oxide surfaces results in the transfer of oxygen from the InP substrate to the Si ICL and the formation of Si–InP bonds. XPS analysis indicates that MgO deposition and subsequent 500 °C annealing results in further oxidation of the Si layer. However, no evidence for the re-growth of interfacial In or P oxide species was observed, in contrast to observations on the H* cleaned surface.

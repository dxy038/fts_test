Root characters have been well established as drought resistance traits in peanut. However, the relationships of root characters with transpiration efficiency (TE) have not been well understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between root traits and TE under early season drought. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted during February–May 2004 and November 2004–March 2005 at the Field Crop Research Station of Khon Kaen University, in Khon Kaen province of Thailand. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) was used with 2 factorial set-up with four replications. Factor A consisted of two water regimes, i.e. irrigated control (FC) and 1/3 available soil water (1/3 AW) from emergence to 40 days after emergence followed by adequate water supply, and factor B comprised of 11 peanut genotypes. Data were recorded for specific leaf area (SLA) and SPAD chlorophyll meter reading (SCMR) at 40 and 60 days after emergence (DAE) and TE and root dry weight (RDW) at harvest. Early season drought increased SCMR, TE and RDW but it reduced SLA. Strong and more consistent variation for TE were observed among 11 peanut genotypes across seasons. Across both seasons, ICGV 98300, KK 60-3 and Tifton-8 had high TE and also had large root systems under drought conditions. KK 60-3 and Tifton-8 had low SLA and high SCMR under early season drought conditions. Root dry weight had a contribution to TE under well-watered and drought conditions, especially under drought condition. SCMR and SLA had smaller contributions to TE under well-watered and ESD conditions. From this study it was apparent that root dry weight was an important trait for TE under early season drought.

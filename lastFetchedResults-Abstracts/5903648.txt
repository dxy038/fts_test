To solve the kitting problem appearing in the process of job shop scheduling in multi-product mixed manufacturing workshops, based on the fuzzy set theory, a job shop scheduling fuzzy mathematical model is built, in which the objective function is the maximum customersÂ´ satisfaction degree. On the basis of the mathematical model, an integrated and effective fuzzy job shop scheduling model is built for multi-product mixed production. Simulation proves the scheduling process based on the job shop scheduling model has good convergence property and can produce satisfactory solutions in a short time.

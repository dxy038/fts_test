Introduction & Objective: Endothelin-1 is involved in induction and progression of atherosclerosis. Since several changes with abnormality in transferring of calcium ions have been seen in atherosclerotic vessels, it is supposed that calcium channel blockers can slowdown the process of atherosclerosis.

Materials & Methods: This study was an interventional experiment. 36 Newsland white male rabbits were divided into four groups: control group receiving normal diet, a group receiving normal diet and amlodipine, a group with high-cholesterol diet and finally high-cholesterol diet with amlodipine group.

Results: The levels of cholesterol and triglyceride in groups with high-cholesterol diet significantly increased compared to controls (p<0.01). Amlodipine consumption in eight weeks reduced significantly (p<0.01) plasma endothelin-1 levels in both of high-cholesterol diet plus amlodipine and amlodipine groups compared to control and high-cholesterol diet groups respectively. Amlodipine consumption also caused significant reduction in the level of endothelin-1 in carotid tissue of subjects received high-cholesterol diet (p<0.01). Conclusion: High-cholesterol diet increased plasma and carotid tissue endothelin-1, whereas amlodipine reduced plasma and tissue endothelin-1 levels in high-cholesterol diet group. In conclusion amlodipine treatment may have positive effects in pathology of atherosclerotic carotid arteries.

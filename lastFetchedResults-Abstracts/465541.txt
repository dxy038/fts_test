OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that neonates who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia have higher amniotic fluid concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines than those who do not develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
STUDY DESIGN: The relationship between amniotic fluid concentrations of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-8 and the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the neonate was examined in 69 patients who were delivered of preterm neonates (≤33 weeks) within 5 days of amniocentesis. Cytokines were measured by specific immunoassays.
RESULTS: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed in 19% (13/69) of newborns. Median amniotic fluid concentrations of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-8 concentrations were significantly higher in mothers whose infants had bronchopulmonary dysplasia than in mothers whose infants did not have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p< 0.05 for each). Neonates who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia were delivered at earlier gestational ages and had lower birth weights than those without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The differences in median amniotic fluid interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-8 between these two groups remained significant after we adjusted for the effect of gestational age at birth (p< 0.05 for each).
CONCLUSIONS: (1) Antenatal exposure to proinflammatory cytokines is a risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia; (2) the injury responsible for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in a subset of neonates may begin before birth. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:825-30.)

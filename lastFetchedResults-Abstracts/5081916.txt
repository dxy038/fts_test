Thousands of equipments of the wireless network and the mobile devices are widely used and the demand of dynamic spectrum resources is significantly growing. How to maximize the social utility in modern technique becomes an important issue. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm based approach to allocate the power spectrum dynamically. The objective is to maximize the sum of individual Shannon utilities with the background interference and cross talk consideration. Compared to the approach in [4], experimental result shows that our approach obtains a better result within an acceptable amount of run time.

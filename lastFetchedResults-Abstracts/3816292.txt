A new bidirectional propagation method is developed for numerical simulation of waveguiding structures with multiple longitudinal discontinuities. It is a noniterative method based on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of each uniform segment. The method is more accurate than existing bidirectional beam propagation methods and it does not require the computation of eigenmodes in each segment

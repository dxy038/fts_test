A systematical approach that can synthesize system contingencies into probabilistic PSS design is developed. A critical contingency screening is first conducted by a ranking of contingencies according to a probabilistic small signal stability index. A multi-objective optimization model is formulated to seek satisfactory system damping performance under both pre-contingency and post-contingency situations. A recursive Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is then used to solve the optimization model. Performance of the proposed model and solution is tested and investigated on an eight-machine system and The potential and superiority of the proposed method over other two intelligence computation methods is reported.

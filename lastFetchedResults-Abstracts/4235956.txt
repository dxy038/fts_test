The Demand-Side-Load Management applied to household is a control strategy which will change the way we consume and produce energy. Several works give different forms of management algorithms of Smart Home integrated or not renewable energy and especially the photovoltaic. All these researches have the same general objective: minimize the daily energy consumption level to reduce the electricity bill without harming the comfort of residents. This paper deals with a Building Energy Management (BEM) System controlling household energy capable both to satisfy the maximum available electrical energy constraint and maximize user comfort criteria. It is composed of three layers. This household energy control system is based on simple models. To validate them, a virtual building modeled more finely using MATLAB/Simulink is used. This work presents the application of optimal control to a thermal zone of a virtual building. The objective is to control energy &#8220;Smart Homes&#8221; consumption through predicted energy price.

In an adaptive array, for a single desired signal, steering weights are chosen such that the main beam of the quiescent pattern points in the direction of the desired signal. However when there are multiple simultaneous wideband signals then it is really difficult to have the beam pattern consisting of independent multiple beams towards desired directions. In this paper, the signal environment with the multiple narrowband/wideband desired signals is considered. It is assumed that there are multiple narrowband/wideband radar sources trying to probe a uniform linear antenna array. Simulations are performed to estimate the output SNR as the performance index of the adaptive array. Moreover the factors on which the performance of antenna array depends are investigated. These include weight coefficients, probing directions, bandwidths, input signal strength etc. The objective of the work is to analyze the overall efficiency of the antenna array in such signal environments.

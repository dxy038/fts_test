Cronbach's Alpha's coefficient for the main scales of the questionnaire was estimated as more than 0.75, indicating the adequate reliability of the questionnaire. The descriptive results revealed that about 11.31, 49.56 and 39.13% of the greenhouse cultivations were sustainable, relatively sustainable vs. unsustainable, respectively. The results of regression analysis indicated that 53.9% of the variances of the dependent variable (sustainability level of greenhouse cultivation) was explained by the five variables of: sustainable agricultural knowledge, level of education, attitudes towards sustainable agriculture, attendance of courses in education and extension as well as greenhouse cultivation.

The purpose of this study is to build a cost-effective and easy-to-popularize laparoscopic training system based on improving traditional training box. The system has the capability of objective skills assessment and the function of automatic recording of training process and results, as well as 3-dimensional coordinate tracking of instruments. The results of pilot experiment in laparoscopic-assisted grip skill assessment had been shown the system can assess the different grip ability level between the senior surgeons and junior residents. Regarding to the evaluation of training effectiveness, five subjects without laparoscopic surgery experiences were asked to perform grip training for five days to observe their training curves. According to the experimental results, the total time taken for subject 1 to subject 5 are improved by 54.9%, 52.0%, 60.6%, 23.3%, and 63.5% separately.

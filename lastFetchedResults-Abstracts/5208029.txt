This paper reports the design and implementation of a RF GaN Oscillator for test in space. This circuit/system will be applied in a space test of the European Space Agency and it will be one of the first experiments in space using European GaN devices. The main objective will be to study the material radiation hardness. In this paper we will present the proposed circuit for test and its main design procedure.

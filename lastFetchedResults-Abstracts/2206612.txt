Background: Hydrazones belonging to azomethine class of compounds have attracted the attention of many chemists owing to their wide spectrum of pharmacological activity profile with structural flexibility and ligating behavior.
Objectives: We aimed to synthesize a potential ligand containing both, isonicotinoylhydrazide and 3-ethoxy-2-hydroxybenzilidine moieties, linked through azomethine group.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, a new ligand derived by the condensation of isonicotinoylhydrazide and 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde have been synthesized. Ligand was characterized on the basis of various spectroscopic techniques like IR, 1H and 13C NMR studies, elemental analysis. The compound was subjected to antimicrobial and anti-tubercular activity screening using serial broth dilution method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is determined. The ligand was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144) and Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli ATCC 11303). New compound synthesized showed good biological activity against tested bacteria. Furthermore, ligand shows high levels of activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37RV) in vitro.
Results: The elemental analysis, 1H and 13C NMR studies of ligand confirm the formation of title compound with the molecular formula C15H15N3O3. Ligand shows inhibition against mycobacterium at concentration 4 ?g/mL.
Conclusions: The schiff bases ligand was readily prepared for evaluation against M. tuberculosis in good yield. Compound show good activity in vitro.

The paper focuses on the vibrations description of the slideâ€“sleeve pair of hydraulic distributor. Mathematical models of vibrations which take into account mixed friction are proposed. The models were parameterized using the results of measurements and experiments carried out by the author, literature sources and the Parameter Estimation tool in Matlab's Simulink Design Optimization package. The proposed models were mutually compared, applying the objective function value as the principal criterion.

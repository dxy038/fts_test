In the domain of human-robot cooperation for robot-assisted manufacturing, the worker protection is always imperative using both intrinsically-safe and standard industrial manipulators. Collaborative workspaces very often involve cluttered layouts and flexible workflows that may require frequent relocation of operators and the concurrent access to resources in close-quarter cooperation. With the objective of maximizing the productivity of workcells, preserving the safety of the cooperation, an optimization of safeguarded workspaces is introduced under the approach of ISO/TS 15066 Speed and Separation Monitoring (SSM) modality. A trajectory-dependent dynamic SSM is considered for establishing the minimum safety area, changing at runtime, in order to avoid overconservative restrictions in nonfunctional volumes. The effects of robot dynamics and distributed robot control are discussed and evaluated.

In this paper, the vehicle routing problem with fuzzy demands (VRPFD) is considered, and a fuzzy chance constrained program model is designed, based on fuzzy credibility theory. Then stochastic simulation and differential evolution algorithm are integrated to design a hybrid intelligent algorithm to solve the fuzzy chance constrained program model. Moreover, the influence of the dispatcher preference index on the final objective of the problem is discussed using stochastic simulation, and the best value of the dispatcher preference index is obtained.

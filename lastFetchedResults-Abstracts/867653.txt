In this paper, we develop a joint quality control and preventive maintenance policy for a production system
producing conforming and non-conforming units. The considered system consists of one machine
which must supply another production line operating on a just-in-time basis. According to the proportion
l of non-conforming units observed on each lot and compared to a threshold value lm, one decides to
undertake or not maintenance actions on the system. In order to palliate perturbations caused by the
stopping of the machine to undergo preventive maintenance or an overhaul, a buffer stock h is built
up from the instant when the rejection rate reaches a threshold level lA in order to ensure the continuous
supply of the subsequent production line. Our objective is to determine simultaneously the optimal rates
l 
m and l 
A, and the optimal size h* which minimize the expected total cost per time unit including the average
costs related to maintenance, quality and inventory.

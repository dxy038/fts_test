Since June 1999, the majority of cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), an arboviral disease, have been reported in the southeast region of Iran. The main objective of this study was to investigate CCHF risk perceptions and to identify the factors influencing perceived risk in this area. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 400 subjects were randomly recruited through 20 health centers in the city of Zahedan, located in the southeast of Iran. Information was collected by interviewing the respondents using a semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with a &#039;high&#039; CCHF perceived risk. Approximately 70% of the respondents reported the CCHF risk to be &#039;high&#039;. Factors independently associated with a &#039;high&#039; CCHF perceived risk included; holding a university degree (OR=5.65, 95%CI 2.02-15.83), high school education (OR=2.70, 95%CI 1.27- 5.75), having had a relative/friend diagnosed with CCHF (OR=2.94, 95% CI 1.08-7.96), a CCHF knowledge score ? 9 out of 20 (OR=3.37, 95% CI 1.61-7.07) and a knowledge score between 5 and 8 (OR=2.58, 95% CI 1.51-4.39). Our results showed that the study population perceived a high likelihood of CCHF risk. Improving public knowledge and awareness could result in a more realistic assessment of CCHF risk, hence better compliance with taking precaution measures to tackle the disease

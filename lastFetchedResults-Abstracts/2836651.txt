This Single-purpose machine for radial cam grinding BRV 300 - CNC is assembled from modular components. They realize precise linear and rotary motion control, measurement and mutual synchronization. Declared component parameters in different operational modes of machine were verified by external measurement system. Precision positioning of linear and rotary components and fluency of motion (rotation/shift) were main objective of this verification. Inspection system for workpiece measurement in and after the process of grinding was designed afterwards. Possible solutions are contact as well as contactless methods of measurement. These methods are applied for measuring of workpiece fixing eccentricity and his final profile. This is doable without taking a workpiece out the machine.

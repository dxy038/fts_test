The main objective of the Nymble system is to allow its users a responsible, secured anonymous online access to other networks. It provides a reliable mechanism for the server administrators to block misbehaving users while allowing the other users to stay anonymous and also in fact even the blocked users remain anonymous but only discarded from the system. The main aim is to implement a system for the server administrators to block anonymous misbehaving users by keeping the utilization of anonymizing networks more acceptable for the server administrators. All users remain anonymous and the misbehaving users can be blocked without deanonymization.

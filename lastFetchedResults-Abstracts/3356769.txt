The objective of this study is to analyze the influence of electrochemical energy storage systems on low voltage grids with high penetration of renewables (RES), mostly photovoltaic power stations (PV). Furthermore, it compares the integration of energy storage systems (ESS) with other alternative solutions economically. It also presents the simulation results for a German power network in a suburban area of Bavaria. In the case study, the ESS are used to reduce overloading of electrical equipment (e.g. power cables and transformers) caused by fluctuating generation of integrated RES. The simulation results reveal that economic use of energy storage to support the grid is feasible when it is accompanied by a specific incentive. The storage tariff necessary for this is comparable with the initial Renewable Energy Act tariff for renewables, thus making this a realistic method for facilitating the use of EES that benefits the grid.

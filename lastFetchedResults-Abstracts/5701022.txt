This paper presents the performance investigation of a self-controlled PMSM drive with a single phase current controlled PWM rectifier at the front end and a PWM inverter at the rear end feeding the PMSM. The front end PWM rectifier ensures unity power factor operation at the input and sinusoidal current drawn from the supply. This results in minimal current harmonics being injected into the supply. Also, the bidirectional power flow capability of the PWM rectifier enables regenerative braking of the drive. The PWM inverter feeding the PMSM is driven using vector control with hysteresis current controller. The rotor position of the self controlled drive is sensed using a resolver. All the requisite control signals for both the front end and rear end converters and resolver are provided using a Digital Signal Processor (DSP TMS 320 F2812). The simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed. This paper shows that such standalone integrated PMSM drives with excellent dynamic response and low input current TED are suitable for various applications such as washing machines, electric vehicles, pumps etc and have an edge over other machines.

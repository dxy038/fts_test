Electrical heating box with multi -loop control has several features as great inertia and coupling. It is a type of multi-variable system. To solve the problem, a kind of decoupling designed implicit generalized predictive control (IGPC) method is discussed. The Multi-variable IGPC based on decoupling design. Using decentralized objective function and feedforward decoupling, the decoupling IGPC is achieved to control a multi -variable system. According to input and output data, the parameters of optimal control law could be identified through use of Recursive Least Squares (RLS). This method avoids solving Diophantine equations by online. The IGPC is used for control electrical heating box with three multi-loops through simulation study. In the test process, compared with the IGPC effect and traditional PID control effect and analyzed the control effect through changing softness parameter. The test results show that the IGPC could eliminate the coupling between loops and have good control stability.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the 3-year clinical performance of one polyacid-modified resin composite material (PMRC), Dyract, in minimally invasive occlusal cavities and its neighbouring fissures.

Method: One hundred and sixteen restorations of the material investigated were placed by a single operator in a group of selected children under controlled conditions. Isolation of the restorations was accomplished with the use of cotton rolls and aspiration. Using modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) codes and criteria, the restorations were reviewed clinically within 1 week of placement (baseline), and thereafter at 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years.

Results: After 3 years, marginal discolouration was present in 8.6% of the restorations. The marginal adaptation was rated as partly sealed (Oscar–Alpha) in 107 (92.2) of the restorations. Five restorations had lost their sealant components, while four restorations were partly sealed with explorer-catch after 3 years. Although wear of the restorations was considerable, restorations rated as ‘partly sealed’ had at least two-thirds of their sealant components fully retained. Recurrent caries was associated with four (3.4%) restorations.

Conclusion: In this clinical study, the retention rate of the tested PMRC material was good, although a marked occlusal wear was evident. The marginal adaptation of the PMRC at the enamel site would probably have been better by the use of enamel-etching. Provided the marginal adaptation and wear resistance of the material is further improved, clinical use of PMRCs in minimally invasive occlusal cavities can be advocated.

In the offering of broadband wireless services a common objective for a service provider (carrier) is to choose a resource allocation policy for multiple service classes that maximizes profit. However, when doing so the policy may not be utility-optimal. This causes users to decrease their consumption, which leads to a decrease of profit for service providers. Therefore, a service provider should choose a Pareto-efficient resource allocation policy so that both the profit of the service provider and the utility of the users can be optimally balanced. In this paper, we develop a framework for finding the necessary and sufficient condition for Pareto-efficiency, derive the Pareto-efficient resource allocation policies and propose an efficient solution for achieving it in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems.

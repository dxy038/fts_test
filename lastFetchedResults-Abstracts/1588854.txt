The main objective of this paper was to perform a preliminary comparative study between chemical and electrochemical coagulation processes, both followed by flocculation and sedimentation of an effluent from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating simulated wastewater from an unbleached Kraft pulp mill. The electrochemical treatment removed up to 67% (with aluminum electrodes) and 82% (with stainless-steel electrodes) of the remaining chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 84% (stainless steel) and 98% (aluminum) of the color in the wastewater. These efficiencies were achieved with an energy consumption ranging from 14 to 20 Wh l−1. The coagulation–flocculation treatment with ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate removed up to 87% and 90% of COD and 94% and 98% of color, respectively. The addition of a high molecular weight cationic polymer enhanced both COD and color removal efficiencies.

o post-treatment processes proved to be technically feasible; however the economical feasibility could not be assessed since the experiments were performed with small reactors that could distort scale factors.

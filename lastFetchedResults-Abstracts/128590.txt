Background&Objective: One of the post-operational problems in the cesarian-section is ilus symptoms and the starting point of taking the liquid diet. Some contraversy are about this procedures. This study was done to evaluate the rate of ileus symptoms of women who are offered oral hydration shortly after cesarean delivery.
Materials&Methods: This study involved 276 women delivered by cesarean under general anesthesia that had no previous cesarean or laparotomy and indisposing and their operations had not been exceeded 90 minutes. For these patients a liquid diet for every other day, partly 6 hours and others 12 hours after operation was started. The patients were examined at the time of starting diet and 6 hours later for bowel sound. nausea or vomiting, abdominal distention and gas passage. 138 women were assigned to each procedure.
Results: Nausea or vomiting cases in the early fed group, were more than 12 hourly diets (2.2% versus no case) and (12.3% versus 10.9%) but the difference was not statistically significant. The bowel sound in the early fed group were less than 12 hourly starting the diets, (15.2% versus 12.3%) the difference was not statistically significant. The 6 hourly starting of liquid diet had a significant effect in speeding up bowel movements (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Early oral hydration after cesarean was well tolerated and it was associated with rapid return of propulsive bowel movements. so to do, this results in better reply to the physiologic request of the patients.

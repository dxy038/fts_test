This paper proposes an approach for actuator and sensor selection for a small flexible aircraft. The approach is based on the synthesis of robust controllers accounting for model uncertainty. The objective is to find, out of a finite set of actuator/sensor configurations available in the aircraft, the best configuration that provides sufficient robustness and desired performance. The results show that the ability to stabilize and achieve performance objectives of aeroservoelastic systems is highly dependent on the selection of actuators and sensors for feedback control.

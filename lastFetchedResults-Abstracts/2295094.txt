Background and Objective: Dimethylhydrazine (DMH) is metabolized to methyldiazonium by cytochrome p450 (CYP 450) in liver that increases some oncogenes expression and via beta catenin mutation and prevention of its destruction. 

Materials and Methods: In this study, 48 rats were divided into 6 groups. Colon cancer was induced by DMH injection (20 mg/kg b.w.)(s.c.) once a week for 18 weeks. Also, the effect of food containing Nigella sativa powder (2 and 4%) on cancer prevention was evaluated. Then, the liver and colon tissues were removed after 7 months. The activity of glutathione s-transferase (GST) and CYP 450 and the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) in liver and beta-catenin level in colon were measured. Also, the tumor number and size and histological damages were assessed in colon tissue. 

Results: The food containing black cumin at both doses reduced tumor number and size. The activity of GST and CYP450 and the level of GSH and beta-catenin were also increased by DMH. Treatment of rats with Nigella sativa modulated the level of these factors. 

Conclusion: Rats feeding with food containing Nigella sativa led to prevention of colon tumor, probably through the influence of detoxifying enzymes activity and beta-catenin level.

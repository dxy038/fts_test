
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The use of drugs to treat diseases led to the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is the most common problems in medical science. In this study, the antibacterial effect of ethanolic extract of Alcea digitata L., Satureja bachtiarica L. and Ferulago Angulata L on four pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was investigated.
METHODS: In this experimental study, the extracts have been prepared from Alcea digitata L., Satureja bachtiarica L. and Ferulago Angulata L. Their antibacterial activity at different concentrations (800, 400, 200, 100 mg/ml) was determined by disk-diffusion agar method and the dilution method. The antibiotics tetracycline and gentamicin as a positive control and DMSO was used as negative control and the MIC and MBC were determined.
FINDINGS: Based on the results of this study, three plant extracts dose-dependently increased the bacteria inhibition zone especially in the gram-positive bacteria compared to the gram- negative bacteria (p < 0.05). Extract of Ferulago Angulata L has maximum antibacterial activity on the growth of bacteria S. aureus (25Â±0.57) (p < 0.05). 
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, three extracts had growth inhibitory effect on all four bacteria. Extract of Ferulago Angulata L. had greater antibacterial activity than the others and the Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain to the extracts.

The objective of this paper is to propose the design of a dynamic route guidance system using forecasted travel time based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data and a modified shortest path algorithm. The Box-Jenkins method is used to forecast the travel time of each path between network nodes. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the optimal route based on this forecasted travel time of each path in the dynamic traffic network. This algorithm is modified to apply the real traffic network that has left-turn restriction, U-turn and P-turn

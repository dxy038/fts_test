In long range transmission planning, where new load growth, new generation sites and perhaps a new voltage level are to be considered, a computer aided method of visualizing new circuits in a network context is needed. The new method presented meets this need by the combined use of a linear (dc) power flow transmission model and a transportation model (also known as a trans-shipment model). The dc transmission model is solved for the facilities network by obeying both of KirchhoffÂ´s laws, flow conservation at each bus and voltage conservation around each loop. The transportation model is solved for the overloads by obeying only the bus flow conservation law while minimizing a cost objective function.

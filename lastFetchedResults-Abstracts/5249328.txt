We present a Java program for the fast evaluation of track resolution and the optimization of the detector layout. The detector setup and the track parameters are entered via the graphical user interface or read from user files, and the variance-covariance matrix of the track parameters is returned, computed by an extended Kalman filter. The positions of the detector layers can be optimized by minimizing various objective functions, such as the transverse momentum resolution or the generalized variance of (a subset of) the track parameters. Minimization is performed by the simplex algorithm according to Nelder and Mead. The program does not require licenced software.

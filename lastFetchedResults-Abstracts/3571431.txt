The fundamental equations characterising the full-bridge zero-voltage-switched DC-DC convertor are utilised in a nonlinear design-optimisation routine. The design is subject to realistic constraints along with an objective function of minimal total and/or maximum efficiency. The routine is used to study the effects of switching frequency, leakage inductance and load range for zero-voltage switching on the efficiency and size. Maximum efficiency is shown to occur when zero-voltage switching is maintained in the immediate vicinity of full-load operation. Experimental measurements confirm computed predictions

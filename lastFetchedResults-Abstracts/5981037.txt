The main objective of this paper is to describe and simulate the application of an interference cancelling technique named Amplitude Domain Processing (ADP) in navigation. ADP is the simplified algorithm of locally optimum detection theory. According to statistical theory, ADP is a non-linear and digital technology and it can eliminate interferences according to the statistical characteristics of the non-Gaussian interferences. ADP technique could be used in Squared-Sum Detector to obtain a code acquisition method that has been processed in amplitude. Simulation results show that the anti-interference technology can eliminate the narrow band interference effectively and improve the SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) of spread spectrum system and the detection probability of the signals.

Software Development Projects can vary considerably in difficulty, size and type. This has led to evolution and development of many associated project management methodologies and standard SDLC-Models. This paper acknowledges the risks associated with wrong selection of SDLC-models on business critical software projects and offers a pragmatic solution by proposing a handy selection matrix for choosing best-fit SDLC models on different types of Software Development Projects, covering both traditional and agile methodologies. This paper is the result of an study carried out to evaluate the methods &amp; practices of Project Life Cycle Model Selection actually used and practiced on the projects selected for this study (from businesses and IT-industry in India), with overall objective of proposing better methods and prescriptive guidance for decision making process for right selection of SDLC-Model on business critical software development projects. Right selection of SDLC-Methodology using a decision support tool can and will help successful completion of business critical software development projects and realization of business objectives for which the projects were undertaken.

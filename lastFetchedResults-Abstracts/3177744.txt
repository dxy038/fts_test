The main objective of this paper is the analysis of the two-way line resonance properties, experiencing small variations of distributed parameters along its length. It is shown that the position of such variation can be determined from the AFC of the line. This paper continues the work described in [1]. The application field of described methodology is security intrusion detection systems.

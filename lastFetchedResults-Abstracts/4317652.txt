Digital Elevation Model (DEM) has been widely used in many fields such as flight simulation, surface analysis, engineering works and flood risk assessment. In these recent years, it can be seen that the use of DEM in flood risk assessment and modeling is increasing. This paper describes a study made on the extraction of DEM using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) in flood risk assessment. The objective is to explore and understand the characteristics and the use of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in flood risk assessment. There are some different sources of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) highlighted in this paper which include ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and topographic map.

In modern digital subscriber line (DSL) systems where multiple users coexist in the same frequency band, multiuser power control is an effective technique for reducing crosstalk interference and improving total system throughput. This paper considers the rate and power control problem in a frequency selective interference channel. The objective of the rate and power control is to maximize the achievable rate region, given an average power constraint for each user. We analyse the performance of both the distributed and centralized multiuser power control algorithms for very high bit rate digital subscriber lines (VDSL) and suggest a multiuser centralized power control algorithm which when applied to the VDSL upstream transmission enlarges the data rate region

The Redwood Project is a collaboration of computer scientists and Earth scientists at the University of California, whose goal is to design, build, and put into practical use a distributed information system that effectively supports intensive computational and storage requirements, such as those evidenced by Earth science applications. A key objective is to support "power harnessing", the ability to concentrate as much of the distributed power available in a large-scale system to meet the demands of any single application. A service-based network software architecture provides the framework for network-integrated computing with power harnessing. In addition, Redwood technologies include a hierarchical wide-area distributed storage architecture, a wide-area high-speed network with quality of service provisions, and an "Experimentalist\´s Workstation" that uses an active document paradigm as the user\´s interface to the rich tool and data environment provided by Redwood. The project is currently seeking to develop partnerships, both financial and intellectual, with industry and the state and federal government.

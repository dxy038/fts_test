Ultra-precision grinding is primarily used to generate high quality and functional parts usually made from hard and difficult to machine materials. The objective of ultra-precision grinding is to generate parts with high surface finish, high form accuracy and surface integrity for the electronic and optical industries as well as for astronomical applications. This keynote paper introduces general aspects of ultra-precision grinding techniques and point out the essential features of ultra-precision grinding. In particular, the keynote paper reviews the state-of-the-art regarding applied grinding tools, ultra-precision machine tools and grinding processes. Finally, selected examples of advanced ultra-precision grinding processes are presented.

Meeting sustainable energy demand with minimum environmental impact is a major area of concern in the energy sector. Alternative fuels such as biodiesel, ethanol etc. have been quite promising for fulfilling both these aspects. While biodiesel reduces emissions of CO, life cycle CO2, SOx, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and particulate matter (PM) significantly, the propensity for the production of NOx is an important problem that requires extensive research. NOx emission from a direct-injection diesel engine is mainly due to formation of thermal NO that is described by Zeldovich mechanism. Thus, studying temperature profile during biodiesel combustion can provide useful insights to the formation and destruction of NOx. The main objective of this work is to investigate the effect of component methyl esters of biodiesel on open air flame temperature distribution and the effect of blending biodiesel with diesel and oxygenates (ethanol and methyl acetate) on open air flames. This objective was achieved by obtaining thermocouple measurements and thermal infrared imaging of local flame temperatures of wick-generated open air flames. A relationship between blend proportions and relative flame temperatures were obtained. In general, it was found that blending oxygenates such as ethanol and methyl acetate into petroleum diesel tended to increase the flame temperature in comparison with straight diesel fuel. The analyses of relative flame temperatures of different components of biodiesel were performed to evaluate the effect of unsaturation level and the hydrocarbon chain length on the flame temperature. It was found that the saturated methyl esters resulted in greater flame temperatures in comparison to unsaturated methyl esters. It was also revealed that shorter chained fatty acid methyl esters lead to higher flame temperatures as compared to its longer chained counterparts.

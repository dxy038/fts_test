DEA method can be used to establish input-output model to evaluate the input-output of the construction of enterprise informatization. The index weight has an important effect on the results of the evaluation. By joining the weight limit into DEA input-output models, it can objectively reflect the extent that the decision makers pay attention to different indicators. By doing this we can make the study objective and authentic. Additionally, we established the DEA model of input-output subsystem in this thesis, divided the process of enterprise informatization into several subsystems, and evaluated the performance of the subsystems. By evaluating the performance of the Enterprise informatization construction at the micro level, the DEA model of input-output subsystem can make us to find out the problems in the informatization construction.

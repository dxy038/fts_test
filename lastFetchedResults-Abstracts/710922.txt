Study Objective
To evaluate the implications of dating in pre- and early adolescent females.
Design
Cross-sectional survey.
Setting
Child psychiatry clinic; pediatric clinic; family clinic.
Participants
Pre- and early adolescent females (n = 80) aged 11–14 and their parents.
Intervention
Pre- and early adolescent females aged 11–14 and a parent were recruited during a regular clinic visit. Pre- and early adolescent females completed a survey that included measures of dating; sensation seeking; lifetime individual and peer drug use; Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Conduct Disorder symptoms; and onset of menses. Parents were asked similar questions about their child's dating behaviors and peer relationships.
Main Outcome Measure
Association of early dating with individual and peer drug use, sensation seeking, aggressive behavior, and onset of menses.
Results
In pre- and early adolescent females, dating regularly is associated with nicotine and alcohol use, sensation seeking, and aggressive behavior. Dating regularly is also associated with onset of menses and a younger age of onset of menses in those who had started menstruating. Parents under-report their child's dating practices and associated high-risk behaviors.
Conclusion
Early dating is associated with nicotine and alcohol use, sensation seeking, aggressive behavior, and early onset of menses in adolescent females. Questions about early dating are a simple and efficient way to open inquiry of both parents and children about high-risk behaviors in the clinic setting.

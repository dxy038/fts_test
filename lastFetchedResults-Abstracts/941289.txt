The objective of this study was to measure the concentration of 14 elements in human bone and investigate the
affecting factors. This study aims to establish a database of elements in Taiwanese bone. Seventy-seven bone samples
were taken from 70 subjects who were undertaking various bone surgeries from a medical center in central Taiwan.
Bone samples were pretreated using microwave digestion and then, after determining the optimal conditions for
analysis, fourteen elements were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy  ICP-
AES.. Results showed that Ca had the highest concentration, followed by Mg and Zn. The lowest concentrations
were of Mn, followed by Cd and Co. There was a positive correlation between the frequency of seafood intake and
presence of all the 14 elements in human bone. There were several elements that had positive inter-correlation: As
with Co; Al, Ag and Ca; Ni with Co, Mn and Al; Co with Al, Ag and Ca; Mn with Cr and Cu; Cr with Cu; Mg with
Ca; Al with Ag and Ca; Ag with Ca; and also Zn with Mg. There were no significant differences found between
concentrations of elements and etiology of bone disease and age. The authors suggest that further studies be
conducted to establish a normal value of elements in human bone in Taiwan. This will greatly benefit the
understanding of the relationship between disease pattern and elements in human bone

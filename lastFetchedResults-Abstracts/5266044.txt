How to achieve the discrete location information of sensor nodes is a key problem in WSNs. The objective of this study is to bring forth a location scheme for WSNs in support of data collection and aggregation, which includes the discrete distance and angle schemes. At last, performance analysis is presented and the result indicates that the location scheme has the properties of scalability and efficiency of energy.

In battery/ultracapacitor electric vehicles, a bidirectional dc/dc converter is employed to process the power according to the power references obtained from the energy management controller. The selection of this converter is of critical importance for the overall system efficiency and size. This study proposes using a three-level dc/dc converter and provides a comprehensive comparison with the conventional two-level and interleaved bidirectional buck/boost converters in terms of magnetic component size/weight and overall efficiency. Unlike the comparative studies presented in the literature, where the efficiency comparison of converters is conducted based on given fixed input and output parameters, power references obtained from a wavelet-transform-based energy management strategy with varying energy source voltages and traction power are considered in this paper. The results of the analyses show that a three-level converter exhibits higher overall efficiency and has smaller size inductor. A 1-kW bidirectional three-level dc/dc converter is designed as a proof of concept, which exhibits 93.2% peak efficiency at 200-kHz switching frequency.

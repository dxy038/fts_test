The primary objective of this study is to determine if there is sufficient information in broadband sonar echoes from the live tethered animals to determine their species. This study is focusing on two species: Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). In addition to determining the species discrimination efficacy of the broadband sonar system, a comparison of these results with the seminal work of Burwen &amp; Fleischman is made as they have presented a firm baseline for species discrimination in this riverine environment using a traditional narrowband split-beam hydroacoustic sonar system.

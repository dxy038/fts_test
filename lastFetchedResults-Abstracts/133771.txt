Introduction: Many studies suggest that the consumption of hydrogenated fat may increase the risk of coronary heart disease, while monounsaturated fats may be associated with a lower coronary risk profile.
Objective: The present study compares the effects of a diet containing 8% olive oil or hydrogenated fat in four groups of rabbits for 12 weeks (experimental period).
Materials and Methods: Twenty Dutch male rabbits were categorized to four groups (One as control, and the other as experimental group). They received one of standard, standard + olive oil, standard + hydrogenated fat, standard + olive oil+ hydrogenated fat for twelve weeks. Fasting blood samples from heart were collected at the beginning, and at the end of experimental period. Their aortic tissue was prepared for microscopic observation and determining the degree of aortic injuries.
Results: Means of total cholesterol, I-DL- C, Triglyceride, MDA and antioxidant capacity were not significantly different at the beginning of experimental period. After experimental period, HDL-C, Triglycerides, total cholestrol and MDA were significantly higher in hydrogenated group. The comparison of hydrogenated fat with combined group (Hydrogenated + Olive oil), showed that triglyceride and total cholestrol are significantly lower in combined group. Histological results showed no difference in the occurance of the atheromatous lesion in the aorta between these groups. According to the undersirable effects of Hydrogenated fat on lipid profile and lipid peroxidation, these effects could be modulated by substituting olive oil in the diet.
Conclusion: In spite of hypercholesterolemic effect of hydrogenated fat, no aortic lesions have been observed.

This paper targets photovoltaic microinverters (MIVs) with integrated battery storage. The dual-active-bridge (DAB) topology provides bidirectional power flow; however, it generally suffers from poor efficiency and limited regulation accuracy at low power. It is shown that by modifying one switch, the DAB converter can operate as a two-transistor flyback to resolve these two issues. In addition, the dc-link voltage in the two-stage MIV can be dynamically adjusted for optimal performance in DAB mode. The proposed dual-mode control scheme is demonstrated experimentally on a 100-W prototype, with up to 8% increase in converter efficiency at low power.

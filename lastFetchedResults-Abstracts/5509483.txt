Conventional multi-level logic synthesis is targeted to reduce the area of the logic circuits (estimated via literal count). This paper looks at multi-level combinational logic synthesis from the objective of minimizing test length, i.e. the size of a test set to detect all irredundant single stuck-at faults in the circuit. The length of a test set affects the test application cost. The synthesis process has been modified to obtain circuits that can be tested with smaller test length. Results of the implementation have shown significant reduction in test length with little increase in run time over the MIS-II synthesis system and very little increase in literal count

A study was performed to minimize the signal distortion of high-power MMW (millimeter wave) communication TWTs (traveling wave tubes) in satellite uplinks. The effect of TWT design parameters on small-signal gain variation was first evaluated analytically. Three PPM (pulse position modulation)-focused Ka-band TWTs were then designed and built to evaluate distortion-reduction techniques. TWTs which featured a ferruleless cylindrical coupled-cavity circuit demonstrated the performance objective of 400 W of saturated output power and 50-dB gain over the 29-30-GHz band. The parabolic small-signal gain variation was less than 3 dB, and the small-signal gain ripple was 1 dB or less, a marked improvement for these types of TWTs. The TWTsÂ´ performance and the techniques used to reduce the amplitude variations are discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Background:The theoretical models of parenting styles seek to identify the factors affecting upbringing children and to determinetheir consequences. The inconsistency between these theoretical patterns, which mainly belong to the Western societies and are affected by the attitude governing them, with the Iranian culture, values and beliefs lays the groundwork for development of native models based onthe Islamic attitude and the specific experiences of the Iranian society. Objective:The present paper aims to study the psychometrics characteristics (reliability and validity) and the theoretical model of the Parent-Child Relationship Questionnaire. Method:The questionnairewas conducted in two phases on 270 teenagers and young people between the ages of 15 to 30 who were residing in district 9 of Tehran in 2011.The research samples were selected in both phases by using multistage random sampling. The sample size was 110 in the first phase and 160 in the second phase. In the first phase, content validity and face validity of questionnaires as well as construct validity (including principal components analysis, item analysis, discriminative index, difficulty index and loop method) were examined by experts. In the second phase, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed. Results: The validity and reliability of the theoretical model of the questionnaire wereconfirmed by the fitting indices. Moreover, the t-value showed that there was a significant relationship between all the questions and the relevant factors. Considering the factor loading of security-oriented as well as freedom-oriented patterns and significance of the t-value, appropriate construct validity could be reported for these two patterns as well.

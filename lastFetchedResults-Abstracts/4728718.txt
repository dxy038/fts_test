Adaptive control schemes are very suitable for systems with nonlinearities. However, the practical complexity makes it difficult to control some systems successfully. It is thus necessary to look into more robust control algorithms. The prospective of parameter space methods for robust control design and an algorithm for a robust adaptive controller based on pole-shifting technique are presented in this paper. The objective is to shift the poles of the open-loop system towards the centre of the unit circle in z-plane by a factor less than one to provide system stability over the whole range of error between the plant parameters and identified plant parameters. Mathematical development and verification of the algorithm by simulation studies are given

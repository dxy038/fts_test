ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Glucocorticoids as powerful agents that effect on cell growth, differentiation and cell death are in throughout life. Morphine at low concentration stimulates process elongation in neurons. In this study we examined the effects of low concentrations of morphine on dexamethasone induced-cell death in differentiated PC12 cells.
METHODS: PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 1% FBS, 2 m? L-glutamin, 1% NEAA and 1% antibiotic penicillin/stereptomycine. Cells were treated with different concentrations of dexamethasone in the presence of 214 nM staurosporine as neuronal differentiated agent. PC12 cells were divided into two groups; group I, treatment with different concentrations of dexamethasone without morphine and group II, treatment with different concentrations of dexamethasone together with morphine (10-10 M). There were six treatments in each group: treatment 1 without (0 nM) dexamethasone and treatments 2 to 6 with adding 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1?M and 10 ?M dexamethasone in culture medium, respectively.
FINDINGS: Our results showed that the cell viability was increased in group I, treatments 2, 3 and 4 and was decreased in treatments 1 and 5 and 6 (p < 0.05).  Cell viability was increased in group II, treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4, and was decreased in treatments 5 and 6 (p < 0.05). Total neurite length in group I treatments 1-6 was decreased (148.70±2.37, 85.06±1.61, 88.38±1.58, 91.05±1.66, 72.82±1.32 and 69.18±1.18 ?m) respectively (p < 0.05). In group I treatments 1 and 6 had highest and lowest total neurite length, respectively (p < 0.05). Total neurite length in group II treatments 1-6 were 164.22±4.45, 105.19±2.84, 108.33±3.09, 149.46±4.04, 117.60±3.08 and 115.24±2.73 ?m, respectively. In group II treatment 1 had highest and treatments 2 and 3 had lowest total neurite length (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that low concentrations morphine enhances neurite elongation and viability in PC12 cells.

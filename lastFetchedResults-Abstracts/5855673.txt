Frequency stability of resonators used in low noise oscillators is typically achieved by encasing the resonator or the complete oscillator in a temperature-controlled oven. This method is preferred over electrically pulling the resonator which results in a lower loaded Q. The oven approach introduces long warm-up time, increased size, and adds considerably to the total power dissipation of the oscillator. The objective is to develop an oven structure which drastically reduces both warm-up time and power dissipation.

A method incorporating a genetic algorithm tailored to EPANET for the conjunctive optimal design and operation of multiquality water distribution systems under unsteady hydraulics is presented and demonstrated. The objective is to minimize the total cost of designing and operating the system for a selected operational time horizon while delivering to consumers the required quantities at acceptable qualities and pressures. The decision variables for the design are the pipe diameters, tank maximum storage, maximum pumping unit power, and maximum removal ratios at the treatment facilities. For the operation phase, the decision variables are set for each time step of the total operational time horizon. These decisions include the scheduling of the pumping units and the treatment removal ratios at the treatment facilities. The constraints are domain heads and concentrations at consumer nodes, maximum removal ratios at the treatment facilities, maximum allowable amounts of water withdrawals at the sources, and return at the end of the operational time horizon to a prescribed total storage in the water distribution system tanks. The model is explored through two example applications.

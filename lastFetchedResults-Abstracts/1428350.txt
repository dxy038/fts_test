Background
m of this study was to investigate the role of hyperthymic temperament in suicidal ideation between a sample of patients with affective disorders (unipolar and bipolar).

estigated affective disorders outpatients (unipolar, bipolar I, II and NOS) treated in eleven participating centres during at least a six-month period. DSM-IV diagnosis was made by psychiatrists experienced in mood disorders, using the corresponding modules of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). In addition, bipolar NOS diagnoses were extended by guidelines for bipolar spectrum symptoms as proposed by Akiskal and Pinto in 1999. Thereby we also identified NOS III (switch by antidepressants) and NOS IV (hyperthymic temperament) bipolar subtypes. All patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We screened a total sample of 411 patients (69% bipolar), 352 completed all the clinical scales without missing any item.
s
tistical significant difference in suicidal ideation (measure by BDI item 9 responses) was found between bipolar and unipolar patients (4.5% vs. 9.1%, respectively). On the group of bipolar patients, suicidal ideation was slightly more frequent among bipolar NOS compared with bipolar I and II (p value 0.094 and 0.086, respectively), interestingly we found a statistical significant less common suicidal ideation among bipolar subtype IV (with hyperthymic temperament) compared with bipolar NOS patients (p value 0.048).
sions
sults indicate that those subjects with hyperthymic temperament displayed less suicidal ideation. This finding supports the hypothesis that this particular affective temperament could be a protective factor against suicide among affective patients.
tion
iginal objective of the national study was the cross validation between MDQ and BSDS in patients with affective disorders in our country. This report arises from a secondary analysis of the original data.

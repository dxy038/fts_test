With the rapid growing number of WWW users, hidden information becomes ever increasingly valuable. As a consequence of this phenomenon, mining Web data and analysing on-line users´ behaviour and their on-line traversal pattern have emerged as a new area of research. Primarily based on the Web servers´ log files, the main objective of traversal pattern mining is to discover the frequent patterns in users´ browsing paths and behaviors. This paper presents a complete framework for Web mining, allowing users to pre-define physical constraints when analysing complex traversal patterns in order to improve the efficiency of algorithms and offer flexibility in producing the results.

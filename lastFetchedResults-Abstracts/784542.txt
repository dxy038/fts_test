Objective: Performance measures provide important information, but the meaning of change in these
measures is not well known. The purpose of this research is to 1) examine the effect of treatment assignment on
the relationship between self-report and performance; 2) to estimate the magnitude of meaningful change in 400-
meter walk time (400MWT), 4-meter gait speed (4MGS), and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and 3)
to evaluate the effect of direction of change on estimates of magnitude. Design: This is a secondary analysis of
data from the LIFE-P study, a single blinded randomized clinical trial. Using change over one year, we applied
distribution-based and anchor-based methods for self-reported mobility to estimate minimally important and
substantial change in 400MWT, 4MGS and SPPB. Setting: Four university-based clinical research sites.
Participants: Sedentary adults aged 70-89 whose SPPB scores were less than 10 and who were able to complete
a 400MW at baseline (n=424). Interventions: A structured exercise program versus health education.
Measurements: 400MWT, 4MGS, SPPB. Results: Relationships between self-report and performance measures
were consistent between treatment arms. Minimally significant change estimates were 400MWT: 20-30 seconds,
4MGS: 0.03-0.05m/s and SPPB: 0.3 – 0.8 points. Substantial changes were 400MWT: 50-60 seconds, 4MGS:
0.08m/s, SPPB: 0.4 – 1.5 points. Magnitudes of change for improvement and decline were not significantly
different. Conclusions: The magnitude of clinically important change in physical performance measures is
reasonably consistent using several analytic techniques and appears to be achievable in clinical trials of exercise.
Due to limited power, the effect of direction of change on estimates of magnitude remains uncertain.

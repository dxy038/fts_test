This paper reports a novel approach on the surface treatment of monocrystalline silicon solar cells using an inorganic chemical, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) that has some remarkable properties. The treatment of contaminated crystalline silicon wafer with hot NaOCl helps the removal of organic contaminants due to its oxidizing properties. The objective of this paper is to establish the effectiveness of this treatment using hot NaOCl solution before the saw damage removal step of the conventional NaOH texturing approach. A comparative study of surface morphology and FTIR analyses of textured monocrystalline silicon surfaces with and without NaOCl pre-treatment is also reported. The process could result in a significant low cost approach viable for cleaning silicon wafers on a mass production scale.

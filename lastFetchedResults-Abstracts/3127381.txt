So far, the author developed the parametrization of all strictly causal stabilizing controllers in the framework of the factorization approach. The objective of this paper is to extend the previous results, the parametrization of all strictly causal stabilizing controllers with some conditions. Since the factorization approach has been used, the result can be applied to numerous linear system models.

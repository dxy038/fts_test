The introduction of micro grids in distribution networks based on power electronics facilitates the use of renewable energy resources, distributed generation (DG) and storage systems while improving the quality of electric power and reducing losses thus increasing the performance and reliability of the electrical system. The main objective of this paper, is designing H&#8734; controllers for a control scheme based on decoupled models, which includes an inner current loop and an outer voltage loop for micro-source grid-connected inverter. The robust controller is designed for the grid-forming using structured uncertainties to improve the performance of the system facing parametric uncertainties. The controller is evaluated by simulation to demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy for the nominal case and perturbed parameters cases.

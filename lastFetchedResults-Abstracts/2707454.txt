In this paper, the application performances of isolated bidirectional dc-dc converters (IBDCs) based on all-Si and all-SiC power devices for next-generation power conversion application are comparatively analyzed and validated through experiments. Both the comparative theoretical analysis and experiments show that the SiC-based converter has better performance than the Si-based IBDC. The efficiency of all-SiC-based IBDC is higher than that of the previous reported IBDCs. The practical applications of IBDC for the next-generation power conversion are expected with the appearance and application of SiC-based power devices.

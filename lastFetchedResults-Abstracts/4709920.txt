We developed a new pupil perimeter which consisted of a 19 inch liquid crystal display for stimulations and an infrared CCD camera for recording the pupillary light reflex. An LCD increases the flexibility of size, luminance, frequency and color of the stimulations compared with that of using conventional perimeter. And we devised another type pupil perimeter using head mount display. It was expected to contribute space savings and easy measuring for old people and bedridden patients. We considered that a pupil perimeter could be used in clinical applications for evaluating an objective visual field easily. Furthermore, pupil perimetry may be useful for detecting in glaucomatous visual field defects.

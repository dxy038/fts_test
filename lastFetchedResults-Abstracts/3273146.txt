The case method is an effective teaching technique for business management education. The main objective with this method is to spark discussion and share ideas. However, discussions are generally conducted in a single-language environment, which is difficult for non-native speakers. We therefore developed a multilingual case method system for global classroom environments to benefit students of different cultures and who speak various languages. The system provides a learning environment in which students can communicate in their native language through the Language-Grid service. We evaluated our system by conducting experiments using a short case of an unresolved cultural conflict. Japanese and Korean students participated in the experiments. The system enabled sufficiently effective communication in their native languages. We were also able to address cultural differences, for example, Japanese students tend to think of cultural conflicts more negatively than Korean students.

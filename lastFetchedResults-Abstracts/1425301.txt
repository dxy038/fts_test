Objective: To analyse changes in inpatient treatment for mood disorders during the period of de-institutionalisation, de-centralisation of service planning, economic recession, attempts to increase depression awareness and increasing biological treatment possibilities. A special interest is paid to whether de-institutionalisation at specialist level psychiatric care results in transfer of inpatient care into non-specialised institutions. Method: A register study of all inpatient treatment due to psychiatric disorders from four health care districts in Northern Finland, with a population of more than 600,000. Treatment undertaken by psychiatric hospitals and wards, primary care wards and medical and surgical wards in general hospitals are distinguished. Results: Inpatient treatment for mood disorders increased vastly in all kinds of health care institutions. The increase was due to growing inpatient treatment of depression. Limitations: The National Discharge Register does not include treatment episodes in private nursing homes or details about the contents of the treatment. Conclusion: Even during explicit active de-institutionalisation, other policies may have a greater impact on hospital use, resulting in unexpected changes in patient populations and service utilisation. In Finland, de-institutionalisation failed concerning mood disorders. The depression awareness policies during the 1990s increased inpatient use of depression across institutions.

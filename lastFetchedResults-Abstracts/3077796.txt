In this paper, we propose a novel model for estimating the quality of speech without the reference speech information. The proposed auditory non-intrusive quality estimation plus (ANIQUE+) model is a perceptual model simulating the functional role of human auditory system, and employs improved modeling of quality estimation by statistical learning methods. Experimental evaluation demonstrated that the performance of the ANIQUE+ model is significantly superior to that of the current ITU-T standard recommendation P.563 on 34 different subjective mean opinion score (MOS) databases - the averaged correlation between subjective and objective quality scores is about 0.97 for ANIQUE+, whereas P.563 shows 0.87 averaged correlation

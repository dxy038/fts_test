Tattoos are associated with blood-borne infections that result from viruses such as the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This association is equally evident among people without major risk factors and among those with major risk factors like injected drug users (IDUs). In this study we evaluated all tattooed patients admitted to our hospital (the Boo-Ali hospital in southeastern Iran) between February 2006 to January 2015. The patients enrolled in our study were admitted to infectious disease wards for different illnesses (e. g., Pneumonia, Sepsis, Tuberculosis, etc.).We only studied the patients who agreed to be included in our study. When we found at least one tattooed area, regardless of its size, we took a blood sample and tested it for the presence of HIV, HBV, and HCV. Among the 63 patients with tattoos (21% female, 79% male, age range:16 to 79-years-old), four patients (6.3%) tested positive for HBsAg and PCR-HBV, seven patients (11%) tested positive for HCV, and five (7.9%) tested positive for HIV. The last group consisted in IDUs and all five had several tattooed areas on their bodies. Upon our results, tattooed people even with a small size of tattoo on the body are more at risk for HCV, HBV, and HIV infection.

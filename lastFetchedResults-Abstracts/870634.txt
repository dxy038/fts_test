In this paper we consider the parallel machine scheduling problem with dual resource constraints with the objective of minimizing the maximum completion time. We develop heuristics that combine list-scheduling and bin-packing approaches with rules to iteratively modify the flexible resource allocation. A lower bound is presented and the previous and proposed solution approaches to the problem are analyzed under a variety of experimental conditions, demonstrating that there are advantages to the proposed heuristics.

System analysis of a bidirectional DC-DC converter for a fuel cell electric vehicle driving system is presented. The proposed converter is based on a zero voltage switching (ZVS) half-bridge converter with centre-tapped rectifier at the secondary side of the transformer. The asymmetrical pulse-width modulation is used in the converter to achieve ZVS feature of power switches and to regulate the output voltage at the desired value. The proposed converter has the advantages of high efficiency, low circuit components and simple circuit configuration. The operating principle and the system analysis are described and discussed in detail. Finally, the experimental results for the proposed converter are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.

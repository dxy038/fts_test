In this paper, a novel algorithm of cooperative ant colonies is proposed to solve resource allocation problem. The resource allocation problem is to allocate the resources to activities with the objective of optimizing the cost function. In our study, cooperative ant colonies can provide a main portion of diversity in search space and can conduct fine-tuning for the solution provided by ant colonies to escape from poor local optima. In this paper, several examples are tested to prove the superiority of our proposed algorithm. From simulation results, the proposed algorithm indeed has remarkable performance.

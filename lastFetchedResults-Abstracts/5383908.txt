New technologies are needed to put on the market ever accelerated schedule in order to design and fabricate devices that fulfill consumers&#8217; expectations. An industry-academy collaborative working mode is very efficient way to accelerate and diversify progression of novel technological solutions, educate new multidisciplinary professionals, and to act the function of new business incubation. University-industry cooperation (UIC) in research is an important vector of innovation and growth, the cooperation ecosystem of interconnected institutions, persons, and policies that are necessary to propel technological and economic development is commonly referred to as the Chinese innovation ecosystem. This paper to investigate critical component of the innovation ecosystem: research partnerships between universities and the private sector. The paper introduces the concept of innovation ecosystem theories firstly. Then puts forward the factors and framework of university-industry cooperation innovation ecosystem. A thorough analysis of the mechanism of innovation ecosystem has been made accordingly. Finally, the paper give the recommendation and countermeasure

In this paper, the design, development and performance of a miniaturized multipurpose dual band planar antenna is discussed. This dual band antenna is destined to work on two UHF RFID bands, which are, 433MHz and the European RFID band (865MHz&#8211;868MHz). The main objective to design such an antenna was to have an antenna design having a small size, with an omni-directional radiation pattern with a reasonable performance. The size of the antenna is reduced by utilizing different miniaturization techniques, among which the most significant once include shorting the antennaÂ´s radiating part with the ground plane, and using closely coupled parallel microstrip lines approach. The antenna structure and design makes it more stable to the external environmental effects, such as hand and wall effects. This type of dual band antenna can be used in different kind of small RFID readers, wireless sensor network nodes and other compact wireless systems.

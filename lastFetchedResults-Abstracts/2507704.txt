Objective: Alcohol consumption is habitually accompanied by the use of other psychoactive
substances, mostly tobacco. Nicotine and alcohol affect male accessory reproductive
glands function. Most studies have been done on pathologic features of prostate, but there
has been no systematic study on the seminal vesicle. Therefore, the aim of current study
was to investigate the distribution of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptors-beta
(ER-B) immune reactivities following long-term treatment of alcohol, nicotine or a combination
of both substances.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, a total of 40 adult Wistar rats, nine
weeks of age, were used. Animals were randomly divided into four groups, including: i.
Control group receiving normal saline 0.09%, ii. Ethanol group receiving ethanol 20% (2
ml/kg, via gavage), iii. Nicotine group receiving nicotine (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection),
and iv. Ethanol-nicotine group receiving simultaneous ethanol 20% (2 ml/kg) and
nicotine (0.1 mg/kg) treatment. All treatment lasted for eight weeks. Prior to intracardiac
perfusion, blood sample was collected from left ventricle. The seminal vesicles were isolated
and processed for paraffin blocking. The sample tissues were then studied for distribution
of AR and ER-B immunereactivities using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
method. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukeyâ€™s test were performed for data
analysis. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: Our results revealed that the lowest mean number of positive cells belonged
to the animals of ethanol-nicotine group that was followed by the ethanol, nicotine, and
control groups, respectively. However, there was no significant difference regarding serum
testosterone level among experimental groups.
Conclusion: It was concluded that combination of both ethanol and nicotine may be a
crucial factor in the expression levels of AR and ER-B.

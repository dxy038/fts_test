This paper addresses the issues on next generation CDMA technologies for future wireless networks, which should offer much higher transmission-rate/throughput than that possible using current CDMA technologies based on unitary codes and direct sequence spreading. Our ultimate objective is to propose a CDMA architecture, whose performance is no longer limited to self-interference. This paper is a review of our currently on-going research on next generation CDMA technologies. In particular, we propose a new CDMA code design method, real environment adapted linearization (REAL) approach, which can be used to generate orthogonal complementary codes (OCCs) with inherent immunity against multipath interference and multiple access interference for both synchronous and asynchronous transmissions. They can also offer ideal correlation properties desirable for signal detection on the edges of a packet, which is important especially to the applications in all-IP based ad hoc mobile networking. Some other topics related to the OCC-CDMA architecture is also addressed, such as system implementation issues.

Relationships between broad-based health symptoms and neuropsychological performance have been investigated previously in Gulf War (GW) veterans. However, very little has been done to assess relationships between severity of neuropsychological symptom complaints and performance on objective neuropsychological tests. In this study, relationships between level of self-reported neuropsychological symptom severity and objective neuropsychological performance measures were investigated. Participants included 240 veterans from three GW-era cohorts: GW-deployed veterans recruited from Ft. Devens, MA, (n = 142) and from New Orleans, LA (n = 51), and veterans deployed to Germany from a Maine National Guard unit (n = 47). Findings suggest that level of subjective neuropsychological complaints was associated primarily with mood symptoms in GW-era veterans. Among GW-deployed troops, high neuropsychological symptom reporters endorsed more tension, fatigue, and confusion and less vigor than those reporting fewer cognitive complaints. Current findings emphasize the importance of independent assessment of subjective symptoms and objective neuropsychological performance.

Traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms like NSGA/NSGA-II and NSDE employ non-dominated sorting to locate the Pareto solutions. Their global convergence character guarantee the quality of solutions, yet the searching speed impedes vast usage in complex engineering problems. In order to deal with this situation, a novel simplex algorithm employing non-dominated sorting strategy, NS-Simplex, is proposed. Its non-dominated sorting strategy ensures the generation of Pareto fronts, whereas the simplex procedure accelerates the convergence process. Benchmark problems are used in numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of NS-Simplex and the numerical result illustrates the effectiveness and efficiency of NS-Simplex.

Background: Matrigel (extracellular matrix) can improve the growth of many cell
types in vitro.
Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of Matrigel on the
development of 2-4 cells human embryos in culture.
Material and Methods: Surplus 2-4 cells human embryos, resulting from ICSI, were
divided into two groups (control and test). Quality of embryos in both groups was
morphologically similar. The test group (n=140) was cultured in Hamsâ€™ F10
supplemented with 10% human serum albumin and 150 ?l liquid Matrigel. The control
group (n=140) was cultured in the same medium devoid of Matrigel. Embryos were
cultured for an additional 4 days and their morphology was assessed every 24 hours.
Both groups were then statistically compared.
Results: The percentage of the human embryos that reached the morula stage in the
control and test groups were 79.2% and 80%, respectively (p > 0.05). However, 36.4%
of embryos reached the blastocyst stage in the test group as compared to 5.7% in the
control group after 144 hours in culture. This difference was statically significant (p
 < 0.01). In addition, culture of embryos on Matrigel and medium versus medium alone
significantly improved in vitro hatching (25.7% versus 3.5%; p  < 0.01).
Conclusion: Matrigel at low concentration enhances human blastocyst formation and
hatching in vitro.

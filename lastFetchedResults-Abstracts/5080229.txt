A family of soft-switching phase-shift bidirectional DC-DC converters is proposed. A synthesis method of the family is described. The converters are composed of fundamental switch cells with phase-shift control. The converters can achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) in both forward and backward modes. The operation principle and analysis of one particular converter, taken as an example of the converter family, are explained. Experimental results are presented

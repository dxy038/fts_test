Volt/Var Optimization (VVO) function is a key element in advanced Distribution Management System (DMS) functionality. VVO function is designed to optimize the voltage and reactive power flow in distribution network by using possible control equipment such as transformer on-load tap changers (OLTC), Voltage Regulators (VR), and switching the Capacitor Banks. In this paper we use a full mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for solving VVO problem for realtime application. The objective of this paper is to implement an MILP model for volt-var optimization function in a commercial solver GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) which has the capability to be used as framework for real-time applications. The implemented model has been tested on a real distribution network in southern Sweden and the results are presented.

An on-line application oriented scheduling approach for cultivation periods of penicillin fed-batch fermentation is proposed to maximize the economic profit of the whole workshop. The approach consists of profit function calculation, profit potential prediction, on-line batch classification and scheduling decision-making. The objective function is to maximize the total economic profit of those batches in parallel operation by repeated updating of the termination sequence while without significant disturbance on upstream and downstream work sections. Pseudo-on-line simulations of re-scheduling on industrial penicillin cultivations demonstrate the potential benefits of the approach. The original data is from a Chinese pharmaceutical company which consists of 58 industrial batches of penicillin fed-batch cultivation under empirical operation. Re-scheduling is carried out under three different inoculation sequences and the simulation results indicate that 2â€“3% of total profit increase could be generally achieved, compared with the empirical one.

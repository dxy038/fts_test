Utilities frequently use ADSS (all dielectric self-supporting) fiber-optic cables installed on transmission lines. Dry-band arcing occurs on the fiber-optic cables when they are polluted and wet. The objective of this paper is to present a technique to predict dry-band arcing in fiber-optic cables. An equivalent circuit is used to represent the polluted fiber-optic cable. The effect of pollution levels on voltage and current distribution along the fiber-optic cable is analyzed. The longitudinal field and power loss distribution along the fiber-optic cable is analyzed. It is shown that for heavy pollution levels, the space potential can be exceeded. The effect of span length on voltage and current is analyzed. The effect of sag on the space potential is analyzed. This model can be used by utilities to predict dry-band arcing in fiber-optic cables installed on transmission lines.

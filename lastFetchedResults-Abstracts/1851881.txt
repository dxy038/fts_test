Summary
ed agents have improved prognosis for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), and they are changing therapeutic expectations with respect to long-term clinical outcomes for these patients. However, in order to obtain the maximum clinical benefit from targeted agents, effective therapy management is essential and includes optimization of dosing and treatment duration, as well as adequate side-effect management.

nib has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of patients with mRCC and is a reference standard of care for first-line therapy. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to determine the best treatment strategy with targeted agents due to long-term tolerability and the development of resistance. An individualized therapeutic strategy in RCC requires a comprehensive understanding of the biology of response and resistance to targeted therapy. Here we review the clinical data regarding the efficacy and safety for sunitinib and highlight the importance of therapy management, as well as the potential use of clinical biomarkers in order to maximize the clinical benefit from sunitinib treatment in patients with mRCC.

The objective of this paper is to apply Principal Component Analysis to evaluate the aging state of the insulation system of the generators of Salto Grande identifying the mostly aged units. This hydropower plant has 14 generators of 135 MW each, with an average age of 32 years. From the analysis it was concluded that there is no evidence of critical units, which require rapid intervention. But there is an aging process, which is not equal on all generators, as there are generators showing a more advanced aging stage. This is key information to define a work plan for maintenance, or to recommend detailed inspections by specialists, or define an upgrade plan.

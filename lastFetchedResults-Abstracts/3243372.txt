This paper presents an optimization technique for optimal load shedding in power system. The technique is known as Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFAO). Load shedding is done by removing a certain amount of loads at appointed locations of a bus system. By doing so, the stability of the system can be improved, as well as the total power losses and total costs of shedded loads. The objective functions of total power losses, voltage stability index values and also total cost of shedded loads are used in determining the optimal load shedding in that particular system. In this research, the technique is implemented into IEEE 30-bus bus system. Simulations of BFAO proved that it can give a better result when compared to the base case values of total power losses and voltage stability index values of that particular bus system.

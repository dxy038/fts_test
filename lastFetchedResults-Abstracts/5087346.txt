OSPFOSPF is the most common intra-domain routing protocol in Wide Area Networks. Thus, optimizing OSPF weights will produce tools for traffic engineering with Quality of Service constraints, without changing the network management model. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) provide a valuable tool to face this NP-hard problem, allowing flexible cost functions with several metrics of the network behavior. A novel framework is proposed that enriches current models for network congestion with delay constraints, setting the basis for EAs that allocate OSPF weights, guided by a bi-objective cost function. The results show that EAs make an efficient method, outperforming common heuristics and achieving effective network behavior under unfavorable scenarios.

This paper presents the structure and capabilities of a small, grid-interactive distributed energy resource system comprised of a photovoltaic source, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, and various local loads. Implemented at the residential level, this system, with a plug-in hybrid electrical vehicle, has the ability to isolate a house from the utility grid (intentionally due to a fault or other abnormal grid conditions), work in the standalone mode, synchronize and reconnect to the utility grid, without load power interruptions. Plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles, with a built-in bidirectional power converter, present the opportunity for demand-response operation in the grid connected mode, whereas in the islanded mode, it can perform frequency and voltage regulation of the power bus. In this paper, system structure and modes of operation are described, and measured results are presented for two main modes of operation and mode transitions.

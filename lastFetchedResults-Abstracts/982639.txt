Our understanding of the plasma membrane, once viewed simply as a static barrier, has been revolutionized to encompass a complex, dynamic organelle that integrates the cell with its extracellular environment. Here, we discuss how bidirectional signaling across the plasma membrane is achieved by striking a delicate balance between restriction and propagation of information over different scales of time and space and how underlying dynamic mechanisms give rise to rich, context-dependent signaling responses. In this Review, we show how computer simulations can generate counterintuitive predictions about the spatial organization of these complex processes.

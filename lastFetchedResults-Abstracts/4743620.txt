Seagrasses are an important component in the marine ecosystem, and also a vulnerable resource subject to environmental change. Satellite and airborne remote sensing has been applied in monitoring and mapping seagrasses. One research issue from a remote sensing perspective is the spectral impact of water column depths since seagrasses normally grow in the optically shallow waters. The objective of this hyperspectral sensing study is to investigate the spectral characteristics of Thalassia testudinum at different water depths. The results indicated a close association between the water depths and reflectance, and a much stronger correlation between the depths and derivative spectra.

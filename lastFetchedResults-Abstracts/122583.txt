With regard to the great attention paid to the narrative point of view in the second half of the 20th century, one of the most conspicuous features of childhood and youthful vision is to concretize the incidents and the events of the stories and to avoid the writer's direct and partial interference with the story or the probable value judgements about the events which may mar the effect of the story.
It is evident that the innocent view of children who are far from the personal prejudice, which the adults cannot avoid, is very different from the adults' viewpoint. This same discrepancy endows the writer with the possibility to characterize his/her personages more concretely. Moreover, the disparity between the world pictured by young characters and that of the adults may reveal many social and psychological anomalies more tangibly: those facts which do not fit into the carefree and unaffected world of children like human pains such as social injustice and inequality; evils like envy and maliciousness. But instead, children in their look at their surrounding are endowed with a camera-like precision and meticulousness from which adults have lost. Thus, the writer sometimes equips himself/herself with this meek and innocent view, but judges what happens around him/her with the same maturity and sophistication of an adult on-looker.
This is the study of ten Persian contemporary writers' deliberate utilization of children's and adolescents' viewpoint in their stories and the advantage of this technique in objective delineation of the major issues of the stories.

As the key technology of electric vehicles(EV) ", "control systems is always the research hotspot of EV field. When the battery component of HEV operates at charge sustaining (CS) mode, the most important problem is how to split the whole vehicle\Â´s required power between engine and battery component reasonably and effectively so as to make the good economy and driving performance. Taking battery component of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Bus as the research object", "this paper established the model of feedback control system for battery component. Then the feedback control systems gains are optimized with the objective function of equivalent fuel consumption and accumulated power requirement error", "which is based on BUSRTE driving cycle. The obtained gains are testified and verified by NEWYORK and CBDBUS driving cycle respectively. The results indicate that the optimized control system for batteries has good fuel economy and driving performance.

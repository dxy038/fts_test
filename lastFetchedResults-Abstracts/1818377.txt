Objective: Previously, we screened 149 subjects and established four groups high or low for salivary killing of oral bacteria, and for aggregation and live and dead adherence of oral bacteria (as a combined factor). Caries scores were significantly lower in both High Aggregation–Adherence groups. Subsequently, we found that supragingival total biofilm DNA, total streptococci and two major streptococcal rRNA variants also were significantly lower in the High Aggregation–Adherence groups. In this study, we looked at the effects of those differences in salivary function on three periodontal pathogens. Design: Quantitative PCR was used to determine levels of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus) in stored DNA extracts of overnight supragingival biofilm collected from buccal upper central incisors (UC), lingual lower central incisors (LC) and buccal upper and lower first molars (BM) and lingual upper and lower first molars (LM) of subjects in the four groups. Results: A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were almost completely absent from these samples. T. forsythensis was found in 11 of 35 persons at the buccal molar site. Only two of those subjects were in the High Aggregation–Adherence groups, and that difference was statistically significant. The mean quantity of T. forsythensis also was significantly lower in the High Aggregation–Adherence groups. Conclusions: The difference between the Low and High Aggregation–Adherence groups might reflect direct interactions of salivary proteins with T. forsythensis. Alternatively, the higher levels of total biofilm and total streptococci seen in the Low Aggregation–Adherence groups might create a favourable environment for early secondary colonization of T. forsythensis.

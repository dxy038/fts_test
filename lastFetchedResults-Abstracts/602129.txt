Feature film, is one of the most popular means of mass communication; it is also a medium in which all forms of communication is being represented. The main objective of this paper is to examine the representation of intrapersonal communication in cinema and for this purpose we have chosen one of the Krzysztof Kieslowski's films. Kieslowski was one of auteur eastern European filmmakers. In this paper, with emphasis on "the Double Life of Veronique", we have analyzed Kieslowski’s special codes in displaying this type of communication. We have applied the semiotic approach to illustrate the usage of signs in this movie. In this article we have shown that the filmmaker, with his special technical codes, has represented both physical and psychological dimensions of a human being. He uses the signs, especially Jungian symbols in "analytical psychology", to display the intrapersonal communication. He illustrate a realistic approach to "dreaming" – one of the key themes in intrapersonal communication – to form a narrative about two dimensions of the main character.

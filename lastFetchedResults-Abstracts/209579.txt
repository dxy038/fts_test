Objective: to find changes in lipid metabolism among patients suffering from chronic liver disease. 
Design: Hospital based observational study. 
Setting: Medical Unit-II Sheikh Zayed Medical College, Rahim Yar Khan. 
Duration: January to July 2007. 
Patients and Methods: About 160 Patients admitted in Medical Unit-II with a diagnosis of chronic liver disease were included in the study. Fasting lipid profile was done in all cases. Micro Lab 300 chemistry analyzer performed lipid Profile by end point kit method. 
Results and Observations: There were 102 (63.75%) male and 58 (36.25%) were female patients. Total cholesterol was markedly decreased in 24 (15%) patients. Low to normal range was present in 132 (82.5%) patients. Hypercholesterolemia was seen in 4 (2.5%) patients. Hyper triglyceridemia was seen in one patient. Serum triglyceride levels were low to normal in 101 (63.13%) patients. HDL-c was below normal in all cases. LDL was low in 141 (88.13%) patients, normal in 12 (7.50%) patients and high in 7 (4.38%) patients. 
Conclusion: Dyslipidemia is a common finding in chronic liver disease. Lipid profile should be done in all cases with advanced liver disease.

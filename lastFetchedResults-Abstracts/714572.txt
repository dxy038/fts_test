Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification that plays a fundamental role in the regulation of many cellular processes. Phosphorylation can modulate protein properties such as enzymatic activity, stability, subcellular localization or interaction with binding partners. The importance of phosphorylation of the replication proteins of negative-strand RNA viruses has previously been documented but recent evidence suggests that replication of positive-strand RNA viruses – the largest class of viruses, including significant human, animal and plant pathogens – may also be regulated by phosphorylation events. The objective of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the various regulatory roles played by phosphorylation of nonstructural viral proteins in the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses.

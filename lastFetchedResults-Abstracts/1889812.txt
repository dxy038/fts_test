Intentional murder of a person is among the most heinous acts, whose punishment according to the holy Quran is eternal chastisement. Regardless of the reasons for murder, one of the significant related issues is the way of its commitment and punishment of culprits. The objective of this article is to study the murder of one person by several persons and its punishment in Islamic law and jurisprudence. Also attempts have been made to verify the authenticity of the known notion of Imamiyah jurisprudents, who permit the killing of all the murderers in retaliation for killing one person.  A study of the reasons of the advocates and opponents of permissibility of killing of all the murderers of one person indicates that, on the one hand, the reasons and theoretical documents regarding invalidity of numerical similarity between the murderer and slain forwarded by advocates of permissibility of retaliation are not enough and in some cases are not correct. On the other hand, considering the numerical similarity between the murderer and the slain as a valid base for permitting retaliation is more compatible with penal codes of Islam, for the punishment or retaliation in Islamic judicial system is based on the result of criminal act and its congruity with the punishment of the culprits. Since in murder of one person by several persons, the outcome is death of one person, and hence not more than one person can be killed in retaliation.

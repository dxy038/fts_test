We transferred the frequency of an ultrastable laser over a 108-km-long urban fiber link comprising 22 km of an optical communication network fiber simultaneously carrying Internet data traffic. The metrological signal and the digital data signal were transferred over two different frequency channels in a dense wavelength-division multiplexing scheme. The metrological signal was inserted in and extracted from the communication network using bidirectional off-the-shelf optical add-drop multiplexers. The link-induced phase noise was measured and canceled with a round-trip technique using an all-fiber-based interferometer. The compensated link showed an Allan deviation of a few 10<sup>-16</sup> at one second and below 10<sup>-19</sup> at 10,000 s. This work paves the way to a wide dissemination of ultrastable optical clock signals between distant laboratories via the Internet network.

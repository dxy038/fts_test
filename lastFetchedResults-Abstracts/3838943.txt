This paper proposes a new soft-switching bidirectional DC/DC converter. The proposed converter achieves zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for the entire main switches and zero-current switching for the rectifier diodes in the large-load range. These features reduce switching loss, voltage and current stresses, and diode reverse-recovery effect. The simple electrical isolated topology with the soft-switching characteristic provides an attractive solution for a battery charge/discharge system in an electric vehicle, distributed power system, or uninterruptible power system. This paper describes the operation principle and the ZVS condition in detail. The mathematical model based on the state-space averaging method is also deduced to depict the performance characteristic. Then, design guidelines are presented to ensure the ZVS condition for all the switches. Finally, simulation and experimental results obtained from a 1-kW prototype verify the discussed theoretical analysis.

In this paper, design and implementation of the space vector modulated 3 &#966;-3 &#966; matrix converter with bidirectional switches for AC motor application is presented. The control strategy, which employs space vector modulation to both output voltage and input current, and hardware design of the matrix converter system are described. In order to implement this strategy and deliver the PWM pulses to the appropriate switches, digital signal processor (DSP) and programmable logic device (PLD) are used. Experimental results manifest that sinusoidal input currents and output voltages with low frequency harmonics are achieved.

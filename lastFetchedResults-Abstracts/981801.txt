Focus and contemplation on sciences related to reading and study of Iranian handmade carpet is considered as one of research approaches to and solutions for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of this valuable historical, cultural and artistic phenomenon. Iranian carpet, as manifestation of Iranian national identity, has a high potential to be the subject of various fundamental, applied and developmental researches. Reading and analysis of Persian handmade carpet from perspective of linguistics, and semiotics, and semiotics-semantics is a new approach in the field of interdisciplinary studies. In the paper, we try to apply two French school discourse systems of semiotics-semantics, that is, tensional schema and semantic square, related to linguistics, to Sangeshko carpet (animal Lachak Toranj design), from Safavid era, which is kept in Miho Museum. The type of this research, and research method was descriptive-analytic, and data collection was conducted using documentary and library methods. The most important question of this research was if these two semiotic-semantic discourse systems, that is, tensional schema and semantic square can be applied to carpet weaving art, especially design of Sangeshko carpet (case study). The major objective of this research was to read and translate designs and themes depicted within the framework and in field of two discourse systems (tensional schema and semantic square) into Sangeshko carpet by linking and studying two semiotic-semantic discourse fields and design of carpet designs.

Passivity is the main objective of the haptic interface design. Whereas there is some omits and approximations in previous works, so the condition for passivity given in them is too conservative. The inherent problems in previous works are analyzed and further proved by simulation. A simple and intuitive approach based on the real frequency response of sampled-data systems is proposed here, and the condition for passivity of a haptic system is obtained. As can be seen from the simulation results, the condition for passivity given in this paper is nonconservative.

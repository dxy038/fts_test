To ensure efficient session continuity for every node in a Mobile Network NEMO Basic Support (NBS) protocol, an extension of MIPv6 has been proposed. The protocol NBS is not directly applicable in PMIPv6 domain as it is a network based mobility management protocol and mobility is transparent from mobile node. It is already proved that to support NEMO BSP in PMIPv6 domain some modifications are required in one of these two protocols or in both. This work is aimed at proposing a new definition of network mobility support in PMIPv6 domain such that they can form a hierarchy of mobile networks. The optimization of the communication path between a Mobile Network Node (MNN) and Corresponding Node (CN) is another objective of this work.

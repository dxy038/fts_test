In the last decades, cloth animation has been the focus of much research, due to demands from the entertainment industry and from e-commerce. That type of animation is most often the result of a physics-based simulation and has a high computational cost. The fabric model consists of a triangular mesh and uses a spring-mass-damper system to compute the forces among the particles, which are located at the mesh´s vertices. However, this work´s main objective is to study the dynamic behavior of cloth, using a remeshing procedure in order to adapt the mesh.

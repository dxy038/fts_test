This paper proposes a fuzzy TOPSIS method. An example including an application to distribution center location selection is investigated using the method to illustrate its applications and the differences from the traditional TOPSIS method. The traditional TOPSIS is only suitable for decision making under certain multi-criteria, which requires the decision-making criteria and the attribute entropy of the programs be certain. This study thus proposes fuzzy TOPSIS, which not only is well suited for evaluating fuzziness and uncertainty problems, but also can provide more objective and accurate criterion weights. For solving distribution center location selection problems by using objective and subjective attributes under group decision-making (GDM) conditions, the proposed system integrates fuzzy set theory (FST), the factor rating system (FRS) and simple additive weighting (SAW) to evaluate facility locations alternatives. The FSAWS is applied to deal with both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. The FSAWS process considers the importance of each decision-maker, and the total scores for alternative locations are then derived by homo/heterogeneous group of decision-makers. It is shown that the proposed fuzzy TOPSIS method performs better than other methods.

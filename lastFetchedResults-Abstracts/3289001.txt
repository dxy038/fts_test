Bi-directional optical frequency links for phase-stabilized frequency transfer require bi-directional amplifiers. Here we present some results from the development and test of two types of bidirectional amplifiers, Er<sup>+</sup>-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) and fibre Brillouin amplifiers (FBA). to be deployed along a fiber link connecting SYRTE/France and PTB/Germany.

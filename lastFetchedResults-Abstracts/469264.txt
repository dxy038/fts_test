Objective
The purpose of this study was to report pregnancy outcome and complication rates for women with recurrent late pregnancy loss who were treated with preconception transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage.
Study design
This was a case note review of 19 women at high risk for second trimester loss and early preterm delivery who were treated with preconception transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital from 1994 to 2003.
Results
Preconception transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage was associated with a postoperative fetal survival rate of 100% for pregnancies that reached >12 weeks of gestation, compared with a preoperative fetal survival rate of 12%. There were no significant intraoperative, antenatal, intrapartum or neonatal complications.
Conclusion
Within this case series, preconception transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage was a safe alternative to transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage that was performed in pregnancy with no risk to a fetus. It should be considered in appropriate cases in women seen for prepregnancy counseling.

Several techniques developed for performance monitoring and fault detection of machinery in the petrochemical industry is presented. The main objective is to perform condition monitoring and fault detection of a compressor based on the collected vibration and other on-site data from a Bently Navada data acquisition system. The analysis techniques developed, configuration and functions of the computer program are also briefly introduced. The techniques can be divided into four parts: (1) time-domain analysis, (2) frequency-domain analysis, (3) orbit analysis, and (4) trend analysis. The program developed has been tested using on-site data from a compressor at Suncor Inc

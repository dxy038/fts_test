The new generation of Steering-by-Wire systems currently under development has demanding requirements continuing operation even in the presence of component failures on the electronic architecture which must therefore provide fault-tolerance and real-time response. The objective of this paper is to provide the fault diagnostics and reconfiguration strategy with the robust adaptive observers in order to restrain the noises, interaction of sensor outputs and model uncertainties for Steering-by-Wire systems based on real-time and closed loop feedback performance. Applying the Steering-by-Wire system hardware-in-the-loop simulation test bench, theoretical analyses and practical results demonstrate the novel fault-tolerant control architecture can be accurately and reliably used for sensor online fault diagnostics and data reconstruction.

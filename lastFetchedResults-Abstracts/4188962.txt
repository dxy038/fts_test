The objective of this study was to identify and model constructs associated with over-runs in software testing time schedules. 40 industry experts from 30 organizational units were interviewed and conclusions were made using regression analysis. The analysis revealed that increased communication and interaction in the design phase between development and testing are associated with time schedule over-runs. This unexpected result may be either a consequence of more comprehensive testing with increased communication and interaction, leading to time schedule over-runs, or the testing time schedule is adjusted under project pressure because of underestimated testing resource needs. Lack of testing know-how was also associated with testing time schedule over-runs. The results of this study can be utilized in planning software testing time schedules.

Objective
Curcumin has antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it remains unknown whether curcumin has any protective effects on sepsis. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate whether curcumin prevents organ dysfunction in animals with sepsis.
Methods
Rats were randomized into four groups. The control group (group I, n = 7) did not receive any treatment. The curcumin group (group II, n = 10) only received 1.2 g/kg of curcumin. Escherichia coli were injected into the remaining groups intraperitoneally after general anesthesia. Five hours after injection, 12 rats received placebo (group III), and 10 rats received 1.2 g/kg of curcumin (group IV) for 7 d. All rats were sacrificed on postsepsis day 8 and a midline laparotomy was performed. Livers, kidneys, and small bowels were excised for evaluation of the degree of inflammation and tissue alterations histopathologically.
Results
In the liver, widespread hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes were seen in the sepsis group. There was no hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes and no portal inflammation in the sepsis/curcumin group. With respect to the small bowel, the sepsis group showed edema and prominent intraepithelial infiltration of neutrophil leucocytes and plasma cells. Inflammation and hyperemia in the lamina propria in the sepsis/curcumin group were less than those in the sepsis group. With respect to the kidneys, the sepsis group showed severe acute tubular necrosis that was more restricted in the sepsis/curcumin group than in the sepsis group.
Conclusion
Curcumin reduced organ dysfunction in rats with experimentally formed sepsis. We propose that curcumin may be useful in the therapy of organ dysfunction due to sepsis, shock, and other diseases associated with local or systemic inflammation.

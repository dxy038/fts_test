Automatic assessment of speech quality is one of the most important problems in mobile communication. In this paper the authors evaluate audio quality over frequency selective fading channel by using objective measurement model, Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ). We use basic version of PEAQ model which gives audio quality in terms of 11 model output variables (MOVs). Quality of speech degrades over such fading channel. The paper presents results showing amount of speech/audio quality degradation for fading mobile radio channels with different amounts of distortion in terms of ISI.

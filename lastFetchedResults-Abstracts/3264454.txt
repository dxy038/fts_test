We define a human motion data format for providing a character model with motion so that any motion capture data can be used to generate exchangeable human animation sequences through networks of heterogeneous computer systems. We have extended the ISO/IEC 19774 H-Anim specification to include motion definition in order to meet this objective. A character model can be prepared with any general graphics tool according to the hierarchical structure defined in the extended H-Anim specification. We can provide the character model with any captured motion data using the interfaces for motion parameters defined in the extended H-Anim specification, even when the data is not relevant to the character model initially. Several kinds of motion capture data can be applied to generate animation sequences for a character model; conversely, one kind of motion capture data can be applied to several different character models. New Joint and Motion nodes are defined for animation exchange in the H-Anim specification. Schema expansion and validation are also included.

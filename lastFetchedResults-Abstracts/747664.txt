One of the most central concepts in ancient Chinese philosophy and, at the same time, one of the most controversial and mysterious of them all, is the concept of “Tao”. This concept is so important that in ancient times it led to the development of a prominent philosophical school called Taoism. This word, which was used before Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, in the sense of the way of heaven and the way of the human world in Chinese dictionaries and enjoyed a completely objective aspect, has developed a profound metaphysical transcendent meaning in Dao De Jing. Therefore, it has given rise to various interpretations and perceptions of this world. According to Lao Tzu, Tao is beyond all distinctions and divisions and enjoys a completely imperceptible and different nature that is beyond all descriptions. After Lao Tzu, Chang Tzu, as the most prominent thinker of Taoism, interpreted Tao from a point of view slightly different from that of the first master. This paper deals with the views of ancient Chinese philosophers concerning Tao and seeks to explain them.

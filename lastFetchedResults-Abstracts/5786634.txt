RMondel (Reflective Mondel) is a reflective object-oriented specification language developed for the description of distributed systems. The objective of RMondel is to allow the development of dynamically modifiable specifications. Reflection in RMondel is supported by two fundamental features of reflection related to object oriented languages: structural reflection and computational reflection. The focus is mainly on structural reflection. With respect to computational reflection, the objects in the system are considered to share one interpreter. The main issue is to show how structural reflection can be useful to change dynamically a specification. The need for validation of the changes to maintain system consistency is also discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The objective of this work is to propose a knowledge based requirement engineering framework to arrive at a reusable design and deployment of a flood situation service in emergency management system software. In this proposed framework, the software requirement specifications are treated as input data with their corresponding association in multiple contexts. All such requirement information is fed into an expert system in the domain layer out of which the first class entities are derived to arrive at a meta-modeling of the target services. A set of contexts that concentrate upon the essential services with respect to deployment time and workflow parameters are considered as field knowledge. The knowledge base with all these information in multiple dimensions is treated as an engine to deliver the resulting design for the software services. The evolutionary computations under different conflicts are carried out as per the changing requirements. The proposed knowledge based system for changing emergency requirements of incident management software is evaluated in terms of maximum likelihood of the correct design with the growth and decay of incoming requests. The domain expert, meta-modeler and decision support modules are incorporated as knowledge based framework to arrive at an effective design for emergency management system.

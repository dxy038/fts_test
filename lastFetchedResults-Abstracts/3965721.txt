The objective of this paper is twofold: a simple formal test to verify that an emulator hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) technology is well suited for specific purposes (the <i>HIL</i> test) and the implementation of an HIL system using very common commercial-off-the-shelf technology (Peripheral component interconnect eXtensions for instrumentation modular instrumentation, LabVIEW Real Time, and Simulink Software Platforms). The HIL approach is used to develop electronic controllers for fuel cell systems (FCSs) by emulation of the FCS. As a conclusion, the HIL test in that specific application is assessed.

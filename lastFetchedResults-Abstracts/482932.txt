Introduction: Basement membranes are specialized extracellular matrices serve as development, proliferation and substrates for migration. Collagen fibers specially type IV, are the most important part of this area. As retina is one of the target organs in diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy are major cause of end stage - renal and retinal diseases and resulting in increased in morbidity and mortality of effected individuals, therefore early diagnosis leads to better treatment.
Objective: Investigation the appearance and distribution of collagen IV during gestational days and early postnatal period.
Materials and Methods: 24 intact female Balb/c mice were kept under normal nutrition and environment condition. After mating, vaginal plug was assumed as zero day of pregnancy. From (13th-18th) days, gestation pregnant mice were sacrified and their embryos as well as pups from 1st to 5th days were collected. For histochemichal studies, the head of specimens were fixed, histological preparation was done and by using monocolonal antibody against for tracing of collagen type IV were carried out.
Results: Our finding revealed that amount of collagen IV in internal limiting membrane (ILM) and extra cellular matrix (ECM) of the retina appearance on embryonic 16th day and increase continuously until end stage of embryonic life. In addition, strong labeling was observed until 3rd day of postnatal period but these reactions did not increase significantly after these periods.
Conclusion: These findings indicate that retinal development is dependent on different proteins by special regards specially collagen IV.

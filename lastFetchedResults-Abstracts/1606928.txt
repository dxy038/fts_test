Land cover/use changes and soil and forest degradation influence on emission of greenhouse gases effectively and lead to global warming. This research was done with objective of investigation of relationships between soil organic carbon density (SOCD) and primary terrain attribute in two depths 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm in Deylaman region, Giulan province. Stratified Random sampling method was used for determination of sampling plot location in uniform unit. A Walkely-Black method was used for content of soil organic carbon measurement. Finally, statistical and correlation analysis were used to understand the relationship between SOCD and primary terrain attributes. This research showed the primary terrain attributes had different roles on each land use/covers. Slope has significant impact on SOCD in forest land while has no significant role in cultivated land and rangeland. Aspect has not significant impact in different land covers/uses in 0-20 cm soil layer. Elevation has significant role on SOCD in cultivated land and rangeland while it has no significant impact in forest land. Exist of enough information about of impact of primary terrain attributes on increasing carbon sequestration process could be effective for land sustainable management in different land use especially in north of country.

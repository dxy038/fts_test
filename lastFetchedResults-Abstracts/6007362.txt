The Northern Isles New Energy Solutions (NINES) project is addressing the current and future energy needs of the Shetland Isles by demonstrating the integration of low carbon energy sources using smart grid technology. In so doing, NINES will facilitate a major step towards a low carbon future for Shetland whilst leading and informing the wider international low carbon energy transition. The principal objective of the NINES project is to enable more renewable connections in a geographical area that is deemed to have the richest renewable energy resources in Europe. As such, the electrically islanded Shetland power network will see significant changes in operation as district heating schemes, domestic space and water heating systems, energy storage systems and new wind connections are developed, deployed and integrated under an active network management system. This paper discusses the role of inter-dependent system models in providing essential inputs to active network management (ANM) design and configuration. Early results from model development and testing are presented with specific focus on the stability limits for the connection of additional renewable generation when operating in conjunction with frequency responsive demand.

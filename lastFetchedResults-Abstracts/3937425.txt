The form of electrotherapy known as interferential therapy is examined with particular application in the management of urinary incontinence. Objective validation of the treatment is described, which allows optimal positioning of the electrodes for a particular patient. It is shown that certain pad positions give rise to higher circulating currents in the pelvic floor, which also corresponds to greater muscle activity as indicated via a pressure probe method. It is shown that objective measurements can be made of muscle activity in sympathy with the difference frequency of two stimulating signals.

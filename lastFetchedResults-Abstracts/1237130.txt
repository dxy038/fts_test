In units of the refinery, sector of reaction hydrocracker unit has the highest operating pressure so the operation is very sensitive to this pressure and so raises the risk of leakage. The purpose of this research, health risk assessment, safety and the environment is in hydrocracker unit of Bandar Abbas Oil Refining Company. To identify environmental aspects and safety and health EFMEA method is used. Both inside and outside the country together to form a combined and the hydrocracker unit form is designed. And aspects of the normalization and overhaul activities are identified and evaluated. For this purpose, 24 activities in normal time and 6 in overhaul activities have been studied. Identify and ranking of aspect accepted based on previous experiences of the events occurred and, objective observations.  And 291 aspects in three stages of life cycle of production, consumption and disposal were identified and evaluated. 119 aspects of the risk priority number the higher the degree of risk taking have been. Degree of risk taking with the number 113 and the method of distribution have been calculated. The RPN aspects that have higher degree of risk taking Cases have been prioritized as a critical activity is considered. Then 10 percent of the RPN prioritized to three categories of very high risk, high and medium classification and analysis were and Corrective actions were defined for them. The results showed highest aspect the environmental risk at the time of overhaul With RPN 343 and the consumption is allocated. The greatest risks of unit Risks related to safety and health With 68 cases Equal to the environmental risk Is 54, The results show Hydrocracker unit control system, safety, health and environment is relatively high But due to the performance of this unit in high temperature and pressure control and stronger corrective actions to improve safety, it seems imperative.

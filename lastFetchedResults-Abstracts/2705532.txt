The Canadian Experiment for Soil Moisture in 2010 (CanEx-SM10) was carried out in Saskatchewan, Canada, from 31 May to 16 June, 2010. Its main objective was to contribute to Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission validation and the prelaunch assessment of the proposed Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission. During CanEx-SM10, SMOS data as well as other passive and active microwave measurements were collected by both airborne and satellite platforms. Ground-based measurements of soil (moisture, temperature, roughness, bulk density) and vegetation characteristics (leaf area index, biomass, vegetation height) were conducted close in time to the airborne and satellite acquisitions. Moreover, two ground-based in situ networks provided continuous measurements of meteorological conditions and soil moisture and soil temperature profiles. Two sites, each covering 33 km &#215; 71 km (about two SMOS pixels) were selected in agricultural and boreal forested areas in order to provide contrasting soil and vegetation conditions. This paper describes the measurement strategy, provides an overview of the data sets, and presents preliminary results. Over the agricultural area, the airborne L-band brightness temperatures matched up well with the SMOS data (prototype 346). The radio frequency interference observed in both SMOS and the airborne L-band radiometer data exhibited spatial and temporal variability and polarization dependency. The temporal evolution of the SMOS soil moisture product (prototype 307) matched that observed with the ground data, but the absolute soil moisture estimates did not meet the accuracy requirements (0.04 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>) of the SMOS mission. AMSR-E soil moisture estimates from the National Snow and Ice Data Center more closely reflected soil moisture measurements.

We give an overview of random matrix theory (RMT) with the objective of highlighting the results and concepts that have a growing impact in the formulation and inference of statistical models and methodologies. This paper focuses on a number of application areas especially within the field of high-dimensional statistics and describes how the development of the theory and practice in high-dimensional statistical inference has been influenced by the corresponding developments in the field of RMT.

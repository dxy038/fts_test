Context and objective: The public trust in the police is deemed as the
main index of police performance. Hence, attracting the trust of citizens
and meeting their satisfaction by the police has the vital importance
for evaluation and improvement of police performance. Perception and
attitude of individuals to the police is dependent to the values, norms
and social beliefs. Thus, in a society including different cultures, various
attitudes have been formed to the police. Studying the public trust to the
police under the effect of different cultures and social values demands
different knowledge and insight. Therefore, in the extant paper these
factors in the Iranian police are studied.

of citizens over 18 years old of Tehran, out of which a sample consisted of
400 elements has been determined based on cluster sampling.
Conclusion and recommendation: the results of findingsâ€™ analysis
indicated that a positive and significant relationship exists between three
attitudinal factors and public trust. Ultimately, according to the obtained
results, some suggestions have been presented for increasing the public
interest in the police.

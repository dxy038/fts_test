One of the well known methods for monitoring raw milk bacterial quality, is to determine total bacterial count (TBC), which has a particular interest to the fanners and processors. Standard plate count (SPC) can be used as a method for determining bacterial load of raw milk. Evaluation of TBC of raw milk on-farm level by using SPC was the main objective of this research. Seven farms were selected randomly and microbiological quality of fresh raw milk was monitored in different steps such as: before and after removal of first part of removed raw milk and also bulk milk that was collected in storage tank. The results showed that removing of contaminated milk from teat chanal has a distinct effect on reduction of bacterial count in fresh milk but it is more important to segregate different grade of raw milk in storage step, due to high bacterial count of mixed raw milk in bulk tank. It can be concluded that microbiological quality of raw milk produced by those farmers was inferior and it is recommended that training and guidance should be given to them.

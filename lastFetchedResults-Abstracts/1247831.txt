Fresh figs have a short shelf-life due to a fast softening rate and fungal spoilage. Infrared heating treatment as a surface decontamination technique could be applied to the ostiole, where most mould growth is observed. However, the quality of fresh fruits could be degraded if the heat treatment is too severe. The objective of this study is to find the optimal trade-off between a fungal decay reduction and a fruit quality. Figs were treated with infrared heating until they reached maximum temperatures of 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C. A heat transfer model was employed to calculate the treatment time required for each treatment group. Quality assessment was performed after six days of storage at 7 °C. At the lowest heating treatment group of 50 °C, a suppression of fungal development was achieved without a significant heat injury.

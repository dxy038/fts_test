Security of electrical energy supply in defencive sites is affected by different parameters like natural disasters and enemy attacks. So, attention to principles of passive defence for design and enhancement of electrical networks in defencive sites is critical. The objective of this study is to increase security of energy supply in defencive sites from the standpoint of passive defence. Due to the presence of DG units and the uncertainty of their power, common methods of security evaluation of energy supply are not applicable directly. For this propose, a new framework for optimal allocation of hybrid energy resources in these sites is presented so that networks technical constraints is satisfied beside energy resources uncertainty and sensitive loads priorities. Supply adequacy of consumers is evaluated by solving a set of optimal power flow equations. Finally, a comprehensive algorithm based on imperialist competitive algorithm, scenario reduction, and optimal power flow is proposed. The optimization problem is formulated as combination of a mixed integer nonlinear programming main problem and a set of nonlinear programming sub problems, taking into consideration the system constraints during all computational steps. The proposed model is presented in MATLAB and GAMS environments and optimal mix of energy resources is obtained to increase energy security of defensive sites and to reduce outage of critical loads, towards principles of passive defense (proliferation, diversification, and dispersation). Final results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in optimal design of hybrid energy resources and remarkable improvement of energy supply security.

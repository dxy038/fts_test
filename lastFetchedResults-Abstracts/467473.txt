Objective: The purpose of this study was to establish whether nimesulide causes fewer fetal side effects than indomethacin or sulindac after short-term maternal exposure for tocolysis. Study Design: This was a double-blind, double-dummy prospective randomized study with three drug treatment groups (n = 10 per group) that were comprised of subjects who were at 28 to 32 weeks of gestation with preterm contractions. The subjects were treated in the delivery suites of two busy inner-city teaching hospitals; the intervention consisted of 48 hours of treatment and with 72 hours of follow-up observation with indomethacin 100 mg (twice daily), sulindac 200 mg (twice daily), or nimesulide 200 mg (twice daily). The amniotic fluid index, hourly fetal urine production, and ductal Doppler pulsatility index observations were monitored before the treatment and at 4, 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours after the treatment was started. The statistical analysis used repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni test, and Bland-Altman agreement. Significance assumed when the probability value was <.05. Results: Each drug caused a significant reduction in all three observations over the 48-hour treatment period, which recovered to pretreatment levels by 72 hours after treatment. There were no significant differences among drugs for any of these effects. Conclusion: Nimesulide causes similar short-term fetal side effects to indomethacin and sulindac.

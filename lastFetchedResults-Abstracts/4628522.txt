This paper is devoted to locating petrol stations in Abidjan, showing their positions on a map to enable consumers to access them more easily. The objective is to study the mode of construction of the stations, identify high concentration areas, empty areas and propose a better organization. This study will also help the motorists to find the nearest filling station by using GPS. The necessary condition to perform such analysis is full description of local coordinates using GPS. The paper shows methodology for performing such analysis and how to represent geographic coordinates on a map using ArcGIS 9.3. The results indicate that this system can allow consumers to locate petrol stations in the Central Business District and the outskirt without encountering any difficulties. It can also help in locating infrastructural facilities like schools, hospitals, pharmaceutical shops and etc.

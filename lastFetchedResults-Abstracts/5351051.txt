In supply chain-oriented management, facility layout is a main factor for the enterpriseÂ´s benefit. There were few papers solving the discrete formulation of facility layout for its weakness though it has been deeply deliberated. An improved genetic algorithms-based approach was presented for solving a supply chain-oriented and dynamic discrete facility layout problem. Determining proper locations for given departments on facility layout problem (FLP) was one task in facility layout planning. Its objective was to minimize material handling costs or total distance that walk back and forth. Detailed information has been acquired by the author using survey, sample analysis, case study, numerical analysis, application, genetic operation and systematic thinking. In summing up it may be stated that numerical analysis and case study of DongBei special steel group in China show the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model, software and genetic algorithm dealing with such kind of problems

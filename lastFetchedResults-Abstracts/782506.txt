The objective of this review paper is to report research findings on the role of milk protein
and indigenous enzymes on the ability of ewe and goat milk to be processed and on the
quality of dairy products. Emphasis is placed on the role of casein characteristics and of
indigenous enzymes on flavour, rheology, texture, and biofuncionality of ewe and goat
cheese.
Finally, the review highlights that further study is needed on milk protein genetic variants
in ovine species, and on the role of indigenous enzymes, especially minor proteolytic
enzyme systems, on the quality of small ruminants milk and dairy products

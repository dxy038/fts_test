Objective Depression is a major public
health problem. Work stress is associated with
depression and workers whose jobs impose high
levels of psychological demands, such as truck
drivers, may be at increased risk. The aim of this
study was to investigate the prevalence and correlates
of depression in truck drivers. Method This
was a cross-sectional study of 300 male truck drivers.
Presence and severity of depression were assessed
by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview followed by the Beck Depression Inventory
Short Form. Relevant demographic, clinical and
occupational data were collected using a purposebuilt
questionnaire. Results The prevalence of
depression among truck drivers was 13.6%. Multivariate
analysis showed that being 45 years or older
had a protective effect (OR = 0.19; P = 0.02),
whereas low educational level (OR = 3.03; P = 0.01),
use of stimulants (OR = 5.03; P < 0.01) and wageearning
(OR = 2.84; P = 0.01), as opposed to selfemployment,
increased the risk for depression.
Conclusions Truck drivers are at increased risk for
depression when compared to the general population.
Efforts to increase awareness of this problem
and to limit the use of stimulants, as well as measures
to improve job satisfaction, particularly among
the wage-earning drivers, may have a positive impact
on mental health in these workers

The objective is to find the topological layout of links at a minimal cost under the constraint that the overall reliability of the constructed network is not less than a given level of system reliability. A decomposition method which is based on a branch-and-bound approach is proposed for solving it. A method is presented to determine a lower bound on the minimum number of links in a network which may satisfy the reliability constraint. The solution method is illustrated with a numerical example, and computational experiments are also given

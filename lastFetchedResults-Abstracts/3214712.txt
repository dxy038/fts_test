Since the last decades the next step in radar architecture referred as multiple input multiple output (MIMO) has become an attractive field of research due to its potential to clearly increase radar performance. MIMO radar offers new perspectives to improve target detection and localization (waveform design, antenna configuration design, multistatic fusion decision for example). This work focus on transmitting antenna configuration design with the objective of increasing the crossrange resolution with some constraints on sidelobe levels. The design is realized through an optimization with a genetic algorithm in free space then the obtained configuration is tested for through the wall (TTW) imaging. In this paper, MIMO radar and its application for TTW detection is first discussed. Thereafter we present the free space imaging processing and its extension to through the wall. Then we derive the optimization procedure and the obtained transmitting antenna configuration is tested on different scenarios in free space and TTW. Finally, we conclude with some discussions about results.

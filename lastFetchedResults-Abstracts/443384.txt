Objective
The purpose of the current study was to review characteristics of patients with nipple discharge who underwent ductoscopy-assisted excisional biopsy who had a final diagnosis of carcinoma.
Methods
A retrospective review was performed of patients presenting with pathologic nipple discharge (PND) who underwent ductoscopy-assisted excisional biopsy and had a final diagnosis of carcinoma.
Results
A total of 14 (7%) of 188 patients who underwent ductoscopy-assisted excision had a final pathology of ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) (12/14, 86%) or invasive breast cancer with DCIS (2/14, 14%). Duct wall irregularities or intraluminal growths were visualized during ductoscopy in 8 of the 14 (57%) breast cancer patients. There were no visual abnormalities noted during ductoscopy that accurately predicted a final diagnosis of malignancy.
Conclusions
Although occult malignancies can be identified in patients undergoing ductoscopy-assisted biopsy for PND, no clear morphologic changes visualized during ductoscopy definitively indicated the presence of malignancy.

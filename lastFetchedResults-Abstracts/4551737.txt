Based on analyzing the existing trust model in P2P networks, especially the trust model-Grep thoroughly, aiming at the shortcomings of Grep model, this paper proposes a new trust model,-Grep-1 which realizes the dynamic changes of the peerÂ´s reputation as well as determines trust level of peers based on the importance of trade. Then we also designs an introducer protocol in the Grep-1 model that is used by peers to find an appropriate to build trust relationship with the peer he does not know before, which can transmit the trust farther. At last, we deal with the implementation of Grep-1 model. The corresponding theory proves that the Grep-1 model is more effucient and objective to P2P E-commerce translations.

Introduction: Oligodendrocytes are myelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS) which develop from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Opalin is a unique molecular marker for mature and myelinating oligodendrocyte. Olig1/2 plays a regulatory function in the differentiation of OPCs to oligodendrocyte. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has been shown to play an important role in the proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocytes. 
Objective: In this study the effects of CNTF on Opalin, Olig1/2 expression in the cerebral cortical extracts of Cuprizone induced multiple sclerosis (MS) has been investigated. 
Materials and Methods: The mice were treated by Cuprizone for five weeks in order to induce MS. The mice were then divided into 3 groups. The first group was injected subcutaneously (SC) by CNTF in the amount of 2 ?g/kg BW. The second group (SHAM) was injected SC by phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the third group was left without injection as the control group. After five weeks the mice were killed and the cerebral cortex was harvested and the expression of Opalin and Olig1/2 was studied by Western blotting. 
Results: The results from this study show that the expression of Opalin, Olig1/2 was significantly increased in the CNTF injected group as compared to the other groups. 
Conclusion: It is concluded that CNTF enhances Opalin, Olig1/2 expression and may play important role in the pathophysiology of MS. It is also concluded that CNTF may be a regulator in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte from OPCs.

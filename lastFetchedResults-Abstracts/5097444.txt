This paper proposes a method for power system expansion planning with sizing of gas-fired distributed generation units, considering natural gas system constraints. The proposed model allocates gas-fired distributed generation units and determines the capacity of them. Furthermore, the lines and substations that should be expanded are addressed. The objective function of the optimization problem is the total construction and operation costs, and a combinatorial fast method, is utilized to solve it. The method is employing CLA-PSO to be suitable for large scale systems.

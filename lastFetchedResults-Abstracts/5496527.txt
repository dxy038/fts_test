There is some imperfection in capacity calculation method called stop line method adopted by "Design specifications of urban roads" when it is used to calculate capacities of reformed signalized plane intersections. The objective of this research is to improve existing stop line method. Based on engineering projects and existing specifications, nominal increase and decrease coefficients have been brought in and a mathematical model for calculating reformed signalized plane intersection capacities has been established. Through case analysis and computer simulation, the model has proved scientific, which can make designers calculate capacities of reformed signalized plane intersections more precisely and evaluate traffic benefits of reformation schemes more objectively.

We present a new approach for linking heterogeneous data of the same objective nature, such as 2D maps, 3D virtual environments and videos with GPS data. We have identified three key challenges (georeferencing, content creation for geospatial videos and bidirectional linking) that should be addressed to link among geographic hypermedia. We propose an easily implementable data model that serves well as a foundation for point query in 2D and attribute query in a video. We also present a point query processing algorithm for video browsing by using the modified R-tree. The proposed method supports geographic hypermedia navigation by providing the bidirectional linking. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective in retrieving geospatial video clips and nonspatial data.

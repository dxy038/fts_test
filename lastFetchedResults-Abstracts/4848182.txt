The objective of this work is to extend universal plug and play (UPnP) that provides currently only local service discovery, to scalable and wide area discovery. This is achieved by combining the widely deployed UPnP framework with the INS/Twine intentional naming system that achieves naming and resource discovery over distributed overlay networks suitable for wide area coverage. A transcoder has been designed to achieve the required interworking between the two systems

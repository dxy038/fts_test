Objectives
The purpose of this study was to assess the physiologic significance of coronary artery lesions with an integrated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) device.
Background

Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with SPECT is of value for assessing the physiologic significance of coronary lesions. Computed tomography coronary angiography is a new technique to noninvasively detect coronary stenosis, with high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) but lower specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). The experimental SPECT/CTCA hybrid imaging device (Infinia gamma camera and LightSpeed16 CT, General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) enables concurrent assessment of coronary anatomy and myocardial perfusion.
Methods

Fifty-six patients with angina pectoris underwent single-session SPECT-MPI and CTCA with the hybrid device and coronary angiography (CA) within 4 weeks. The ability of fused SPECT/CTCA images to diagnose physiologically significant lesions showing >50% stenosis and reversible perfusion defects in the same territory was determined and compared with CTCA stand-alone.
Results

Of a total of 224 coronary segments in 56 patients, 12 patients and 54 segments (23%) were excluded from further analysis of CTCA. Overall, 170 coronary segments were evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of CTCA were 96%, 63%, 31%, and 99%, respectively, as compared with 96%, 95%, 77%, and 99%, respectively, for SPECT/CTCA.
Conclusions

Hybrid SPECT/CTCA imaging results in improved specificity and PPV to detect hemodynamically significant coronary lesions in patients with chest pain. Single-photon emission computed tomography/CTCA might play a potentially important role in the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease and introduce an objective decision-making tool for assessing the need for interventions in each occluded vessel.

Bidirectional DC-DC converters are used in many applications when bidirectional energy transfer between two DC buses is needed. This paper presents a bidirectional dc-dc converter with coupled inductor. High voltage conversion ratio is achieved and the leakage-inductor energy is recycled in both discharge mode and charge mode. Also, the switch voltage stress is reduced by the clamping circuit to achieve high efficiency in the proposed converter. An experimental circuit is implemented to verify the feasibility. The conversion efficiency can achieve 94.3% in discharge mode and 92.6% in charge mode.

On the basis of the electrical discharge machining (EDM) deviceÂ´s technical requirements, this paper applies fuzzy control technology to numeric control pulse power supply. By designing the fuzzy control rules, we have realized the intelligent control of molding devices. The result of the power supply experiment indicates that this control project has achieved the design objective.

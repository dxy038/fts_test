Based on the life cycle of business process reengineering (BPR), BPR is decomposed into business reengineering (BR) at the strategic and tactical levels and process reengineering at the operational level, including process structural and parametric optimization, respectively. Quality-function-deployment-centered integrated tools are proposed to support the rational analysis and decision making in BR. The analytic hierarchy process is utilized to evaluate the intangible attributes. Questionnaire and stochastic simulation are used to determine the strategic goals. Correlation analysis is employed to appraise the effects of each reengineering objective on customer requirements and other reengineering objectives. The slack-adjusted assurance region data envelopment analysis model is developed to estimate the performance levels of benchmarked organizations and to predict the possible investment and incurred performances. Finally, the decision of reengineering objectives and their performance levels in a specified phase is made through the 0-1 integer programming model considering cost-effective predictive results, which brings about the formation of tactical goals. The proposed tools provide structured approaches to set strategic and tactical goals, and organically link them. Thus, they can provide a powerful support for aligning business strategies, information technology tactics, and business processes of reengineering organization with customer requirements. An illustrative example demonstrates the application of the systematic analysis and decision-making methodology supported by the proposed analytic tools.

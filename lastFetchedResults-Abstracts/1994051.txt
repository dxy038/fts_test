Background & Objective: Sarcocystosis is caused by the genus of Sarcocystis, an intracellular protozoan parasite in the phylum Apicomplexa. More than one hundred species of Sarcocystis can infect domestic and wild animals. This parasite is pathogenic for animals such as cattle and sheep; it also causes gastrointestinal symptoms in humans. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotyping of Sarcocystis strains in North Khorasan province.
Materials&Methods: In this study, 320 samples of liver, diaphragm, heart and muscles were collected from 80 sheep (40 males and 40 females).The histological study was conducted for finding Sarcocyst. Furthermore, for observation of sarcocystis bradyzoite, 70 g of each tissue were digested using tissue digestion. PCR analysis was performed on all samples. Sequencing was done on 12 PCR product. Also, genotyping was carried out by Blast search and the homology analysis on 18 sRNA region. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16  software.
 Results. Sarcocyts were seen  using histological method.  Tissue digestion method showed that all samples(100%)were infected with Sarcocystis. Genotyping of 12 samples proved that sarcocystis belonged to Sarcocystis tenella (75%), Sarcocystis moulei (8/33%), and Sarcocystis gigantea (16/66%). 
Conclusion: The prevalence of Sarcocystis infection was high in the tissues of sheep in North Khorasan province. Moreover, Sarcocystis  tenella,  Sarcocystis moulei and Sarcocystis gigantea  were reported for the first time in this province and Sarcocystis tenella was the most common species.

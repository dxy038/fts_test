A linear quadratic bumpless transfer technique for a six-degree-of-freedom planar actuator with integrated active magnetic bearing is proposed to solve the lift-off and landing problem by switching between different controller sets. The need for multiple controller operation states results from the difference between robustness and wind-up concerns during lift-off and landing and the high performance tracking requirements for accurate operation. A procedure for tuning the plant input and error matrices used in the Linear Quadratic Bumpless Transfer method based on new observations is presented. The procedure has been applied to synthesize a bidirectional bumpless switching mechanism that was successfully applied and tested on a 6 DOF laboratory setup.

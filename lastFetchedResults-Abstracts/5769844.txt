9000kN bridge erecting machine for high-speed railway constructions is used as an object of study in this paper. According to the geometrical structure and features shape of this machine, the characteristic parameters are selected to simplify the structure model. A model of high-speed railway bridge erecting machine is established, using finite element software ANSYS and APDL parametric language. The structural optimization design is studied in the paper, in which the mass of this bridge erecting machine is the optimization objective, and the structural parameters are the design variables. Under the condition of the constraint of the strength and stiffness, the structural parameters are optimized to reduce the mass. After optimazation, the mass of the machine is reduced by 11%. It is shown that this method can short design period, reduce the cost of design and gain accurate result.

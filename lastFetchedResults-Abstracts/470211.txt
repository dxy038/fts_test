Objective
In this study, human preterm amnion cells were investigated in 3-dimensional (3D) cell-matrix culture systems in an attempt to design therapeutic strategies for preterm premature rupture of the membranes.
Study design
Three-dimensional collagen I and fibrin cellâ€“containing biomatrices were created to mimic the architecture of native amnion. Amnion mesenchymal cells were embedded in 3D matrices, and epithelial cells were placed on top of these matrices. Cell viability and morphology were visualized by DiI-ac-LDL, F-actin, and nuclear staining. Proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was investigated using gelatine zymography.
Results
Preterm amnion epithelial and mesenchymal cells cultured in collagen I and fibrin matrices assume cell morphologies similar to those observed in vivo. Mesenchymal cells were capable of remodelling collagen I, as seen by extensive volume contraction, by 40% at day 1 and 80% at day 5. Matrix contraction was independent of the presence of epithelial cells, and could not be inhibited by GM6001 and/or aprotinin. No contraction was observed in fibrin matrices over 8 days. The migratory response of mesenchymal cells cultured in 3D fibrin matrices supplemented with fibronectin was associated with specific activated MMP-9.
Conclusion
Three-dimensional fibrin matrices might be useful in amnion cell tissue engineering, including cell-matrix transplantation.

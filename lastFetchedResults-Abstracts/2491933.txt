Estimation of genetic trends is necessary to monitor and evaluate selection programs. The objective of this study was to estimate the genetic trends for milk yield in Iranian Holsteins cows using random regression test day model. Data set was consisted of 743205 test-day records from 1991 to 2008, which were collected by the Animal Breeding Centre of Iran. Breeding, environmental and phenotypic values were estimated using a random regression test-day model. The logarithmic form of Wood function was chosen to fit the additive genetic and permanent environmental effects of milk yield. Genetic, environmental, phenotypic trends were estimated by regressing the mean of breeding values, environmental values and phenotypic values on birth year. The genetic and phenotypic trends were positive and significant, whereas environmental trends were not significant. Genetic trends of sires and dams were estimated separately and it was positive and significant for dams, but it was not significant for sires. The phenotypic, environmental and genetic correlation between each days in milk and total 305 days were estimated. The correlations related to breeding values were weak and it showed that with the logarithmic transformation of milk yield, persistency can be improved independently from milk production.

Inverse metabolic engineering is a useful approach for engineering phenotypes in biological systems. The overarching objective of this approach is to combine the power of evolutionary engineering approaches with the precision of constructive metabolic engineering strategies. Often the difficulty in this approach is elucidating the genetic basis of the phenotypes that emerge as a result of evolutionary mechanisms. As a result of advances in genomics technologies, several techniques now exist that substantially improve researchers ability to identify such genes. Metabolic engineers now have the ability to map phenotypic landscapes of considerable genetic diversity, which should improve understanding of the relationships that exist among phenotype, genotype, and environment. In this mini-review, we will discuss several of such genomics tools that may be useful in developing inverse metabolic engineering strategies and, in particular, mapping phenotypic landscapes.

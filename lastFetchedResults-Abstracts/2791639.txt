The use of SCADA systems has been increased since the 1960s as a need arose to more efficiently monitor and control the status of remote equipment. And they are becoming more and more susceptible to cyber-attacks due to utilize standard protocols and increase connectivity. The objective of this paper is to introduce our on-going work and discuss challenges and opportunities for preventing network and application protocol attacks on SCADA systems.

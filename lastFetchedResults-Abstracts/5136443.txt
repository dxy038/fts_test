Accuracy of measurement data has direct bearing on the quality of optical tomography, and in some special tissues, the region of interested is not at the center. Therefore, a new optimization strategy of fiber positions is proposed for the special case. In the new strategy, sources and detectors are located nearest to the surface of region of interested. On the other hand, the transport model of photon also has important effect on the reconstructed results, and diffuse equation is often used in many researches. However, diffusion model has great disadvantages for many cases, so the equation of radiative transfer is imported in this paper. In the reconstruction process, a gradient tree algorithm is put forward to implement the gradient computation of objective function with respect to optical parameters. Experimental results show that the quality of reconstructed images and convergence of reconstruction process are greatly improved based on the equation of radiative transfer with the optimized strategy, and the computation complexity is also significantly reduced at the same time.

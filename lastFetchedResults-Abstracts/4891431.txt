Microscopic traffic flow models have been widely used in decision making and evaluation of real transportation systems and the models must be calibrated before use in order to content the credibility of decision and evaluation. For a kind of microscopic traffic flow model (Transportation analysis and simulation system model, TRANSIMS), a new optimal objective function is adopted which is based on the mean and standard deviation of the traffic fundamental graphic data. According to this objective function, a method of successive weighted average algorithm is used to search the optimal parameter. After these process, the model is calibrated. The studies show that the optimal parameter can always be found, and the relative error between the best parameter and real parameter is less than 10%.

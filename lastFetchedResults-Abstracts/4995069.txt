This paper presents an approach to EcoDesign for product variety. The objective of the research is to get a quantified life cycle scenario to support design, manufacturing and life cycle management. Towards this goal proposed is a novel multi-objective optimization framework in which the problem is structured as minimizing the deviations from the concerned objectives. A mathematic programming method called Goal Programming(GP) help designers to solve the problem, which previously had been based on experience together with evaluation of individual objectives in isolation. Our proposed method is particularly valuable in a multi-objective situation where there are a number of important and incommensurable objectives that belong to several different interest groups(user, maker and/or government). Parametric study is performed to analyze the trend of change of variables with the changes of parameters and objectives priorities. The multi-objective optimization algorithm will provide a set of non-dominant. designs where a further improvement for one objective will be at the expense of another. From the set the preferable one can be selected based on selected criteria by life cycle simulation or other means. Fuzzy set is used to quantify and transform incomplete and ambiguous information when determining values of parameters for modeling product life cycle. Existing refrigerator is used as a demonstration example

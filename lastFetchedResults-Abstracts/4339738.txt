The introduction of distributed generation (DG) into distribution networks has a significant effect on losses. This effect can be detrimental or beneficial depending on where DG units are allocated and which sizes they have. This paper deals with optimal siting and sizing of DG units for minimizing the total power losses in a radial distribution network under bidirectional and unidirectional power flow scenario. An enhanced genetic algorithm (EGA) is used for effectively explore the problem search space. Moreover, a simple and straightforward penalty function is presented in which the normalization of the violations is not needed. The method is implemented and tested on a typical 16-bus distribution network. Simulation results indicate that unidirectional flow constraint may restricts the ability of DG units to minimizing the network losses.

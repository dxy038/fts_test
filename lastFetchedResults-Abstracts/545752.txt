Objective
Development is a complex process, completed over a specific period of time, 
through the maturation of the nervous system. It is affected by genetic, ethnic, 
nutritional, social, and economic factors; one of the environmental factors 
affecting the acquisition of motor skills in infants is the use of baby walkers. Since 
this device is very commonly used for infants in our country, we conducted this 
study to evaluate its effects on the acquisition of motor skills in this age group 
of children. 
Materials & Methods
This longitudinal study was conducted in 2005 on 300 infants referring to the 
Primary Health Care Centers of Kashan district in 1384; the infants were divided 
into two groups of 150 babies each, with the case group using baby walkers, 
while the other 150, the controls, did not. All babies were followed for two 
years, and the ages for acquisition of motor skills were documented during 
face-to face or telephone interviews with the parents. Data were analyzed using 
the T-test and the Chi Square test.
Results
Of the study population, 175 babies (58.33%) were male. The mean age of 
acquisition of motor skills including rolling, crawling, moving on hands and 
feet, sitting without and with help, standing and walking dependently and 
independently were found to be delayed in infants using baby walkers, a 
difference between the two groups of walker users and non- walker users that 
was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
Considering the adverse effects that walkers have on the acquisition of motor 
skills in infants, as demonstrated by the results of this study, we do not 
recommend the use of baby walkers in infants.

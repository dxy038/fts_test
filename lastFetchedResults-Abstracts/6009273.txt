The scope of this work is to design an Optical Transport Network unifying the physical topology design, virtual topology design and routing and wavelength assignment. The objective is to calculate the global optimal solution, instead of partial solutions. The Mathematical Formulation defined here is based on the Quadratic Assignment Problem, and it could be used for networks with either grooming feature, or not, by allocating sub-wavelength demands, represented by SDH/SONET payload units. Two heuristics to solve this problem are proposed, the EXATO Heuristic, and a GRASP Heuristic. The results showed that the approach was successful to design a low cost optical network.

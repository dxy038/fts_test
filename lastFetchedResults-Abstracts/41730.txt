This paper presents the results of an analysis of radar airborne scatterometer data obtained over an Austrian black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold ssp. nigricans Host.) forest in Loz√®re, France. This system provides vertical sounding inside canopy from which can be derived tree height estimations. The objective of this paper is to analyse the validity of these measurements and, then, to study the interest of this kind of sensors for better forest management. The mean and top height estimations give very good results with a relative error of about 6%. The radar measures the back scatter coefficient of the vegetation from which can be estimated other parameters such as stem volume or basal area. The radar backscatter coefficient is found to be sensitive to the biomass in a low to intermediate range of values (0-200 m3/ha), particularly when the canopy backscattering is separated from the ground echo. The estimation of stem volume using a regression with both tree height estimations and backscatter measurements gives satisfying results. Finally, we discuss the interest of this kind of sensor data for an improved and detailed forest management giving an example of application on the evaluation of the variability of the local site index within a stand.

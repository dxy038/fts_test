An overriding objective in the development of this on-line course was to create &#8220;reasons&#8221; for individuals to engage in the material. The population consisted of very busy classroom teachers. Course developers purposely designed the structure to be student-centered so that participants relied on each other for input. As discussed above, this was accomplished through the jigsaw strategies that made participants depend on each other for essential information in creating the Earth systems diagrams. There is always room for improvement and fine tuning, but developers have been pleased with the implementation of this course. After minor tuning, it will soon be offered again and will provide a model for development of other on-line courses

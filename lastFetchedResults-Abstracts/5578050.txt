The pre processing phase is essential in knowledge data discovery process. We study too particularly the data filtering in supervised context, and more precisely the feature selection. Our objective is to permit a better use of the data set. Most of filtering algorithm use myopic measures, and give bad results in the case of the features correlated part by part. Consequently in the first time, we build two new contextual criteria. In the second part we introduce those criteria in an algorithm similar to the greedy algorithm. The algorithm is tested on a set of benchmarks and the results were compared with five reference algorithms: Relief, CFS, Wrapper (C4.5), consistancySubsetEval and GainRatio. Our experiments have shown its ability to detect the semi-correlated features. We conduct extensive experiments by using our algorithm like pre processing data for decision tree, nearest neighbours and naive Bays classifiers.

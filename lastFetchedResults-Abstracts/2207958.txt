Transparent conductive oxides (TCO) are indispensable as front electrode for most of thin film electronic devices such as transparent electrodes for flat panel displays, photovoltaic cells, windshield defrosters, transparent thin film transistors, and low emissivity windows. Thin films of aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) have shown to be one of the most promising TCOs. In this study, three layered Al-doped ZnO (AZO)/ZnMgO/AZO heterostructures were prepared by filtered cathodic arc deposition (FCAD) on glass substrates. The objective is to find a set of parameters that will allow for improved optical and electrical properties of the films such as low resistivity, high mobility, high number of charge carriers, and high transmittance. We have investigated the effect of modifications in thickness and doping of the ZnMgO inner layer on the structural, electrical, and optical characteristics of the stacked heterostructures.

Acute toxicity to fish hepatoma cell line PLHC-1 and to juvenile rainbow trout was examined for 18 plant protection products. The main objective was to explore whether hepatoma cells could be used to predict acute toxicity in fish taking into account the mode of toxic action and compound properties. Acute fish toxicity was determined using the OECD guideline test 203 and compared to predicted baseline LC50 of acute fish toxicity calculated with a quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship (QSAR) derived for guppy fish. Cytotoxicity was determined through the inhibition of neutral red uptake (NR50) into lysosomes and compared to predicted baseline cytotoxicity derived for goldfish GFS cells. In general, NR50 values were higher by a factor ranging from 3 to 3000 than the corresponding acute LC50. A weak correlation between NR50 and LC50 values was found (log/log: r2 = 0.62). Also the lipophilicity (log Kow) was not a good predictor for cytotoxicity (r2 = 0.43) and lethality (r2 = 0.57) of these pesticides. The neutral red assay is detecting general baseline toxicity only. Comparing LC50 data to QSAR results, the compounds can be classified to act as narcotics or reactive compounds with a specific mode of toxic action in fish. The results indicate that limitation of the neutral red assay in predicting acute fish toxicity. A promising alternative might be the assessment of toxicity in a set of in vitro systems addressing also cell-specific functions which are related to the mode of toxic action of the compound.

In this paper, we present a novel method for Super Resolution (SR) reconstruction with rotation invariance and search window relocation. To combine complementary information in observed images to generate a higher resolution image, we first relocate search window to involve potential similar patches and then use rotation invariance similarity measure to find accurate similar patches. Comparing with Nonlocal Means SR, our algorithm can find more similar patches for weighted average. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in terms of both objective measurements and subjective evaluation.

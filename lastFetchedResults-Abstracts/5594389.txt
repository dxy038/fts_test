The authors consider the problem of designing a feedback control for a single-input-single-output nonlinear system, in order to solve the problem of matching a given linear model even in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances. Sliding-mode and input-output linearization techniques are used to achieve this objective. The resultant inverse system dynamics of the closed-loop system is investigated in order to study the stability of the overall closed-loop system

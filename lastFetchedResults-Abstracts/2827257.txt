The upcoming JPEG XT is under development for High Dynamic Range (HDR) image compression. This standard encodes a Low Dynamic Range (LDR) version of the HDR image generated by a Tone-Mapping Operator (TMO) using the conventional JPEG coding as a base layer and encodes the extra HDR information in a residual layer. This paper studies the performance of the three profiles of JPEG XT (referred to as profiles A, B and C) using a test set of six HDR images. Four TMO techniques were used for the base layer image generation to assess the influence of the TMOs on the performance of JPEG XT profiles. Then, the HDR images were coded with different quality levels for the base layer and for the residual layer. The performance of each profile was evaluated using Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Feature SIMilarity Index (FSIM), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and CIEDE2000 color difference objective metrics. The evaluation results demonstrate that profiles A and B lead to similar saturation of quality at the higher bit rates, while profile C exhibits no saturation. Profiles B and C appear to be more dependent on TMOs used for the base layer compared to profile A.

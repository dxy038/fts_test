Objective
Induction of hematopoietic cells from human embryonic stem (ES) cells has been reported recently. However, before cells derived from human ES cells can be used in the clinic, preclinical studies using these cells in experimental primates will be necessary. Therefore, we attempted to establish a method to induce hematopoietic cells robustly and abundantly from primate ES cells.
Methods

A primate ES cell line, CMK-6, derived from the cynomolgus monkey was used in this study. We adapted a method to induce hematopoiesis from CMK-6 cells on feeder cells, and tested the effectiveness of three kinds of feeder cell lines (OP9, C2C12, and C3H10T1/2). In addition, we tested the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) on hematopoiesis induction from CMK-6 cells.
Results

VEGF and IGF-II showed an extremely strong synergistic effect to induce hematopoiesis from CMK-6 cells. C3H10T1/2 cells proved to be very useful for the induction of hematopoiesis from CMK-6 cells, and the production of blood cells on C3H10T1/2 cells has been maintained as long as 5 months. During this long period, ES cell derivatives continuously produced mature blood cells, including terminally differentiated cells.
Conclusion

We have developed an original method to produce enriched blood cells abundantly from primate ES cells for an extremely long period. This method may represent a good in vitro model for studying primate hematopoiesis and related diseases. Furthermore, our method may be useful for preclinical studies of transfusion therapy using blood cells derived from ES cells in experimental primate systems.

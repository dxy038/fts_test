Our objective was to integrate an effective channel routing algorithm with the Chip Design Language (CDL) algorithmic layout tool. CDL uses technology targetable layout techniques, so that the output of the routing algorithm can easily be ported to different technologies. We introduce the technology independent features of CDL and describe how a greedy router can be interfaced to it. Specific features of interest include mapping from the grid based router to the gridless CDL environment, and the automatic insertion of CDL feed-through cells in multi-channel applications

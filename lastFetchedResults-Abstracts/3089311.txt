In this paper, we propose a framework to develop aspects for intrusion detection. We model attack scenarios using an aspect-oriented unified modeling language (UML) profile. Based on the attack scenario model, the intrusion detection aspects are developed and woven into the target system. The resulting system has the ability to detect the intrusions. The major objective of this work is to invite aspect-oriented software development to the task of detecting intrusions.

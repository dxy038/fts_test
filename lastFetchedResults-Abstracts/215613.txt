Background: Viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus and
Herpes simplex virus may playa role in the pathogenesis of
Behcet's disease (BO). Interferons (lNF) are natural defense
mechanisms against viruses and inhibit their activities by
enhancing major histocompatibility complex class I and cytokine
expression. This study evaluated the efficacy of INF-a-2b on
mucocutaneous lesions of BO.
Methods: In this open label clinical trial, 12 patients were
chosen sequentially from cases referred to the Rheumatology
Unit of the Ghaern Hospital of Mashhad University of Medical
Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, with inclusion criteria of active BO
without central nervous system or ophthalmic involvement.
They received subcutaneous injections of 3 million units of
IFN-a-2b three times a week for six months. The numbers and
the sizes of lesions were evaluated monthly with the objective
and subjective assessments of disease activity.
Results: The average dose of interferon prescribed was 2.7]
million units during six months. The numbers and sizes of
oral, genital and cutaneous lesions decreased significantly
with less pain and longer duration of remission. The most
common side effects were flu-like symptoms and bone pain
reported by 8 patients with temporary impotence in two
males and local reactions as erythema and edema of the upper
extremities in two patients.
Conclusion: INF-a-2b seems to be an effective therapy for
mucocutaneous lesions of Behcets disease

This paper discusses on the improvement of power density of hollow rotor compared to conventional spoke type Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG). The objective of this research is to propose a rotor structure that could improve the power density by maximizing the flux linkage of the machine. In this research the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to simulate the characteristics of the hollow rotor spoke type PMG at various speed. The result shows that the hollow-rotor topology has higher back electromagnetive force and output voltage compared to conventional spoke type PMG. In addition, the hollow-rotor spoke type motor has higher output power compared to conventional spoke type PMG. In summary, this paper provides an overview of the performance of the hollow-rotor spoke type topology that contributes high power density.

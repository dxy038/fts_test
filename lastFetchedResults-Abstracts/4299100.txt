In order to solve the problem as too many uncertain factors, heavy workload in calculation, the difficulty of obtaining an optimal scheme, and the waste of energy caused by the irrational structure of production exist in the process of alumina ore-burden, with the minimum of energy consumption as the objective function, consider the production experience, a unified ore-burden in sintering and Bayer process model of optimal scheduling is established in this paper. Considering the existence of nonlinearity, multiple constraints and multiple cycles, a hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization with mutation parameter was used to get the optimum solution. Finally the computation results with industry running data show that optimal scheduling scheme with minimum energy consumption can be obtained efficiently.

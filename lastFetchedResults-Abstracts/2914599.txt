Long distance transmission lines have to carry heavy load flows. The authors present an expert system for exactly obtaining target multiple load flow solutions for the present and forecasted loading conditions. The knowledge base is extracted from acquired know-how through the research study on multiple load flow solutions. The main objective of this expert system is to automatically provide target solutions to be used in voltage monitoring

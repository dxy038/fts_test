The next biennial IEEE International Pulsed Power Conference will join with the IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science, and this joint conference, namely PPPS-2013, will be held from June 16-21, 2013, in San Francisco, USA (see http://www.ece.unm.edu/ppps2013/). This conference will reflect the most recent developments in the areas and topics pertaining to the science and technology of pulsed power. It is one of the most important conferences in this field in which major research laboratories and groups associated with this field from around the world typically participate. The objective of this Special Issue is to bring the most up-to-date developments reported at PPPS-20 13 to the readership of IEEE Transactions of Plasma Science. It will be the 1Oth of its series which started in April 1997. All submitted manuscripts will undergo standard peer-review process typical for all IEEE Transactions and Journals. This Special Issue will be widely announced before and during the PPPS-2013 conference. However, the Special Issue will not be restricted to PPPS-2013 attendees, and it will cover the following topics, which are also the focus areas the conference: 1) Fundamental Research and Basic Processes; 2) Microwave Generation and Plasma Interactions; 3) Charged Particle Beams and Sources; 4) High Energy Density Plasmas and Applications; 5) Pulsed Power Switches and Components; 6) Industrial, Commercial, and Medical Applications; 7) Pulsed Power Sources; 8) Pulsed Power Systems; and 9) Diagnostics.

This work investigates the deployment of active networking on mobile devices. The objective is to determine the possibility of decreasing energy consumption on mobile devices accessing Internet services, by use of active networking. The approach is to move the TCP/IP stack from the mobile device onto an access point. To enable this a light-weight protocol based on Bluetooth has been implemented to facilitate the link between the mobile device and the access point. A design and implementation that is transparent to user applications and runs on the mobile device is presented. The performed tests indicate a decrease in the energy consumption of 25%.

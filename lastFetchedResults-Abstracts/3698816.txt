Manned space flight uses one of the oldest communications media, speech, and a voice recorder is required to store it. CBS Laboratories developed the voice-time recorders for the NASA Gemini missions, and flights have proved their effectiveness. The small, light, reliable device records the mixed voices of the astronauts on one track and a digital time signal on the other. Cartridges with one hour capacity can be changed during orbiting, which permits taking as many cartridges as the mission duration requires. Tape is 0.110 inch wide, moves at 0.6 in/s and is contained in a unique coaxial-reel bidirectional cartridge. An ac synchronous motor, energized from a dc to ac converter, drives the mechanism at constant speed. Ground players/duplicators allow convenient transcription and time correlation of the cartridges.

Objective: Following traumatic brain injury, disruption of blood-brain-barrier and consequent
brain edema are critical events which might lead to increasing intracranial
pressure (ICP), and nerve damage. The current study assessed the effects of aqueous
date fruit extract (ADFE) on the aforementioned parameters.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, diffused traumatic brain injury (TBI)
was generated in adult male rats using Marmarou’s method. Experimental groups include
two pre-treatment (oral ADFE, 4 and 8 mL/kg for 14 days), vehicle (distilled water, for 14
days) and sham groups. Brain edema and neuronal injury were measured 72 hours after
TBI. Veterinary coma scale (VCS) and ICP were determined at -1, 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours
after TBI. Differences among multiple groups were assessed using ANOVA. Turkey’s test
was employed for the ANOVA post-hoc analysis. The criterion of statistical significance
was sign at P < 0.05.
Results: Brain water content in ADFE-treated groups was decreased in comparison
with the TBI+vehicle group. VCS at 24, 48 and 72 hours after TBI showed a significant
increase in ADFE groups in comparison with the TBI+vehicle group. ICP at 24, 48 and
72 hours after TBI, was decreased in ADFE groups, compared to the TBI+vehicle. Brain
edema, ICP and neuronal injury were also decreased in ADFE group, but VCS was
increased following on TBI.
Conclusion: ADFE pre-treatment demonstrated an efficient method for preventing
traumatic brain deterioration and improving pathological parameters after TBI.

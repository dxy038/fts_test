<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Recent studies have emphasized the important role of cognitive beliefs in etiology and ‎maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD has different subtypes, but the ‎specific role of cognitive beliefs in OCD symptomatology is not clear. The aim of the current ‎study was to determine whether the cognitive factors proposed by Obsessive Compulsive ‎Cognitions Working Group (OCCWG) could specifically predict subtypes of OCD.‎<br /><strong>Method:</strong> The question was investigated in a sample of 208 university students (mean age = 21, SD = 1.6). ‎The target population was selected by cluster sampling. All participants completed two ‎questionnaires including Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ-44) and Obsessive Compulsive ‎Inventory-Revised (OCI-R). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression ‎analysis.‎<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Regression analysis demonstrated that “responsibility/ threat over estimation” was a significant ‎predictor of obsessive and compulsive behaviors and predicted washing, checking, obsessing, ‎hoarding, and neutralizing subtypes of OCD. Furthermore, “perfectionism and intolerance of ‎uncertainty” was the most significant predictor of ordering and hoarding while ‎‎“importance/ control of thought” predicted ordering only.‎<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study found evidence in support of Salkovskis’ cognitive theory about the central role of ‎inflated responsibility beliefs in developing different subtypes of OCD. Besides, the results ‎revealed those other cognitive beliefs had less important role in the development of OCD ‎symptoms. ‎</p>

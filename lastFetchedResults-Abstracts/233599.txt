During the last decade, extensive research efforts have been made on the development of four-dimensional (4D) models (space + time) which integrate computer graphics of three-dimensional geometrical models to scheduling data with a view to generating graphic visualization of construction processes for planning and decision making purposes. Nevertheless, these 4D applications to construction planning are often limited to the component level of a building. Their major drawback is the lack of pragmatic site management features, such as analysis of resource requirements for individual construction activity, generation of site facility layouts, quantification of construction materials and cost evaluation over a specified time period. The objective of this study on 4D graphics for construction planning and site utilization (acronym 4D-GCPSU) is mainly to furnish a solution to the aforementioned problem. In this paper, our works on 4D model in a broader site management context aiming to assist planners to deal with day to day activities are delineated. The prospective requirements for 4D application to support practical use on site management are also highlighted.

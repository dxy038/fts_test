Many acute stressful experiences are not inherently very harmful, yet are associated with great pain and anxiety. The characteristics and experiences that the person brings to the situation are more important than any objective characteristics of the experience itself in determining how aversive the experience will be. Dental procedures are excellent examples of this type of stressor. Drawing primarily on the literature related to dental procedures, the present article discusses the nature of pain and anxiety in the face of an acute stressor, and presents the dispositional and situational factors that contribute to the perception of an acute stressor as aversive. A model is presented illustrating how the various factors interact. It is argued that, in addition to being descriptive, the model is also prescriptive of measures that may be taken to ameliorate the distress of persons subjected to acute stressors like dental procedures.

The paper discusses the influence of driving cycles on the design optimization of permanent magnet synchronous machines. A bi-objective design optimization is presented for synchronous machines with V-shaped buried magnets. The machine length and the loss energy over a given driving cycle are defined as objectives. A total of 14 parameters defining geometry and winding layout are chosen as design parameters. Additionally some constraints like speed-torque-requirements and minimal stray field bridge widths are set. The optimization problem is solved using 2D finite element analysis and a high-performance differential evolution algorithm. The analyses are performed for the ARTEMIS driving cycle due to the more realistic driving behavior in comparison to the most commonly used New European Driving Cycle. Furthermore, a reference design optimization against the rated point loss energy is presented. The results show a much better performance of the driving cycle optimized machines in comparison to the rated point optimized machines in terms of the cycle-based loss energy. Loss savings depend strongly on the machine length and are approximately in between 15% and 45%.

We study the online transportation problem with the sudden traffic congestions where the running time of online vehicles is our optimization objective. We consider an optimal combination of the Greedy Strategy, the Reposition Strategy and the Waiting strategy for the online scheduling of vehicles, as result a Harmonic Strategy with online algorithm model is given in compensation of the disadvantages of the three basic strategy. By analyzing the competitive ratio and competitive performance of the Harmonic Strategy, the result comes clearly to show that the Harmonic Strategy harmonizes well the three strategies and makes some progress towards the competitive performance.

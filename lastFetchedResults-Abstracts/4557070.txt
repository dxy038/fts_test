This work presents a project which was realized with the objective of implementing an alternative solution to teaching methods. This solution involves the assistance of computers working as pedagogical tools complementary to the traditional methods that are used in the teaching of subjects such as Mathematics, Electrics and Electronics. Besides the background that has motivated the realization of this project, This work presents not only the strategies, principles and philosophy which were defined for the courses content but also the way in which a solution was implemented, as well as the strategy expected to be carried out to test the solution and evaluate the results of these tests. In addition, it also explores the alterations that this type of strategy may cause in the roles traditionally attributed to teachers and students, and the effect that these changes bring about in the teacher-student relationship. Finally, this paper also contains a brief presentation of the organizational structure of the solution, the phases and main tasks that this project involved, other phases expected to be carried out in the future, as well as its conclusions.

In this paper, a novel switching mean filter using cloud algorithm method is proposed, which is a powerful impulse noise removal method. We employ an efficient impulse noise detector to detect the noisy pixels and proposed cloud impulse noise removal algorithm to reconstruct the intensity value of noise pixels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can obtain better performances in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations than those state-of-the-art impulse denoising techniques. Especially, the proposed method can preserve edges very well while removing impulse noise. Since our algorithm is simple, it is very suitable to be applied to real-time applications.

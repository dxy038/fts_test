The issue of testing one-dimensional iterative arrays with a constant number of test vectors independent of their size, determined by a new variable testability measure (VTM), is the objective of this paper. It is shown that VTM is a generalization of the C-testability concept, which predicts a constant number of test vectors for iterative cellular arrays of identical cells, independent of their size. A further development of C-testability, called M-testability, is introduced to deal with more general one-dimensional iterative arrays (nonidentical cells)

The paper evaluates a circuit-switched multi-hop WDM network with wavelength conversion by a semi-Markov based approach. The proposed technique provides accurate performance prediction while also preserving model flexibility. Whether the wavelength conversion is beneficial or not depends on many factors. The main concerns considered are the number of wavelengths, packet generation rate, processing latency, and propagation delay. The network architecture evaluated is a bidirectional wrap-around mesh. System performance is measured in terms of network throughput and average packet delay. The results quantify the magnitude of performance improvement achieved through wavelength conversion

In this paper, an admission control (AC) scheme is proposed for handling multiclass Grade of Service (GoS) and Quality of Service (QoS) in Uplink Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems. GoS requirement in conjunction with QoS has been seldom taken into account in previous admission control and resource allocation algorithms for LTE uplink. We propose a novel algorithm for handling the priorities while fulfilling the QoS objective of all granted requests. It corresponds to a solution that combines resource allocation and admission control properties to satisfy the GoS and QoS objectives. Call blocking probability, call outage probability, system capacity and number of effectively served requests are used as performance metrics. Numerical results show that it is possible to manage a priority scheme which satisfies the QoS constraints of all granted requests without any system capacity loss, when comparing to previous algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed AC algorithm gain, for the most sensitive traffic, can be around 20% over the reference AC algorithm.

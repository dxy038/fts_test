From a technical point of view improvements of color picture tube could be regarded as having reached their limits. In this respect we have found that the mask focusing tube can achieve this objective when they are combined with the black matrix technique, the high performance gun, dot screen structure, high matrix transparency and large electrode diameter. Two fold improvements of brightness and contrast have been obtained with two fold mask transparency, 22% higher matrix transparency and mask-focusing. 20-30% less deflection power, 70% less mask doming also have been achieved with 110 degree 36.5 mm neck diameter and 1:2 mask focusing voltage ratio. 20% less spot diameter and sharp beam distribution have been obtained by new multi-stage focusing electron gun and delta arrangement 36.5 mm neck diameter.

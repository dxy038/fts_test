The deterioration mechanism of reinforced concrete (RC) structures under corrosion is highly dependent on environment and material properties. Uncertainties in structural damage occurrence and propagation due to corrosion should be considered in a rational way using a probabilistic approach. In this study, such an approach is proposed to establish a life-cycle optimum inspection plan under uncertainty. This plan leads to cost-effective maintenance interventions, considering uncertainties associated with damage occurrence/propagation and inspection methods. Uncertainties associated with prediction of damage occurrence time are considered by using the Monte Carlo simulation. A damage detectability function is used to assess the quality of inspection method according to damage intensity. The inspection planning is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the expected damage detection delay. This formulation is further used for optimum monitoring planning. Effects of number of inspections and/or monitoring actions, quality of inspection, monitoring duration, and uncertainties associated with damage occurrence/propagation are investigated. The proposed approach is applied to an existing highway bridge. This approach can be used to develop cost-effective management strategies by considering effects of damage detection delay on life-cycle cost and performance of deteriorating structures.

Moral education is one of the most important educational issues. To achieve this high aim in the educational system it is necessary to have a plan which is called "curriculum" in the literature of educational sciences. This plan will not enable the educational system to achieve its ideal aims unless it is based on the value and religious foundations, principles, and methods proposed by the culture of the country. Having a good model of moral education curriculum based on religious doctrines, which is the objective of this research, prepares the ground for designing a comprehensive curriculum in the field of religious education. Using a descriptive â€“ analytical approach and library resources, this paper studies and brings out the main features of a moral education curriculum in the light of  'Allamah Misbah views.

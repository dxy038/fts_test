This paper describes the implementation of an Android application, called FuX, that can continuously play a stream of newly generated fifth species counterpoint. A variable neighborhood search algorithm is implemented in order to generate the music. This algorithm is a modification of an algorithm developed previously by the authors to generate musical fragments of a pre-specified length [28]. The changes in the algorithm allow the Android app to play a continuous stream of music. The objective function used to evaluate the quality of the fragment is based on a quantification of the extensive rules of this musical style. FuX is a user friendly application that can be installed on any Android phone of tablet.

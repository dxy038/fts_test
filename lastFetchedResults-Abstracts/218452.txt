Optimal expansion of medium-voltage power networks is a common issue in electrical distribution planning. Minimizing total cost of the objective function with technical constraints and reliability limits,makeit a combinatorial problemwhichshouldbe solved by optimization algorithms. This paper presents a new hybrid simulated annealing
and tabu search algorithm for distribution network expansion problem. Proposed hybrid algorithm is based on tabu search and an auxiliary simulatedannealing algorithm controls the tabu list of the main algorithm. Also, another auxiliary simulated annealing based
algorithm has been added to local searches of the main algorithm to make it more efficient. The numerical results show that the method is very accurate and fast comparing with the other algorithms.

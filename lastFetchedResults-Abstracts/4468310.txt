This paper aimed at comparing the performance of bidirectional converter designs for renewable source power generation such as wind. The bidirectional converter is supposed to allow a bidirectional power flow between power line and a battery system. In order to determine the most applicable bidirectional converter circuit which meets a set of requirements, four types of designs which were based on previous work of others were simulated with PSCAD software. The ability of each design to maintain a set voltage at the power line and also the direction of current flows at the battery as well as at the output of the converter are investigated.

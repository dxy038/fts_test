Globally, today particularly in the developing countries, much attention is paid to how to achieve the goals of all-out development, that is sustainable and human development. This paper proposes the question that what role does women's increased participation play in attaining sustainable development in the Muslim countries. What is the prospect for these countries? Drawing on the experiences of the developing countries, writers hold that a comparison of the conditions of the Middle Eastern nations with those of the Muslim countries of Southeast Asia demonstrates that sustainable development in the Muslim countries cannot be realized without women's extensive participation. Thus, women's increased participation in the development process of these countries is essential. More importantly, what guarantees the materialization (manifestation) of such an objective is the existence of adequate inclination to facilitate the conditions for women's engagement in the development process.

A three phase bidirectional AC-DC converter using the novel ramptime current control method is described. Simulation results and a study into the effects of the current regulator &#8220;phase&#8221; on the AC and DC current ripple are presented. Prototype experimental results show current 1% THD. A field installation of the converter is shown to independently source real power into the grid, while providing reactive power grid voltage support

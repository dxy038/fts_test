Proposes an objective criterion for determining if, given a specific circuit technology, a gate model is suitable for synthesis and verification. This is based on relating the analog circuit behavior to the digital model behavior using a formal definition of implementation. We illustrate the type of design errors which occur when the criterion is not satisfied, and introduce a gate model designed to satisfy the criterion

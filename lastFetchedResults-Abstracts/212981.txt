The objective of this paper is to evaluate the validity of commonly used
multiaxial fatigue criteria for different multiaxial loading conditions. The best
criterion is identified through comparative analysis. The assessment is based
on the experimental research findings of the SAE notched shaft, which is used
as a benchmark. The relative performance of the three existing multiaxial
fatigue theories based on the strain criteria and the critical plane approaches
are investigated. There is no fixed strain life criterion that can predict the
fatigue life best for different loading cases. Among all the critical plane models
considered, Fatemi and Socie model gives best fatigue life prediction for both
multiaxial in phase and 90Â° out of phase loading cases.

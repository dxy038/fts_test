The objective of this paper is to present an online parameter tuning method for digital power converter with predictive current-mode control. The proposed method can effectively deal with the issues caused by variation of inductance, input voltage drift, and voltage drop caused by DCR. The proposed online parameter tuning method is based upon adding an additional current sampling between two pulsewidth-modulated outputs. Neither an additional sensor nor system parameter is required for the realization of the proposed method. Moreover, the effects of inductance variation, input voltage drift, and voltage drop caused by DCR are analyzed. It will be shown that inductance variation and DCR result in dc offset of the inductor current, and input voltage drift and DCR deteriorate the performance of both steady-state and transient responses. It will be confirmed by simulation and experimental results that these effects can be dealt with by using the presented online parameter tuning method. Experimental results will be presented to fully support the theoretical analysis.

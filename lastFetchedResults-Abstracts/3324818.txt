In this paper, a meta-heuristics algorithm based artificial immune system (AIS) is used for solar PV parameter estimation. A new objective function based on derivative of maximum power with respect to voltage for solar double diode model is proposed. For performance evaluation and validation of the proposed approach using AIS, the results are compared with Genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for two different PV modules. The results prove that the proposed approach with AIS outperforms GA and PSO in terms of convergence speed and objective function value for both PV modules. The proposed formulation with AIS can be used for parameter extraction of panel with different make/models.

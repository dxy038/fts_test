ECTI association was established with the objective to promote research activites of Thai scholars. Apart from issuing two international transactions, and a magazine to members and public, ECTI sponsors international conferences so what we can gather researchers from various contries around the world to share experiences with Thai researchers. I do believe that international research collaboration can be established and strengthen through this activity.

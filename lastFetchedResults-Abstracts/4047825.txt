The multi-valued exponential bidirectional associative memory (MV-eBAM) has been proposed and proved to be asymptotically stable under certain constraints. Although multi-valued eBAM has been verified to possess high capacity by thorough simulations, the capacity is still unable to be solved analytically. In the paper, an algorithm is proposed to derive the capacity. Some important characteristics, including the absolute lower bound of the radix, and the approximate capacity are also discussed. The result shows that the multi-valued eBAM indeed possesses high capacity

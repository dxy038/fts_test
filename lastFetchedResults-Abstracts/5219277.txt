Redundant nonholonomic mobile manipulators have wide range applications in civilian and military areas. The high redundancy provides high operation flexibility but also introduces redundancy resolution problems. The existing methods mainly focus on the off-line redundancy resolution, and most of them are based on single objective optimization. However, in order to efficiently accomplish a specific task, the dynamic environment information, task constraints and requirements should be considered. This paper investigates a new method which employs the onboard sensor information to resolve the redundancy online by realizing multiple objectives optimization. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by simulation results.

Open-loop optimal control theory is formulated and applied to damp out the vibrations of a beam where the
control action is implemented using piezoceramic actuators. The optimal control law is derived by using a maximum
principle developed for one-dimensional structures where the control function appears in the boundary conditions in
the form of a moment. The objective function is speci®ed as a weighted quadratic functional of the displacement
and velocity which is to be minimized at a speci®ed terminal time using continuous piezoelectric actuators. The
expenditure of control force is included in the objective functional as a penalty term. The explicit solution of the
problem is developed for cantilever beams using eigenfunction expansions of the state and adjoint variables. The
eectiveness of the proposed control mechanism is assessed by plotting the displacement and velocity against time.
It is shown that both quantities are damped out substantially as compared to an uncontrolled beam and this
reduction depends on the magnitude of the control moment. The capabilities of piezo actuation are also investigated
by means of control moment versus piezo and beam thickness graphs which indicate the required minimum level of
voltage to be applied on piezo materials in relation to geometric dimensions of the combined active/passive
structure. The graphs show the magnitude of the control moment which can be achieved using piezoceramics in
terms of problem inputs such as voltage, piezo and beam thicknesses

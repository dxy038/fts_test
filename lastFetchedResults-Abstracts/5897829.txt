In this work we propose an optical burst switching retransmission scheme without any loss of bursts for star topology networks that exploits the entire network capacity. The basic idea is to allow the core node to resolve contentions by itself; balancing the intelligence of the network between edge and core nodes, losing neither the advantages of optical burst switching nor the simplicity of the core switch architecture. To achieve this objective, two retransmissions schemes are defined. The former confines the average number of retransmissions per burst below 2. The later exploits the whole network capacity.

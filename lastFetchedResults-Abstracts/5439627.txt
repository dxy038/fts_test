An LP (Linear Prediction) spectrum modification method is proposed based on linear extrapolation for different signal to noise ratio under the white noise environment. A direct modification on the noisy LP spectrum is employed, since the autocorrelation coefficients of the original speech are not available in some practical applications. The linear suppression rule is applied into the high-frequency region of the noisy LP spectrum, while no modification is made in the low-frequency region. The experimental results on ITU-T G.722.2 demonstrate that, comparing with the reference methods, the proposed method could provide the reconstructed speech with an obvious improvement both in objective and subjective quality by using the modified LP coefficients.

The objective of this letter is to provide a better understanding of the impact of temporal decorrelation on the tomographic phase of the P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission BIOMASS, selected as the Seventh Earth Explorer by the European Space Agency. In the context of Phase A BIOMASS activities, the tropical forest site of Paracou, French Guiana, was illuminated at P-band during the airborne campaign TropiSAR 2009 and the ground-based campaign TropiScat 2011. P-band data from TropiSAR were used to generate a high-resolution 3-D reconstruction of the Paracou forest, whereas TropiScat data provided information about temporal correlation considering different time lags and different heights within the vegetation layer. The ensemble of the two datasets were used to generate a synthetic SAR data stack that emulates BIOMASS acquisitions over the Paracou forest site, accounting for BIOMASS geometry and resolution, as well as for the forest temporal decorrelation. Different data stacks were produced by varying the revisit time between two consecutive passes from 1 to 17 days. The resulting vertical structure reconstruction and forest height retrieval were observed to yield valuable results as long as the revisit time is 4 days or less.

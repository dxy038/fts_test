Introduction: One of the most important factors for disease risk is the undesirable health condition of the houses. The dark, damp and unsanitary house exposes  residents to TB. As the housing status is crucial in establishing the conditions for the transmission of TB, this study was designed to survey the situation of housing environmental health of tuberculosis patients in Yazd on transmission of communicable diseases according to World Health Organization standards in 2010.
Methods: In this descriptive study, the housing status of all TB patients of Yazd in 86 cases were collected through a questionnaire survey, observation, and measurement.
Results: Results showed that the houses in 22.1 % of cases were made of adobe and mud, 3.55% having average density of room, 50% of houses had insufficient natural light, 54.7 %  had unfavorable natural ventilation, and 26.7 %, inadequate heating appliances. Also 32.6 % of the floor, 32.6 % of the walls, 37.2 % of the ceilings, 22.1 % of the sewage disposal, 12.8 % of drinking water, 20.9% of garbage collection, 11.6% of keeping-pet places, and 20.9%  of waste disposal were in unhealthy conditions. In addition, 2.3% of these houses lacked toilet and 7% lacked bathroom.
Conclusions: Comparing the housing condition of people with TB via the existing standards, the status is assessed as unfavorable. Thus improvement of  the tuberculosis condition calls for the education programs to inform people of such disadvantages. 
Also the attention of housing stakeholders and relevant agencies should be drawn to help low-income people.

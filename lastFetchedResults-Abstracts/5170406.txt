This paper is a consequence of further works which deal with the linear character of weighted T-systems in dioids like (max ,+) or (min ,+). Our objective is to propose an algebraic point of vue this kind of Petri nets. The deterministic property permits to propose a mathematical abstraction of the Petri net behavior and the possibility to evaluate some properties on the system of equations. And the next result decline the possibility to transform the weighted T-systems in a marked graph.

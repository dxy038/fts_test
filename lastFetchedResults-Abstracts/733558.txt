Objective.
To investigate the nutrition-related cancer prevention attitudes of low-income African American women, determine whether a nutrition education program can alter these attitudes, and determine whether these attitudes are related to diet and dietary changes.
Method.

One-hundred and fifty-seven African American women from Washington, D.C. public housing communities participated in a nutrition education program from 2001 to 2003. They completed questionnaires assessing their attitudes about the role of nutrition in cancer prevention at baseline, post-intervention, and 4 months later. They also completed 24-hour food recalls at baseline, post-intervention, and 4 months later.
Results.

Women agreed that good nutrition prevents cancer, especially women with higher literacy, women with fewer children living at home, women who had not had experience with cancer, and women who were worried about their health. Participation in the program increased agreement that good nutrition prevents cancer over 4 months. Women whose agreement increased over the intervention were able to maintain dietary changes they made over 4 months.
Conclusion.

Nutrition-related cancer prevention attitudes were strong and were strengthened by a nutrition education program. These attitudes may contribute to people's ability to maintain dietary changes.

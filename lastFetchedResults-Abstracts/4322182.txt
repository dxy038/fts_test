Molten iron logistics balance is one of iron &amp; steel production planning and scheduling problems. It lies on the first layer in iron-steel correspondence scheduling system. Productivity constraints of blast furnace and steel-making, demand weight constraints of molten iron for steel-making, weight constraints of on-line molten iron were comprehensively considered and a multi-objective mathematical programming model of molten iron logistics balance problem was established. The multiple objectives including maximizing productivity of blast furnace and steel-making and minimizing transportation cost were taken into account in the model. By conversion method the model was converted into linear programming which can be solved by standard linear programming software. And the evaluation indices of model were computed. The experimental results using practical production data show the proposed model is effective and feasible.

Background: Regarding the relatively high numbers of DDH in Iran and also avoiding the problems of early treatment, the patient follow up and delay in therapy seem to be necessary in evaluating the spontaneous improvement.

Objective: To evaluate the spontaneous improvement of sonographic findings of untreated DDH of neonates within one month after birth at Qazvin Kosar hospital.

Methods: This was a descriptive analytical study performed on 2791 neonates born at Qazvin Kosar hospital during April 2008 to April 2009. Following clinical examination, if the neonate was found positive for DDH, a sonography procedure applied. In case of positive sonography, the treatment was postponed for one month and the clinical examination and sonography re-checked at the end of one-month delay in therapy. Data were analyzed using SPSS vl6 software and chi square test.

Findings: Of total 2291 neonates, 103 cases were found positive for DDH following physical examination among those 23 excluded from the study. Out of 80 neonates positive for DDH upon clinical examination, 42 were found with normal sonography and 38 with positive sonography for DDH among those 35 neonates (92.1%) were revealed to have spontaneous improvement after one month. Female sex, breach presentation, and left hip involvement in clinical examination led to higher numbers of positive sonography. Neonates with DDH born from older mothers were demonstrated unlikely to have spontaneous improvement.

Conclusion: Delay in DDH treatment led to spontaneous improvement in 92.1% of cases. This delay in therapy could prevent the occurrence of complications such as femoral head avascular necrosis while reducing the medical costs and emotional complications in young parents.

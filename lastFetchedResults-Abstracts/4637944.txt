This paper presents an Efficient and Reliable Particle Swarm Optimization (RPSO) method for solving the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) of large distribution system solution for Combined Economic Emission Dispatch Problem (CEEDP).The objective is to minimize the total fuel cost of the generating units having quadratic cost characteristics subjected to limits on generator True/Active /Real and Reactive Power output, Bus Voltage, Transformer taps and Line flow limits. Combined Economic Emission Dispatch Problem (CEEDP) is obtained by considering both the Economic and Emission objective. This bi-objective problem is converted into a single objective function using a Price Penalty Factor (PPF). Reliable Particle Swarm Optimization (RPSO) was originally developed by a social-psychologist (JAMES KENNEDY) and an Electrical Engineer (RUSSELL EBERHART) in 1995. The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated under simulated conditions on IEEE30-Bus system with 6-Generation units. The problem has been formulated as a single optimization problem to obtain the solution for optimal power flow problem with combined fuel cost and environment impact as objectives .The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) of large distribution system solution for Combined Economic Emission Dispatch Problem (CEEDP) results obtained using Reliable Particle Swarm Optimization (RPSO) are better than any other Evolutionary Computation techniques proposed so far.

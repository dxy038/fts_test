	Numerical modeling of compressible two-phase flow is a challenging and important subject in practical cases and research problems. In these problems, mutual effect of shock wave interaction creates a discontinuity in fluid properties and interface of two fluids as a second discontinuity lead to some difficulties in numerical approximations and estimating an accurate interface during hydro-dynamical capturing process. The objective of this research is to increase the accuracy of numerical simulation of two-phase flow using two-fluid model. For this purposes, MUSCL strategy was used for increasing the Godunov numerical scheme accuracy from 1st order to 2nd order. The privilege of this method is high accuracy, low numerical oscillation and low numerical diffusion. The problems considered for the verification of the results are the water-air shock tube, a square bubble with moving interface in a uniform flow and a shock wave with 1.72 Mach having interaction with an air bubble in a water pool. The obtained numerical results showed that, the results that have been obtained by second order accuracy have less diffusion in the two-phase flow interface.

A neonate with functional single ventricle and severe subaortic obstruction received a palliativew procedure that involved a side-to-side anastomosis of the aorta and pulmonary artery, placement of a patch in the main pulmonary artery to divide the systemic and pulmonary circulations, and creation of a small opening in the patch tp provide pulmonary blood flow. The patient recently underwent a bidirectional Glenn procedure at 10 months of age. This procedure obviates the need for a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt and may provide a more reliable source of blood to promote growth of both pulmonary arteries.

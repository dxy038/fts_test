On the basis of matter-element and extension set in extension theory, the paper use the level, evaluation indexes and characteristics value on the reliability evaluation of CNC machine tools as a matter-element. Then we can determine the classical field, controlled field and the matter to be evaluated on the subsystem of the numerically-controlled machine tools. Finally we apply the matter-element and correlation function of extension set to establish the reliability matter-element evaluation model for CNC machine tools. Due to the range of correlation function is the whole real number field, the evaluation can make full use of information and reflect subsystemsÂ´ reliability more comprehensively and effectively. So evaluation result is more objective and precise.

A water environment security assessing system is constructed to respect the water environment security situation on pollution source, water quality, and ecology along Luan River to Tianjin Diversion Project. The model for assessment is proposed based on multi-hierarchy fuzzy theory. The corresponding assessment indexes, quantitative standards and weight functions are established. The system and method are applied to assess the water environment security status of Luan River-Tianjin Diversion Project. The result shows that the assessment system can reflect objective current status of water environment security. Therefore, it can provide technology support for securing water quality of Luan River-Tianjin Water diversion project.

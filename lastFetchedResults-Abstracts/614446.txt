
Background and Objective: Textile wastewaters are known as an important environmental pollutant. The main characteristic of textile wastewater is its colorness, which contains various organic and inorganic pollutants. Therefore it is necessary to treat such effluent effectively before discharging into the environment.
Methods: In a fundamental-applicable study, removal efficiency of Acid red 18 and Acid red 14 using zero valent iron powder has been investigated. Parameters studied include pH (3-11), contact time (15-120 min), and initial concentration of iron powder (0.5-2 g/L). 
Results: Batch experiments show that dye removal was increased with increasing mass of iron powder and contact time, while decreased with increasing of pH. The high removal efficiency was observed in pH=3, contact time=120 min and iron powder concentration of 2 g/L. The result of kinetic studies shows that removal of Acid red 18 and Acid red 14 was best described by pseudo-second order kinetic model.
Conclusion: the overall results of present work shows efficient removal of Acid red 18 and acid 14 by zero valent iron powder

Autonomic systems appear as closed because their internal logic cannot be communicated to their users. This work presents a method to solve this communication problem. The objective is to let the user specify, negotiate and observe the high-level objectives imposed to the autonomic system without affecting the latterÂ´s self-management capabilities, but also to enable relevant communication from the system towards the user. A smart micro-grid is the autonomic system used. A procedure that generates relevant arguments is connected at the monitoring level of the grid as a deliberative layer.

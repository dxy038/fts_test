Aninnovative digital half toning procedure is established on multiscale error diffusion is studied in this paper. In this research a negative multiscale error diffusion technique is proposed having more practical significance. The prominent features of the algorithm are (1) Application of image quadtree (2) Selection of the darkest pixel based on minimum intensity guidance theorem (5) Non causal diffusion of error. The quality of the halftoned image is evaluated both through subjective and objective evaluations. For the objective evaluation feature similarity index is adopted in this paper. The proposed technique provides enhanced result both visually and in terms of feature similarity index.

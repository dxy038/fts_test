This paper is concerned with objective stress update algorithm for elasto-plastic and elasto-viscoplastic endochronic theory within the framework of additive plasticity. The elastic response is stated in terms of hypoelastic model and endochronic constitutive equations are stated in unrotated frame of reference. A trivially incrementally objective integration scheme for rate constitutive equations is established. Algorithmic modulus consistent with numerical integration algorithm of constitutive equations is extracted. The implementation is validated by means of a set of simple deformation paths (simple shear, extension and rotation), two benchmark test in nonlinear mechanics (the necking of a circular bar and expansion of a thick-walled cylinder), a test which demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed model in simulation of cyclic loading and ratcheting in finite strain case (cyclically loaded notched bar) and finally, the analysis of a tensile test, which presents a shear band with a finite thickness independent of the finite element mesh using endochronic viscoplastic constitutive model.

In the present study, a semi-empirical method that combines theoretical and experimental data for exploring the thermal performance of a heat sink with or without integrating TEC has been successfully established. By employing the genetic optimization technique, a series of constrained optimal designs have been performed. The independent variables for optimization search are the pumping capacity of the TEC (Q <sub>c</sub>), the electric current of the TEC (I) and the external thermal resistance between hot side of the TEC and ambient (R<sub>ext </sub>). The present objective for the optimization search is the maximum temperature difference between heat sinks with and without integrating TEC. The results show that optimal value of DeltaT<sub>b-c </sub> is 21.3degC, with boundary limits of Q<sub>c</sub> =10W, I=10A and R<sub>ext</sub>=0.25 degC/W. However, this design results in a poor coefficient of performance (COP), say COP=0.17. Under a given constraint of COPsquare2, the optimal value of DeltaT<sub>b-c</sub> can be obtained to be 9.1 degC with the corresponding Q<sub>c</sub>=14.8W, I=3.4A and R<sub>ext</sub>=0.25degC/W. Comparisons between the results by the present optimal design and those obtained by the semi-empirical method have been made with a satisfactory agreement. The present optimal design shows that a heat sink/TEC assembly can provide an effective temperature reduction with high COP and extend the upper limits of air-cooled heat sinks

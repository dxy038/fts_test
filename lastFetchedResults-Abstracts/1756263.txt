Objective
ch generally indicates that psychological variables are stronger predictors of cardiovascular outcomes in healthy populations than in those with preexisting illness. Studies of Type-D personality, however, suggest that it may also be predictive of negative health outcomes in cardiovascular patient populations. To date, no independent, comprehensive meta-analysis centered specifically on Type-D has integrated this literature and provided quantitative estimates of these relationships. The present meta-analysis investigated the associations between Type-D personality and (a) major adverse cardiac events (MACE), (b) health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and (c) biochemical markers of cardiovascular disease among cardiovascular patients.

dependent reviewers abstracted data from 15 separate studies. A random effects meta-analytic model was utilized to calculate omnibus effect sizes for each set of related studies, i.e., for the MACE (N of patients=2903), HRQOL (N of patients=1263) and biochemical marker (N of patients=305) measures.
s
tive association was found between Type-D personality and MACE, whereas a negative association was observed between Type-D personality and HRQOL. There was a trend toward significance in the association between Type-D personality and cardiovascular disease biomarkers.
sion
 personality is a promising construct for understanding psychological relationships with important outcomes among cardiovascular patients. Subsequent investigations undertaken by a more diverse group of unaffiliated scientists are important for further development in this line of research.

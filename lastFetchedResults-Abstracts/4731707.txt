Implant longevity is desired for all bone replacements and fixatives. Titanium (Ti) implants fail due to lack of juxtaposed bone formation, resulting in implant loosening. Implant surface modifications have shown to affect the interactions between the implant and bone. In clinical applications, it is crucial to improve osseointegration and implant fixation at the implant and bone interface. Moreover, bone marrow derived cells play a significant role for implant and tissue integration. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate how surface micropatterning on Ti influences its interactions with bone marrow derived cells containing mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) have the capability of differentiating into osteoblasts that contribute to bone growth, and therefore implant/bone integration. Hematopoietic stem cell derivatives are precursor cells that contribute to inflammatory response. By using all three cells naturally contained within bone marrow, we mimic the physiological environment to which an implant is exposed. Primary rat bone marrow derived cells were seeded onto Ti with surfaces composed of arrays of grooves of equal width and spacing ranging from 0.5 to 50 &#956;m, fabricated using a novel plasma-based dry etching technique. Results demonstrated enhanced total cell adhesion on smaller micrometer-scale Ti patterns compared with larger micrometer-scale Ti patterns, after 24-hr culture. Further studies are needed to determine bone marrow derived cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation potential on micropatterned Ti, and eventually nanopatterned Ti.

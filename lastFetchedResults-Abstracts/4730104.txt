Series capacitors compensations may cause subsynchronous resonance (SSR) of steam turbine-generators. Using the principle which is depressed SSR by STATCOM and choosing appropriate measured data to design the subsynchronous damping control (SSDC) based on improved particle swarm optimization algorithm which is presented in this paper. Regard the controller parameter of STATCOM as adaptive parameter. Treating the damping ratio as objective function and basing on improved particle swarm optimization algorithm to damp SSR. Take the subsystem within Mohong and Yanchong series capacitors of China Southern Power Grid as example to verify the validity of SSDC.

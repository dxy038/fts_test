In order to attain the maximum external cycle power of a-type Stirling Engine, first, this paper uses multi-objective optimization of the linear weighted evaluation method and with reference to the group AHP method to gain the optimal range of link rod ratio of general crank-connecting rod mechanism, then on that basis, it establishes optimal design model for the maximum external cycle power of &#945;-type stirling engine. finally, it presents and resolves a practical example.

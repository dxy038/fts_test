Construction planners often face the challenge of optimum resource utilization to
compromise between different and usually conflicting aspects of projects. Time, cost and
quality of project delivery are among the crucial aspects of each project. Emergence of new
contracts that place an increasing pressure on maximizing the quality of projects while
minimizing its time and cost, requires the development of models considering quality in
addition to time and cost which has modeled extensively. In this paper, a new metaheuristic
multi-colony ant algorithm is developed for the optimization of three objectives time-costquality
as a trade-off problem. An example is analyzed to illustrate the capabilities of the
present method in generating optimal/near optimal solutions. The model is also applied to
two objective time-cost trade-off problem, and the results are compared to those of the
existing approaches.

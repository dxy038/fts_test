In this paper, we suggest a new behaviour for a MOSFET bidirectional switch for AC main application. We use two transistors of high voltage power MOSFET new technology based on the CoolMOS, one to control the forward current, and the second one to short-circuit the complementary diode, thus, for the first time, significantly decrease its power dissipation. For that, we must improve the power transistorÂ´s with the low switching losses (RDS(on)).

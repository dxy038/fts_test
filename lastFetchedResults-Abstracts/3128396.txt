Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has made great strides in the detailed simulation of complex fluid flows, including some of those not before understood. It is now being routinely applied to some rather complicated problems, and starting to impact the design cycle of aerospace flight vehicles and their components. It is being used to complement and is being complemented by experimental studies. Several examples are presented in the paper to illustrate the current state-of-the-art. Included in this paper is a discussion of the barriers to accomplishing the basic objective of numerical simulation. In addition, the directions for the future in the discipline of computational fluid dynamics are addressed.

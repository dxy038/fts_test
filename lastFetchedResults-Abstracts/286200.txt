Background:  Irritant and/or allergic hand dermatitis in individuals who are unable to avoid causative exposures is difficult to control. Usefulness of protective creams has been generally unsatisfactory. Objective:  To determine if hand dermatitis, primarily of an occupational nature, could be improved by the use of a protective foam containing dimethicone and glycerin. Methods: Adult male and female subjects with chronic hand dermatitis for at least 12 months, felt to be either allergic, irritant, or combined in nature were given the study foam for routine application after a 2-week observation period. At 2 and 6 weeks the skin was evaluated by the investigator and subject for parameters including redness, scaling, fissuring, blistering, and pruritus on a numerical scale. A global evaluation also was performed. Photographs were taken at each visit. Usage of topical corticosteroids was recorded. No systemic therapies other than antihistamines were allowed. Results:  Thirty-one subjects were enrolled in the study and 28 completed it. The physician and subject's initial global evaluations averaged 6.13 and 5.48, respectively (0-10 scale). The final scores were 3.68 and 4.75, respectively (P <.001 for physician rating; P  = .259 for subject rating). Topical corticosteroid usage was reduced in 16 of 30 (53.6%) subjects. Twenty-one of 30 subjects (70.0%) had improved over the course of the study. No adverse effects were noted. Conclusion:  This protective foam greatly or moderately improved chronic hand dermatitis in a sizable number of individuals with previously uncontrolled dermatitis despite continuing in their regular occupation.

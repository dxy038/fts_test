Objective
rophins, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), promote neuronal development and neuronal survival, but their mechanisms remain controversial. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that NGF and BDNF interfere with angiotensin-II- and glutamate-induced facilitation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) in nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) neurons.

ofile of NGF and BDNF actions in acutely dissociated rat NTS was studied using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique.
s
atment with NGF and BDNF attenuated angiotensin-II-induced facilitation of VDCCs, but did not attenuate glutamate-induced facilitation of the L-type VDCC current in NTS neurons. NGF-induced attenuation was antagonised by pretreatment with a tyrosine kinase A (TrkA) receptor antagonist K-252a.
sions
tenuated angiotensin-II-induced facilitation of L-type VDCCs mediated by TrkA receptors in NTS neurons.

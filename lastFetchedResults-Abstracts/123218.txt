The objective of this study was to obtain relationships between plant leaf area (cm^2 plant-1) with leaf dry weight (g plant), total vegetative dry weight (g plant-5, and plant height (cm). For this object, three cotton cultivars (Sahel, Siokra324 and Deltapain25) were used. Sampling was carried out at one month after emergence, squaring, flowering, boiling, boll opening, and second pick from the cultivars under irrigated conditions and four sowing date. At each sampling, leaf area, leaf dry weight, total vegetative dry weight and plant heights were measured. Leaf area range between 170 to 8167 cm' plant-' with an average of 3039 cm- plant'. Various equations were used to describe relationships between leaf area and mentioned characteristics. Best results were obtained with power equation in linear form {ln(y)=a+b*ln(x)}. This equation was used for all combinations of cultivar-sowing date and cultivar-growth stage separately. Results showed that one equation is adequate for all cultivars at all growth stages and sowing dates. Significant relations was found between leaf area and leaf dry weight (R2=0.98), total vegetative dry weight (R2-0.84) and plant height (R2=0.76). It was concluded that equations could be used for estimation of leaf area.

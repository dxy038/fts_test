This work presents the development of a welding machine current MIG pulsed that it uses a mathematical model. Initially the control model is developed with theories and applications PID which should be adjusted in agreement with the operation points stipulated by the variation of the stick out. That process becomes disadvantageous in a real process due to you continue changes of the points of operation of the welding machine. Being used of control techniques FUZZY the problem of controller´s PID syntony can be eliminated and turning the most robust system the inherent disturbances of the process. Tends as main objective the comparison of controllers´ PID results and fuzzy that at once know that fuzzy doesn´t present the syntony problem for several operation points

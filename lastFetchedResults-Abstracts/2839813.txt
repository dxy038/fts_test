Coastal area has abundant resources however, overdevelopment and utilization by mankind has caused severe abuse of original landscapes. In order to mitigate such deterioration, the concept of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been proposed to take measurements of geographic nature, applied construction, ecology system, economic value and environmental protection. The objective is to establish a reasonable utilization and sustainable development goal. However, most of the studies on coastal zone management are focused on qualitative approaches or quantitative modules such as sequential (i.e. statistics model) or spatial (i.e. geographic information system) assessment. It is seldom to apply integrated spatial-temporal model with artificial decision assessment, therefore this study combines both system dynamic (SD) which is best known in process timing dynamic complexity, causal loop and timing stagnant, together with cellular automata (CA), which can effectively present spatial interactions of each parameters, to develop a set of integrated spatial and temporal assessment system for coastal area. The objective is to facilitate decision maker or managers to conduct simulation and strategic analysis based on various subjects and modules, and lay out a sustainable coastal management strategy.

In this paper, a method for the localization of mobile devices within museum areas is proposed. The proposed semantic wireless localization approach combines the potentialities of RSS-based active localization with those of the semantic representation of the museum environment. The final objective is the real-time and accurate estimation of visitors positions in order to provide new advanced services useful for the visitors (e.g., adaptive contents related to position, path, interests) as well as for the museum managers (e.g., visitors flows, statistics, security). A customized App has been developed and installed on the smartphones of some museum visitors for experimental validation. A selected set of preliminary results is presented and discussed.

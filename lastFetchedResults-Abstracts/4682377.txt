The Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), on the European Space Agency´s remote-sensing satellite No 1 (ERS-1), produces thermal IR image data of exceptionally high standard, showing remarkable optical clarity and radiometric discrimination with very low noise in all its operating channels. ATSR´s main scientific objective is to measure global sea surface temperature (SST) data with the levels of accuracy required for climate research, typically &#177; 0.3&#176;C. This paper describes, with examples, the main characteristics of ATSR data-products, including the results of some recent validation projects. It also outlines some of the early scientific results for ATSR

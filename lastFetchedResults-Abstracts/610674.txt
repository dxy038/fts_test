Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional-comparative study, 400 men (200 hypertensive men and 200 normotensive men) were selected by convenience sampling in Tehran and their quality of life was measured by standard short form (SF36). Data analysis was done by SPSS software 15 using statistical tests ?2 and T-test exact test. P < 0.05 denoted statistical significance.
Results: Mean age of participants in the hypertensive group was 44.83?8.48 and in the normal group was 4.44?5.50. The quality of life of normotensive control subjects (82.20 ± 10.72) was at higher level than hypertensive subjects (72.77 ± 17.60) (P  < 0.001).
Conclusion: The quality of life in hypertensive men is at lower level than healthy men. Therefore, early detection of the hypertensive patients and finding better treatments to improve their quality of life is required.

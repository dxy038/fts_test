The thin film resonator technology has been under development for over forty years in one form or another. Although the basic approach is derived from the desire to reach higher frequencies than those readily achieved by thinning bulk crystals, there have always been competing technologies or fundamental material or processing problems that have impeded the development. Finally, a point was reached in the wireless market wherein competing technologies appeared unable to meet the demands of modern wireless applications and thin film approaches began to receive some emphasis. This paper will survey the thin film resonator technology. Every effort will be made to provide an objective analysis of the technology in relation to applications and competing technologies, and point out obstacles and promises, as known, for further technology advancement to high frequencies.

The objective of this study was to use a homogenization model of the anisotropic mechanical behavior of annulus fibrosus (AF) to address some of the issues raised in structural finite element and fiber-reinforced strain energy models. Homogenization theory describes the effect of microstructure on macroscopic material properties by assuming the material is composed of repeating representative volume elements. We first developed the general homogenization model and then specifically prescribed the model to in-plane single lamella and multi-lamellae AF properties. We compared model predictions to experimentally measured AF properties and performed parametric studies. The predicted tensile moduli (Eθ and Ez) and their dependence on fiber volume fraction and fiber angle were consistent with measured values. However, the model prediction for shear modulus (Gθz) was two orders of magnitude larger than directly measured values. The values of Eθ and Ez were strongly dependent on the model input for matrix modulus, much more so than the fiber modulus. These parametric analyses demonstrated the contribution of the matrix in AF load support, which may play a role when protoeglycans are decreased in disc degeneration, and will also be an important design factor in tissue engineering. We next compared the homogenization model to a 3-D structural finite element model and fiber-reinforced energy models. Similarities between the three model types provided confidence in the ability of these models to predict AF tissue mechanics. This study provides a direct comparison between the several types of AF models and will be useful for interpreting previous studies and elucidating AF structure–function relationships in disc degeneration and for functional tissue engineering.

Gait analysis is widely recognized as a promising tool for obtaining objective information on the walking behavior of Parkinson´s disease (PD) patients. It is especially useful in clinical practices if gait properties can be captured with minimal instrumentation that does not interfere with the subject´s usual behavioral pattern under ambulatory conditions. In this study, we propose a new gait analysis system based on a trunk-mounted acceleration sensor and automatic gait detection algorithm. The algorithm identifies the acceleration signal with high intensity, periodicity, and biphasicity as a possible gait sequence, from which gait peaks due to stride events are extracted by utilizing the cross-correlation and anisotropy properties of the signal. A total of 11 healthy subjects and 12 PD patients were tested to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The result indicates that gait peaks can be detected with an accuracy of more than 94%. The proposed method may serve as a practical component in the accelerometry-based assessment of daily gait characteristics.

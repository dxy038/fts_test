The objective of this paper is to find an optimal method for the design of tracked base travel systems for special purpose vehicles and robotic machines that may be required to steer over a light bonded terrain composed of fresh concrete. For the case of a vehicle traveling on a weak fresh concrete during construction, the paper presents detailed comparative studies of the steering performances of a small model tracked test vehicle with alternative amount of steering ratio for various concrete slump values. For these studies a detailed simulation analytical method has been developed. From this work it is proven, in comparison to experiment, that the simulation analytical method is useful for predicting various steering performances of a test tracked vehicle running upon soft fresh concrete of various consistencies.

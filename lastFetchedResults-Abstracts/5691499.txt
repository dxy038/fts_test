Wireless sensor is a consolidated technology with high potential in the Internet of Things. However, some open issues must be tackled in order to leverage the whole potential of this technology. One of the challenges is the energy consumption. Many algorithms have been proposed for saving energy; a promising alternative is an evolutionary multi-objective technique. However these approaches offer a set of solutions and the selection of the optimal solution is not trivial. This paper present an algorithm based in NSGA-II for selecting the best sensor distribution as well as a mechanism for optimization of results.

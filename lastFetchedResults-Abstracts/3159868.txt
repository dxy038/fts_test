To optimize the urban public transport network, the paper systematically researches the multifactor analysis and thought about the urban public transport, proposes six binding indexes together with their threshold on the purpose of minimizing the general cost and maximizing the service, and also establishes the quantitative objective functions for the optimization of transport network on the basis of 5 indexes such as total travel time of passengers according to spatial dimension, time dimension and value dimension firstly. Secondly, the paper establishes the standard index decision-making matrix and positive-negative ideal solution decision-making matrix, and researches the analyzing model for transport network optimization which takes the objective functions as set of indexes and alternatives as set of domain by quantitative analysis according to the TOPSIS. Finally, the weights of decision-making model are determined comprehensively by means of AHP and entropy which takes the experts´ knowledge and experience, decision makers´ intentions and preferences and information within data itself into consideration. In addition, the optimization degree was judged by calculating the closeness of scheme matrix which runs from the ideal scheme. The example shows that this method can adjust the public transport network better, and the result was much more reasonable and practical.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to review the clinical outcomes of anti-D isoimmunization in a series of women who typed Rh positive or Rh weak positive.
Study design
This was a review of The Ohio State University Medical Center Fetal Therapy Program Database.
Results
Of 1068 pregnancies affected by anti-D, 5 pregnancies (0.47%) occurred in 4 women between 1994 and 2004, who were serologically typed as Rh positive or Rh weak positive. All 5 pregnancies delivered at term. All newborns were confirmed affected either by a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) or were Rh positive. Newborns were not anemic at birth and subsequently did not require transfusion. No newborns were treated for jaundice. All newborns were discharged home with their mothers.
Conclusion
Anti-D hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is a rare complication of Rh positive and Rh weak positive pregnancies. Although the potential for severe HDFN exists in this clinical scenario, our experience suggests that in Rh positive or Rh weak positive pregnancies with anti-D isoimmunization, clinical HDFN is mild. Nonetheless, Rh positive or Rh weak positive patients with anti-D should be monitored for potentially significant HDFN.

SCEPTRE 2 is a normative report on the basic mechanisms of the real-time executive kernels. No fault tolerance technique exists in its current version. So, in order to develop fault tolerant real time applications, redundancy management service must be provided. In this paper we present the difficulties we have found during the implementation of fault tolerance in SCEPTRE 2. These difficulties are principally due to the non determinism present in SCEPTRE 2. So our objective in this paper is to present the solution we propose for the resolution of this problem. Our approach to fault tolerance is based upon the replication of capsules on distinct sites. The adopted replication strategy is the semi-active redundancy

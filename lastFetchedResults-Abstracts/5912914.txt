This paper deals with the modelling of a railway vehicle to calculate the electromagnetic field distribution inside and outside the vehicle at 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz. Our objective is to evaluate the electromagnetic (EM) pollution induced outside the vehicle due to onboard Wi-Fi networks. Experimentations have been performed on a railway vehicle both with CW and Wi-Fi standard transmitter-receiver systems. A geometrical model has been defined for the numerical simulations of the vehicle body retaining only the predominant structural parts in the electromagnetic phenomena. This work should then allow to analyse via simulation, the optimal configuration of the onboard Wi-Fi devices in order to reduce the EM field outside the vehicle which can prove to be a source of pollution for other Wi-Fi networks.

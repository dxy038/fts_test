Objective: The purpose of this study was to report the clinical experience collated from the 1995 and 1997 case list summary sheets of United States and Canadian active candidates who were completing the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology oral examination for the first time. Study Design: Data from the case list summary sheets were entered into a computerized database and collated. Data from active candidates who had subspecialty training and from other international graduates were excluded. Results: The difference in the ratio of men to women candidates between 1995 and 1997 was statistically significant (P = .02). Both years, 31% of the major operations were hysterectomies, of which 60% and 62.5%, respectively, were performed through an abdominal incision. The mean total cesarean delivery rate was 20.5% in 1995 and 19.7% in 1997. The ratio of primary to repeat cesarean deliveries was 2 to 1 in both years. The ratio of forceps to vacuum extraction deliveries was 3:7 in 1995 and 2:5 in 1997. Conclusion: This data set provides a national overview of the clinical experiences of a relatively homogeneous group of practicing obstetrician-gynecologists who have recently completed their training.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:1429-32.)

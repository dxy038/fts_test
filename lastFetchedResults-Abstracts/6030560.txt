&#8220;Exploring Engineering&#8221; is a required course for all first-year engineering students at Bucknell University (USA), and approximately one-fifth of the students in the course are nonengineering majors. The course uses lectures, laboratories, and design projects to illustrate the essence of engineering. This paper describes an electrical engineering laboratory that was developed for Exploring Engineering and offered during the fall of 1993. The title of the laboratory is &#8220;Sine Waves and Hearing&#8221;, and the objective is to teach the basic properties of sine waves through several experiments related to hearing

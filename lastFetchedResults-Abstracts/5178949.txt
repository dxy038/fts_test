In todayÂ´s information age, secure exchange of information in a reasonably quick manner is of utmost importance. Information may be in form of data, video, audio etc. In this paper, the main objective is to do a thorough analysis of numerous network components and finally precipitate in an all optical network (AON). The network so formed will be operative in DWDM (dense wavelength division multiplexing) methodology with included feature of future compatibility. An attempt is made to make a foray into simulation of an optical splitter with single die cast for multiple specifications.

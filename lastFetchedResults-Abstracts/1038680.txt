Ranking and selection of the optimal material is an important stage in the engineering design process. However, most of the methods proposed for ranking in materials selection have tended to focus on cost and benefit criteria, with target values receiving much less attention in spite of their importance in many practical decision-making problems such as selecting materials to best match the properties of human tissue in biomedical engineering applications. In response to this perceived gap, the development of a new normalization technique is considered in this paper that provides an extension of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method and objective weighting in materials selection. There are four example cases included to validate the accuracy of outcomes from the proposed model. It is believed that the proposed decision-making model is suitable for linking to material databases and has the potential to enhance the efficiency of computer-aided materials selection systems.

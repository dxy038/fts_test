This study presents a prototype of a one-time implantable spinal cord stimulation system (SCS) using wireless power and bidirectional data transmission by an inductive link. The data can be transmitted by an inductive link, which is based on a duplex ASK-LSK technique. A fabrication chip is integrated in the bio-implant to generate stimulation waveform control signals. The chip area is 1800 &#215; 1250 &#956;m<sup>2</sup>. The proposed SCS system attain better flexibility of operation modes than that of a commercial product, i.e., Medtronic Itrel 3 7425.

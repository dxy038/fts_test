Objective
luate the effect of EDTA pre-treatment of dentine on resistance to degradation of the bond between dentine and resin-modified glass-ionomer cements.
s
non-carious human molars underwent cavity preparations. Teeth were restored with Fuji II LC or Vitremer. Half of the cavities were restored following manufacturers’ instructions whereas the other half was pre-treated with EDTA (0.1 M, pH 7.4) for 60 s. Teeth were stored in water at 37 °C for 24 h, 3 months or submitted to 10% NaOCl immersion for 5 h. Teeth were sectioned into beams (1 ± 0.1 mm) and tested to failure in tension at 0.5 mm/min. Bond strength data (MPa) were analyzed by ANOVA and SNK multiple-comparisons tests (p &lt; 0.05).
s
DTA was used for pre-treatment of dentine, higher bond strengths were observed for both cements. Degradation challenges produced a decrease in bond strength values only in the Vitremer group. This decrease was avoided when EDTA was used for dentine treatment before restoring with Vitremer.
sions
re-treatment of dentine increases bond strength of resin modified glass-ionomers cements to dentine and improves resistance to degradation of the bond between Vitremer and dentine.

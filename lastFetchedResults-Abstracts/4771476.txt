In order to know the construction conditions of the safety culture in power supply companies this paper sets up an overall and objective safety culture assessment index system of power supply enterprises based on the power industry characteristics. The weights of indexes can be got by improved AHP and comprehensive scores can be obtained by linear weighted method. Then an assessment model is introduced which adopts the trapezium-cloud model to make grade division (concept partition) of the safety culture instead of the hard division method in previous studies. The concepts gained by this way can reflect the data distribution characteristics more obviously. Finally we can obtain the cloud parameters by using backward cloud generator, which are used for evaluation. WhatÂ´s more, the example in this paper shows that the model is feasible and effective and it can offer more valuable information.

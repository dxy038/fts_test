The traditional grounding grid analysis method viewed practical inhomogeneous soil as homogeneous soil. However, when the substation grounding grid area is very large, there are a large part of fault current will flow away from the deep soil, deep soil of grounding grid has a great impact to grounding performance, so how to accurately obtain the soil layered structure model is the foundation of grounding system design and simulation calculations, can make the grounding design more reasonable, at the same time, can reduce unnecessary blindness. Through the introduction of nonlinear objective function, The paper introduce into genetic algorithms which deal with the parameters optimization for multilayer structure models of soil is excellently, A recursive method to get the exact expressions of GreenÂ´s Functions in multilayer earth is resented in this paper, in the presence of Wenner measurement method. The author make use of the relationship between apparent resistivity and probe distance. By introducing nonlinear objective function, the solution of soil parameters will be transformed extremum question of objective function, combined with genetic algorithm, the horizontal layered soil model is inversed. the method can calculate the arbitrary stratified soil models. Calculations show that the method practical.

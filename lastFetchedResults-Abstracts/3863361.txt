In this paper, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is used to design a high-level controller for a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Given the kinematic model of the UAV dynamics, which is used as a model of the UAV with low-level autopilot avionics, the control objective of the NMPC is determined to track a desired line. After the error dynamics are derived, the problem of tracking a desired line is transformed into a problem of regulating the error from the desired line. A stability analysis follows to provide the conditions that can assure the closed-loop stability of the designed high-level NMPC. Furthermore, the control objective is extended to track adjoined multiple line segments. The simulation results demonstrate that the UAV controlled by the NMPC converged rapidly with a small overshoot. The performance of the NMPC was also verified through realistic ??hardware in the loop simulation.??

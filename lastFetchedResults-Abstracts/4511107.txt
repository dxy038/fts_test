Coupled Tank System is one of the widely used applications in industries. Like other process control, it require suitable controller to obtain the good system performances. Hence, this paper presents the study of Coupled Tank System using LQR and PID controller. Both controller parameters are tuned using Single-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The performance of the system is compared based on the transient response in term of of Rise Time (Tr), Settling Time (Ts), Steady State Error (ess) and Overshoot (OS). Simulation is conducted within MATLAB environment to verify the performances of the system. The result shows that both controller can be tuned using PSO, while LQR controller give slightly better results compared to PID controller.

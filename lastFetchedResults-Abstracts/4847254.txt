The paper considers an important variation of the MIMO channel Decision Feedback (DF) equalizer, the bidirectional MIMO equalizer, that combines the classical forward DF equalizer (DFE) with the backward DFE, which is based on imposing anticausal properties to the feedback filter. With reference to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, we extend the bidirectional equalization from the single-input single-output (SISO) scenario to the more general multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scenario where different definitions of anticausal systems can be given. An original variation of the bidirectional DF equalizer is also proposed in order to reduce its performance loss in the presence of the error propagation.

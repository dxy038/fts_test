Streptococcus equi causes equine strangles. The acute disease has many of the hallmarks of an acute response including high fever, elevated plasma fibrinogen and neutrophilia, affects known to be mediated by proinflammatory cytokines. The objective of this study was to screen-culture supernatants from equine clinical isolates of S. equi and S. zooepidemicus for stimulation of mitogenic responses by horse peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Mitogenicity comparable to that of concanavalin A was detected in culture supernatants of S. equi strains but not in those of S. zooepidemicus. Mitogenicity was neutralised by Proteinase K and a post-strangles convalescent serum, and evidence for the presence of both thermo-resistant and thermo-labile mitogenic factors was obtained. Release of proteinaceous immunogenic mitogens in combination with the antiphagocytic protein SeM unique to S. equi may therefore contribute to some of the severe clinical manifestations of acute strangles in the horse.

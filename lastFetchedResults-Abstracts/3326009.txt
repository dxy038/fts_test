The benefits of using SPOC platforms into face-to-face education are yet to be completely analysed. In this work we propose to use SPOCs and video contents to flip the classroom. The objective is to improve the involvement and satisfaction of students with the course, to reduce the drop-out rates and to improve the face-to-face course success rate. We apply these ideas to an undergraduate first year course on Data Structures and Algorithms. The study is validated by collecting data from two consecutive editions of the course, one in which the flipped classroom model and videos were used and other in which they were not. The gathered data included online data about the students´ interaction with the SPOC materials and offline data collected during lectures and exams. In the edition where the SPOC materials were available, we have observed a correlation between the students´ final marks and their percentage rate of video accesses with respect to the total number of accesses, which indicates a better academic performance for students who prefer videos over documents.

Plate finned-tube heat exchanger (PFTHX) is a kind of simple and frequently used heat exchanger in industry. A bacterial colony chemotaxis (BCC) optimization algorithm is applied to the optimization of geometry parameters such as the fin number, tube row number, tube column number, etc. of a PFTHX, and the optimization objective is the total manufacture cost or the thermodynamics performance indices. The BCC optimization algorithm is derivatively-free, and the convergence speed is fast, especially, it is irrelevant to the kind of the heat exchanger. A simple verification case was conducted and the result is acceptable.

The dynamic load balancing problem of network resource is studied. To start with, the demand of this issue is modeled and analyzed theoretically. After that, some heuristic objective functions which satisfy the host and network constraints are designed. A novel dynamic load balancing mechanism named DLBM which is based on the simulated annealing algorithm is proposed eventually. The simulation results show that, by selecting appropriate factors, the scheme can not only absorb most of the nodes to participate in load balancing, but also reduce the number of bottleneck nodes and the average utilization rate of resources significantly.

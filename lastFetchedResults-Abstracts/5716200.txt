The authors look at robust controllers for vehicular systems, namely, controllers that generate prescribed reference tracking in systems with uncertain parameters and structured disturbances. The basic objective is a design procedure based entirely on time-domain formulations and fixed point techniques in Banach space L&#8734;. An illustrative design is given for typical braking and acceleration systems

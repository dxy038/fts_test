In this paper, swarm tracking problems with group dispersion and cohesion behaviors are discussed for a group of Lagrange systems. The agent group is separated into two subgroups. One is called the leader group, whose members are encapsulated with the desired generalized coordinates and generalized coordinate derivatives. The other one, referred to as the follower group, is guided by the leader group. The objective is to guarantee distributed tracking of generalized coordinate derivatives for the followers and to drive the generalized coordinates of the followers close to the convex hull formed by those of the leaders. Both the case of constant leaders’ generalized coordinate derivatives and the case of time-varying leaders’ generalized coordinate derivatives are considered. The proposed control algorithms are shown to achieve velocity matching, connectivity maintenance and collision avoidance. In addition, the sum of the steady-state distances between the followers and the convex hull formed by the leaders is shown to be bounded and the bound is explicitly given. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of theoretical conclusions.

Objective: Little is known about the physiological properties of the major components of steady-state visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Based on the hypothesis that isoluminant color and high contrast pattern differentially activate the parvo- and magnocellular pathways, we studied difference in spatial frequency function between chromatic and achromatic VEPs to sinusoidal gratings.
Methods: Steady-state VEPs to isoluminant chromatic (red-green) and high contrast (90%) achromatic (black-white) sinusoidal gratings with nine spatial frequencies (0.5 to 8.0 cycles/Â° (cpd)) at 4 Hz (8 reversals/s) were recorded in 13 normal subjects. VEPs were Fourier analyzed to obtain phase and amplitude of the second (2F) and fourth (4F) harmonic responses.
Results: The 2F amplitude of chromatic VEPs decreased above 4.0 cpd in a low-pass function while that of achromatic VEPs showed a band-pass function with a peak at 4.0 cpd. The 4F amplitude of chromatic VEPs was not affected significantly by spatial frequency whereas that of achromatic VEPs exhibited a high-pass function. The phases of 2F and 4F showed a non-monotonic function of spatial frequency in both chromatic and achromatic stimuli with peaks at middle spatial frequencies.
Conclusion: Chromatic and achromatic visual stimuli differently affected 2F and 4F components, which thus suggests that 2F and 4F components are generated from different neuronal subgroups largely in the parvocellular pathway.

The unlicensed frequency range around 60 GHz is optimally suited for wireless high-data rate transmission systems. To exploit this potential, the interactive design and characterisation of antennas, transceivers, and signal processing algorithms tailored to the specific demands of the intended application is required. In terms of the air interface, the high carrier frequencies impose additional challenges for the experimental determination of the radiation patterns of the antennas. We have designed, fabricated, and applied a low-loss planar waveguide-to-microstrip transition for measurements of the radiation pattern of a 60 GHz 2times2 patch antenna array. The results are promising for wireless bidirectional multimedia distribution systems.

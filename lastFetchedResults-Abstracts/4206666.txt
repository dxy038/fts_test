Multilevel Inverters are increasingly being used in high-power and medium voltage applications; there are many modulation techniques available to control their operation. In this paper, the Space Vector PWM Technique (SVPWM) to control a hybrid multilevel inverter is described. The inverter produces thirteen-level, SVPWM, three-phase waveforms using a bidirectional switch, twelve transistors and a delta-star transformer. The simulation and experimental results obtained with a 1 kW prototype are provided to verify the correct operation of the converter.

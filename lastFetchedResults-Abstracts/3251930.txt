Wind energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources. With the use of variable speed operation, the wind turbine works more efficiently in the partial load region, where the objective is to maximize wind energy capture. This paper presents the application of a multi-input multi-output optimal control approach to a wind turbine system for maximizing the aerodynamic power coefficient, thus the wind energy capture. The proposed optimal control method is compared to the traditional single-input single-output feedback control with respect to energy capture. A dynamic wind turbine model is used and the performance of different control scenarios is compared through numerical simulation.

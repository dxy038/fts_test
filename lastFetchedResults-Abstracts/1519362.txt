Background and Aims: Calcium hydroxide has a pronounced antimicrobial activity against most of the bacterial species found in infected root canals and endodontic infections. It is one of the most frequently used intracanal medications in endodontic therapy. The objective of this study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of six calcium hydroxide formulations (mixed with saline, lidocaine 2%, chlorhexidine 2%, chlorhexidine 0.2%, Iodine Potassium iodide (IKI) 2%, and glycerin) on Enterococcus faecalis using agar diffusion test.Materials and Methods: Twelve culture plates were incubated with Enterococcus faecalis. Five cavities were made in each plate with 5 mm diameter and 4 mm depth. Two plates were randomly considered for each calcium hydroxide formulation and filled completely with creamy mixture of tested materials. The plates were incubated at 37ºC for 48 hours. The diameter of inhibition zone around each well was recorded in millimetres and data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey tests.Results: The results of this study showed that all tested calcium hydroxide pastes had good antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide mixed with lidocaine, chlorhexidine 2% and IKI 2% were significantly greater than that of calcium hydroxide mixed with saline (P0.01).Conclusion: Considering the results of this study, lidocaine 2%, chlorhexidine 2% and IKI 2% are suggested to be used for preparation of calcium hydroxide paste. Further studies with different methods are needed for confirming these results.

The objective of this paper is to estimate the psychological impact of
unemployment for a group of 240 Malaysian graduates during their transition from university
to labour market. There is evidence of negative psychological impact of unemployment.
Results also reveal that treating employment or unemployment as a homogenous state is
subject to state aggregation bias.

Protein-hydrocolloids interactions play an important role on textural and mechanical properties of foods. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of xanthan and locust bean gums on the gelling ability of myofibrillar proteins at different levels of calcium addition. Surimi was supplemented with xanthan (X) and locust bean (LB) gums at different X/LB ratios: 0.00/1.00, 0.25/0.75, 0.50/0.50, 0.75/0.25, 1.00/0.00. Calcium chloride was added at 0.2 or 0.4%. Changes on shear stress and shear strain at the failure of surimi gels were evaluated. Addition of 0.4% of calcium chloride improved the mechanical properties. Locust bean added alone negatively affected the shear stress of gels. Xanthan at levels of 0.75 and 1.00 had a disruptive effect on the gelling forming ability. This negative effect was partially inhibited with addition of 0.4% of calcium chloride. A profitable effect was found when a X/LB ratio of 0.25/0.75 was added, with an increase on the mechanical properties of surimi gels. Xanthan and locust bean gums could be employed to elaborate surimi gels when added at a X/LB ratio of 0.25/0.75.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the association between the I148M variant of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) and the presence of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) across different populations. This study was a meta-analysis of all relevant researches published in the literature from year 2000 to 2015. The odds ratios (ORs) of PNPLA3 allele distributions in CHC patients were analyzed and compared with healthy controls. The meta-analysis Revman 5.2 software was applied for investigating heterogeneity among individual studies and for summarizing all the studies. The meta-analysis was carried out according to the Cochrane Reviewersâ€™ Handbook recommendations. A total of 120 clinical trials or reports were retrieved, yet only five trials met the study selection criteria. Five hospital-based case-control studies were included in the final analysis. The overall frequency of PNPLA3 gene polymorphisms was 20.4% (205/1005) in CHC and 10.23% (53/518) in controls. The summary odds ratio for the association of gene polymorphisms of PNPLA3 with the risk for CHC was determined as 2.20 (95% CI: 1.56 -3.11) and was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). The current meta-analysis showed an association between frequency of GG genotype of PNPLA3 and the risk of development of CHC in various populations throughout the world.

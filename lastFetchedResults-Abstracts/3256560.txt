The emergence of various and disparate social media platforms has opened opportunities for the research on cross-platform media analysis. This provides huge potentials to solve many challenging problems which cannot be well explored in one single platform. In this paper, we investigate into cross-platform social relation and behavior information to address the cold-start friend recommendation problem. In particular, we conduct an in-depth data analysis to examine what information can better transfer from one platform to another and the result demonstrates a strong correlation for the bidirectional relation and common contact behavior between our test platforms. Inspired by the observations, we design a random walk-based method to employ and integrate these convinced social information to boost friend recommendation performance. To validate the effectiveness of our cross-platform social transfer learning, we have collected a cross-platform dataset including 3,000 users with recognized accounts in both Flickr and Twitter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed friend transfer methods by promising results.

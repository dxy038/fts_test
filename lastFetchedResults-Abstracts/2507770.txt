Background: Hadron therapy is a novel technique of cancer radiation therapy
which employs charged particles beams, 1H and light ions in particular. Due to their
physical and radiobiological properties, they allow one to obtain a more conformal
treatment, sparing better the healthy tissues located in proximity of the tumor and allowing a higher control of the disease.
Objective: As it is well known, these light particles can interact with nuclei in the
tissue, and produce the different secondary particles such as neutron and photon. These
particles can damage specially the critical organs behind of thyroid gland.
Methods: In this research, we simulated neck geometry by MCNPX code and calculated the light particles dose at distance of 2.14 cm in thyroid gland, for different
particles beam: 1H, 2H, 3He, and 4He. Thyroid treatment is important because the spine
and vertebrae is situated right behind to the thyroid gland on the posterior side.
Results: The results show that 2H has the most total ?ux for photon and neutron,
1.944E-3 and 1.7666E-2, respectively. Whereas 1H and 3He have best conditions,
8.88609E-4 and 1.35431E-3 for photon, 4.90506E-4 and 4.34057E-3 for neutron, respectively. The same calculation has obtained for energy depositions for these particles.
Conclusion: In this research, we investigated that which of these light particles
can deliver the maximum dose to the normal tissues and the minimum dose to the
tumor. By comparing these results for the mentioned light particles, we fnd out 1H and
3He is the best therapy choices for thyroid glands whereas 2H is the worst.

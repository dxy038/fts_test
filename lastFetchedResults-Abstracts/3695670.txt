A communication system plays an important role in distribution automation system (DAS), and various communication media have been applied to meet the utilityÂ´s objective. Distribution automation technology using code division multiple access (CDMA) wireless communication network have been developed and shown its cost effectiveness and durability through the field test. Several system components for CDMA such as gateway, packet assembly disassembly and modem had been newly developed and their interfaces are standardized. Establishing a separate control channel for interworking function from central station, system reliability is significantly improved in the case of event processing. CDMA network would be applied to a small-scale DAS which could have a difficulty in constructing a communication network in an economic way, while fiber-optic cable would be applied to a large-scale DAS which needs high speed and reliability in a big city.

Objective: Functional heterogeneity, i.e. regional or selective activation of subpopulations of fibres within a muscle, has been described in some jaw and limb muscles. Each head of the lateral pterygoid muscle may also be functionally heterogeneous. The aims of this investigation were to develop a technique to test this hypothesis, and to use this technique to determine whether there is any multi-unit electromyographic (EMG) evidence for functional heterogeneity within the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid (IHLP).
Methods: In 3 human subjects without craniomandibular disorders, recordings were made of condylar movement and multi-unit EMG activity from two sites in the IHLP during repeated trials of a contralateral (n=21) and a protrusive (n=26) jaw movement. The recording sites within IHLP were approached extraorally (labelled IHLP-extra) and were verified by computer tomography (CT); the other (IHLP-intra) were from sites in IHLP approached intraorally.
Results: In each subject, the time of occurrence of the peak filtered signal from IHLP-extra was significantly different (P<0.05) from IHLP-intra for all protrusion trials but not for contralateral trials.
Conclusions: The data suggest a task-dependent change in motor unit recruitment order within IHLP and that IHLP is functionally heterogeneous.

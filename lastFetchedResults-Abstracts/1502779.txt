The objective of this study was to assess biogas production capacity in different regions of China based on climate conditions and substrate availability. The results of our analysis indicated large differences in below-ground temperature and solar energy resources among different regions of China. According to data collected in 2006, slightly more than 1200 million tons of crop residue and manure could be used as substrates for biogas production. We suggest that household biogas technology must be developed according to local conditions.

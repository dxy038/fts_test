Background: Maternal mortality (MM) is an avoidable death and
there is national, international and political commitment to reduce
it. The objective of this study is to examine the relation of MM to
socioeconomic factors and its inequality in Iran’s provinces at an
ecologic level.
Methods: The overall MM from each province was considered for
3 years from 2004 to 2006. The five independent variables whose
relations were studied included the literacy rate among men and
women in each province, mean annual household income per capita,
Gini coefficients in each province, and Human Development Index
(HDI). The correlation of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) to the
above five variables was evaluated through Pearson’s correlation
coefficient (simple and weighted for each province’s population) and
linear regression – by considering MMR as the dependent variable
and the Gini coefficient, HDI, and difference in literacy rate among
men and women as the independent variables.
Results: The mean MMR in the years 2004–2006 was 24.7 in
100,000 live births. The correlation coefficients between MMR
and literacy rate among women, literacy rate among men, the
mean annual household income per capita, Gini coefficient and
HDI were 0.82, 0.90, ?0.61, 0.52 and ?0.77, respectively. Based
on multivariate regression, MMR was significantly associated with
HDI (standardized B=?0.93) and difference in literacy rate among
men and women (standardized B=?0.47). However, MMR was not
significantly associated with the Gini coefficient.
Conclusion: This study shows the association between
socioeconomic variables and their inequalities with MMR in Iran’s
provinces at an ecologic level. In addition to the other direct
interventions performed to reduce MM, it seems essential to
especially focus on more distal factors influencing MMR.

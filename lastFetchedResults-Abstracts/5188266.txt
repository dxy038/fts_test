This paper presents an approach to calculate the price of reactive power (VAR) support service and optimize the VAR control in a multi-area power system. For the calculation of VAR pricing, the VAR support benefits with respect to power delivery increases of tie lines are computed. These benefits are used to determine the VAR pricing in multi-areas environment. For VAR optimal control, the loss minimization is selected as objective function. The methods are cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and nonlinear convex network flow programming (NLCNFP). The proposed VAR optimization and pricing scheme was tested on IEEE 118-bus system, which is divided into three areas.

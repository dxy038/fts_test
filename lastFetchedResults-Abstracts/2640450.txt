 Objective The aim of the present study was to investigate the
                            efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on self-efficacy
                            and anxiety among epileptic patients. Methods The present study with a
                            pretest-posttest control-group design was performed on epileptic
                            patients in public healthcare centers of Kuhdasht, Iran. Through
                            randomized sampling, 15 patients were selected for the experimental
                            group and 15 epileptic patients for the control group. The experimental
                            group received MBCT once a week during 8 sessions, while the control
                            group was engaged in usual activities. The data collection tools
                            included the general self-efficacy scale (GSES) and Zung self-rating
                            anxiety scale (SAS). For statistical analysis, descriptive tests and
                            repeated measures analysis of variance were performed. Results Data
                            analysis showed significant differences in self-efficacy and anxiety
                            scores between the experimental and control groups (P &lt; 0.001).
                            Conclusions According to the results, MBCT can increase self-efficacy
                            and decrease anxiety in epileptic patients.

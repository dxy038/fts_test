The increasing supplementation of foods with carbohydrates substitutes and the growing regulatory requirements for controlling these products, turn into the necessary development and validation of accurate analytical control techniques. This paper presents the simultaneous validation of two close analytical procedures for the determination of sucralose and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) in fruit juices using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD). This study consisted in applying the accuracy profile procedure with a three-level validation experimental design. Decision criteria, namely acceptability limits (Â±10%) and proportion of result contained in the calculated tolerance intervals (80%), were decided on a consensus basis with end-users, whereas no official references were available. In conclusion, the proposed analytical procedures were validated over the selected validation domains for fruit juices and came out on very capable techniques. Validation strategy was purposely oriented towards the ease of use in routine and the liability of the methods rather than extreme performances. This objective is consistent with this of contract laboratories which need to reach a known level of guarantee for the results which they produce. In that respect, accuracy profile represents a very convenient tool to ascertain such a goal.

Wind is known as a source of power, which changes both magnitude and direction. As a result, the produced power by the generator with a wind turbine fluctuates. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present a grid connected inverter with unity power factor for wind power applications. The current source of grid connected inverter is implemented by controlled the voltage in phase with current in order to the power flows from variable dc source to power line all time. The system characteristic of the voltage and current of grid-connected inverter as before and after synchronization to power utility are investigated by using MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation and hardware experiment. The experiment results are given, which the inverter output voltage and current are sinusoidal at 50 Hz. of frequency, the both waveform are low harmonic distortion and the current is enforced in phase with the voltage both before and after synchronization all time.

Two tuberculosis (TB) models with incomplete treatment are investigated. It is assumed
that the treated individuals may enter either the latent compartment due to the remainder
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or the infectious compartment due to the treatment failure.
The first model is a simple one with treatment failure reflecting the current TB treatment
fact in most countries with high tuberculosis incidence. The second model refines the simple
one by dividing the latent compartment into slow and fast two kinds of progresses. This
improvement can be used to describe the case that the latent TB individuals have been
infected with some other chronic diseases (such as HIV and diabetes) which may weaken
the immunity of infected individuals and shorten the latent period of TB. Both of the two
models assume mass action incidence and exponential distributions of transfers between
different compartments. The basic reproduction numbers of the two models are derived
and their intuitive epidemiological interpretations are given. The global dynamics of two
models are all proved by using Liapunov functions. At last, some strategies to control the
spread of tuberculosis are discussed.

Introduction & Objective: Breastfeeding promotion is an essential mean to reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity and to enhance growth and development in children. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of motherâ€™s education on the breastfeeding status. 
Materials & Methods: This research was an semi -experimental study among 200 randomly selected primiparous women who had no experience on breastfeeding. Breastfeeding education was done after delivery in hospital. Data were collected before and after the intervention using questionnaire and observation checklist. 
Results: The results implied that, before the intervention, only 3% of mother had good breastfeeding knowledge comparing to 55.5% after the intervention. Women's knowledge scores significantly increased after intervention (p=0.000). In addition, only 30.5% of mother had good breastfeeding practice comparing to 70.5% after the intervention (p=0.000). Paired t-test showed that practice scores of women were significantly different before and after the intervention (p=0.001). The Spearman correlation test showed that knowledge and practice scores of women before and after the intervention were significantly correlated (p = 0.000).
Conclusion: Therefore, it can be concluded that breastfeeding education increased women's knowledge and improved their breastfeeding status.

Objective: The current study was a descriptive survey research work. Its main purpose was to investigate and compare the time management and job burnout for active and inactive staffs of Hakim Sabzevari University.
Methodology: The statistical society of the current research work was all the staffs in Hakim Sabzevari University (431). 225 subjects were selected by simple random sampling. The research tool used was the Maslach burnout (1993) and Azizi Moghaddam time management (2006) questionnaire. The Kolmogrovâ€“Smirnov test was used for the normality of the data distribution. T-test and two-way Anova were used to compare the independent groups and analyze the simultaneous interaction between two independent variables (physical activity and organizational position) and two dependent ones (job burnout and time management), respectively.
Results: According to the results obtained, there is a significant difference in job burnout and time management between the active and inactive staffs. Besides there was a significant difference in job burnout and time management active and inactive academics and employees.
Conclusion: Based on the results obtained, probably the active staffs catch less job burnout than the inactive ones. Besides probably these people can manage their time better. Likely, a less job burnout due to physical activity may create appropriate opportunities for a better time management. The difference observed between the academics and employees may be due to the difference in the nature of the jobs.

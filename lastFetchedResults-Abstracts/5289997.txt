As a key of high capability mobile platform, wheel independent-drive control is studied by using the dynamic tire LuGre friction model and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method. Firstly, the wheel independent-drive mathematic model was given and the dynamic tire LuGre friction model was briefly introduced. Then the control objective was analyzed, and the control system structure and the ADRC controller were designed. At last, the independent-drive control simulations under the expected constant and dynamic longitudinal slip were done. The results show that the ADRC controller, which designed based on dynamic tire LuGre friction model, can implement high precision and strong robust control effect.

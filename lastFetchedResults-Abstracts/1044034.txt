The objective of this paper is to study heat and mass transfer coupling under non-Fourier effect. The non-Fourier model is applied on Luikov’s equations. The governed equation is called Luikov’s Corrected (LC) equations and is solved by hybrid analytical–numerical method. Heat and mass propagation in LC field is shown to be wavelike; so, wavefront speed is obtained. Applying non-Fourier model instead of Fourier’s law sensitizes Luikov’s equations to respond in fast transient process. Further, the effect of heat and mass transfer coupling on interpreting non-Fourier affects is investigated. It is seen that the presence of heat and mass transfer coupling reduces wavefront speed with respect to uncoupled non-Fourier heat transfer.

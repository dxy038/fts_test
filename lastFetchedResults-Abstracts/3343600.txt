A large-scale energy storage module (LS-ESM) is being designed to support a combination of directed energy and normal pulsed loads such as S-band and X-band radar systems requiring high power. Each load has unique time constants, widely different repetition rates or peak power capacity. An objective is to have a common LS-ESM service all pulsed loads and also feed the main AC bus to support steady state loads. Candidate storage technologies are the high density lithium-ion batteries in modular units. Several aspects of high power transmission from the LS-ESM source to the pulsed loads are studied from the aspect of reducing the transients imparted to the main power system. A comparison is shown of medium voltage AC transmission with load time constants ranging from 1 to 100 ms and ESM module sizes from 25 to 250 MJ.

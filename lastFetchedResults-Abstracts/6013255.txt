The objective of this study was to present a novel method to make a preoperative effect of surgery based on occlusal contact. This method could make preoperative prediction for the orthognathic surgery. The three dimensional model including maxillary and mandible was reconstructed by CT data, then the finite element model of occlusion was rebuilt after simplified articular disc, The stress contour areas of the dental surface was obtained by simulations implemented by finite element software. After transforming the regional distribution of stress into the form of bite points, the predicting system of surgery based on occlusal points was set up. It is helpful for the surgeon make medical treatment program. This method assures both facial appearance change effect and the number of occlusal point, so the method has a certain practical application value.

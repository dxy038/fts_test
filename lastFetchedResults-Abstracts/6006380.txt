A new separation and reconstruction method for BSS (blind source separation) is proposed in this paper. The objective here is to concatenate BSS separated signals in adjacent time blocks. The proposed method sets a overlap part for each adjacent signal blocks, and utilizes the associativity in separated signals of the overlap. It has advantages of no required array calibration, efficient computation, and easy realization. These superiorities are highly beneficial for radar or communication system type applications. Furthermore it is shown, by two simulation experiments, that the proposed method successfully separates and reconstructs the separated signal blocks.

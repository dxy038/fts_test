 The objective of this study is to establish the prevalence of dysphonia and associated factors in public school female teachers working in Belo Horizonte. This cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of schools between May 2004 and July 2005. There were 2103 elementary education daytime teachers from 83 schools included in the study. Self-applied questionnaires were used for data collection. These included questions on social and demographic matters, general health and mental health (General Health Questionnaire-12 [GHQ-12]), the environment and organization of work, and voice-related aspects. The variable dysphonia was classified as absent, possible, or probable based on the association between frequency of fatigue when speaking and worsened voice quality during the past 15 days. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze factors independently associated with dysphonia in each response subgroup and in total. One third of the female teachers did not report voice symptoms during the past 15 daysآ (33%). The prevalence of probable dysphonia was 15%, and the prevalence for possible dysphonia was 52%. Factors associated with probable dysphonia were presence of recent upper airway problems (odds ratio [OR]آ =آ 5.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]آ =آ 4.06âˆ’8.71), problems at work because of voice (ORآ =آ 65.30, 95% CIآ =آ 19.33âˆ’220.59), other activities with intense voice use (ORآ =آ 1.71, 95% CIآ =آ 1.08âˆ’2.71), high noise levelsآ (ORآ =آ 2.55, 95% CIآ =آ 1.72âˆ’3.76), poor ventilation in the classroom (ORآ =آ 2.00, 95% CIآ =آ 1.24âˆ’3.22), current mental disorder (ORآ =آ 3.20, 95% CIآ =آ 2.18âˆ’4.70), sedentary life style (ORآ =آ 1.94, 95% CIآ =آ 1.21âˆ’3.09), and marriage (ORآ =آ 1.70, 95% CIآ =آ 1.16âˆ’2.47). Associations between probable dysphonia, poor working conditions, health-related aspects, and professional jeopardy indicate the complexity of dysphonia in female teachers and the need for collective intervention strategies.

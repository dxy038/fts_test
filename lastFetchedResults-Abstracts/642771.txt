Objective
The objective of this study was to describe the effects of short-term dietary exposure of bovine lactoferrin (Lf) on intestinal lymphocyte apoptosis and expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in healthy mice.
Methods

Female C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: 0% Lf (n = 16), 0.2% Lf (n = 16), and 2.0% Lf (n = 15). Bovine Lf was administered orally, as part of the diet, for 4 consecutive days. Intestinal lymphocytes (ILs) were isolated and analyzed for percentages of CD4, CD8, apoptotic CD4, and apoptotic CD8 cells using flow cytometry. Pro- (caspase-3) and anti- (Bcl-2) apoptotic protein expressions and TNF-α expression in ILs were determined by Western blotting.
Results

There were significant increases in the percentages of CD4 (P = 0.02) and apoptotic CD4 (P = 0.02) ILs in bovine Lf–fed compared with control mice. Percentages of CD8 and apoptotic CD8 cells and expression of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 in ILs did not differ significantly by diet group. In contrast, the expression of TNF-α was significantly lower in Lf-fed versus control mice (P = 0.01).
Conclusion

Short-term dietary Lf decreased TNF-α expression in ILs and increased apoptosis of CD4 ILs in healthy mice.

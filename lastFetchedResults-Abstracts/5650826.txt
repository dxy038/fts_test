In a satellite, the main function of a Power Conditioning Unit (PCU) is to manage the energy coming from several power sources (usually photovoltaic and battery) and to deliver it continuously to the loads in an appropriate form during the overall mission. A Noval Multiple-Port Converter(MPC) used as high power PCU is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter merges photovoltaic port, bidirectional battery port and regulated power bus port into single power stage. The power conversion stages of MPC topology are first descried. The operation stages of converter and design of the circuit considerations are analyzed. Then the dynamic modeling and close loop design are also given as well. A competitive unit is used to realize priority of the regulated power bus. It is difficult to design intersecting closed control loop without proper decoupling method. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed topology and confirm its ability to achieve independent control over three power processing paths. This topology promised significant savings in component count and losses for the future high power and high power density ratio satellite platform.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) implementations and deployments have been encountering many problems. Most of the information security officers are torn between adhering to the standards or following up a particular mathematical and theoretical model. In this paper we are implementing and deploying PKI at University of Tabuk. In this real world experience we do believe that we can avoid many difficulties, impracticalities and the negative experiences of the past. Another objective is to eliminate paper based circulations by employing digital signature. We elected to deploy OpenPGP and make a test bed for University of Tabuk and future city wide deployments.

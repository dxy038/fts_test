This paper focuses on the design and optimization of the electrical system operation in an electric drive bus, powered by a PEM fuel cell and photovoltaic modules. Through the optimization developed, an improved performance and reduced operating costs for the system, in normal operation, is pursued. Aiming that objective, models of all components (fuel cell, solar modules, electric motors, batteries, controllers, etc.) involved in the system have been developed using the software MATLAB. Results obtained with these models have allowed the designing of an optimized control system.

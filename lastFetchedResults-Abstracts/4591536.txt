A kind of hybrid control approach to aim at realizing multi-objective approximation of optimization for control and dispatch of power systems is presented in this paper. The essence of the approach is to have the task and function for eliminating all of the categories of events which are defined as all of the classifications of the states of a power system which are unsatisfactory for the multi-objective of the power system operation. By applying the means of "control command, C" which is produced by the highest level and delivered to the middle one and the means of "operating order, O" which is delivered from the middle level, the operating power system is dispatched and controlled. The paper builds up a uniform architecture in order to implement the hybrid control approach of power systems. The advanced energy management system (AEMS) of Shanghai Power grid mainly on the basis of the hybrid control theory and method above mentioned, is explained as a typical case.

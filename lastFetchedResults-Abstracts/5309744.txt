The Pareto optimal set of a continuous multi- objective optimization problem is a piecewise continuous manifold under some mild conditions. We have recently developed several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on this property. However, the modelling methods used in these algorithms are rather costly. In this paper, a cheap and effective modelling strategy is proposed for building the probabilistic models of promising solutions. A new criterion is proposed for measuring the convergence of the algorithm. The locality degree of each local model is adjusted according to the proposed convergence criterion. Experimental results show that the algorithm with the proposed strategy is very promising.

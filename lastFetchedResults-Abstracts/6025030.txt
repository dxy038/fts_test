We address an emerging technology that is applicable to biomedical digital imagery in general. We specifically address mammography as a first application. Researchers in every major university medical center and several national laboratories are experimenting with diagnostic methods in digital mammography that show promise for earlier detection. In most cases, these advanced methods are computationally intensive. Without the aid of advanced, real-time computing technology such methods are not suitable for a screening system. What is needed is a hardware and software combination that is capable of evaluating all of these promising methodologies. Theoretical studies at the Armament Directorate have shown that the high-speed computing technology being developed for smart weapons may be able to meet that challenge. The objective of this paper is to present the proposed hardware and software that seems appropriate for a computer aided mammography screening system, and its dual use military application

The objective of this paper is to develop a distributed aperture antenna, which has the same performance as a single large aperture antenna, but has lower profile. The distributed aperture will have a simpler mechanical design, lower cost, lower power electronics, graceful performance degradation and overall higher reliability. This paper presents a design that forms an antenna aperture from distributed smaller apertures connected with precisely phased transmission lines.

A gamma spectrometer system with sodium iodide and germaniumlithium drifted detectors and digital minicomputer was selected for use at the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant. The equipment selection was based on the effluent reporting requirements of AEC Safety Guide 21 - MEASURING AND REPORTING OF EFFLUENTS FROM NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS. General software routines were not available for this specific application. A functional description of the software has been defined and the specific routines are in development. These routines automate radionuclide analysis and report generation for the nuclear power plant technician. The operating objective of the gamma spectrometer system is to routinely provide a detailed radionuclide analysis of samples, using a minimum of wet chemistry, to meet the requirements of plant Technical Specifications while operated by the plants´ Radiation Control and Test Technicians. Changes in in-plant and effluent analysis requirements during the post two years have made existing equipment of that time inadequate for the needs of today and the future. The minicomputer based gamma spectrometer system provides the maximum amount of flexibility available today to meet tomorrow´s demands.

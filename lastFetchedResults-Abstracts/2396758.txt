In weight optimizitaion of double-layer grids, various parameters, such as
members cross-sectional areas, the height between two layers, structure meshing in two
directions and the topology of the structure should be considered. In this study, for
simultaneous optimization of size, shape and topology of double-layer grids, a genetic
algorithm is employed and is modied based on the fuzzy inference system. First, to
eciently search in design space at each stage, some solutions are generated in the
neighborhood of the best sample, which enhances searching operation in the neighborhood
of the optimum solution. Then, in order to achieve the possible solutions, penalties for
violation of constraints, and the number of violated constraints are considered in order
to choose the next generation. The value of objective function and the values of genetic
algorithm parameters have a great eect on the result of the algorithm. For adaptive
setting of these parameters, the fuzzy inference system is employed. The eciency of these
improvements has been conrmed by presenting some examples of truss structures and
comparison with the other algorithms.

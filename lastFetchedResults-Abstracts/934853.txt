The objective of the work was to study foaming properties (foam overrun, drainage rate and collapse stability) of soy protein and their hydrolysates as affected by polysaccharides. As starting material a sample of commercial soy protein isolate was used (SP) and hydrolysates of 0.4, 5.0 and 5.2% degree of hydrolysis (DH) were produced by an enzymatic reaction. The polysaccharides added were xanthan, λ and κ-carrageenan, guar, locust bean gum and hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses as surface-active polysaccharides.

The effect of polysaccharides addition on foaming properties depended in a complicated way on the degree of hydrolysis of protein, surface-activity of polysaccharide, concentration of both macromolecules, contribution of polysaccharide consistency to bulk viscosity and interfacial interactions between biopolymers. However, through cluster analysis the best combination of protein/polysaccharide to obtain defined foaming properties could be determined for an eventual industrial application.

Presents an overview of the system concept, status, and results to date of a US Air-Force-sponsored research and development contract titled Strategic Flight Management Demonstration for Large Aircraft. This contract was awarded to Boeing in 1989 and has developed a detailed conceptual flight management design for bomber and other strategic aircraft in hostile environments. The focus of the effort is centered on a multidimensional flight management algorithm which optimizes mission and vehicle constraints within the objective criteria defined by the user command. A system assessment of both the attributes and the fundamental problems associated with such a system is discussed

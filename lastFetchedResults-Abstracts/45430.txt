This research concerns polymer matrix composite (PMC) materials having long or continuous reinforcement fibers embedded in a polymer matrix. The objective is to develop comparatively simple, designer friendly constitutive equations intended to serve as the basis of a structural design methodology for this class of PMC. Here (Part II), the focus is on extending the damage/failure model of an anisotropic deformation/damage theory presented earlier. A companion paper (Part I) by the writers deals with creep deformation of the same class of PMC. The extension of the damage model leads to a generalization of the well known Monkman/Grant relationship to transverse isotropy. The usefulness of this relationship is that it permits estimates of (long term) creep rupture life on (short term) estimates of creep deformation rate. The current extension also allows estimates of failure time for various fiber orientations. Supporting exploratory experiments are defined and conducted on thin-walled specimens fabricated from a model PMC. A primary assumption in the damage model is that the stress dependence of damage evolution is on the transverse tensile and longitudinal shear traction acting at the fiber/matrix interface. We conjecture that a supplemental mechanism of failure is the extensional strain in the fiber itself. The two postulated mechanisms used in conjunction suggest that an optimal fiber angle may exist in this class of PMC, maximizing the time to creep failure.

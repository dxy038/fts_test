Objective: To examine 10-year results of canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM) for acquired cholesteatoma. Methods: Medical records of 136 patients with cholesteatoma who has undergone CWDM in a university hospital and who had a follow-up of at least 10 years were checked. Results: During follow-up, 21% of patients had undergone one revision operation and 3% two revisions. The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma was 17% and in three patients the cholesteatoma recurred twice. Ten years after CWDM, 98% of the operated ears were dry, 1% moist, and one ear (0.7%) was discharging. The tympanic membrane was intact in 92% and perforated in 8%. Only 14% of patients had hearing levels of 20 dB or better and 46% had 40 dB or better. Conclusion: It is concluded that the surgical technique of CWDM should be improved in order to lower the recurrence rate and to improve hearing results.

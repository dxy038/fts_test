In this paper, both methods of magnitude-oriented design and delay-oriented design for variable fractional-delay (VFD) infinite impulse response (IIR) filters are proposed. In the former, the objective error function is formed by including root-mean-square error function of variable frequency response and the stability error constrained function, such that the designed filters are stable. As for the second part of this paper, it is desirable to minimize the root-mean-square error of variable group-delay response while the magnitude response and stability can be preserved. Hence, except those stated above, the root-mean-square error function of variable group-delay response is further included in the objective error function. However, these induced problems are highly nonlinear, so iterative methods are proposed to overcome them. Several design examples are presented to demonstrate the features of these design methods, including concerns among VFD finite impulse response (FIR) filters, VFD allpass filters and VFD IIR filters as well as the designed results of both methods.

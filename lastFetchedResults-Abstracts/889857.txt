Atmospheric dust is a major risk to human health and its adverse effects increase when the concentration of heavy metals is high. Nowadays, magnetic susceptibility technique is frequently employed as a useful tool to recognize areas and materials polluted with heavy metals. The objective of this study was to evaluate this method in identifying heavy metal polluted dust in Isfahan metropolitan areas. Dust samples were taken from 36 locations in Isfahan, Khomeynishahr, Falavarjan, Zarinshahr and Mobarake for a period of 5 months. To determine the concentration of Mn, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Cd, Zn and Pb, dust samples were digested with HNO3 and to determine the Fe concentration, they were digested by acid ammonium oxalate. The concentration of heavy metals was then determined by an atomic absorption spectrometer. Besides, the magnetic properties of the dust samples including ?lf, ?hf and ?fd were measured by a MS2B sensor. The highest ?hf and the lowest ?fd were found in industrial areas with a mean of 529.9 Ã— 10-8 and 0.8 %, respectively. The results indicate that, as compared to natural soils in the area, atmospheric dust is polluted by human activities. Magnetic parameters were only correlated with Fe and Mn concentrations with an R2 of 0.9 and 0.54, respectively. Therefore, this method could be used to determine dust pollution by Fe and Mn. A significant correlation was found between ?fd% and ?lf, indicating that multi domain (MD) particles and stable single domain (SSD) particles originating from human activities are predominant in dust.

Scilab is the famous open source software. Scilab has been extensively received and it has been designed a open system. So scilab is a good platform to develop some useful toolbox. Random Forests is an excellent machine learning algorithm. It is efficient to process large data and can solve unbalanced classification problems. It has been used widely. While because of some disadvantages, the current toolboxes are not popular. In this paper, we develop a toolbox of Random Forests with scilab. We test its performance and apply it to handwritten numeral recognition. The objective of this work is to promote the toolbox and facilitate more users.

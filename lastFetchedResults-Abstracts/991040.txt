The objective of this work was to determine the effect of pre-frying elimination through the addition of methylcellulose and the influence of wheat flour partial replacement with corn flour (5 and 10%) on some quality factors of deep fat fried shrimp nuggets and compare the results with traditional process including pre-frying step. All batters showed shear-thinning behavior (n ? 0.624) and provided a good fit with power law model (R2 ? 0.979). Methylcellulose produced a significant increase in the consistency index of the batters. The highest pick-up value (57.68%) and the lowest oil content were found in 2% MC added batters that contained 5% corn flour, which was consistent with its high apparent viscosity. Results showed that the pre-frying elimination is an effective way in reducing oil content (%46) in deep fat fried shrimp nuggets.

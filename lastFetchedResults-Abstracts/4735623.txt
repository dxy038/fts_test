LTE uplink has two major scheduling algorithms, namely, Best CQI (BCQI) algorithm and Proportional Fairness (PF) algorithm. PF algorithm provides less system throughput than BCQI algorithm, however, unlike BCQI algorithm it considers users with poor channel condition for allocation process. In this paper, a new scheduling algorithm called as Opportunistic Dual Metric (ODM) Scheduling Algorithm is proposed for LTE uplink. The objective of the algorithm is to prioritize the users with good channel condition for resource allocation, at the same time not to starve the users with poor channel conditions. The proposed algorithm has two resource allocation matrices which are effectively used to allocate the resources to the users. The performance of ODM is measured in terms of throughput, fairness and transmit power. From the results it is observed that the proposed algorithm has better trade-off in terms of all the three performance parameters than PF scheduler and BCQI scheduler.

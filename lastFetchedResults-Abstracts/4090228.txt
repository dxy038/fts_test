Bidirectional chirp-free tuning in Bragg reflection wavelength by as much as 12.52 mm has been achieved based on the principle of a beam of uniform strength. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis. The tuning device is simple in configuration, low cost, and easy to operate, which can be used in numerous applications, such as tunable fiber grating lasers and reconfigurable wavelength add-drop multiplexers, etc.

Purpose
The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic quality of low-dose computed tomography (CT) with that of standard-dose chest CT in the diagnosis of infectious lung diseases.
Materials and methods
Thirty chest CT scans [high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), 15; spiral CT, 15] were performed in HIV-positive patients with an infectious lung disease. Two additional slices were obtained at two lower exposures (HRCT, 120 kV/70 mAs and 120 kV/50 mAs; spiral CT, 100 kV/56 mAs and 100 kV/40 mAs) after chest routine CT. Observers compared the quality of the images obtained at different parameters and image noise. Objective evaluation of image noise was also made.
Results
Diagnostic image quality was excellent in 93% of the low-dose HRCT scans and in 86% of the low-dose spiral CT scans, rates that are always acceptable in any case. Significant differences were found in noise levels between the low-dose and reference scans; however, artifacts did not compromise detection of abnormalities. In HRCT, a mean reduction of 77% from the standard technique to the low-dose scan is possible in total and in lung effective doses. In spiral CT, this reduction is lower at 71%. These values can reach a further reduction with ultra-low-dose imaging (84% in HRCT and 80% in spiral CT).
Conclusions
Chest CT image quality appears to be adequate to evaluate pulmonary infectious diseases, even with an effective reduction in radiation dose. Standard-dose CT with a higher patient effective dose may be appropriate for selected cases.

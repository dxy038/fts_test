A simplified environmental biological model has been developed based on biodegradation kinetics correlation to regulate and optimize wastewater treatment system of activated sludge process. All parameters included in the model are calibrated in accordance with reference data and experimental results and good agreements are achieved between calculated results and reference data or experimental results. The minimum bioreactor volume is used as objective function in the model and errors between optimal minimum volume of the model and each reported result of three references are found to be no more than 8.63 % after validation. Comparisons between optimal results and
experimental data demonstrate that the deviations are negligible. The optimal minimum volume is 9.21 m^3 with the error of 6.40 % to the practical bioreactor volume of a pilot treatment system. The environmental biological model has been applied to economically evaluate a former treatment system with native bacterium YZ1 and four operation periods of the pilot system with functional strain Fhhh compared with YZ1, Fhhh possesses higher biodegradation ability in
purified terephthalic acid wastewater and a broader economic potential in the field of wastewater treatment.

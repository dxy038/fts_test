Objective (s): Thermal comfort consists of three parameters: temperature, humidity and airflow. It is one of the important factors on maintaining health and optimizing the performance of students in the classrooms. According to the climatic conditions of Qom province and the importance of thermal comfort in schools, this study aimed to assess classroom thermal conditions in primary schools. 
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in primary schools in Qom province in 2013. Relative humidity was measured using a CASELLA hygrometer and temperature was measured using a mercury thermometer at five points in each classroom at one meter height from ground level. The measurements were performed between 9 AM to 15 PM in the spring. Thermal discomfort was measured using the thermal discomfort index (DI). All statistical analysis performed using SPSS software version 16.
Results: Overall 115 classrooms were assessed. In this study, mean temperature was equals to 27.42±2.84°C. The mean of relative humidity was 30.4±7/43% and mean of the DI was 22.46±1.72°C. In 17.4% of classrooms the DI was less than 21°C, in 60% of classrooms was 21-24°C and in 22.6% of classrooms was 24-27 °C. As a result only in 17.4% of classrooms thermal comfort conditions was favorable for students.
Conclusion: In order to increase thermal comfort level in primary schools and educational environments, especially in tropical areas such as Qom province, appropriate actions are recommended.

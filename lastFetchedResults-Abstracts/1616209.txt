This work introduces a multi-objective optimization approach for the synthesis of batch water networks. In addition to concentration-based constraints, water characteristics and property-based constraints for the process sinks are considered. Since adjusting properties may require the use of hazardous chemicals, issues of process intensification to minimize the total volume of stored materials are considered along with economic objectives. The model includes logical constraints, time restrictions, mass and property constraints for the sinks and environmental requirements. Two case studies are solved to show the applicability of the proposed approach. The results show tradeoffs between the storage of hazardous materials and the network economics. The multi-objective solutions are illustrated through Pareto curves that enable the decision maker to select the solutions that strike the proper balances between the desired objectives.

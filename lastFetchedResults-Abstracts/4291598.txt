Based on the covariance-like fitting criterion we propose a direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm that embeds a weighting scheme in the objective function without selection of any hyperparameters. With an assumption of uncorrelated sources, we formulate the problem of DOA estimation as a linearly constrained quadratic optimization under power constraints. Numerical results show that the proposed method not only is robust to this assumption but also has the superior performance in comparison with some other sparsity-driven methods.

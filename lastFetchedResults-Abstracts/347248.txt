Objective: Our study aims to assess the optic nerve fiber layer thickness in vivo, the function of the innermost retinal layer and whether a correlation exists between morphological and functional parameters in patients affected by Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
Methods: Seventeen AD patients (mean age 70.37±6.1 years, best corrected visual acuity >8/10 with refractive error between ±3 sf, intra-ocular pressure (IOP)<18 mmHg) were enrolled. They were compared to 14 age-matched controls. Nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Three different measurements in each quadrant (superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal) were taken and averaged. The data in all quadrants (12 values averaged) were identified as NFL Overall. Retinal function was assessed by pattern electroretinogram (PERG) recordings using high-contrast (80%) checkerboard stimuli subtending 15 min of the visual arc and reversed at the rate of two reversals/s.
Results: In AD eyes, there was a significant (P<0.01) reduction in NFL thickness in each quadrant and in the NFL Overall evaluation compared with the values observed in control eyes. PERGs showed a significant (P<0.01) delay in N35, P50 and N95 implicit times, and reduction in N35-P50 and P50-N95 amplitudes. NFL Overall values were significantly correlated (P<0.01) to the PERG P50 and N95 implicit times and P50-N95 amplitude. No correlations (P>0.01) between NFL values and other PERG parameters (N35 implicit time, N35-P50 amplitude) were found.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that in AD patients, there is a reduction of NFL thickness evaluated in vivo by OCT and this morphological abnormality is related to a retinal dysfunction as revealed by abnormal PERG responses.

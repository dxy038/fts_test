The results of the Portos-94 aircraft measurement campaign over coniferous stands of the Landes forest (France) are presented. PORTOS is a five-frequency microwave radiometer developed by CNES and Matra Marconi Space. The objective of the study is to analyse the interest of passive microwave radiometry to estimate land surface characteristics of the forest canopy. The frequency channels of PORTOS are identical or very close to the channels of the planned ESA microwave radiometer MIMR. Therefore, the present study contributes to better assess the potential applications of MIMR over forest areas. The results, based on a principal component analysis, are in good agreement with results obtained from active microwave measurements. They show the interest of &#8220;short&#8221; wavelengths (5, 10.65, 23.8 and 36.5 GHz) for discriminating between categories of coniferous stands

since the energy supply of a sensor node is limited, energy optimization should be considered as the key objective when studying the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Our contribution is in integrated control optimization and genetic algorithms to ensure proper function of WSNs in extremely limited bandwidth, power and storage. A set of simulation results are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has higher efficiency and can achieve better network lifetime at the base station.

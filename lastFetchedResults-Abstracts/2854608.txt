Due to the uncertainty of major influential factors in emergency logistics transportation path optimization, this paper intends to describe those uncertain factors, such as the transportation time, the safety factor and the transportation costs, etc. by using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. And then the paper establishes a multi-objective optimization model according to the previous described decision-making matrix with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The following theoretical derivation and numerical examples prove the feasibility of this suggested model.

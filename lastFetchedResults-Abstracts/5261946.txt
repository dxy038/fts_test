Image registration is an important problem and a fundamental task in computer vision and image processing field. Especially, CT and MR imaging of the head for diagnosis and surgical planning indicates that physicians and surgeons gain important information from these modalities. In radiotherapy planning, manual registration techniques are performed on MR and CT images of the brain. In general, physicians segment the volumes of interest (VOIs) from each set of slices on the MR and CT images manually. However, manual registration of the object area may require several hours for analysis based on anatomical knowledge. In this paper, we develop a new method for automatic registration of head images by using an optimal retrieval on neighbor VOIs in several extracted data and maximization of mutual information. The primary objective of this study is to increase accuracy of the registration and reduce the computational processing time.

Background Nurses, as the frontline hospital staff, have a substantial effect on the patients’ satisfaction; therefore, investigating the effective factors on nurses’ behaviors and attitudes is of great importance. Organizational justice is one of the influencing factors on nurses’ behaviors and attitudes; lack of understanding organizational justice can result in unpleasant consequences such as job burnout, counterproductive behavior, and job stress. The objective of the present study was to investigate the intermediate role of job stress and job burnout concerning organizational justice and counterproductive behaviors among the nurses of Sabzevar Medical Centers.Methods & Materials The present research was an applied and descriptive type; a periodical one presented in structural equations format.

For data collection, the instruments of the study included Niehoff and Moorman organizational justice, Phillip L. Ricejob stress, Maslach et al. job burnout, as well as Spector and Fox counterproductive behaviors. The collected data were analyzed by SPSS and LISREL Software. LISREL was used to analyze confirmatory factor and model test.Results The findings indicated that organizational justice has a negative and significant effect on job burnout (-0.57), job stress (-0.43) and counterproductive behavior (-0.35). Besides, job burnout (0.39) and job stress (0.36) have positive and significant effect on counterproductive behaviors.Conclusion In addition to directly influencing the counterproductive behaviors, organizational justice indirectly influences them via job burnout and job stress.

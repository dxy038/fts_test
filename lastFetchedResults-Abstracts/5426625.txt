In uniprocessor real-time systems, resource sharing is usually done using protocols such as Stack Resource Policy, Priority Ceiling Protocol and Priority Inheritance Protocol. Unfortunately these protocols did not work as expected on real-time multiprocessor systems. Such problem must be addressed with different approaches like Multiprocessor Priority Ceiling Protocol (MPCP) and Multiprocessor Stack Resource Policy (MSRP). The objective of this paper is to propose a variation of the MPCP protocol and a possible implementation, including an experimental evaluation.

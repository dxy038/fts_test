Background and Objective: Performance evaluation of faculty members always involves various issues. Hence, this study was designed and performed to describe and recognize the experiences of faculty members about promotion procedures. 
Material and methods: In this sectional – descriptive study, data was collected using researcher – made questionnaire. The validity was estimated through specialist advice and in order to calculate its reliability the Cronbach alpha coefficient was measured (% 76). Participants were 122 faculty members of Mashhad Medical Sciences University who were selected randomly. The data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
 Results: % 66.2 of clinical sciences and basic sciences faculty members disagreed with the "cultural item" and "selection board performance" (54.1%). The clinical sciences faculty members also disagreed with "promotion procedures outline" and "recruitment board performance" (55.1% and 63.5%). There was a significant difference regarding "cultural item"(P <  0.02). 
Faculty members agreed with "education item" , "research item" , "management item", "initial assessment" , "selection committee performance" and "expert committee performance" (%63.1 , %59 , %59 ,  %74.6 , %66.4 , %63.1). The difference was significant regarding the "selection committee performance" (P  < 0.05).
Faculty members expressed regulated promotion procedures as the best choice to resolve the problem.
Conclusion: In the current study, an outline of promotion procedure, cultural item, recruitment board performance and selection board performance had a low mean. Therefore, transparent and just promotion methods, codifying appropriate quantitative and qualitative indicators to measure activities, homogenizing the promotion procedures and utilizing experts at the university promotion committees seems to be necessary.

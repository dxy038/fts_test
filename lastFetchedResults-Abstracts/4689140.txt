This paper proposed a forecast model about the average load of cognitive work. Firstly, it reviewed the related research about cognitive load assessment. Secondly, it set up an indicators system of cognitive assessment and chose some assessment methods. Finally, it set up a BP network forecast model by taking the subjective assessment conclusions as outputs, the objective assessment data as inputs. It validated this model by designing and carrying out a cognitive load test. The model this paper proposed can mine the related specialistsÂ´ knowledge in the existing data, it can forecast the workload of a similar cognitive task and reduce the assessment workload effectively.

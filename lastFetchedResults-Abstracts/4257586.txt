The objective of the study is to improve teacher efficiency so that large numbers of students can be educated, while at the same time implementing an individual approach to education in which each studentÂ´s progress is taken into account. To achieve this objective, we propose an education system for groups of students at a similar stage of learning. With this system, CAI is used to help individual students to learn by themselves and networks are used to constantly monitor their progress. Then students who reach an impasse are grouped according to their learning progress. The teacher can then provide a supplementary lesson for the whole group, thus improving his or her efficiency. Moreover, we undertook an education experiment for 2 teacher subjects and 10 student subjects using the proposed system. The teacher work rate results indicated that a single teacher using this system to teach approximately 20 students can provide efficient supplementary lessons to plateau-status students, even when students diverge from each other in terms of progress

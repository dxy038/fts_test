The proposed zero-current-switching switched-capacitor quasi-resonant DC-DC converter is a new type of bidirectional power flow control conversion scheme. It possesses the conventional features of resonant switched-capacitor converters: low weight, small volume, high efficiency, low EMI emission and current stress. A zero-current-switching switched-capacitor step-up/step-down bidirectional converter is presented that can improve the current stress problem during bidirectional power flow control processing. It can provide a high voltage conversion ratio using four power MOSFET main switches, a set of switched capacitors and a small resonant inductor. The converter operating principle of the proposed bidirectional power conversion scheme is described in detail with circuit model analysis. Simulation and experiment are carried out to verify the concept and performance of the proposed bidirectional DC-DC converter.

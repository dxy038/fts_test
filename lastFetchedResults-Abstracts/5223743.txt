The authors propose a case algorithm method in a case-based engineering design support system based on a psychological memory model. The objective is to support the conceptual design process interactively as much as possible, using the SUPPORT tool as an intelligent assistant. The work is characteristic in: (1) supporting the functional design with the value analysis methodology; (2) analogical case retrieval based on the semantic memory which defines the relations among concepts from multi-viewpoints; and (3) organization of cases based on a model of dynamic and hierarchical human episodic memory in cognitive science. SUPPORT and the memory organization method are discussed

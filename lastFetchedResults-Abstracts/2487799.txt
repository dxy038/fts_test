Background and Objectives: Excessive growth of population and the need to provide food for humans and livestock increased the process of land use change from forest to range and cultivated by farmers, especially in recent years. Deforestation leads to adverse ecological conditions including the reduction of biodiversity and soil quality. The results of several researchers around the world indicate that deforestation reduces soil quality by decreasing organic matter, microbial respiration, aggregate stability, hydraulic conductivity and increasing bulk density. The objective of this study was to assess the variations of some soil quality indices due to land use change in Fandoghlou region and also creating minimum data set of soil quality indices using factor analysis method.
Materials and Methods: The study area is located 25 Km northeast of the city of Ardabil at 48° 33´ 30" longitude and 38° 24´ 30" latitude. Its mean annual precipitation and temperature are 430 mm and 8 ?C, respectively. Thirty disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken from 0 to 15 cm depth of three adjacent forest (F), range (R) and cultivated (C) lands (totally 90 samples) located at a steep slope. Some physicochemical and biological indices were measured in soil samples. Mean comparison of parameters by Duncan’s test and factor analysis using principal component analysis method were performed.
Results: Land use change from F to R and C decreased mean organic carbon (OC) from 
5.8 to 3.08 and 2.24%, total N from 0.46 to 0.22 and 0.11%, mean weight diameter of aggregates from 1.28 to 0.97 and 0.35 mm, saturated hydraulic conductivity from 0.49 to 0.35 and 0.20 cm min-1, microbial respiration from 0.90 to 0.36 and 0.30 mg CO2 g-1 soil day-1, K from 545.07 to 289.07 and 105.14 mg kg-1, P from 55.18 to 27.67 and 51.98 mg kg-1, total porosity from 54.11 to 46.67 and 37.3% and increased mean CaCO3 from 5.57 to 9.93 and 11.98%, sand from 54.82 to 57.83 and 60.76% and pH from 5.66 to 6.73 and 6.82, respectively. The highest significant positive correlation was found between OC and N (r=0.897**). The results of factor analysis showed that three factors justified higher than 95 percent of variance in sand, 83 percent of variance in OC, N, K, clay and silt and 73 percent of variance in pH, respiration and porosity and 60 percent of variance in P. 
Conclusion: The results showed that land use change from F to R and C reduced soil quality in the study area. Due to the high slope of Fandoghlou forested region which accelerates the sensitivity of soil to water erosion and also its tourism importance, the conversion of remaining forest land to range and cultivated lands must be prevented.

This article addresses a systematic way to maximize the bandwidth versus dc power dissipation performance of CMOS transconductors. It is proposed that the ac transconductance to the dc power dissipation ratio is an appropriate objective function for achieving the optimization. CMOS transconductors realized from four major MOS transistors are examined. Analytical predictions are verified by HSPICE simulation as well as experimental measurements.

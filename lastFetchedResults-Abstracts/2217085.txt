The objective of this work is to optimize the process parameters of beam blank continuous casting in order to ensure high quality and productivity. A transient thermo-mechanical finite element model is developed to compute the temperature and stress profile in beam blank continuous casting. By comparing the calculated data with the metallurgical constraints, the key factors causing defects of beam blank can be found out. Then based on the subproblem approximation method, an optimization program is developed to search out the optimum cooling parameters. Those optimum parameters can make it possible to run the caster at its maximum productivity, minimum cost and to reduce the defects. Now, online verifying of this optimization project has been put in practice, which can prove that it is very useful to control the actual production.

The objective was to investigate the use characteristics of home nebulizers and to measure the benefit gained from dispensing home nebulizers (compared with their cost) to patients from the hospital. During the study period, August 28, 1996 to May 17, 1997, a sample of 232 of the 291 entries from a log of home nebulizers dispensed by the hospital respiratory care department were surveyed over the telephone. Of the 232 study subjects under the age of 21, a telephone interview of a guardian or supervising adult was completed in 106 subjects (46%) a mean of 43 weeks after the home nebulizer was prescribed (47% of the cohort received their home nebulizers from the inpatient service and another 47% were discharged with home nebulizers from the emergency department (ED)). An average of 3.6 estimated additional ED visits and 5.4 office/clinic visits for each patient were prevented by the home nebulizer. The benefit (savings from reduced ED and office visits alone) to cost ratio estimates range from $855:$90 to $1710:$90 or more. The overwhelming majority of the patients felt that the home nebulizer was a good idea, it was easy to use, they had no problems with the nebulizer and they received adequate training for home nebulizer use. Home nebulizers are a cost-effective means of providing home nebulized albuterol for selected outpatients. Hospital inpatient units and EDs which have the ability to dispense a home nebulizer, have an additional therapeutic option available for selected patients who may benefit from it. Medical insurance companies should fully support (ie, pay for) home nebulizers because it is cost effective. If there is any concern about the reliability of the patient to follow-up with their primary physician, the patient's primary physician should be contacted to discuss the feasibility of discharging the patient with a home nebulizer.

In this paper, the effect of different rotor asymmetry rotation faults on the power loss variations in Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) is studied deeply. To fulfill this objective, SRMâ€™s core losses including hysteresis and eddy current losses accompanied with its copper losses are firstly introduced theoretically in detail. Then a 6 by 4 SRM is simulated and motor profiles as well as power losses factors are measured in presence of three common eccentricity faults namely as; static eccentricity (SE), dynamic eccentricity (DE), and mixed eccentricity (ME) faults. The numerical analysis and simulations are done by the three-dimensional Time-Step Finite Element Method (3D-TSFEM). In next step, a similar test rig is designed and built for experimental measurements and confirmations. It was realized that, these types of eccentricity faults directly affect the power loss value and can enhance it abundantly. In other word, the more severity in fault levels conclude the more reduction in output power and the more increment in power losses that can be used as diagnosis index.

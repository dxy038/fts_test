Three different kinds of the novel enhanced genetic algorithm procedures including the hybrid genetic algorithm, interval genetic algorithm and hybrid interval genetic algorithm are respectively presented. As the results of the proven systems show, the hybrid genetic algorithm can determines the better optimum design than the traditional optimization algorithms and genetic algorithm. The interval genetic algorithm and hybrid interval genetic algorithm can avoid calculating system slope in traditional interval analysis and determines the optimum interval range of the parameters under allowable corresponding objective error boundary. It is the first time that genetic algorithm has been applied to interval optimization process.

This paper describes the key findings of a recently completed research project. The primary objective of this project is to develop a guide for use by electric utilities through comprehensive review of the processes and tools employed in design, construction and testing of grounding systems with the objective of identifying potential sources of errors that can result in either overly pessimistic (non-optimal) designs or overly optimistic (with unsatisfactory performance) design of the grounding system, introducing unintended risk in achieving the safe grounding conditions in most cost efficient manner. The guide identifies design software limitations, design assumptions, errors and omissions during construction in not following the design specifications and measurement errors during the commissioning phase to be the key sources of error that can introduce significant risks affecting ground grid performance or their cost efficiency. The guide also provides recommendations to control and mitigate such risks.

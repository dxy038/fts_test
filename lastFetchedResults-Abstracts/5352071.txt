The Web Services composition paradigm has been widely used in Information Technology (IT) and Internet environments to create Web applications that both flexible and rapidly deployable. Web Services are a key way to realize Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA). In Telecom, on the other hand, the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) architecture enables valued-added services composition for IP-based networks. Several ongoing efforts - referred to as &#8220;SOA for telecom&#8221; (SOA-TEL) - are attempting to merge SOA with telecom. The objective of these attempts is to enable Telecom operators and service providers to re-use existing service building blocks while building valued-added converged Web and telephony services. These services offer seamless experiences across various networks and, therefore, richer experiences, but are more complex than typical Web Services (e.g., transaction-based). The IEEE Next-Generation Service Overlay Networks (NGSON) working group is focusing on this integration and an architecture has been proposed. In addition, NGSON specifies context-aware, dynamically adaptive, and self-organizing networking capabilities. There are, however, a number of shortcomings in the NGSON architecture. This paper identifies these shortcomings and describes a possible solution. Finally, we discuss an illustrative use case scenario to help bring clarity to our proposed &#8220;enhanced&#8221; NSGON architecture.

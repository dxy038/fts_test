Objective
The aim of this study was to light microscopically evaluate the homogeneity of the cement interface of an adhesively luted glass fiber post (GFP) by using a new cement application aid compared to a conventional post cementation method.
Methods

Twenty artificial root canals (n = 5) received GFP under the following experimental conditions: I = RelyX™ Unicem applied with a new application aid, II = RelyX™ Unicem, III = Panavia F 2.0 and IV = Variolink II (groups II–IV with conventional post cementation). From all specimens standardized photographs were taken perpendicularly to the post surface under a light-optical microscope from two opposite sides. The depicted cement interfaces were analysed using surface-analyzing software and related to the complete three-dimensional surface of the cement interface. Non-parametric tests were used to compare median values of the observed inhomogeneities (α = 5%).
Results

The median values (%) of inhomogeneities within the cement interface for the cervical, middle, and apical level of analysis were: I = 2, 2, 7; II = 15, 19, 24; III = 8, 16, 39; IV = 11, 16, 29. For the complete post length, median values (%) of inhomogeneities were: I = 4; II = 19; III = 20; IV = 18.
Significance

The conventional application technique for luting endodontic post results in a large number of voids and bubbles. The combination of a flexible root-canal-shaped application aid achieves a more homogenous cement interface for the self-adhesive luting material tested.

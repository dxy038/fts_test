Unmanned systems through military programs and numerous R&amp;D projects are now becoming operationally mature. Their use in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations can now be envisaged to enhance first responder capabilities and intervene in hazardous areas. For cost and procedural reasons however, the market is still very fragmented and business models are unclear. The DARIUS project will leverage previous R&amp;D efforts on technologies and possible added-value of these systems for situation awareness to envisage their adaptation and integration in complex multi-national/agency SAR operations. The main objective of DARIUS is to reach effective levels of interoperability so these systems can be shared between several organisations. This objective will be achieved by designing a Generic Ground Station with associated proposed standards, a full integration in the command and control cycle and a consistent communication network. In addition, DARIUS will adapt the existing unmanned systems and their payloads (air, ground and maritime) to the specificities of the Search and Rescue missions. DARIUS solutions will be evaluated in real conditions through 3 scenarios (Urban, forest fires and maritime SAR) designed by the end-users.

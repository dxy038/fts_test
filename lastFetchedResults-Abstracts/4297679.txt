This paper presents a new method to interpolate the color filter array (CFA) pattern that is commonly used in a single-sensor digital camera. The proposed method involves two main steps: slicing the color planes into layers to identify smooth local image regions; estimating the missing color values based on the spectral correlation between color planes. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing the results with those generated by other existing methods. It shows that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of both subjective and objective image quality

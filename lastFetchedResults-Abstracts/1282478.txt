In this paper a suitable mathematical model of the two terminal HVDC system is provided for optimal power flow (OPF) and optimal location based on OPF such power injection model. The ability of voltage source converter (VSC)-based HVDC to independently control active and reactive power is well represented by the model. The model is used to develop an OPF-based optimal location algorithm of two systems two terminal HVDC to minimize the total fuel cost and active power losses as objective function. The optimization framework is modeled as non-linear programming (NLP) and solved by Matlab and GAMS softwares. The proposed algorithm is implemented on the IEEE 14- and 30-bus test systems. The simulation results show ability of two systems two terminal HVDC in improving the power system operation. Furthermore, two systems two terminal HVDC is compared by PST and OUPFC in the power system operation from economical and technical aspects.

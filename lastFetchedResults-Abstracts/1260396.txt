 Although the problem of vocal fatigue is not uncommon in people with voice disorders, research on objective quantifiable indicators of vocal fatigue is limited. It has been suggested that a speaker's perception of increased phonatory effort associated with periods of prolonged voice use is related to increased lung pressure required to initiate and sustain phonation. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among perceived phonatory effort (PPE), which was used as a subjective index of vocal fatigue, and phonation threshold pressure (PTP), a quantifiable measure defined as the minimal lung pressure required to initiate and sustain vocal fold oscillation. PTP and PPE were recorded before, during, and after five adult male and five adult female speakers engaged in a prolonged oral reading task designed to induce vocal fatigue. The results supported a direct, moderately strong relationship between PTP and PPE, particularly when PTP was measured during speech produced at comfortable and low-speaking pitch levels. No gender effects were found. PTP returned to baseline levels within 1 hour after the fatiguing task. PPE returned to baseline within 1 day. The data support the use of PTP as an objective index of vocal fatigue.

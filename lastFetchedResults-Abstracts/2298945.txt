Groundwater arsenic concentrations exceeding the federal drinking water standard are common in the southern Gulf Coast aquifer system in Texas, including in aerobic, unconfined groundwater which provides much of the municipal and domestic water supplies for the region. The objective of this study was to determine geochemical factors affecting the occurrence and distribution of groundwater As in unconfined portions of the southern Gulf Coast aquifer system through a comparative transect study of groundwater across three major hydrostratigraphic units (the Catahoula Formation, Jasper aquifer and Evangeline aquifer) and analysis of regional water quality data. Results show that As concentrations decrease with increasing distance from the Catahoula Formation, which is consistent with Miocene volcanic ash as the main source of As to groundwater in the region. Arsenic concentrations correlate with V, SiO2 and K, all of which were released during weathering of volcanic sediments and their degradation products. In all three units, carbonate weathering and active recharge in the unconfined zones result in circum-neutral pH and oxidizing groundwater, which are typically amenable to As immobilization by adsorption of arsenate onto mineral oxides and clays. However, As concentrations exceed 10 Î¼g/L in approximately 30% of wells. Silica that was co-released with As may compete for sorption sites and reduce the capacity for arsenate adsorption.

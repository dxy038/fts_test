In the situation that there is not enough consideration about the trust level of the buyers and sellers in the existing connection methods which considers buyers´ attributes more, a connection method based on the buyers and sellers is proposed, which heightens the importance of the trust level of the users in the computing of the transaction success probability. In this paper, we propose a material computing method for the attribute value, which is used in the new connection method. We use an improved trust model based on multiple factors for computing the users´ creditability degree, which heightens the validity of the user´s creditability degree. Theory and experiments all show that this method is more objective.

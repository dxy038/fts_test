A robust torque and flux control strategy for induction motor is proposed with L<sub>2</sub> disturbance attenuation. The L<sub>2</sub> gain from the disturbance to the penalty signal denotes the robustness of the control system to some extent. The appropriate control method can reduce the L<sub>2</sub> gain to a given level. The controller design proceeds along two stages. The first stage is to choose the desired flux and current state, which match the control objective. In the second step, the tracking error system is considered and the control law is designed to force the L<sub>2</sub> gain in a given region. The robustness is verified by simulation results with uncertain rotor and stator resistance.

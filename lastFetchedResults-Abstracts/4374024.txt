To find an optimal multi-machine scheduling for objective tasks with deadline constraints, an optimal model was proposed, and GASA hybrid optimal strategy was applied to solve this problem. Each individual has two gene clusters, one record the order of the tasks to be executed, the other stands for the number of the tasks allocated to each machine. Individuals created by greedy algorithm were introduced to improve adaptability of initial population, and simulated annealing algorithm was introduced to avoid prematurity. Several simulation experiments show that the proposed scheduling algorithm is valid and feasible

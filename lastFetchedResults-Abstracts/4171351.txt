This paper describes the compression of grayscale medical ultrasound images using a recent compression technique, i.e., space-frequency segmentation (SITS). This method finds the rate-distortion optimal representation of an image from a large set of possible space-frequency partitions and quantizer combinations and is especially effective when the images to code are statistically inhomogeneous, which is the case for medical ultrasound images. We implemented a compression application based on this method and tested the algorithm on representative ultrasound images. The result is an effective technique that performs better than a leading wavelet-transform coding algorithm, i.e., set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT), using standard objective distortion measures. To determine the subjective qualitative performance, an expert viewer study was run by presenting ultrasound radiologists with images compressed using both SFS and SPIHT. The results confirmed the objective performance rankings. Finally, the performance sensitivity of the space-frequency codec is shown with respect to several parameters, and the characteristic space-frequency partitions found for ultrasound images are discussed.

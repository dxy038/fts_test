As a result of the increasing operating frequency and the number of transistors of IC, not only the signal integrity (SI), but the power integrity (PI) has also grown from non-existent to an important system. The objective of power integrity is to produce a clean signal for the high-speed driver by supplying a good source. A good source needs to fulfill two criteria: 1) meet the DC power requirement and 2) reduce the power fluctuation caused by the AC current switch. This paper will discuss power integrity simulation using the 3D fullwave simulation tool CST STUDIO SUITE<sup>&#174;</sup>. The accuracy of the simulation results are also compared with the measurement results.

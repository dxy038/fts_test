This research tries to bring in an enterprise view to road safety information management towards understanding the whole and making sense out of it for improved decision-making in the effort of reducing the problem of road safety. Under the umbrella of an information architecture research for road safety, the objective of this research is to identify the role of collision related factors to the severity of an accident in explaining road safety situations and define or construct road safety information architecture based on existing enterprise frameworks. The research followed a Design Science research paradigm and Zachman Enterprise Framework was used to guide the development of the road safety information architecture. The research also employed classification techniques using Decision tree and Rule induction approaches. Results showed that the architectural representation guided by the selected framework can provide a holistic view to the management of road safety data. Moreover the identified patterns in a form of rule can supplement the previous severity prediction experiments with promising performance.

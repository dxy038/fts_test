The problem of horizontal collaboration clustering which collaboration coefficient is usually given by priori knowledge is carefully researched. This paper provides an approach to obtain the optimal weight by taking the weight factor as a variable in the term of the objective function. Theory analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm can get better clustering result.

Many spatial decision making problem not only includes spatial analysis and display, but also includes conflicting solutions, how to find multi-objective solutions is important for spatial decision making. This paper developed a spatial data mining module based on multi-objective optimization to solve multi-objective spatial data mining problem. The application case improve that the spatial mining module is available.

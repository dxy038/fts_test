An objective quality assessment method for H.264 high definition (HD) video streams in the compressed domain is presented in this paper. Based on the H.264 open-source codec project JM12.4, we design an efficient system to extract two video features as the input vectors without fully decoding the videos. These features are analyzed by Least Squares method. Fourteen HD sequences coded at four kinds of bit-rates are tested in our experiment. The experimental results show that this system obtains an accurate quality evaluation. In addition, our methods can be applied to real time monitoring, since the model does not require the source pictures, or a complete decoding process, and can get a good corresponding with the subjective assessments results.

The main task of this work was to study the influence of the cooling conditions after homogenization of the 6082 aluminium alloys. The effect of the solution heat treatment temperature on the mechanism and ageing kinetics of the two commercial wrought aluminum alloys 6005 and 6082 was also analyzed. The alloys were heat treated—T4 with a wide range of solution heat treatment temperature from 510 to 580 °C and then natural ageing in the room temperature. Then, Brinell hardness measurements were conducted on both alloys in order to examine the influence of ageing time on the precipitation hardening behavior. The microstructure changes of the aluminium alloys following ageing for 120 h has been investigated by metallographic and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The minor objective of the present study was to determine how extrusion processing affected the microstructure and mechanical properties of both aluminium alloys. For this purpose tensile tests were performed.

Thermal dissipation in power electronics systems is becoming an extremely important issue with the continuous growth of power density in their components. The primary cause of failure in this equipment is excessive temperatures in the critical components, such as semiconductors and transformers. This problem is particularly important in power electronic systems for space applications. These systems are usually housed in completely sealed enclosures for safety reasons. The effective management of heat removal from a sealed enclosure poses a major thermal-design challenge since the cooling of these systems primarily rely on natural convection. In this context, the presented paper treats the heat pipes as effective heat transfer devices that can be used to raise the thermal conductive path in order to spread a concentrated heat source over a larger surface area. As a result, the high heat flux at the heat source can be reduced to a smaller and manageable level that can be dissipated through conventional cooling methods. The objective of our work is to describe the feasibility of a cooling system with miniature heat pipes embedded in a direct bonded copper (DBC) structure. The advantage of this type of heat pipe is the possibility for implementation of the component layout on the heat pipe itself, which eliminates the existence of a thermal interface between the device and the cooling system

In the 21<sup>st</sup> century network security is rated as one of most demanding domain in computer science and engineering where numerous organizations and researchers are giving their contribution to enhance the existing network security framework in various ways. This paper is aimed at discussing about the enhancement of firewalls policies in the network. The network security and firewalls are two words which seem to be closely attached to each other as we know firewall provides security to network in organization efficiently. The firewalls are no doubt very efficient in securing data in network but still there is wide scope of improvement to utilize it in network with the best usage. The scope of improvement in firewalls policies configuration proves to be a good step towards better security in network. The timely firewalls policies start becoming obsolete and start getting conflicts complaints. Our objective is to eliminate the unused polices and provide updated and timely required policies to provide better security to network to avoid any untoward network security attacks.

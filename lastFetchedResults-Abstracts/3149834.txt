A new flow shop scheduling problem (FSP) is studied, which is abstracted from the auto assemble workshop. The problem is characterized by multi-workstation operation and stopping-line operation, and fluctuant processing time. It is a typical NP-hard optimization problem with strong industrial roots. Firstly, the mathematical model of this scheduling problem is constructed. And then the scheduling results are obtained based on hybrid algorithm of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm (GASA). The objective is to minimize the completion time. Lastly, testing and analyzing the performance of scheduling results through 2D animation simulation. Simulation results show that the method is available and efficient.

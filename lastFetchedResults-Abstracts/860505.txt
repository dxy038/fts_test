In this paper, it is shown how the Lipschitz continuity of a global optimization problem's objective function influences the termination of a Hansen type method. The results concern applying different termination criteria to a Hansen method and retrieving more information than explicitly supplied by a certain criterion. A similar result for Moore-Skelboe methods arises, as a consequence.

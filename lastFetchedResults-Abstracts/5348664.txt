This paper presents a fuel cell to wheel model that has been developed to design and optimize a high efficiency fuel cell based vehicle. This prototype car runs energetic races where the main objective is to go the furthest with the lowest energy. The main subsystems of the vehicle are the fuel-cell, the power converter, the motor and the mechanical train. Each subsystem has a best operating point which can not be obtained when all subsystems are linked together. The fuel-cell to wheel model is then used to reach the best efficiency and the results are compared with experimental measurements.

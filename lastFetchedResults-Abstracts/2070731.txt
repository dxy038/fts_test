Objective: Hypertrophic scar involves excessive amounts of collagen in dermal layer and
may be painful. Nowadays, we can’t be sure about effectiveness of procedure for hypertrophic
scar management. The application of stem cells with natural scaffold has been the
best option for treatment of burn wounds and skin defect, in recent decades. Fibrin glue
(FG) was among the first of the natural biomaterials applied to enhance skin deformity in
burn patients. This study aimed to identify an efficient, minimally invasive and economical
transplantation procedure using novel FG from human cord blood for treatment of hypertrophic
scar and regulation collagen synthesis.
Materials and Methods: In this case series study, eight patients were selected with hypertrophic
scar due to full-thickness burns. Human keratinocytes and fibroblasts derived
from adult skin donors were isolated and cultured. They were tested for the expression of
cytokeratin 14 and vimentin using immunocytochemistry. FG was prepared from pooled
cord blood. Hypertrophic scars were extensively excised then grafted by simply placing
the sheet of FG containing autologous fibroblast and keratinocytes. Histological analyses
were performed using Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s Trichrome (MT) staining
of the biopsies after 8 weeks.
Results: Cultured keratinocytes showed a high level of cytokeratin 14 expression and
also fibroblasts showed a high level of vimentin. Histological analyses of skin biopsies
after 8 weeks of transplantation revealed re-epithelialization with reduction of hypertrophic
scars in 2 patients.
Conclusion: These results suggest may be the use of FG from cord blood, which is not
more efficient than previous biological transporters and increasing hypertrophic scar
relapse, but could lead to decrease pain rate.

Automatic methods for location area code (LAC) planning in mobile networks require prediction values of the expected signaling traffic (paging, location update, etc.) that have to be provided by signaling traffic models. It is a main objective that the input data of the methods and models are based on performance measurement values from the operations and maintenance center (OMC). In this paper, the performance of redistribution of measurement values for cell planning is investigated. Cell assignment probabilities (CAP) are used to distribute measurement values over cell areas. Then, CAPs of a new cell plan are used to reassign the former measurement distributions resulting in cell prediction values. The analysis of the prediction performance is carried out by comparing the mobile terminated call (MTC) prediction values based on one network status with OMC measurement values of a following network status. Network and OMC measurement data are provided by a real network.

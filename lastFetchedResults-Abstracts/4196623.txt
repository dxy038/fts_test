The objective of this paper is to show an alternative methodology to calculate transmission line parameters per unit length. With this methodology the transmission line parameters can be obtained starting from the phase currents and voltages in one terminal of the line. First, the article shows the classical methodology to calculate frequency dependent transmission line parameters by using Carson´s and Pollaczeck´s equations for representing the ground effect and Bessel´s functions to represent the skin effect. After that, it is shown a new procedure to calculate frequency dependent transmission line parameters directly from currents and voltages of the line that is already built. Then, this procedure is applied in a two-phase transmission line whose parameters have been previously calculated by using the classical methodology. Finally, the results obtained by using the new procedure and by using the classical methodology are compared.

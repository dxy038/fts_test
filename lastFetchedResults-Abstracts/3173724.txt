The radial basis function network (RBFN) has been widely used in various fields such as function regression, pattern recognition, and error detection, etc. However, the structural parameters of RBFN including the number of hidden units, centers vectors, and widths (variances) are one of the most important issues when training a RBFN, which greatly affect the performance of RBFN. So, the objective of this paper is to construct an elementary survey about this problem. Firstly, the fundamental knowledge and notations of RBFN is introduced. Secondly, we summarize most existing network structure initialization methods for RBFN and categorize them into four goups. Then some typical appraoches for each category are introduced and discussed. The disadvantages and virtues for parts of methods are also introduced. Finally, the paper is concluded with a discussion of current difficulties and possible future directions about RBFN architecture selection.

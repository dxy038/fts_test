Abstract  
Background and Objective: Electroconvulsive Therapy is a psychiatric treatment in which a group of   professions including anesthesia, psychiatry and nursing are needed. One of the most important nursing cares is patient education, especially about having temporary cognitive impairment occurred after ECT. This study investigated the effect of training on cognitive status of patients undertaken ECT.  
Material and Methods: This pre-experimental study was conducted on 74 patients, first treated with electroconvulsive therapy, who were placed randomly in two equal groups of case and control. In case group, we used pamphlet, images and lecture to give information. Patientsâ€™ cognitive status was assessed before ECT and   twenty-four hours after the first, third and sixth sessions.  The data was collected by a questionnaire called MMSE cognitive status and analyzed by Repeated measurement and t-test.
Results: There is significant difference between cognitive status of case and controls  (p >  0/01) 24 hours after the first and third treatment sessions, but no   changes for sixth session.  
Conclusion: lack of knowledge results in fear and disturbances, which in turn leads to exacerbating of cognitive problems. Thus, nurses are required to give the patients adequate information before ECT.

Objective. – The function of the C-terminus region of the human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) has not been well characterized except for its involvement in trafficking. To understand further the role of C-terminus region, we performed a functional analysis of a novel frameshift mutation (1122fs/147) identified in a Japanese long QT syndrome 2 (LQT2) patient who had recurrent episodes of syncope.
Methods. – Wild type (WT) and mutant HERG plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, and whole-cell current was recorded by the patch-clamp technique. Confocal microscopy was performed to examine the membrane distribution of channel protein using a green fluorescent protein tagged to the N-terminus of HERG.
Results. – The mutant 1122fs/147 alone could express current, but reduced density by 74% of control. No dominant negative effect was noted with co-expression of WT and 1122fs/147. Activation and deactivation time constants were not changed, while inactivation was accelerated in 1122fs/147 compared to WT, and V1/2 of steady-state inactivation curve shifted by 11 mV in the negative direction. Current density of 1123stop mutant revealed 49% reduction compared to WT and showed no shift in steady-state inactivation. Confocal microscopy revealed reduced protein expression on the cell surface both in 1122fs/147 and 1123stop mutants compared to WT.
Conclusion. – Frameshift mutation at the C-terminus region with additional 147 amino acids evoked a loss of function of the HERG channel. A negative shift in steady-state inactivation induced by the additional 147 amino acids and trafficking defect contribute to a reduced current amplitude of 1122fs/147.

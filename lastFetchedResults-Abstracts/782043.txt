The fertility obtained in sheep after the use of intravaginal progesterone devices is related
to the content of progesterone of the device. The hypothesis of this study was that the
reproductive response of anoestrous ewes to the ram-effect could be improved by the
administration of oestradiol-17  in conjunction with CIDRs treatment—using previously
used CIDRs in a 5-day progestagen priming. Therefore, the objective was to determine if
oestradiol-17  treatment increases fertility of anoestrous ewes primed with used CIDRs
and stimulated by the ram-effect. The hypothesis was tested with CIDRs that had been
previously used for 12 or 18 days. The trial was performed during the non-breeding season
using 158 Corriedale ewes. Ewes had been isolated from rams since Day −35 (Day
0 = introduction of the rams). A CIDR (0.3 g progesterone, InterAg, Hamilton, New Zealand)
was inserted on Day −5 in all ewes with CIDR that had been previously used for 12 days
(n = 62) or 18 days (n = 96). Also on Day −5, 29 and 53 ewes that had received CIDRs of 12
or 18 days, respectively, received an intra-muscular treatment of 50 g of oestradiol-17 
(E groups). The ewes that did not receive the oestradiol-17  treatment remained as the
control group (C group). Overall the treatment groups were thus: C12 (n = 33), C18 (n = 43),
E12 (n = 29), and E18 (n = 53). On Day 0 all CIDRs were withdrawn, and ewes were placed
with 18 rams and 20 ewes hormonally induced to exhibit oestrus. Sexual receptivity of
ewes treated with CIDRs was estimated from marks on the rumps of the ewes daily from
Day 0 to Day 5, and the pregnancy status diagnosed with transrectal ultrasonography on
Day 40. The percentage of ewes exhibiting oestrus and pregnancy rates were lower in ewes
synchronized with previously used CIDRs for 18 days, compared to those used for 12 days.
The responses of ewes in oestrus were 39.4, 14.0, 65.5, and 32.1% for the C12, C18, E12, and
E18 groups respectively, with pregnancy rates of 30.3, 14.0, 34.5, and 17.0%. Administration
of oestradiol-17  increased the frequency of oestrous response in ewes that were treated
with CIDRs previously used for 12 days (P < 0.05), but not in those treated with CIDRs used
for 18 days. It could be concluded that the administration of oestradiol-17  only improved
the percentage of ewes responding to oestrus when CIDRs previously used for 12 dayswere
used for 5 days before the introduction of rams. No positive effect on fertility was observed
irrespective of the period during which CIDR had been previously used.

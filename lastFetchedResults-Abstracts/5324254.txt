The modeling and coordinated control strategy based on self tuned variable structure sliding mode dynamic controller for a wind-diesel-fuel cell renewable generation system with battery backup are discussed in this paper. The proposed hybrid scheme tracks the maximum power efficiency and optimal energy capture from the wind, diesel and the fuel cell. The diesel generator set unit issued to balance the system demand power according to the total power demand in order to minimize the diesel fuel consumption. The paper presents a novel application of Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO technique to control the 6-pulse rectifier converter, dynamic filter/capacitor compensation DFC and Green Power Filter GPF schemes using real time dynamic self regulating error tracking to maximize the energy capture from the wind turbine. A tri-loop error driven dynamic controller is used to adjust the PWM switching of the DFC- Dynamic AC side filter compensator and green power filter. Full power factor correction and power quality enhancement is validated under different operating conditions, including sudden load disturbances and wind velocity excursions. Multi Objective Optimization MOPSO technique is used to find the optimal control gain settings that dynamically minimize the global dynamic error.

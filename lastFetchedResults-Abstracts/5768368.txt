A new type of dielectric lens used for the compact-field test is designed in this paper. The main formulation for such a design is based upon the geometrical optics method. The light path-differences are chosen as the objective function to implement the optimization. After the contour of the lit side of the lens is theoretically optimized, the mathematical function expression of the contour is obtained. The transmitted electromagnetic waves across the lens are proven to be approximately plane waves within &#177;20&#176; scanning angle. Finally, the light path-differences between one which is with lens and one which is without lens are compared which demonstrates that the existence of such a lens is very effective for making the propagated wave much closer to a plane wave.

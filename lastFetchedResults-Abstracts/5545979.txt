In this work, a determinististic, efficient design methodology is put forward to design a wide-band, low-noise microstrip amplifier, where the microstrip widths, lengths {W<sup>&#8594;</sup>,&#8467;<sup>&#8594;</sup>} of the input/ output matching networks are obtained accurately and fast for a substrate {&#949;<sub>r</sub>, h, tan&#948;} using the cost-effective 3D EM- based Support Vector Regression Machine (SVRM) microstrip model provided that ensuring the stable source Z<sub>S</sub>(&#969;) and load Z<sub>L</sub>(&#969;) terminations for the compatible {Noise F(&#969;) &#8805; F<sub>min</sub>(&#969;), Input VSWR Vi(&#969;) &#8805;1, Gain G<sub>Tmin</sub>(&#969;)&gt;G<sub>T</sub>(&#969;)&#8805;G<sub>Tmax</sub>(&#969;), Bandwidth B} quadrates of the employed transistor. The 3D EM- based SVRM microstrip model provides the accurate and fast characterization of the equivalent transmission line in terms of the characteristic impedance Z<sub>0</sub> and the dielectric constant &#949;<sub>eff</sub> within the continuous domain of {0.1mm &#8804; W &#8804; 4.6 mm, 2 &#8804; &#949;<sub>r</sub> &#8804; 10, 0.1mm &#8804; h &#8804; 2.2mm, 2GHz &#8804; f &#8804; 14GHz} in an efficient manner. In the modeling process, the substantial reduction (up to %64) is obtained utilizing sparseness of SVRM in the number of expensive fine discretization training data with the negligible loss in the predictive accuracy using the quasi-TEM microstrip synthesis formulas as the coarse model that allow to identify the regions of the design space requiring denser sampling. Moreover, the multi-objective amplifier design problem is reduced into the two single-objective design problems of the input(IM)/ output (OM)matching networks to provide the source Z<sub>S</sub>(&#969;) and load Z<sub>L</sub>(&#969;) terminations to the transistor, respectively. Finally the design methodology is applied to the design of typical wideband lo- -noise amplifiers of the transistor NE3512S02 within 3GHz and 8GHz using T-, II- L types of microstrip matching circuits satisfying the maximum gain provided the available minimum noise and a permitted amount of input mismatching at each operation frequency. In the design optimization of the IM/OM networks, a Memetic Algorithm (MA) in which a simple local optimizer called Nelder-Mead (NM) algorithm is used along with the global optimizer Particle Swarm (PSO) algorithm is used. Furthermore, typical T-T designed amplifier is validated using the Circuit Simulator AWR and 3 D EM Simulator SONNET.

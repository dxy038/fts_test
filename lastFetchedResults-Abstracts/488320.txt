Background and Objective: Off pump coronary artery bypass graft can be done with or without using intracoronary shunt. We have compared these two methods in early postoperative period, in this study. Materials and Methods: 208 candidate patients for off pump coronary artery bypass graft were devided in to two groups randomly for using intracoronary shunt or not. Variables including peri and postoperative changes in electrocardiography and echocardiography, rate of myocardial infarction, mortality, morbidity, and cardiac enzymes, were estimated.
Results: There was no significant difference between two groups in electrocardiographic changes, myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction,hospital mortality and intensive care unit stay but Creatine Kinase Myocardial Band enzymes were higher in group not using intracoronary shunt. In contrast troponin I was increased in group using intracoronary shunt.
Conclusion: Using intracoronary shunt in off pump coronary artery bypass graft leads to lesser change in cardiac enzymes but does not impact peri and postoperative evidence of myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction,mortality and morbidity. Using intra coronary shunt is suggested however because of simpler surgical procedure and less intra operative hemodynamic changes.

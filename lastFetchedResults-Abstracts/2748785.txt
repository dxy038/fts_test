A family of algorithms, named &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-MUSIC, for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in impulsive noise is proposed. The &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-MUSIC estimator adopts the &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-norm (1 &#8804; p 2) of the residual fitting error matrix as the objective function for subspace decomposition, rather than the Frobenius norm that is used in the conventional MUSIC method. Although the matrix &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-norm minimization based subspace decomposition will lead to a nonconvex optimization problem, two iterative algorithms are designed for achieving efficient solutions. The first algorithm is the iteratively reweighted singular value decomposition (IR-SVD), where the SVD of a reweighted data matrix is performed in each iteration. The second algorithm solves the nonconvex matrix &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-norm minimization by alternating convex optimization. Two complex-valued NewtonÂ´s methods with optimal step size in each iteration are devised to solve the resulting convex problem. The convergence of the iterative procedure is also proved. Numerical results verify that the &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-MUSIC methodology outperforms the standard MUSIC scheme and several existing outlier-resistant DOA estimation approaches in terms of resolution capability and estimation accuracy.

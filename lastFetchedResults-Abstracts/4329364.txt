Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are seen to be a step forward in vehicle electrification, to replace ICE-based conventional vehicles. On the one hand, using a PHEV means that a part of the vehicle energy comes from the grid or other sources, such as renewable energy, to charge the battery. On the other hand, increasing the number of nuclear and coal power plants to supply these new needs would shift the problem to another place, and will not permit solving the problem of pollution or fossil fuel depletion. The main idea presented in this paper consists in sharing the production between the home and the vehicle and use at the same time the vehicle to supply power to the home appliances during the electricity peak demand (i.e., when the prices are the highest). In this study, a general control strategy is designed, taking into account the overall system (grid, local production from renewable, and vehicle, including its battery). Furthermore, a simulation, including the household daily power profile and the PHEV drive cycle is presented. The home power profile takes into account photovoltaic (PV) and wind production as well as home load profile based on real data. The objective of the control strategy is to minimize the total energy cost.

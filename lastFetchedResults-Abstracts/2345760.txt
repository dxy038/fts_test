Honing with an adaptronic system is an approach to manufacture free forms in liner bores. The objective is to produce bores which fulfill highest demands on cylindricity also under the influence of distortion mechanisms in operation. The investigations are aimed at providing a model-like description of the tool-specific machining conditions and at their implementation using a suitable control system. In this paper the process modeling is presented as well as the influencing factors on shape, dimensions and surface accuracy are discussed also with regard to optimizing the tribological behavior. In addition, the performance of the adaptronic honing system is evaluated.

The paper deals with the problems of the dynamic capacity allocation in satellite system, where the round trip time (or dead time) between the request and the assignment is greater than the maximum tolerated delay for packet transmission, in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). The objective of the algorithm proposed in this paper is to maximize the radio link utilization tacking into account the QoS requirements. The satellite network has been modeled and a feedback controller has been studied, in order to define a control strategy to steer the system towards the target equilibrium.

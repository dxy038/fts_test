The objective of knowledge integration is to promote knowledge collection, sharing and retrieval in distributed and heterogeneous environment. Our workgroup develops a domain-oriented model for knowledge integration in distributed heterogeneous environment such as semantic grid, which promises better access to relevant knowledge by producing a global domain ontology that is used for establishing semantic connections among the local autonomous knowledge sources as well as for retrieving those sources. The paper describes the architecture of the model, mainly introduces the data translation service, which puts forward an ontology based common semantic model and an XML based data model, presents the data translation algorithm between different knowledge sources and an adapter framework for accessing distributed heterogeneous knowledge as well.

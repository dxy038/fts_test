In this paper, four typical thinning intensity were choose to the larch forests. After thinning, significant differences in stand periodic increment between control and thinning plots appeared. ANOVA indicated significant difference in any stand characteristic among treatments prior to thinning. Information on the distribution of stand characteristics in specific tree-size classes at given is valuable to for managers. So the objective of this study was to develop and compare the two methods (i, e., Normal distribution and Weibull distribution) for estimating the diameter distribution of larch forests Baesd on Different thinning intensity in Changbai Mountain, Northeast China, the results showed that all the thinning intensity followed the Normal distribution, and the correlation coefficients were above 0.918, but only the middle thinning conforms to the Weibull distribution, the correlation coefficient is 0.929. From chi-test results, the diameter structure simulated in this paper is applied, and with small application error and high precision. This showed that the Normal distribution can be chosen the prediction function for the area with stand structure distribution in the future.

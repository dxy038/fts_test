Considering the nonlinear trait and the disturbance effect of power systems, a new design scheme is presented in this paper, and the exact feedback linearization of differential geometry and linear robust Hinfin control is applied to the design of the excitation controller. The proposed controller can effectively enhance the transient stability for a power system and stabilize the terminal voltage by means of the feedback of generator terminal voltage whose objective is to obtain voltage regulation about the prescribed reference. Simulation on a single-machine infinite-bus power system shows that the nonlinear robust Hinfincoordinated excitation controller is very effective for the improvement of system stability and disturbance attenuation compared with the non-linear excitation controller and the traditional PID controller.

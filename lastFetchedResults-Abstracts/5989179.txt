Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have been proposed as an extremely flexible technology tor establishing wireless communications. In comparison with fixed networks, some new security issues have arisen with the introduction of MANETs. Secure routing, in particular, is an important and complicated issue. Clustering is commonly used in order to limit the amount of secure routing information. In this work, we propose an enhanced solution for ad hoc clustering based on multi hops and network density. This solution will be used as a framework to manage cryptographic keys in a distributed way. This paper details the density-based clustering algorithm for the standard OLSR protocol. Our algorithm takes into account the node mobility and gives major improvements regarding the number of elected cluster heads. Our objective is to elect a reduced and less mobile cluster heads that will serve for keys exchange.

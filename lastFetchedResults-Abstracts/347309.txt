Objective: To validate a new clinical scale of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The scale is based on clinical history and physical examination findings and includes two figures. The first is a score determined by clinical history and objective findings. The second evaluates the presence/absence of pain as a dichotomous categorical score.
Methods: One hundred and sixty-eight consecutive idiopathic CTS hands were studied in two centers (Rome, Siena). We compare the results of the historical-objective scale (Hi-Ob scale) with the results of other validated measurements of CTS severity: (1) the Italian version of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, (2) the neurophysiological classification adopted by the Italian CTS study group. Furthermore, for the Hi-Ob scale the intra-observer and inter-observer evaluations were assessed.
Results: The main Hi-Ob parameter was positively related to the conventional validated measurements. Conversely, the category ‘PAIN’ of the Hi-Ob scale appeared unrelated to the other clinical and electrophysiological parameters. Intra- and inter-observer evaluation showed the reproducibility of the Hi-Ob assessment.
Conclusions: Our data show that the Hi-Ob scale is a reliable measurement which may be useful in CTS evaluation either for clinical or for scientific purposes.

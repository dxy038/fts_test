A novel modification of the Fuzzy Clustering for Categorical Multivariate date (FCCM) algorithm termed as dasiaFuzzy Co-Clustering Algorithm for Images (FCCI)psila is proposed for clustering of medical images. The main aim of this work is to segment regions of interest in histo-pathological images which consist of groups of similar cells indicating some form of abnormality in the animal tissue. The proposed method relies on improved colour clustering results when FCCI is applied on images as compared to the conventional clustering techniques. The method also categorizes different types of lesions based on the co-clustering results. The objective function is optimized using the bacterial foraging algorithm which gives image specific values to the parameters involved in the algorithm. The colour segmentation results are found to be more accurate, producing well formed and valid clusters having ldquocrisppsila values of membership function with lesser number of iterations. The algorithm results in distinct co-clusters ranked in the order of their memberships.

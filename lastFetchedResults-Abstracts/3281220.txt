This paper studies both cooperative and noncooperative amplify-and-forward (AF) wireless relay strategies with power constraints at the source and at the relays. The main objective is to design jointly and iteratively the closed form of a source scaling factor and a relay amplifying matrix, based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion under the conditions of both no-channel and channel phase misalignments. With the derived optimal source scaling factors and relay amplifying matrices, impacts on the system performance of both no-channel and channel phase misalignment are investigated by presenting the bit error rate and cost function behavior. Finally, this paper presents the iterative algorithm to solve the constrained Lagrangian optimization problem with a low computational complexity.

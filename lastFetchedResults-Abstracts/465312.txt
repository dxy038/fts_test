OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether intraocular pressure differs between preeclamptic and normotensive women in the peripartum period.
STUDY DESIGN: Eighteen preeclamptic (defined as blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg and ≥1+ proteinuria) and 18 normotensive women were studied. Intraocular pressure was determined with a handheld tonometer. Each intraocular pressure determination was obtained by repeatedly touching the cornea until signal averaging produced a single measurement with a variance <5%. Right and left intraocular pressure, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained intrapartum and 24 hours post partum with the patient in the seated, supine, and left lateral positions. Data are reported as mean ± SD or median (range) as appropriate. Significance was set at p< 0.05.
RESULTS: No differences existed in race, age, weight, gravidity, parity, cervical dilatation, and heart rate between the preeclamptic and normotensive groups. Gestational age was lower (39 [34 to 42] vs 41 [34 to 42] weeks, p = 0.003), and intrapartum mean arterial pressure (100.2 ± 9.8 vs 81.0 ± 8.3 mm Hg, p< 0.001) and degree of proteinuria (3 [1 to 4] vs 0, p< 0.001) were higher in the preeclamptic group. There was no effect of position or delivery on intraocular pressure in either group. Intraocular pressure was higher in the preeclamptic group in the intrapartum (18.8 ± 3.0 vs 15.3 ± 2.7 mm Hg, p< 0.001) and postpartum periods (20.2 ± 4.5 vs 15.7 ± 3.6 mm Hg, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Compared with normotensive women, preeclamptic women have increased intraocular pressure in the peripartum period. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:1052-5.)

Background: Gastric surgeries are still among the major causes of surgery complications. Study on prevalence of these complications and recognition of their risk factors are strongly needed. Objective: To study Gastric surgery complications and strategies for their management in patients hospitalized at Ayatollah Taleghani hospital.
Methods: In this Cross-sectional study all gastric surgeries at Ayatollah Taleghani hospital between 1994 and 2002 were assessed. Variables were age, sex, type of surgery, indication of surgery, type of complication and management strategy (medical or surgical). Data were collected from patients' medical records.
Findings: Indications for surgery were gastric malignancy & neoplasia in 277 patients (59.8%), peptic ulcer in 151 (32.6%), and other causes in 7.6%. The most prevalent surgeries were Billroth II (23%) and total gastrectomy (15%). The highest level of complications was observed in Billroth II (24%). Complications of surgery occurred in 42 cases (9%) among those 33 males and 9 females. Except for vagotomy & pyloroplasty, less than 50% of complications needed surgical management. Conclusion: This study showed that the prevalence of gastric surgeries complications is 9%, comparable to those found in other studies. The most prevalent surgeries were Billroth II and total gastrectomy, believed to be associated with relatively higher level of complications.

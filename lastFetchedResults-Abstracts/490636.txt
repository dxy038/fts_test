Objective: The goal of current research is the assessment of cognitive emotion regulation strategies according to neuroticism and extraversion personality dimensions. Method: To do so, 725 university male students completed the Persian version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire- Revised (EPQ-R). Then, on the basis of extreme scores in extraversion and neuroticism dimensions from the main sample, 4 groups including introvert, extravert, neurotic and emotional stable (each with 35 Ss) were selected and assessed by Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Results: Results indicated that neurotics in confrontation with negative experience use more self-blame, acceptance, rumination, putting into perspective, catastrophizing and other-blame strategies. Whereas, emotional stables utilize more positive refocusing and refocus on planning strategies. Prevalent strategies in extra verts were positive refocusing, putting into perspective and positive reappraisal. Whilst, introverts use more self-blame, acceptance, rumination, refocus on planning, catastrophizing and other-blame strategies. Conclusion: On the basis of this findings, we could claim that personality traits play an important role in choosing emotion regulation strategies and the type of emotion regulation strategies is in accordance with one dominant personality trait.


The World Trade Organization (WTO) is one of the most important international organizations came into being after the establishment of the United Nations. It seems that one of the main articles in Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) of WTO is article 23, titled “Strengthening of Multilateral System”, under which the idea of self-containedness of WTO has originated. Article 23 of DSU states that when Members seek the redress of a violation of obligations or other nullification or impairment of benefits under the covered agreements or an impediment to the attainment of any objective of the covered agreements, they shall has recourse to, and abide by, the rules and procedures of this Understanding. Hence, according to the explicit text of DSU, recourse to outside rules and procedures of WTO have not been permitted and as mentioned above, one may become uncertain of self-containedness of WTO legal regime.

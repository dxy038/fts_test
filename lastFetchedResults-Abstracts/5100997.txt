A robust nonlinear predictive controller for single-link flexible joint robot is presented in this paper. The objective is to track some predefined profiles for angular displacement of the link. The prediction model, used in the controller design, is carried out via Taylor series expansion. The uncertainties and error modeling of the system are taken into account by this controller. In order to deal with them, a disturbance observer is designed from the predictive control law. Simulation results show the high performance of the proposed control scheme.

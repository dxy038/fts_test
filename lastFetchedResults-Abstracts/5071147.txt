In this paper, we propose a scheme for image denoising by combining bilateral filtering in spacial domain with curvelet hard shrinkage method in transformed domain. That is, we first pre-process noisy image with curvelet hard shrinkage, then to process the obtained image with bilateral filtering. Numerical experiments illustrate the good performance in comparison to the curvelet hard shrinkage method and the bilateral filtering method by using two objective measures: peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM).

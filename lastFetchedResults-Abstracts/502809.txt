The most important cause of postmenopausal bleeding is endometrial cancer but tuberculosis accounts for only 1% of the postmenopausal metrorrhagia. The association of these two disorders is extremely rare. The presented case is a 58-year-old postmenopausal woman complaining of a bloody vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. The laparatomy was performed and histologic examination of the uterus disclosed an endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, grade G1 invading less than one-half of the myometrial thickness. The tumor was associated with an extensive granulomatous reaction, with numerous tubercles composed of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells of Langhans type and central caseation necrosis. These granulomas were seen close to the carcinoma in the Endometrium and far from the neoplasm in the myometrium, endocervix, right ovary and pelvic lymph nodes. Although the coexistence of endometrial cancer and tuberculosis is extremely rare, it may occur in patients who live in the regions with a high prevalence of tuberculosis.

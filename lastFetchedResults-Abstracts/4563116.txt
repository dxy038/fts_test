A hybrid train system employing fuel cells (FC) and lithium-ion batteries (Li Bat) is one of the most effective ways of coping with the drawbacks of diesel vehicles. This paper describes the design, construction and testing of a drive control method for such a hybrid test train using a traction inverter for which the user can modify the control program. The primary objective of this research is to deduce operation statuses of power sources from the input voltage of the traction inverter. A secondary aim is to change the maximum traction electric power based on the outcome of such deduction. This paper presents the design of the method along with the results of practical testing, and investigates compatibility between the drive control method and the FC/Li Bat hybrid system.

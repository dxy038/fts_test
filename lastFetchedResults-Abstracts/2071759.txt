This paper presents a technique which finds a
mapping of the vertices of a task graph to the tiles of a mesh
based network on chip (NoC) architecture. The proposed
algorithm is basically a genetic algorithm. The algorithm
helps us achieve optimal or near optimal solutions in large
size applications with reasonable time. In this process
different types of Genetic algorithms are applied in the basic
framework for solving the mapping problem on two real core
graphs Video Objective Plan Decoder and mp3encmp3dec.
The experimental results show the comparisons of these
different meta heuristic algorithms with each other. It show
that the proposed algorithm performs as well as the most
previously proposed mapping algorithms considering the
communication cost parameter. It is a common metric in
evaluation of different mapping algorithms which have direct
impact on power consumption and performance of mapped
NoC.

Our objective was to demonstrate a role of chromium (Cr) in response to severe burn. A third-degree burn involving 20% of total body surface was applied under anaesthesia in accord with ethical guidelines. Chromium concentrations in liver decreased progressively and were non-detectable on days 5 and 10 following injury. In quadriceps muscle, Cr concentrations increased 6 h after injury and then declined significantly within the first day and remained at these levels the following 9 days. Urinary Cr losses were also increased. Changes in kidney, brain and serum Cr were not significant. Non-fasting glucose rose 6 h after injury and then returned to levels measured before the burn. There was a significant rise in corticosterone reaching a maximum the first day after injury that was accompanied by significant increases in circulating insulin and glucagon that were maximal after 2 days. Changes in IGF-1 were not significant. In summary, changes in Cr concentrations were associated with an early hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and increased secretion of stress hormones. These observations strongly suggest a mobilization and utilization of Cr following severe burn. Additional studies are needed to document that improved Cr status might lead to improved recovery following burn.

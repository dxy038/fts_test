Volvo Logistics North America is currently seeking to consolidate 16 United States distribution centers into one center in Radford Virginia. Included in the scope of this project, was determining an equipment process layout and designing an inventory management tool. The overall objective was to determine the most efficient layout of process lines for receiving, sorting, inspection, and storing of customer owned equipment and develop a useable inventory tool. Deliverables requested were flow charts on processes and the inventory tool, with the only constraint being limited facility space. A visual of the current warehouse and a database capable of obtaining information from 5 of the 16 distribution centers were supplied by the sponsor. Extending the scope of the project, the team delivered a safety inspection checklist as well as packaging instructions.

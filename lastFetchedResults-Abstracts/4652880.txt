We have firstly succeeded in enucleation of oocyte by using micro-electric knife. The discharged output power and conductive area were controlled to adapt the cellular-order ablation under water and under atmospheric pressure environment. The local area ablation was obtained by the glass shell insulation around the copper wire with silver paste, and which prevent the bubble generation when it was discharged under the water. This fabricated sharp electric knife has a designed small space at the end of the knife between the wire and the glass tip, and which contribute to stabilize the electric discharge. The width of the ablation region was successfully reduced to more than a half compare to the conventional wire electrode, by using the robust glass shell insulation and a single micro-scale bubble injected from inside of the electrode. Moreover, the nucleus dyed by Hoechst was also removed successfully with limited damage region which is the difficult task for manual operation with glass capillary. This low cost micro-electric knife can fabricate any objective material under various environments and it has a possibility to contribute to a new fabrication method in micro-nano bioengineering field.

We have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a bidirectional hybrid wavelength-division-multiplexed/subcarrier-multiplexed (SCM)-passive optical network based on a noise-suppressed Fabry-Peacuterot laser diode (FP-LD) and a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA). For downlink data transmission, an FP-LD with multiple wavelength characteristics was used, and the mode partition noise of the FP-LD was reduced using a gain-saturated SOA with high-pass filter characteristics. For uplink data transmission, the downlink optical source was reused and remodulated by an SCM method, using an RSOA. A bidirectional SCM link with radio frequencies (RFs) of 2.4 GHz in the downlink and 1.0 GHz in the uplink was implemented. To confirm the validity of the proposed configuration, a 16-quadrature amplitude modulation transmission experiment was performed on a 10-km bidirectional optical access link. The transmission performance was investigated by means of the error vector magnitude and RF spectrum

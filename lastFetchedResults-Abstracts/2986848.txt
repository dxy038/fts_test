This paper describes part of the work that has been performed in the context of the ESPRIT IV project 25702 I-MODE. The main objective of the I-MODE project is to evaluate the implementation of analog baseband building blocks, such as data converters and filters, necessary for the integration of multi-mode transceivers in a low cost digital 3.3 V CMOS technology. Furthermore, in order to achieve the low voltage operation required for use in handheld equipment, the current mode approach has been chosen as a promising technique for the design of these blocks

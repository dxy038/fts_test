We have presented a polymer wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) filter based on multimode interference and developed a hybrid integrated optical module for 1.31/1.55-mum bidirectional operation. The active devices were integrated on a silicon optical bench platform by flip-chip bonding technique. The polymer WDM filter chip using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was fabricated by the hot embossing technique. This hybrid module exhibited a bi-directional operation of 2.5 Gb/s with a minimum sensitivity of -20.5 dBm at a bit error rate of 10<sup>-10</sup>, an optical crosstalk of -35 dB and the clear eye pattern.

An algorithm for routing messages between processing elements in a multiprocessor system is proposed. As a basic architecture an n-dimensional hypercube is applied. Only one of the processors in the hypercube is connected with an external user. The external machine is called host processor. Bidirectional one-port links, some of them faulty at same time are applied. The algorithm can be applied on an arbitrary connected multiprocessor system.

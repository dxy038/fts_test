Objective.
Transport-related physical activity (TPA) has dramatically declined in the last 50 years. The purpose of this study is to establish the relationship between sociodemographics, overall physical activity levels, and TPA travel mode (walking and cycling), with the perception of replacing car journeys by means of non-motorized travel.
Methods.

A nationally representative sample mail out survey (n = 7,894) identified physical activity levels, perceptions of using non-motorized transport modes, and sociodemographics for a New Zealand adult sample.
Results.

Overall, 21% of respondents strongly agreed that they could replace car journeys with TPA on at least 2 days per week. Respondents who reported higher activity levels were more likely to strongly agree with replacing car journeys than sedentary respondents. Personal income and education level were negatively associated with recognition of replacing car journeys. Respondents who recognized they could replace car journeys reported the highest prevalence for considering walking or cycling short distances.
Conclusion.

Only a small percentage of people perceive they can replace car journeys with TPA. Current physical activity levels and socioeconomic status variables are associated with perceptions of replacing car journeys with TPA.

The proposed mobile agent collects the load index and performs the distributed scheduling considering the behavior of the different kinds of applications. The environments obtained were considered due to the application of parallel processing of using medical images as well as the comparison of their performance time to measure them. The objective of this paper is to offer alternatives of processes scheduling aiming at maximize the use of the machines.

This article is intended to find out a rational education model based on Imam Khomeini’s thought. This is an analytic-inferential research. According to Imam Khomeini, man’s wisdom is minor and is classified into six rational training. They will be considered in this research. Three bases are general ones underlying all rational training. The other three bases correspond these general ones. They are as follow: wisdom is a divine blessing to man; there are theoretical and practical wisdom; wisdom is educable; thinking is basic for wisdom’s flourishing; wisdom is inseparable from science; the perfection of wisdom is due to sensual desires. The optimal objective of Islamic education, according to Imam Khomeini, is meeting Allah. It includes three other objectives including knowledge, faith and practice. Three principles are mentioned here, including application of logical methods, concomitance of wisdom and science, and preference of purification over teaching. Illustrating the linear and transversal relationship of these elements, the final conceptual network of rational education is formed.

Interior permanent magnet (IPM) motors are normally designed with two or more flux barriers per pole. The form of such flux barriers has a direct impact on the torque developed by the IPM motor, with regards to both its average value and ripple. The Machaon structure includes flux barriers of different shape, aimed at reducing the torque ripple. Their shape depends on the number of poles, number of slots, winding arrangements, and PM volume used in the rotor. An optimization technique is adopted in order to determine the best shape of the flux barriers with the objective of achieving a smooth torque with a high average value.

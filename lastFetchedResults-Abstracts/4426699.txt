This paper proposes a fuzzy LVQ with prototypes of linear varieties. Minimization of an objective function yields memberships of fuzzy clusters, principal components of the clusters and classification boundaries of LVQ type competitive learning. The proposed fuzzy c-varieties in this paper includes, within the Piccard iteration, a simple procedure for parameter estimation under missing data situations

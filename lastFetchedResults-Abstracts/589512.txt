Objective:  The present paper studies the role played by school libraries in students’ academic performance and bonding with the school.
Methodology: A survey was carried out using an author-constructed questionnaire. Samples were drawn from 2010-2011 primary, guidance and high school students in the city of Ardebil. 776 students were selected using proper cluster sampling.
Findings: There is a very low rate of school library utilization by students. 417 students within the sample population had never used school library. The status of school libraries given the number of books, area, skilled manpower and facilities were considered by the students to be very low. A significantly positive link was found between the school library usage levels with students bonding with the school. A similar link was found between school library usage and students’ academic performance. A best fit model is presented.

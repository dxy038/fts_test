In this paper, a multi-objective control system has been developed and experimentally tested. The multi-objective control system can be effectively used to control short-term fouling as well as long-term fouling. In an earlier study it was found that coagulant dosing in ultrafiltration can be used effectively to control the short-term fouling resistance during several sequential filtration cycles. To control long-term resistance increase during sequential chemical cleaning cycles, usually, in open-loop setting of the cleaning frequency or variables which influence the cleaning efficiency, such as, the cleaning time and the chemical composition are adjusted. Additional introductory experiments showed that changes in the coagulant dosing have a more pronounced effect on long-term fouling than changes in the usual applied variables. For this reason, it was decided to develop a closed-loop multi-objective controller where the coagulant dosing is used as the manipulated variable to accomplish both control objectives namely the fouling resistance over multiple filtration cycles (the short-term objective), as well as the irreversible fouling resistance over multiple chemical cleaning cycles (long-term objective). However, the controller is too slow to deal with temperature changes influencing the effectiveness of the coagulant dosing. To handle these influences a kind of gain scheduler should be included in the control algorithm.

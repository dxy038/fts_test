<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To consider incisional endometrioma (IE) as a differential diagnosis of abdominal disorders and to recommend different treatments as preventive measures. Incisional endometrioma (IE), as a rare condition, usually develops in surgical scar of cesarean section or hysterectomy.<strong><br />Materials and methods: </strong>We performed a retrospective review of 12 cases at Department of Surgery, Shahrekord University of medical sciences, Shahrekord from August 2010 to August 2012. The participants were diagnosed with IE using their pathology specimens.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The age ranges were from 23 to 44 years (mean age 32.75 years). A total of 12 patients had previous cesarean sections through a Pfannenstiel incision, which the wound was managed with regular irrigation, but peritoneum was not repaired. The main symptom was an abdominal wall mass about the previous caesarean section surgical scars, associated with cyclic pain. The mean duration of symptoms was 6 to 24 months (mean duration 6.66 months). There was 100% recovery after surgical treatment without any relapse of symptoms during follow-up till now.<strong><br />Conclusion: </strong>We recommend irrigation of the wound with high-jet saline solution before wound closure and repair of peritoneum at the time of cesarean section as a preventive measure.</p>

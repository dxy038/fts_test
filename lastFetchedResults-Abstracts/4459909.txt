Biometrics has become more and more important in security applications. In comparison with many other biometrie features, iris recognition has very high recognition accuracy. Successful iris recognition matching depends on how similar the stored template in database is compared with the introduced template. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a high performance scheme for iris recognition system in which a set of iris images of a given eye are fused to generate a final template. This will not only reduce the storage capacity requirements but also enhance the systemÂ´s speed during the matching process. The performance of both the proposed algorithm and the overall system will be assessed.

Background and Objectives : The objective of this study was to determine and compare the general levels of awareness of patient&rsquo;s rights among the patients and nurses in training hospitals in Qom province. Methods: In a descriptive analytical study, 150 nurses and 200 hospitalized patients were asked about patient&rsquo;s rights in all public hospitals in Qom. Data were collected using questionnaires and analyzed by SPSS. A p -value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: The nurses&rsquo; total awareness score was significantly higher than the patients&rsquo; total awareness score. No significant association was found between the patients&rsquo; total awareness and age, gender, educational status, marital status, living place or bedtime. The nurses&rsquo; total awareness showed no significant difference with respect to age, marital status and work history. The female nurses&rsquo; total score was significantly higher than the male nurses&rsquo; total score. Conclusion: These results suggest that increasing awareness especially among patients is needed, if awareness and practices regarding patient&rsquo;s rights should be improved.

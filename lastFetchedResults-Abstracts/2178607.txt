Strati? ed random sampling was used to identify four Islamic religious schools in the state of Kelantan, Malaysia. 500 male and female students from these schools were chosen as the subjects of the study.This study used quantitative methods based on a cross-sectional approach. Data from the above mentioned tests and questionnaires were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression.

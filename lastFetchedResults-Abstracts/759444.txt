Drawing on transactional theories of child development,
we assessed bidirectional links between trajectories
of adolescent substance use and parenting processes from
early through mid adolescence. Hierarchical generalized
models estimated trajectories for 3,317 adolescents from the
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, exploring
both between- and within-individual effects. Between
individuals, adolescents reporting more regular family
activities and greater father and mother knowledge of
friends and teachers experienced lower levels of substance
use through mid adolescence. Similarly, adolescents with
more frequent substance use reported lower family activities,
father knowledge, and mother knowledge, though
these differences dissipated over time. More conservative
within-individual differences indicated a prospective protective
effect of family activities, with increases in
adolescent participation in family activities predicting later
declines in substance use. Results support the central
importance of engagement in regular family activities, and
suggest the need for further exploration of transactional
processes between parents and children in the development
of risk behaviors.

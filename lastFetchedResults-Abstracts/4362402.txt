The objective of this work was to determine the shield thickness for a photon source considering slab geometry, isotropic scattering and one-group energy model. For this purpose a method was used that combines the Laplace transform with the P<sub>N</sub> approximation (LTP<sub>N </sub>) of the transport equation. The shield thickness was obtained iteratively by using an analytical expression, determined by the P<sub>1 </sub> approach, as an initial value. The good results obtained indicate that this methodology is applicable to the resolution of shield problems in transport theory

In this research, considering demand order period uncertainty in a supply chain Stackelberg game, a multi-objective decision analysis is adopted to allow use of a performance measurement that includes cost, customer service levels, order flexibility. This measurement provides more comprehensive measurement of supply chain performance through three measures approaches, and identifies factors affecting performance, their relationships and the trade-off effects among them. A solution algorithm with the thoughts of genetic algorithms for Stackelberg game was very successful in generating solutions in short computation times, and simulation works are carried out in Liaoyang Petroleum Company. The results obtained confirmed the significance of cost, customer service, order flexibility

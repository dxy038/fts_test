Deep and extended review of the management sources indicate that there are no specific books, articles or dissertations that hve academically paid attention to research problems in the way of Islamic management accomplishment. This article, however, tries to deal with such problems. 
	The objective of this research is a practical one. It follows a descriptive-exploratory research method. Data is gathered through library sources, questionnaires and interviews with experts.
	Cronbach Alfa coefficient was used for calculating the reliability of the questionnaires. It was 91 percent for questionnaire number two, and 83 percent for number three (showing the present situation). The validity of the questionnaire was so high that thirty problems were identified based on the background of the research. These problems were referred to the experts. Some of the items were deleted and some more were added, resulting in 55 problems. These were then decreased to 50 items. Content validity of these questionnaires seem to be quite acceptable.
	This research presented seven hypotheses covering inter-organizational and outer-organizational (including cognitive, policymaking, programming, administrative, supervision and evaluative) problems as influential factors preventing Islamic management from accomplishment. These hypotheses were tested by single sample T-test, and all of them were conformed.

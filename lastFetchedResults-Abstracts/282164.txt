The objective of the study was to investigate the comorbid problems and the psychosocial profile of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) adults. It was hypothesised that, compared with a community control group, the ADHD group would have a history of academic underachievement, poor occupational adjustment, antisocial behaviour, relationship difficulties, substance misuse, mood and affective problems and personality disorder. Compared with a clinic control group, it was hypothesised that the ADHD group would report an earlier onset of problems. Two clinical groups were drawn from referrals to an adult ADHD assessment clinic and a normal control group was recruited from the community. Groups were matched for age, sex and social class. The ADHD group (N=30) was compared with the clinic control group (N=30) and the normal control group (N=30) on measures of anxiety, depression and personality. Psychosocial variables were measured by the ADHD-Adult Functioning Interview, a semi-structured interview of childhood and adulthood functioning. The hypotheses were largely supported with the ADHD group being significantly more impaired than the normal control group on all psychosocial domains and comorbidity. The ADHD group was more impaired than the clinical control group on childhood measures of academic underachievement, antisocial and criminal behaviour. It was concluded that ADHD is a risk for the development of multiple problems and comorbidity in adulthood. Results emphasise the need to take a developmental perspective when diagnosing ADHD in adulthood.

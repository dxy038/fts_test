With the development of distribution network and power electronic device, it is increasingly more important for the reliability of power system and optimization of active and reactive power from a system standpoint. This paper proposed a novel power optimizer based on solid state transformer (SST), which could substitute for static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and network connector, with their integrated capability of active power transfer, voltage control, and reactive power compensation. The improvements of the power optimizer are as follows. First, active power can be transferred according to the optimization objective. Second, reactive power can be compensated on both sides. Third, grid voltage with constant magnitude and frequency could be supported in time when branch network voltage breaks down. To this end, our simulation studies are presented to show that this power optimizer can operate normally. To conclude, this proposed power optimizer has a great prospect for development and application.

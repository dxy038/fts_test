In this paper, different intelligent approaches to incorporate demand response (DR) in distribution systems are discussed. The key objective of this study is to give full insight on the applications of DR strategies in residential sector under smart grid paradigm. Smart grid is a new technology that uses the advantages of digital communication technologies to improve the energy efficiency, reliability and quality of the services provided by the utilities. One of the important components of smart grid is smart distribution system, whose role is to exchange data between customers and utilities in addition to supply of power. The data include market prices, customer willingness to participate in DR, network operator commands etc. The potential benefits of DR can be utilised effectively with the help of advanced energy management tools. In this study, various intelligent energy management tools like agent based energy management frameworks, home energy management tools and their application to control non critical loads in residential sector are discussed.

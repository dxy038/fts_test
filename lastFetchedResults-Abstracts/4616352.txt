Changes in the distribution of urban population density is a complicated dynamic system, so identifying its law is of great significance for sustainable social development. Build an urban geographic information database and population density database which can be accurate to the street communities based on GIS, select Changsha as study area, take the interaction of the constrained multi-agent system and cellular automata environment to simulate the process of urban population density distribution. The study results show that this method takes into account composite factors in relation to population migration, and could reflect a spatio-temporal dynamic change in the population density distribution in an objective and all-around way. However, under the influence of a variety of factors, there is still a gap to some extent between the simulated population distribution in suburb and the residential land use specified in the Changsha master plan Year 2020. Thus, the further study should take into account this case, and a population density distribution could be established more scientifically based on the existing research experience.

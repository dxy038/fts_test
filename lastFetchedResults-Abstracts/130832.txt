Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate a significant relationship between C-514T polymorphism in LlPC gene and C-514T polymorphism in Tehran population.
Material and Methods: Serum levels of glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol and I-IDL-C were measured in 258 men and 287 women. A segment of the gene mentioned was amplified with PCR and the polymorphism with RFLP-NlalII was revealed.
Results: The T allele frequency was 0.164 in men and 0.144 in women. A significant relationship between HDL-C levels and C-514T polymorphism was not found even after adjusting for age, BMI and blood pressure.
Conclusion: Our experiment concludes that C-514T polymorphism in Tehran's population is similar to other caucasians. However, we could not find any significant statistical relationship between this polymorphism with low serum HDL-C concentration in this population.

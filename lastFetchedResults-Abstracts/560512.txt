Background: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is the most commonly used
system for restoring functions after spinal cord injury (SCI).
Objective: In this study we investigated feedback PID and feedforward-feedback
P-PID controllers for regulating the elbow joint angle.
Methods: The controllers were tuned based on a nonlinear muculoskeletal model
containing two links, one joint with one degree of freedom and two muscles in the
sagittal plane that was simulated in MATLAB using Sim Mechanics and Simulink
toolboxes. The first tune of the PID and P-PID controllers was done by trial and
error. Then, the coefficients were optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). For checking
the robustness of the controllers, we compared the amount of rise time, settling
time, maximum overshoot and steady state error under three conditions: the first was
when the initial angle of the joint was fixed and only the desired angles changed; the
second was with a fixed step as input and various initial angles; and the last condition
was with different maximum forces for muscle.
Results: Genetic controllers had better performance than the trial and error tuned
controllers. The amounts of settling time were not so different for the controllers in
condition 1 but had more variations in condition 2 and had really better results in
genetic P-PID in condition 3. The overshoot was pretty less in PIDs than in P-PIDs
and the steady state error was almost zero for all of the controllers.
Conclusion: Genetic controllers had a better performance than the trial and error
tuned controllers. The rise time was much less in P-PIDs than in PIDs.

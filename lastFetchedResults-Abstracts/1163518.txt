Structural capacity deterioration is among the main causes of increasing failure probabilities of structural systems, thus maintenance interventions are a crucial task for their rational management. Several probabilistic approaches have been proposed during the last decades for the determination of cost-effective maintenance strategies based on selected performance indicators. However, benefits and drawbacks of each performance indicator with respect to the others should be further analyzed. The objective of this paper is to investigate probabilistic approaches based on the annual reliability index, annual risk, and lifetime distributions for life-cycle maintenance of structural systems. Maintenance schedules are obtained for representative series, parallel, and seriesâ€“parallel systems considering total restoration of component resistances whenever a prescribed threshold, based on a selected performance indicator, is reached. Effects related to different structural configurations and correlation among failure modes are investigated. The superstructure of an existing bridge is used to illustrate the presented approaches.

The objective of this study is to produce a system that would allow music symbols to be written by hand using a pen-based computer that would simulate the feeling of writing on sheets of paper and that would also accurately recognize the music symbols. To accomplish these objectives, the following methods are proposed: (1) Two features, time-series data and an image of a handwritten stroke, are used to recognize strokes; and (2) The strokes are combined, as efficiently as possible, and outputted automatically as a music symbol. As a result, recognition rates of 97.60% and 98.80% were obtained in tests with strokes and music symbols, respectively.

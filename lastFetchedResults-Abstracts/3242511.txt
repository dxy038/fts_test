The paper discusses the techniques developed to implement a teaching program for medical engineering students in the field of electronic hardware; based on my departmentÂ´s best practices, these techniques are built on active education methods through hardware experiments. The author proposes a two-semester laboratory work for this practical training: the first one for basic analog and digital circuits, and the second semester for microcontrollers. For the proposed labs, the main objective was to provide real life-like and useful experiments and small design projects which would excite and motivate the student, and, in the same time, would give them the practical knowledge they need as future engineers working in the field of medical engineering. One extra semester is dedicated for an Embedded System Design Project.

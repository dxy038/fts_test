Call Set-up Success Rate (CSSR) is an important Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for mobile network performance analysis. However, obtaining this KPI depends largely on data from the Mobile Network Providers (MNP). Owing to limitations associated with gleaning such data, recent trends seek new methods of gathering data independent of the MNP. Consequently, it is the objective of this paper to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques being used for such a purpose and at the same time propose and discuss the algorithm for a low cost embedded system for CSSR measurement. Thus, this paper provides basic introduction into CSSR measurement and at the same time propose a new architecture for CSSR measurement using citizen sensing techniques where individual GSM usersÂ´ has the ability to measure CSSR from their mobile phone and transmit the measured CSSR to a central server without the use of Drive Test.

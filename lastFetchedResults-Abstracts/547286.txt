The management and application of organic wastes in agricultural lands decreases environmental risks and increases utilization of these matters. The objective of this research was to investigate and compare the effect of polyacryl factory sewage sludge (PSS), municipal compost (MC) and cow manure (CM) on soil properties and on yield and growth of maize (single cross 704, Zea mays L.). The treatments were control (without any organic waste) and application of PSS, MC, and CM at two rates (15 and 45 t ha"1). This research was done in the research farm of Isfahan University of Technology (Lavark-Najafabad). The experimental design was a randomized, complete block with three replications. Treatments were incorporated into the soil before the maize planting (on 23 June 2008) and soil sampling was performed after 132 days (Simultaneously with maize harvesting). Application of the organic wastes resulted in significant increase soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and significantly decreased bulk density. However, saturated hydraulic conductivity was decreased by application of PSS. Application of 15 and 45 t ha"1 of PSS reduced Ks more than 14% and 42%, respectively, compared with control; however, the reduction was significant only in the plots which received 45 t ha"1 of PSS compared with control. The results of plant yield and growth showed that leaf area index (LAI), plant length, biological yield, 1000 seed weight and seed yield increase due to the application of organic wastes.

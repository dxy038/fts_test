The objective of this study was investigation of furfurylation effect on water absorption, thickness swelling, contact angle and surface roughness in two species such as beech (Fagus orientalis) and fir (Abies alba). In this regard, two different values of furfurylation of beech and fir wood specimens in the form of low level and high level were carried out and compared with control specimens. The furfurylation was carried out with impregnation under pressure and polymerization of furfuryl alcohol monomer with heat catalyst. For evaluating the water absorption and thickness swelling, specimens were subjected to longterm water immersion, and their dimension changes were determined at different times. The surface roughness and contact angle testes were also carried out. Results indicated that water absorption and thickness swelling were reduced. Results also indicated that drop contact angles were decreased and surface roughness were increased by increasing of furfurylation level.

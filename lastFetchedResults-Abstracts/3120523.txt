An optimum design approach to fault detection filter (FDF) with sensor location is proposed. A multi-objective optimization problem based on optimal sensor location for FDF is formulated for linear time invariant system. Optimal sensor location are formed by selecting minimum number measured outputs by sensors available, so that ensures FDF is as high sensitive as possible to faults and simultaneously as enhanced robust as possible against the unknown inputs such as disturbance under the given cost constraint. The dynamics of generated residual by FDF is formulated as non-convex and in terms of bilinear matrix inequality (BMI). The existence condition of multi-objective optimal problem and the solution of observer gain and post-filter matrix are also given and proved.

The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has been proposed for assessing stress responses to pollutants in soil and it has already been successfully employed in the aquatic environment. Presently, we developed the DDDC assay (D. discoideum developmental cycle assay) for both soil toxicity assessment and soil health screening. The DDDC assay is primarily aimed at determining the capacity of D. discoideum to undergo its developmental programme forming a fruiting body, measured in terms of fruiting body formation inhibition and fruiting body size factor, which may be considered an indication of its ecological fitness (potential for spore dispersal). A second objective of the solid phase DDDC assay is to identify potential mechanisms of toxic action on the developmental cycle, for which three checkpoints are examined: (a) aggregation arrest, (b) migration arrest, and (c) culmination arrest. Presently, conditions for the DDDC assay such as soil texture, soil water content, soil pH, food availability and incubation time were investigated and optimized. In addition, both solid and liquid phase variants of the DDDC assay were applied to assess the toxicity of Hg, at regulatory concentrations. The developmental cycle and ecological fitness were affected from the exposure to 0.3 mg Hg/kg dry-wt soil onwards. The DDDC assay has been shown to be a high sensitivity test.

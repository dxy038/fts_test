Manufacturing as well as the manipulation and the assembly of microsystems (MEMS (Micro ElectroMechanical Systems) for instance) need most precise robots and a clean working environment. This paper gives a brief overview of the recent evolutions of this technology. To design new miniaturized machines, a new project "microfactory" is launched. Its main objective is to set up a mobile clean environment to harbor one or more automated micro-assembly machines. It will be suitable to work in a normal environment. This miniaturized system uses small trays for the microsystems\Â´ transfer. The designs of three main layouts of the microfactory are outlined in this paper.

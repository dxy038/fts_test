There are large varieties of legumes and oil seeds in tropical Africa which are part of traditional food systems but whose nutritional and economic values have not been completely determined and are far less exploited for both human and livestock utilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate Lophira lanceolata (false shea or meni oil tree) seeds with the aim of qualifying and quantifying chemical and biological information that might serve as a guide to exploit its potentials and benefits for human and animal nutrition .The chemical composition, amino acid profile and phytochemical screening of the lesser-known oil seed were carried out using standard methods. The seeds were found to contain 2.78% moisture, 29.89% crude protein, 8.43% crude fiber, 48.61% crude fat, 1.45% total ash. Total carbohydrate and caloric values were 11.62% and 637.21 kcals, respectively. Mineral analysis revealed the seeds to contain 311mg/100g of sodium, 518mg/100g of potassium, 30mg/100g of calcium, 82mg/100g of magnesium, 20mg/100g of zinc, 40mg/100g of iron and 290mg/100g of phosphorus. Amino acid analysis using technicon sequential multisample amino acid analyzer detected all the essential amino acids except tryptophan. The seeds are rich in three of the essential amino acids (EAA) (g/16g N)-, isoleucine (3.16), leucine (5.29) and lysine (4.39) with chemical scores of 75.2, 125.9 and 104.5%, respectively. The other amino acids compared well with the FAO reference proteins. Tyrosine appeared to be the most limiting amino acid with a chemical score of 19.14%. Phytochemical screening of the seeds indicated presence of some bioactive compounds such as saponins, tannins, alkaloids and trace amounts of anthraquinones. Based on results of this study, the lesser known and under- utilized oil seed, L. lanceolata can be a potential source of edible and industrial oil as well as a source of protein, mineral element and energy supplements in livestock feeds. Further research can also reveal its potential for human consumption. The presence of some bioactive substances explains folk medicinal use of the plant.

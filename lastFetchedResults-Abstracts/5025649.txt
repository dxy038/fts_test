A multi-objective optimization algorithm for solving a mixed-integer programming problem that normally arises in system-reliability design is proposed. Our algorithm uses a genetic algorithm based on Pareto tournament and equivalence sharing, and a population-based constraint handling method. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we apply it in a practical reliability optimization problem. The results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective for solving the problems

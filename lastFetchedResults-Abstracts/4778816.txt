Unreliable wireless communication, mobility of network participants and limited resource capabilities of mobile devices make conventional replication techniques non suitable for MANETs. Frequent network partitions and dynamic disconnection should be handled to improve data availability. In this paper, a novel node failure fault tolerant data replication strategy is proposed. Main objective is to improve data accessibility among a mission critical mobility group. It ensures persistent data availability by duplicating data over replica nodes. The algorithm is designed to operate in environments with node failures. The proposed replica allocation methodology takes care of data availability values in the presence of node failures with mobile nodes remaining energy and storage capacity. Performance of the proposed approach is analyzed in terms of data availability and is demonstrated by simulations.

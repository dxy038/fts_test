A new genetic-based approach is proposed for optimal selection of the static synchronous
series compensator (SSSC) damping controller parameters in order to shift the closed loop
eigenvalues toward the desired stability region. Controller design is formulated as a nonlinear
constrained optimization problem. As the combination of objective function (system stability) and
constraints (limits of controller gains) is used as the fitness function, their simultaneous improvement
is achieved. The work relies on genetic algorithm (to capture the near global solution), analysis of
mode observability (to select the effective feedback signal of the damping controller) and the
theoretical analysis of a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB), using its modified linearized PhillipsHeffron
model installed with SSSC. It is shown that the results can be easily extended for multi
machine power systems. Simulation results are presented to show the fine performance of the
proposed SSSC controller in damping the critical modes without significantly deteriorating the
damping characteristics of other modes in a SMIB power system.

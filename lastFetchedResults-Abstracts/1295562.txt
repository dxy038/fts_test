We consider label setting algorithms for the multi-objective shortest path problem with any number of sum and bottleneck objectives. We propose a weighted sum aggregate ordering of the labels, specifically tailored to combine sum and bottleneck objectives. We show that the aggregate order leads to a consistent reduction of solution times (up to two-thirds) with respect to the classical lexicographic order.

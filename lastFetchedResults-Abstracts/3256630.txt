Three-dimensional (3D) Image quality assessment (IQA) is becoming one of hot research area recently. 3D image refers to a technique for enhancing the illusion of depth and protrusion in an image by presenting two offset images separately to the left and right eye of the viewer. These two-dimensional images are combined in the brain to give the perception of 3D depth and protrusion. With the advent of visual revolution, 3D visual becoming more and more important to us, but how could we enjoy an excellent effect 3D image or video? This is the question that we would like to solve in this paper, and the answer is an assessment of 3D image system based on objective and subjective method was built and in this paper we discussed the result comprehensively.

BACKGROUND:
Menopause is a critical phenomenon in women's life. After cardiac diseases, menopause is the second major cause of living with a disability in 45-60 year old women. The majority of women will experience bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. The objective of this review is to focus on hormone therapy for relieving postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms.
METHODS:
For this systematic review, we primarily explored 125 papers published about hormone therapy for VMS from 2001 to 2015 by searching with combinations of the keywords in various databases. Among those, 59 papers met the initial search criteria and among them, 9 papers were potentially retrievable and reviewed. All included studies used estrogen formulations in the management of VMS.
RESULTS:
Nine studies met all inclusion criteria. All studies assessed the effects of hormone replacement therapy on VSM. The results showed that low-dose oral and transdermal estrogen in all dose ranges were more likely than placebo to decrease the frequency of VMS. Indeed, the nanostructured formulation was safe and effective in relieving the symptoms of menopause. The mean daily decrease in the number of hot flashes from baseline was found in the studies.
CONCLUSION:
MHT has a complex pattern. Understanding the natural history of VMS, and the risks and benefits of both hormonal therapies, helps to individualize management plans. Low-dose estrogen-based therapies can be the most effective regimens to relieve VMS. These medications can be used by different administration routes and formulations.

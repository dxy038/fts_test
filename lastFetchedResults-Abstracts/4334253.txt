Initial water rights allocation in the watershed is a typical multidimensional, nonlinear, nonnormal decision problem, and it is difficult for traditional methods to determine weights and solve the decision problem. In this study, a new coupled chaos optimization-projection pursuit model is established, in which projection pursuit is adopted to reduce the dimensions of the decision problem and chaos optimization algorithm is presented to search the optimal projection direction. The model is directly driven by the sample data, and the optimal values of various schemes are calculated according to the optimal projection direction. In the coupled model, the difficulty that the objective functions and constraints must be continuous and differential can be avoided and the calculation efficiency is greatly enhanced, and the calculation of weights is objective and fair. The model proposed in this study provides a new method for initial water rights allocation in the watershed. Finally, the rationality and validity of this model is verified by a case study of initial water rights allocation in Fuhuan River.

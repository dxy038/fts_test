With the objective of diminishing the distance between bays of SF <sub>6</sub> gas insulated switchgear (GIS), a 300 kV three-phase-in-one-tank-type gas circuit breaker (GCB) has been developed. The size of the interrupting chamber has been reduced to decrease the diameter of the GCB tank. Hot gas flow has been optimized analytically and the deterioration of insulation performance caused by the hot gas between the poles has been investigated. A more compact GIS with fewer parts and easier to install results from the study

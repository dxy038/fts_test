This paper is concerned with the development of a novel classifier for automatic mass detection of mammograms, based on contourlet feature extraction in conjunction  with statistical and fuzzy classifiers. In this method, mammograms are segmented into regions of interest (ROI) in order to extract features including geometrical and contourlet
 coefficients. The extracted features   benefit  from  the  superiority  of  the  contourlet method to  the
state  of  the  art  multi-scale  techniques.  A genetic algorithm  is  applied  for  feature  weighting  with  the  objective  of  increasing    classification  accuracy.
Although fuzzy classifiers are interpretable,  the majority are order sensitive and suffer from the lack of generalization. In  this  study,  a kernel  SVM  is integrated  with  a  nero-fuzzy  rule-based  classifier  to form a  support vector based fuzzy neural network ( SVFNN).  This  classifier  benefits from  the  superior classification  power  of  SVM  in  high  dimensional  data spaces  and  also from the  efficient  human-like  reasoning  of  fuzzy  and  neural networks  in  handling  uncertainty  information.
  We use the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) standard data set and the features extracted  of the digital mammograms  are applied to the fuzzy-SVM classifiers to assess the performance. Our experiments resulted in 95.6\%,91.52\%,89.02\%, 85.31\% classification accuracy for the
subclass FSVM, SVFNN, fuzzy rule based and kernel SVM classifiers respectively and we conclude that  the subclass fuzzy-SVM is superior to  the other classifiers.

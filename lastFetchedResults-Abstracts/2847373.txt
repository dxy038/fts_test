According to the laid problem of photovoltaic cells, first of all, we need to divide the wall which laid photovoltaic cells into pieces to lay more photovoltaic cells; Secondly, to make total electricity generation maximize and unit electricity generation cost as little as we can, we established the 0-1 multi-objective programming model; Thirdly, aiming at lowest cost, the inverter configuration optimization model is established; Finally, we modeling to the instance of the solar house design, and obtained reasonable scheme of the solution of photovoltaic battery lying and inverter configuration.

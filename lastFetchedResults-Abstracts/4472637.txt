Texture features of the cell nucleus and chromatin as well as general topological or morphological features which used many cell image analysis contain important cellular diagnostic and prognostic information. In this paper, we describe the computerized method of nuclei and chromatin texture analysis of renal cell carcinoma image. For this study, 4 feature groups have been defined and selected. After preprocessing, feature parameters were extracted from the cell nuclei images that had been classified based on the Fuhrman nuclear grading system. Finally, we performed the quantitative analysis for the validation of the extracted features.

From the process design, demand for utilities can be estimated. The utility
system is then designed with respect to the process design. Energy-integrated
process design can be introduced at this stage to seek the design that
requires the minimum energy, and the corresponding levels at which the
utility should enter the process can also be determined. The interaction
between process design and the utility system is a further step of energy
integration. This step is usually considered after the process design is
energy-integrated and targets for minimum hot and cold utilities identified.
When hot and cold utilities are specified, it is possible to deal with these
utilities as normal process streams to be presented on a grid diagram with
the rest of the process streams. The objective of this simultaneous approach
for the interaction between utilities and process design is to assign the most
effiCient way for the utility to be introduced to the process. Consequently,
the synthesis of the heat-exchanger network design should become more
effective, thereby resulting in a reduced demandfor utility import. Copyright

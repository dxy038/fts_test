In this article, a comparative study between population based optimization methods with random and restricted search space definition applied in the pattern synthesis of linear antenna arrays is presented. Synthesis problem of reduced side lobe level and narrow beamwidth is considered. The design objective further considers the optimization of excitation amplitude and uniform inter element spacing using random and restricted search space definition by particle swarm optimization and differential evolution methods. As examples simulation of 12 and 21 elements have been considered. Effectiveness of the restriction in search space is proved through statistical and parametric analysis. Further comparison with published work has been carried out to prove the superiority of restricted search Particle Swarm Optimization.

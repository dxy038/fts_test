The objective of this work is to apply "x-by-wire" technology to increase the tractability, stability, manoeuvrability and safety of wheeled vehicles (especially those working on steep slopes) while at the same time minimising fuel consumption and damage to the ground traversed. The essential feature of this work is that both of the two basic methods of steering a vehicle are used so that they both tend to produce the same centre of curvature for the path of the vehicle. This deliberate (but cooperative) redundancy means that the inevitable failure of one steering system is prevented by both steering systems acting in unison. Means of first deducing and then correcting for slips angles and longitudinal slip are described

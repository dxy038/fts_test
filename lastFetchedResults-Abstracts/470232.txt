Objective
The purpose of this descriptive study was to determine the attrition rate in 2003 and to establish where residents matriculate after leaving an obstetrics and gynecology residency program.
Study design
A questionnaire was sent by e-mail to all program directors in obstetrics and gynecology residencies in the United States. The questionnaire asked for the number of residents who had left a program, what year of training the resident was in, and whether the departure was a transfer, withdrawal, or dismissal. It asked whether a transfer was to an obstetrics and gynecology residency program or to another specialty; if the resident transferred to another specialty, which specialty did the resident choose.
Results
Two hundred nineteen of 253 programs responded (86.5%). Of residents who left programs, 49% left in the first year of training; 34% left in the second year of training; 13% left in the third year of training, and 4% left in the fourth year of training. The reason for attrition was that 75% of the residents transferred to another residency program; 16% of the residents withdrew from training, and 8% of the residents were dismissed. Of the transferring residents, 60% remained in obstetrics and gynecology.
Conclusion
Although resident attrition was higher than in 1992, more residents remained in obstetrics and gynecology.

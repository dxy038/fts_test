This paper presents a numerical study of the structural interaction between a bridge and a new continuous device for launching heavy structures using the force of friction. In this way, it provides a great contribution for the civil engineering field focused on a new method for launching bridges by a continuous and bidirectional mechanism. A non-linear finite element model using contact elements studies the structural interaction between the bridge and the new device. Bridge and device interaction are studied using linear and non-linear contact behavior. The substructuring technique is used for the bridge modeling in order to reduce the overall degrees of freedom. This technique allows the selection of the best arrangement for two mechanism models placed under the webs of the bridge: two parallel arrangements where external device is opposite or behind the internal one, and other arrangement with devices in series. Furthermore, the non-uniform load distribution over the mechanism was studied during the launching process. With this methodology, it is possible to study the structural behavior of the mechanism taking into account the real load distribution applied for the bridge during the launching process.

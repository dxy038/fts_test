The deposition of adhesives is a critical process step in the assembly of mixed technology printed circuit boards. The objective of this research was to systematically study and “optimize” the syringe deposition of adhesives at a microelectronics assembly facility. This was done through the use of ‘design of experiments’ to determine the critical machinery factors which most effect the volume of adhesive deposited. The volume of adhesive needed to be effectively controlled in order to maintain the proper volume necessary for the components used at the facility.

To efficiently render halftone images for various printers and displays that support different resolutions, it is desirable that all halftoning results can be produced at a time, and all of them can be embedded in a single full-scale halftone image such that a simple down-sampling process can extract images of suitable resolutions from it if necessary. This letter presents a framework for achieving this objective with multiscale error diffusion. A multi-resolution halftoning algorithm is proposed based on this framework. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide good image quality at different resolutions.

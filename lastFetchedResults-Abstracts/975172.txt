Objective: Various abnormal behaviour patterns can be conceptualized as extremes in the five personality traits present in normal people. Among clinical personality disorders, schizotypal personality is least accounted for by the five-factor model. The aim of the present study is to explore the associations of the schizotypal personality with the five factor model of personality in Iran. Method: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study and was conducted in an experimental research context. A group of 319 normal participants were randomly selected, and answered to schizotypal personality (STA) and Big Five Inventory (BFI) scales. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. Results: Results indicated that schizotypal personality has positive correlation with neuroticism and negative correlation with extraversion. Regression analysis based on the present results indicated that even though conscientiousness and agreeableness are not by themselves related to schizotypy, they need to be added to neuroticism and extraversion for its development. Neuroticism, in males, and extraversion, in females had more power in prediction of schizotypal traits, compared to other personality traits. Conclusion: Results were discussed in light of previous research findings with clinical samples, including schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia. The role of gender should be emphasized in the relation between schizotypal traits and schizophrenia.

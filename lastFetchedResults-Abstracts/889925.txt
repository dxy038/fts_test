The emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza and Lassa fever in 2004 and 2012 respectively as well as the human African trypanosomosis in the 1990s and the increased prevalence rates of endemic and neglected zoonoses such as rabies, tuberculosis, salmonellosis, brucellosis and so on in Nigeria calls for attention. These diseases pose serious threats to human and animal populations, food security and safety, national economy and losses of environmental diversity especially in Nigeria. Despite all these challenges however, little or no attention is given to the control of these zoonoses by professionals involved, especially through inter-disciplinary collaboration. This review identifies the individual roles of different professionals and emphasized on inter-disciplinary approach to zoonoses control in Nigeria. This can only be achieved through collaborations between the veterinarian, physician, environmental health personnel, the media as well as the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Environment and Communication.

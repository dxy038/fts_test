This paper presents an optimization approach applied to a whole fuel cell (FC) air supply system including its geometry and its control. The aim is to optimize its power consumption along with its mass. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to define the design parameters of both permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and a fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The results are compared with those obtained by a sequential optimization process and advantages of co-design optimization approach are clearly shown. Indeed, a significant reduction of the objective function (made up on both motor mass and energy consumption) on a considered operating cycle can be obtained.

This paper discusses the application of technology to medical audit and quality assessment. It demonstrates that this is not just a matter of straightforward computerisation of manual methods; an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach is required, embracing the selection of appropriate (preferably objective and quantifiable) assessment criteria, the structuring and presentation of data such that it becomes amenable to processing, and the construction of a suitable software/hardware environment to carry out the relevant monitoring and processing. The consequences of adopting technological assistance are considered; potential dangers such as threats to confidentiality, data integrity and security. The need for a variety of adequate safeguards is explored

The objective of this current research is to describe the design of a high performance micro sensor for small spacecraft that acts as the core of a stand-alone aerospace system. A high performance cascaded micro sensor is designed with micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and nano-scaled technology, and can be incorporated in conventional methods as well as new spacecraft system designs focused on power efficiency system for flight application (PESFA) mission, referred to herein as the PESFA mission. This research describes the behavior of high performance micro sensor design methodology with dynamic configuration. The results of the computer simulations of these micro sensors are compared for possible improvements and provide high power efficiency at very long lifetimes to be able to operate independent of an energy limitation in flight application such as spacecraft and aerospace systems

The authorsÂ´ objective is to design an architecture for the implementation of a general polyphase recursive all-pass filter sharing common functional blocks and minimizing the use of storage, which can process a sample in one clock cycle. The architecture should be self-sufficient to realize a chain of cascaded decimation filters which attenuates out-of-band noise and decimates the signal to the lowest sampling rate

We introduce a fast and high-performance image subsampling
method using feedforward artificial neural networks (FANNâ€™s). Our
method employs a pattern matching technique to extract local edge information
within the image, in order to select the FANN desired output values
during the supervised training stage. Subjective and objective evaluations
of experimental results using still images and video frames show that our
method, while less computationally intensive, outperforms the standard
lowpass filtering and subsampling method.

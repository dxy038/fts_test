The literature on project scheduling with uncertain activity durations is still in its burn-in phase. We examine project scheduling with net-present-value objective and exponential activity durations by means of a backward stochastic dynamic programming recursion. We examine the particular setting in which the individual activities carry a risk of failure, and where an activity&#194;&#191;s failure results in the project&#194;&#191;s overall failure. In the project planning and scheduling literature, this technological uncertainty has typically been ignored and project plans are developed only for scenarios in which the project succeeds.

We address a novel predictive control strategy for dual-rate systems in which the input updating period is different from the output sampling period based on lifted state-space model identified by a modified Numerical Subspace State-Space IDentification (N4SID). There are three steps in the predictive control strategy. Firstly, lifted state-space models are identified for dual-rate systems by the modified N4SID. Based on the identified lifted state-space model, we construct predictors which can predict the output of dual-rate systems in multi-step ahead. Combining the predictors with an objective function minimization, predictive control laws for dual-rate systems are derived.

The objective of this work is to develop a modeling strategy for the structural analysis of large three-dimensional laminated composite structures undergoing geometric and material induced instability. A sub-modeling approach is used with multiple mixed-mode linear-softening cohesive elements and linear-elastic solid-shell elements through the thickness. A localized sub-plane control strategy is adopted for tracking multiple crack formations and the propagation of multiple delamination fronts. Simple element and solver benchmarks are used to demonstrate the adopted methods. Finally, the adopted methods are demonstrated in an engineering case study of a generic laminated composite wind turbine blade.

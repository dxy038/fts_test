The paper presents a practical dynamic security region (PDSR) based dynamic security risk assessment and optimization model for power transmission system. The cost of comprehensive security control and the influence of uncertainties of power injections are considered in the model of dynamic security risk assessment. The transient stability constraints and uncertainties of power injections can be considered easily by PDSR in form of hyper-box. A method to define and classify contingency set is presented, and a risk control optimization model is given which takes total dynamic insecurity risk as the objective function for a dominant contingency set. An optimal solution of dynamic insecurity risk is obtained by optimizing preventive and emergency control cost and contingency set decomposition. The effectiveness of this model has been proved by test results on the New England 10-generator 39-bus system.

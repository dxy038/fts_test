Construction engineering project often faces from technology, economic, natural and social environment, and many other aspects of uncertainties.These uncertainties once formed risk, often can cause huge economic losses and social influence. In order to avoid such situations, This paper introduces a network analysis (ANP) which is the risk analysis of a large-scale construction project based on WBS-RBS, established risk factors multi criteria and multi-level ANP structure model,and solve the model in detail. Finally taking a large-scale construction project for example, through the application of this method analysis obtains the risk factors for the weight of a large-scale construction project. From the total ranking results ,it is easily found that the project faced the biggest and the most key risk elements. Considering the interaction relationship of risk elements, the final results will be more objective truly reflect the real situation. It can provide an objective reference for engineering project risk control and management.

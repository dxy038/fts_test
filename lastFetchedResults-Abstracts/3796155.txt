The present work is a continuation of the authorÂ´s previous work (see IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas., vol.37, p.30-34, Mar. 1988), where a new power theory of three-phase circuits under nonsinusoidal conditions was suggested. The main objective of the present work is to determine whether the theory suggested has practical applications that justify the need of measuring quantities introduced in it, particularly, whether it improves a theoretical basis for improving power properties of such circuits. It is shown that the three-phase linear asymmetrical load supplied from a symmetrical source of nonsinusoidal voltage composed of a finite number of harmonics can be converted with a reactance circuit into a symmetrical three-phase circuit of almost unity power factor. It is shown how such a reactance circuit can be designed and which quantities should be measured for this purpose

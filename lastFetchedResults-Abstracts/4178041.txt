Learning how the human heart develops is essential in cardiology education. It lets us understand a normal heartÂ´s morphology and also explains the formation of congenital heart defects. However, learning cardiac embryology is difficult because the processes underlying the heart formation are complex. This complexity is caused by the fact that complicated organs like the heart are generated from only a couple of cells. The overall objective of the project presented was to design and develop a 3D model capable of rendering the dynamics of the various stages of normal heart development, beginning at fertilization until its final form

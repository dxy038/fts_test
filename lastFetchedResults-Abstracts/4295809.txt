In this paper, we consider a real time regulation of traffic within a disturbed transportation networks. We aim to find a new schedule for transit system of buses after the detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to minimize waiting time of transferring and non transferring passengers at stations. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approach and multi-agents techniques in the case of unlimited buses capacities. In case of a limited bus capacity the problem becomes difficult to solve. In this paper, we present an approach using genetic algorithms to solve this problem

Sensorineural tinnitus is the chief pattern of hearing disorders characterized by hearing loss, sleep disturbances, inattention, upset, anxiety and depression, etc. Nowadays traditional Chinese medicine such as acupuncture is considered as a widely-used and complementary therapy for tinnitus. However, most of the classic acupuncture is only taken by acupoints while moxibustion is another effective and well - accepted method. In this paper, we prepare a study protocol for sensorineural tinnitus with the pattern about deficiency of qi-and-blood, and attempt to provide a scientific method for further study combining disease with syndrome on tinnitus disorder. In our study, the objective is to evaluate the clinical effect of the moxibustion at Da-zhui acupoints compared with the classic acupuncture treatment measured mainly by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score and audiometry examination results.

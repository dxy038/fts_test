Based on the in-depth analysis of urban networkÂ´s characteristics, a comprehensive model composed of an evaluation index system and a novel evaluation methodology is described for studying environmental effects that planning schemes might cause if they were implemented. The novel model focuses on various typical perspectives, such as pollution emissions, carbon emissions and environmental coordination into consideration in a quantitative way. Unlike traditional evaluation approaches which largely depend on the preference of decision makers, the proposed decision-making approach integrates multiple attribute tradeoff analysis with fuzzy satisfying analysis. In this way, it is capable of determining the most robust plan in an objective sense. The simulation results of a real urban network in China are presented and discussed, illustrating the suitability of the proposed model to the urban power grid planning evaluation and its superiority in operation. The model provides useful guidance for the urban power grid going towards an eco-friendly condition in the future.

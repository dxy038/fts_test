Congestion pricing is considered to be one of the best ways to alleviate congestion. A bi-level model based on SDUO-DT/RC (stochastic dynamic user optimal-departure time/route choice) about the dynamic congestion pricing was established in this paper. The upper modelpsilas objective is to minimize the whole travel time of all vehicles in the study period. And the lower modelpsilas objective is to satisfy the dynamic user optimal conditions of departure time choice and route choice. The travel cost disutility function is represented as three parts: travel time, congestion pricing and the schedule delay costs of arriving times at destinations. In this way, the lower model is developed from the deterministic DUO (dynamic user optimal) problem to the stochastic DUO problem, which is represented as a VI (variational inequity) - and also combines the congestion pricing and DTA (dynamic transportation assignment) together.

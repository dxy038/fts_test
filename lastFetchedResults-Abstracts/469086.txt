Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rate and indications of cesarean delivery after a successful external cephalic version.
Study design
A case-control study was performed from patients who were delivered in a tertiary care center between 1987 and 2000. Each patient who underwent a successful external cephalic version (study group) was compared with the next woman with the same parity, who was delivered at term (control group). Nulliparous and multiparous women were analyzed separately. Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney, and Student t tests were used for statistical analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed where appropriate.
Results
A total of 602 patients were included in this study. The rates of cesarean delivery in nulliparous women (29.8% vs 15.9%; P<.001) and in multiparous women (15.9% vs 4.7%; P<.001) were significantly higher when compared with the control group. Patients with successful external cephalic version were more likely to have a cesarean delivery for dystocia (nulliparous, 22.5% vs 11.9%; P = .01; multiparous, 10.9% vs 1.3%; P<.01). After an adjustment for confounding variables, a successful external cephalic version was associated with an increased rate of cesarean delivery at term (nulliparous: odds ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.13-3.68; multiparous: odds ratio, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.76-10.54).
Conclusion
The rate of cesarean delivery for dystocia is increased after a successful trial of external cephalic version in both nulliparous and multiparous women.

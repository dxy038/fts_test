This paper presents a study of electromagnetic interference to pipelines due tonearby 500 kV HVDC transmission line faults.While there is a large volume of publications addressing the issues of alternating EMI issues, the authors are not aware of publicly available publications addressing the issues of inductive interference from HVDC lines under fault conditions. The objective of this paper is to fill in this gap.The study focuses on magnetic (inductive) interference to the pipelines caused by the transient nature of the fault current. Modelling techniques for this type of studies are described and computation results for the induced potential on a pipeline during a fault are presented.

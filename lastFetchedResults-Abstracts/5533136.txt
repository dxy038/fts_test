This paper investigates the application of alternative multi-objective optimization (MOO) strategies to a complex scheduling problem. Two vector evaluated algorithms, namely the vector evaluated particle swarm optimization (VEPSO) algorithm as well as the vector evaluated differential evolution (VEDE) algorithm is compared to a differential evolution based modified goal programming approach. This paper is considered significant since no other reference to the application of vector evaluated algorithms in a scheduling environment could be found. Algorithm performance is evaluated on real customer data and meaningful conclusions are drawn with respect to the application of MOO algorithms in a multiple machine multi-objective scheduling environment.

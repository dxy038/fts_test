The objective this research for estimate minimum cost of gabage from its sources to disposal sites in Nonsung District Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thailand. By using genetic algorithms run in microsoft excel add-ins find the minimum cost and appropriate waste allocation.The distance applied in the simulation was displacement between two points not the true distance along the route. It was found from the study that the factors affecting the pattern of the hauling system and waste allocation were number of sources and waste quantities produced, number and capacity of transfer stations and disposal sites and hauling cost from different points.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of spatial structure and crystalline phase on the biological performance of collagen–hydroxyapatite (Col–HA) composite prepared by biomineralization crystallization. Two types of Col–HA composites were prepared using mineralization crystallization (MC composites) and pre-crystallization (PC composites), respectively. Structural characteristics were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Surface elemental compositions were measured by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). These composites were used in in vivo repair of bone defects. The effects of the crystalline phase on the biological performance of Col–HA composites were investigated using radionuclide bone scan, histopathology and morphological observation. It was observed that in MC composites, HA was located on the surface of the collagen fibers and aggregated into crystal balls, whereas HA in PC composites was scattered among the collagen fibers. ESCA showed that phosphorus and calcium were 8.99% and 17.56% on MC composite surface, compared with 4.39% and 5.86% on the PC composite surface. In vivo bone defect repair experiments revealed that radionuclide uptake was significantly higher in the area implanted with the PC composite than in the contralateral area implanted with the MC composite. Throughout the whole repair process, the PC composite proved to be superior to the MC composite with regard to capillary-forming capacity and the amount of newly formed bone tissue. So it could be concluded that HA placement on collagen fibers affected the biological performance of Col–HA composites. Pre-crystallization made HA scattered among collagen fibers, creating a better structure for bone defect repair in comparison with MC Col–HA composites.

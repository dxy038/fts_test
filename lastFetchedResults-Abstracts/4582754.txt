The objective was to design and fabricate a four element X-band microstrip array centered at 7.5 GHz which has high gain, low sidelobe levels and is simultaneously well matched to the source. The design starts with formulation in Matlab<sup>reg</sup> for single element patch antenna. The design was then simulated and optimized in Agilentpsilas advanced design system (ADS) for high gain by making the patch resonating at the same center frequency but with larger dimensions. An array of four such elements was designed in ADS Momentum. Inter element spacing and feed line was optimized for good impedance matching, low sidelobes and high gain. By using method of moments (MoM) the effect of mutual coupling among the elements was taken into account. The array was manufactured, tested in anechoic chamber and results were compared with simulations.

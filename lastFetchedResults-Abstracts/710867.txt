Study Objective
To understand adolescent girls' use of “I don't know” within the context of discussing information related to sexual attitudes and behaviors.
Design
Qualitative analysis of seven focus groups with adolescent girls.
Setting
Urban primary care clinic.
Participants
Adolescent girls (n = 23) with a mean age of 16.4 years (range 14 to 18 years). Fifty-two percent were African-American, 26% were Caucasian, 17% were Hispanic/Latino, and 5% were Asian.
Results
The use of “I don't know” served three functions: (1) place holder, (2) lack of commitment to an opinion; and (3) reduction of commitment to an opinion or belief.
Conclusions
These results suggest that girls use “I don't know” when asked about their thoughts and opinions related to sexual health, and that its use can have varying implications. Discriminating the intent may help providers respond appropriately. Responses should include providing a safe and nonjudgmental environment in which girls can express their feelings and opinions regarding their sexual health.

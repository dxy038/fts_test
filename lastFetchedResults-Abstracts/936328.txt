Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major complication in immunocompromized
patients where can be serious and rapidly fatal. Early diagnosis and appropriate
antifungal treatment is important in reducing mortality and morbidity. Despite
many efforts to develop detection methods, the diagnosis of IA still remains
challenging and current conventional methods are limited for adequate diagnosis.
New rapid methods which can detect IA early in the course of disease with high
sensitivity and specificity are needed to treat these infections at an early stage.
Using molecular methods for the identification of Aspergillus species can be a
cost-effective, rapid, discriminatory, and objective approach for delineating
Aspergillus species in a clinical microbiology laboratory. PCR techniques for the
diagnosis of IA have been studied for more than a decade and are still considered
investigational; however, until now PCR is not included in current EORTC/MSG
diagnostic criteria.

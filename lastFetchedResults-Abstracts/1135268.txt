The effects of various surface treatment techniques on the fatigue crack growth performance of friction stir welded 2195 aluminum alloy were investigated. The objective was to reduce fatigue crack growth rates and enhance the fatigue life of welded joints. The crack growth rates were assessed and characterized for different peening conditions at a stress ratio (R) of 0.1, and 0.7. The surface and through-thickness residual stress distribution were also investigated and presented for the various regions in the weld. Tensile residual stresses introduced during the welding process were found to become significantly compressive, particularly after laser peening. The effect of the compressive stresses was deemed responsible for increasing the resistance to fatigue crack growth of the welds. The results indicate a significant reduction in fatigue crack growth rates using laser peening compared to shot peening and native welded specimens. This reduced fatigue crack growth rate was comparable to the base unwelded material.

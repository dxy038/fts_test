The present work is oriented to offer a communication system to people who undergo a severe loss of motor function as a result of various accidents and/or diseases so that they can control and interact better with the environment, for which a brain-computer interface has been implemented through the acquisition of EEG signals by electrodes and implementation of algorithms to extract characteristics and execute a method of classification that would interpret these signals and execute corresponding actions The first objective is to design and construct a system of communication and control based on the thought, able to catch and measure EEG signals. The second objective is to implement the system of data acquisition including a digital filter in real time that allows us to eliminate the noise. The third objective is to analyze the variation of the EEG signals in front of the different tasks under study and of implementing an algorithm of extraction of characteristics. The fourth objective is to work on the basis of the characteristics of the EEG signals, to implement a classification system that can discriminate between the two tasks under study on the basis of the corresponding battles.

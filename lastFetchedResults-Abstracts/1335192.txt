The main objective of this paper is to simulate different solar absorption power-cooling systems that uses ammonia based working fluid mixture to simultaneously produce cooling and mechanical power with a single system. The power and cooling cycles through absorption are of great interest because they can use low temperature thermal energy sources as solar energy with a higher versatility than the separated production of power and cooling (refrigeration) to cover the typical variable cooling and power demands of the building. In this study we have considered several system configurations based on the Goswami and single-stage combined absorption power and cooling cycles and different solar thermal technologies: evacuated tube, parabolic trough and linear Fresnel solar collectors. To compare the configurations we have performed the energy and exergy analysis for a specific case located in Sevilla (Spain) with a coordinates of 37°22′38″N 5°59′13″W using TRNSYS software as simulation tool.

Abstract
Background and objective:  E. coli is considered causes of urinary tract infection (UTI) and the majority part of nosocomial infections. This bacterium for having pathogenicity effects is necessary to have virulence factors. One of this factors is fimH (Type I fimbriae). The aim of this research â€œStudy of prevalence of fimH gene in Escherichia coli isolated from patients with and without kidney stone.
Materials and methods: A total of 70 urinary samples of stricken with UTI of referred to Ttaleghani Hospital, 42 urinary samples were contaminated with E. coli. Then, is accomplished antibiogram with 9 conventional antibiotics  for all of the bacteria. The presence of fimH gene was investigated by PCR. 
Results: A total of 70 urinary samples were collected, 42 samples (60%) were contaminated with Escherichia coli. Of 42 samples, 12 samples (28.6%) have had kidney stone & 30 samples (71.4%) have not had kidney stone (P < 0.05). 24 samples (57.1%) have had fimH gene & 18 samples (42.9%) have not had fimH gene (P < 0.05). Of 12 samples individuals of stricken with kidney stone, 8 samples (66.7%) have had fimH gene & 4 samples (33. 3%) have not had fimH gene (P < 0.05). By doing antibiogram, recommended antibiotics for Urinary Tract Infection were included Imipeneme & Gentamicin. 
Conclusion: Eschrichia coli with prevalence of 60% were the most common bacteria isolated from the urine of patients with UTI. Individuals with UTI are susceptible for kidney stone formation.  fimH gene in patients with UTI is an important pathogenic factor. This gene is involved in advancing kidney stones formation. The identification of microorganisms present in the kidney stone can be treated with appropriate antibiotics to reduce the risk of stone.

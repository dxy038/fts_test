This paper presents a new block-based focusing technique for all in-focus light field rendering (LFR). In the proposed method, at first, synthesized images with different depths for a desired view point are obtained by the conventional light field rendering (LFR) method. The synthesized images contain both low and high frequency component artifacts in out-of-focused regions. After that, the proposed dynamic block-based focusing technique is applied to these synthesized images in block by block. Using this process, all in-focus images can be reconstructed. Experimental results show both objective and subjective evaluations compared to the previous works. The proposed method saves processing time and the rendered images have an acceptable quality.

There are many ways to model a complex social system such as the level of poverty of an entity and many ways to measure poverty in an entity given the variety of definitions available. This work has as its main objective to apply the distributed agency methodology, which consists of several techniques used in computer science, to solve complex social problems. This approach allows the possibility of analyzing data from a macro level to a micro level where the intermediate part is highlighted, all in an organized integration of a social simulation displayed on geographic information with natural language quantifiers.

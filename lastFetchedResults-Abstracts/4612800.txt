The space environment is the main field of the space-aeronautics incorporation information battle, and it is the information base and resource guarantee of utilizing space and controlling space. The priority of sensor task is the important foundation for space multi-sensor scheduling. According to the characteristics of motion target surveillance mission, sensor scheduling problem of motion target surveillance is described, an objective function of sensor scheduling is defined, a real-time scheduling model of motion target surveillance task is put forward based on Considering synthetically constrain condition such as the task, resource and time. Research results on space multi-sensor scheduling provide important reference value and good application prospect instruction for planning and integrating of space multi-sensors system under information-based terms.

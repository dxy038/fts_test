Efficient and on-time maintenance plays a crucial role in
reducing cost and increasing the market share of an industrial unit. Preventive
maintenance is a broad term that encompasses a set of activities
aimed at improving the overall reliability and availability of a system
before machinery breakdown. The previous studies have addressed the
scheduling of preventive maintenance. These studies have computed the
time and the type of preventive maintenance by modeling the total cost
related to it. Todays the engineering insurance is an appropriate and
durable protection for reducing the risks related to the industrial machinery.
This kind of insurance covers a part of maintenance costs. Previous
researches did not consider the effect of engineering insurance
on maintenance scheduling while it affects the total cost function of maintenance scheduling seriously. Given the above-mentioned remarks,
this paper introduces for the first time a new scheduling of preventive
maintenance with considering total cost and total reliability of the system
in which the effect of engineering insurance has been taken into
account. Due to the uncertainty in the input parameters, which are
very common in application, the paper proposed the application of robust
design approaches. To solve this multi objective model, first it has
been transformed into a single objective model by using global criterion
and the resultant model is solved through genetic algorithm. The
results show the magnitude effect of engineering insurance on maintenance
scheduling. Therefore, neglecting the importance of engineering
insurance leads to an inefficient scheduling maintenance.

We consider path-based survivable service provisioning in transparent optical networks with the constraints of wavelength continuity and a limited number of add/drop ports at each OXC node in the presence of limited tunability of transmitters. We develop simple but valid analytical models to estimate the effects of number of add/drop ports and transmitter tunability on survivable service provisioning performance. We propose effective algorithms for the assignments of wavelength resources and add/drop ports for each survivable connection service and conduct simulations to evaluate the impacts of number of add/drop ports and transmitter tunability on path- based survivable service provisioning and further to examine the validity of the analytical models. It is found that a certain system add/drop ratio is required at each node so as to eliminate the blocking due to the lack of free add/drop ports. A network with a higher density requires a larger relative number of add/drop ports (i.e., add/drop ratio) for a given overall blocking objective. A network with a higher density benefits more in blocking from transmitter tunability. Finally, the analytical models are verified to be able to qualitatively predict the trends and effects of all the related constraints on the performance of survivable service provisioning.

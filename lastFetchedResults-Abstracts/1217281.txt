Background and Objective: One of the most important applications of electrode physiological tests is early diagnosis of hearing loss and estimating of hearing threshold in neonate and children for early auditory intervention. Auditory Steadyâ€“State Response (ASSR) is modern technology for threshold detection in audiology. Measurement of Auditory brainstem response (ABR) is most common method of detection auditory threshold in neonates. The goal of this article was to correlate the results between thresholds obtained from ASSR and click-ABR.
Subjects and Methods: In this descriptive-analytic design, 32 children with mild and moderate hearing loss, aged between birth to 7 years, were studied. All children were evaluated by both ASSR and C-ABR.
Results: The correlation coefficients for frequencies of  0.5, 1, 2, 4, mean of 2-4, and mean of 1-4 kHz were between 0.40- 0.87 in mild hearing loss and 0.52-0.91 in moderate hearing loss(P < 0.05).
Conclusion: C-ABR and ASSR thresholds in mean frequencies had a greater correlation than single-frequency(P-Value <  0.001 < 0.002-0.015). This correlation was higher in greater degrees of hearing loss and higher frequencies.

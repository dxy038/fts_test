Robust multi-objective optimization has emerged as an active research. A recent study proposed two different definitions of robust solutions in the context of multi-objective optimization. In this paper, we extend the concepts for finding robust solutions in the presence of active constraints. The meaning of robust solutions for constrained problems is demonstrated by suggesting three test problems and simulating an evolutionary multi-objective optimization method using the two definitions of robustness. The inclusion of constraint handling strategies makes the multi-objective robust optimization procedure more pragmatic and the procedure is now ready to be applied to real-world problems

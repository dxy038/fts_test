This paper addresses the connectedness issue in multiagent coordination, i.e., the problem of ensuring that a group of mobile agents stays connected while achieving some performance objective. In particular, we study the rendezvous and the formation control problems over dynamic interaction graphs, and by adding appropriate weights to the edges in the graphs, we guarantee that the graphs stay connected.

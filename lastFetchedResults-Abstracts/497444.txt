With regard to the theoretical model, the forest road network is consisting of straight line even spaced roads. So the log moves on the shortest path to the nearest road. But these conditions seldom occur in the field. The objective of this study was to estimate correction factor of skidding distances in Patom district. To do this, first topographic conditions of the field were classified into micro and macro topographic sections and were investigated in the field and all observations were added to the maps. Then skid trails and cable lines were designed on maps with regard to these observations and also skid borders. To assess the trails from practical standpoint, each trail was checked with compass and clinometers in field and any potential modification was corrected in maps. One hundred and eighty nine sample points were selected and theoretical and practical skidding distances were measured. After that using these samples, regression models were determined to convert theoretical distance to practical one. Then significance and reliability of models were tested. The estimated correction factor for study area was 2.03.

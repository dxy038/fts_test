Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine whether temporal non-linearities of the cochlear amplifier, as reflected by otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), exist and are distinct from any recording system non-linearities.
Methods: Maximum length sequence stimulation, at various stimulus rates, was used to evoke OAEs from normally hearing subjects. Recordings from a 2cc cavity were also made. The data were analyzed to obtain the linear response and estimates of the slices of the 2nd and 3rd order Volterra kernels. This provided a measure of two and 3 click non-linear temporal interactions, respectively.
Results: The results showed that temporal non-linearities of OAEs do exist, are stable and repeatable within individuals and have properties that differ from those shown by the conventional linear response. Whilst some of the non-linear response properties conformed to the expected pattern, of increasing amplitude with increase in stimulus rate, there are some areas in which they show an unpredicted complexity.
Conclusions: Whilst system non-linearities could be found, there was no difficulty in distinguishing between the physiological and system non-linear components. New areas of research and application may result from the use of these new OAE responses.

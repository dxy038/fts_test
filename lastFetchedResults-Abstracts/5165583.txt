Many current integrated circuits designs, such as those released for the ISPD2005 (Nam et al., 2005) placement contest, are extremely large and can contain a great deal of white space. These new placement problems are challenging; analytic placers perform well, but can suffer from high run times. In this paper, we present a new placement tool called Vaastu. Our approach combines continuous and discrete optimization techniques. We utilize network flows, which incorporate the more realistic half-perimeter wire length objective, to facilitate module spreading in conjunction with a log-sum-exponential function based analytic approach. Our approach obtains wire length results that are competitive with the best known results, but with much lower run times.

Nowadays the traffic systems for the transportation of goods and persons is an important subject that affects our economies, social interactions and almost every aspect of our life. Delays and traffic bottlenecks represent a significant inconvenient and problematic in this area. The ITS architectures provides innovative solutions to solve many aspect of this problematic. However these solutions tend to be heavy in infrastructure and costly in implementation and maintenance. Our approach is oriented to traffic guidance systems with light infrastructure and affordable cost to be implemented over urban networks where budget is a vital constraint such as rural areas and developing countries. We present in this paper the typical use case of our solution for traffic routing services. We call our general architecture VPAIR (Virtual Police Agent for ITS Traffic Routing). The objective pursued is to affect the driver decision in such a way as to maintain a fairness System-Optimal.

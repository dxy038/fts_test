HL-2A has achieved parameters of Ip = 400 kA, Bt = 2.65 T, approaching to its rated operational parameters with Ip = 450 kA and Bt = 2.8 T so far. Considering present status of HL-2A tokamak and in order to extend experimental research further, the HL-2A will be modified with a more efficient divertor. The objective of modification of HL-2A is to obtain optimized plasma parameters and shape, and an advanced divertor. The plasma configuration will be realized by composite arranging of poloidal field coil (PFC) system. After modification, the plasma current Ip will reach 800 kA, the elongation and triangularity of plasma will be above 1.6 and 0.3, respectively.

With an increasing usage of sensitive electronic equipment power quality has become a major concern now. One critical aspect of power quality studies is the ability to perform automatic power quality data analysis and categorization. The objective of this paper is to present a technique based on fuzzy logic to categorize power quality events and to simulate the impact of power quality on sensitive equipment. Inherent features are extracted from recorded waveforms using Fourier and wavelet analyses and fed into a fuzzy expert system. The categorization technique has been implemented using the Fourier, Wavelet and fuzzy logic toolboxes in MATLAB and tested with real power quality measured data. The impact of power quality on the operation of sensitive equipment has been illustrated through simulations in MATLAB SIMULINK. Such study is essential to predict the performance of modern loads and also to be able to explain why a specific load fails during a power quality event. The findings are reported in detail in this paper.

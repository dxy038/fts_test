The wireless sensor network has received increasing attention recently. Due to the inexpensive cost and small size of sensor nodes, sensor networks are densely deployed in many applications. Performing multiple tasks, the traffic generated by the wireless sensor network is hybrid, including time-sensitive traffic and delay-tolerant traffic. Obviously, handling them in a uniform fashion is unsuitable. Our objective is to provide classified service according to the attribute of packets. In our paper, we utilize the multiple paths between the source and sink to provide a solution satisfying the delay requirements of different traffic types. In dense wireless sensor networks, this is feasible because numerous paths exist between a source node and the sink. We propose a model for multipath routing, followed by detailed explanation of our routing protocol PRIMAR (prioritize multipath routing). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRIMAR

Long time ago, a famous photographer Patrick Na&#776;slund once said: It would be great have a smart camera to fulfill &#8220;Broader horizons demand new perspectives&#8221;. (Hasselblad Brief, 2004). Recently, among those digital effects, such as: Face Detection Technology, Smile Shutter Mode, Full frame, CCD Anti Shake system, Live View., which could be standardized in many new cameras. In the year of 2009, some new artificial intelligence video chips such as: CMOS Sensor, Full HD Video, Sweep Panorama, Interchangeable Unit Camera System, Super High Speed ISO., has been promoted. It could change not only the function and concept of new camera (DC) but to challenge the current DV market seriously. In our experiment, we collect more than 300 cases from the telephone survey during Jan., 2010 and March, 2010. A total of 225 cases comply with the conditions. To probe mainly into the relationship between new generation DC Confidence level and 3 potential customers: Amateur Photographer (AP), Senior Photographer (SP), and college student (CS). The profiles of contingency table were used to explore what kinds of video effect, people are interested and the relationship between new generation of IC chip with video effect. That is the reason what we are probe into this highly competitively market with brilliant creative design, and hope to offer an objective suggestion for both industry and education administers.

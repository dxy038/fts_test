This study demonstrates the phase plane representation of the pendulum knee drop (PKD) test for 7 children with cerebral palsy (CP) and one child without disability. Outcome measures included the change in knee´s range of motion (ROM) and angular velocity pre and post vestibular stimulation. Results of this study show significant increase in the knee´s ROM and angular velocity post vestibular stimulation; these results are indications of a significant reduction in the level of disability. The purpose of this study is to better understand the biomechanical changes caused by interventions such as vestibular stimulation and to be able to provide objective measures as changes ROM and the knee´s angular velocity.

Transportation-distribution planning problems have been one of the important topics in management science. This paper studies a bilevel multiobjective transportation-distribution planning nodel in which the distributing company has two objectives and the manufacturing company has one objective. For the proposed model, we present a hybrid algorithm to solve this problem, the algorithm uses the controlled elitism and the dynamic crowding distance to improve the NSGA-II, and thus a modified NSGA II is given. A practical problem is presented to validate the proposed algorithm.

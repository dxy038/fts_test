Application of the method of least squares for parameter estimation of exponential signals for processing data received by antenna array on several samples of observations has been considered. Effective algorithms of this method have been proposed; the explicit analytical expressions of the first and second derivatives of objective function of the least squares method have been obtained. Accuracy properties of the method and results of the method application for determination of parameters of moving sources are presented.

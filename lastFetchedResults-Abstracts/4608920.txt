The rise of distributed generation (DG) and the development of smart grid call attention to the research on the interconnection of distributed generation. The research of optimal allocation of distributed generation in smart grid is taken. A multi-objective optimization model is proposed that takes account into economic benefits and environmental benefits. The network loss sensitivity analysis is used to determine the location of distributed generation. The multi-objective planning is transformed into single objective planning by employing the fuzzy optimization theory. Results of case study on actual power system show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a naturally occurring thiol, is found in some fruits and vegetables, sometimes in concentrations higher than glutathione. The objective of this research was to determine the antioxidative effect of NAC in liposomal and muscle models challenged by different oxidizing systems, three that produce reactive oxygen species, two that produce reactive nitrogen species, and two that produce reactive sulfur. The antioxidative effect of cysteine and NAC was compared in the liposomes and NAC and BHT were compared in the muscle homogenates. Lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), TBARS, and sulfydryls (protein and non-protein) were analyzed. Results indicated that NAC is a more effective inhibitor of lipid oxidation in systems induced by free radicals and reactive nitrogen than those that are induced by peroxides. NAC appears to be at least mildly antioxidative in both liposomal and muscle models, although it did not completely inhibit oxidation in liposomes and generally was not as effective as BHT in the muscle models.

The objective of set theoretical signal recovery is to find a feasible signal in the form of a point in the intersection of <e1>S</e1> of sets modeling the information available about the problem. For problems in which the true signal is known to lie near a reference signal <e1>r</e1>, the solution should not be any feasible point but one which best approximates <e1>r</e1>, i.e., a projection of <e1>r</e1> onto <e1>S</e1>. Such a solution cannot be obtained by the feasibility algorithms currently in use, e.g., the method of projections onto convex sets (POCS) and its offsprings. Methods for projecting a point onto the intersection of closed and convex sets in a Hilbert space are introduced and applied to signal recovery by best feasible approximation of a reference signal. These algorithms are closely related to the above projection methods, to which they add little computational complexity

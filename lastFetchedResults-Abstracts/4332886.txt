Focuses on a multiobjective 0-1 programming problem with a block angular structure by incorporating the fuzzy goals of a decision maker. Having elicited the linear membership functions of the decision maker, if we adopt a fuzzy decision for aggregating them, then the original problem reduces to a single-objective 0-1 programming problem with block angular structure. To solve the reduced problem by exploiting its special structure, we propose a genetic algorithm with decomposition procedures which only generates feasible solutions. Through many numerical experiments, both the feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated

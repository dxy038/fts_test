Background
Recent evidence suggests that new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) adversely affects orthotopic liver transplant (OLTX) patient and graft survival. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of hepatitis C infection on the natural history of NODAT.
Methods

A retrospective review of 492 OLTX recipients at a single center was conducted from January 1993 to January 2003. Patients were followed for a minimum of 12 months (range 12 months-10 years). The study population consisted of 444 OLTX recipients who were either HCV positive (n = 206) or HCV negative (n = 238). NODAT was defined by the need for antidiabetic medication for at least 7 days starting anytime after OLTX. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Student t test, Kaplan-Meier survival, and chi-square tests.
Results

The overall incidence of NODAT was 33% (146/444). There was a significant difference in the development of NODAT between the HCV-positive group (82/206, 40%) and the HCV-negative group (64/238, 27%) (P < .001). Other independent risk factors for development of NODAT were male gender and age >50 years.
Conclusion

Hepatitis C infection contributes to the development of diabetes mellitus in OLTX recipients. The mechanisms behind HCV infection and associated NODAT in HCV-positive OLTX recipients warrant further investigation.

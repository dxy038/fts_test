It shows that etical concepts and propositions of connection between "is" and "ought" are under consideration and important. In this view "ought' is meaned "necessity" and "certainty" and this necessity is deductive necessity. It means that on basic deductive necessity we say. for reach to result "B" voluntary praxis "A" is necessary, it means ought acts thus in view point of actual philosophy propositions of justice for example: "justice is good" or "injustice is bad" and so on; bring up in form "ought equal necessity" beacuse its concepts are objective. So, on ontology, isn't a split between is and ought and both are real. Thus acts have inherent properly goodness or badness and Human understand it by his wisdom.

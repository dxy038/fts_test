Glass surface temperature can be measured using a radiation thermometer
operating at a mid-IR wavelength, typically the 3–5μm band, where the glass is
opaque. For optical fiber preforms, the temperature measurement requirement may
exceed 2,200◦C. Scale realization at national measurement institutes at these temperatures
is usually carried out at short wavelengths, typically less than 1μm. The mismatch
in wavelength can lead to significant uncertainties when calibrating a radiation
thermometer working at 3–5μm. To overcome this, a narrow band 3.95μm radiation
thermometer has been built that is designed to be used from 1,000 to 2,500◦C. It is calibrated
by measurement of high-temperature metal–carbon eutectic fixed-points. The
instrument is based on silicon lenses, with a liquid nitrogen (LN2)-cooled InSb detector,
and narrow-band iInterference filter. An anti-reflection coated objective lens/aperture
stop focuses onto a field stop giving a 1mm target, then a collimating lens, and
glare stop. All parts visible to the detector, other than the target area, are either at LN2
temperature or are part of a temperature-stabilized housing. A relay-operated shutter
that blocks the field stop is used to subtract the background. The size-of-source effect
of the instrument has been measured. Gold-point measurements have been made to
assess the stability. The device has been calibrated using high-temperature fixed points.
A three-parameter fit has been applied and the resultant scale compared to an ITS-90
realization.

An improved technique to design prototype filters for nearly-perfect reconstruction modulated filter banks and transmultiplexers is shown. This technique is based on the frequency sampling approach, and the formulation is presented as a multi-objective optimisation problem. Results indicate that the new formulation provides arbitrary-length prototype filters with even better quality parameters.

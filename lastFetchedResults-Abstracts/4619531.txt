This article presents the main findings of a study on the advantages of robotics for live line maintenance on high and very high voltage lines in France. The study includes two sections. The first part consists of determining what line and substation maintenance work can be done by remote controlled operation or by robots and how much it would cost. The objective of the second section is to determine whether the use of robot technology can help reduce the size of lines and substations, making it possible to integrate them better into the environment

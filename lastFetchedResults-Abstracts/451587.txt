Purpoe
To decribe color viion at the baeline examination of 80 participant in a longitudinal cohort tudy of birdhot chorioretinopathy and to identify relationhip between color viion and viual acuity, ymptom, and ophthalmic ign.
Deign
ingle center cro-ectional tudy.
Method
Color viion wa evaluated with the deaturated Lanthony 15-Hue tet. Relationhip were ought between the quare root of the color confuion core (CC) and the following factor: bet-corrected viual acuity (BCVA), ymptom, cataract, vitreou inflammatory reaction, retinal vaculiti, cytoid macular edema (CME), and birdhot leion characteritic.
Reult
When compared with publihed, age-matched normal control ubject, 49 patient (61.3%; 76 eye [47.5%]) had abnormal CC value. Abnormal CC value were found in nine of 51 phakic eye (18%) with normal BCVA (â‰¥1.0) and without cataract. Although mot eye did not have claifiable defect, 30 eye (18.8%) had tritan (blue-yellow) defect (88% of eye with claifiable defect). With the ue of multivariate analye, there were ignificant aociation between increaed CC value and the ymptom of altered color viion (P = .005) and altered contrat enitivity (P = .015). There wa a ignificant, but weak, relationhip between CC value and birdhot leion morphologic condition (P = .049), but no relationhip were found with other leion characteritic or with vitreou inflammatory reaction, retinal vaculiti, or CME.
Concluion
The Lanthony 15-Hue tet provide an objective technique to ae complaint of altered color viion in people with birdhot chorioretinopathy. Color viion can be abnormal in eye with normal viual acuity; therefore, thi parameter may be ueful a an additional meaure for monitoring the dieae.

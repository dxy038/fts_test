The Chi-Chi earthquake struck central Taiwan in 1999, triggering many landslides over a broad area. A large amount of information was obtained from the field reconnaissance conducted by National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering [NCREE, 2000. Investigation Report of the Geotechnical Hazard Caused by Chi-Chi Earthquake, Taiwan] and other follow-up investigations. The objective of this research was to analyze the landslide data for assessment of the potential for landslides triggered by the Chi-Chi earthquake, and a predictive model was constructed accordingly. The analysis was conducted under a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment, and the landslide potential was defined by the information value proposed by Jade and Sarkar [Eng. Geol. 36 (1993) 91]. Seven factors were selected and the structural equation model was used to describe the relationship among the factors and building of the predictive model. Verifications of the model were conducted using an independent set of field investigation data, and results were satisfactory with the field investigation data displaying higher potential.

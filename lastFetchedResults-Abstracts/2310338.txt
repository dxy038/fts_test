Sand cushions against impact force are widely used for rockfall prevention covers. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of the dry density and thickness of a sand cushion on an impact response due to a falling weight likened to a rockfall. A series of laboratory experiments for a decomposed granite soil was executed in the combination of the mass and drop height of the weight. As a result, the impact pressure applied to the soil surface increases with the dry density, but it does not depend on the thickness of the soil. The earth pressure at the bottom of the mold increases with the dry density, and it decreases with the thickness of the soil. Therefore, the transmissibility of the impact pressure decreases rapidly with the thickness of the soil.

In all over the world the energy crisis is a main issue. In the 18th century, when fossil fuels seemed to be the ideal energy source and vast quantities of fossil fuels have been used like petroleum, coal, and natural gas etc. Fossils that create the fossil fuels take millions of years to generate. Once we burn them or use them, they take another million years to get recreated and as every fossil is finite, eventually they will diminished ultimately. Fossil fuels are harmful for the environment. So, in order to prevent disastrous environmental changes, it is essential to stop the extraction of the increasing demand of fossil fuels. For this purpose it is quite necessary to make a new exploration of natural resources of energy. Researchers have shown that renewable energy sources are able to fully meet the global energy requirements with almost no pollution and global warming emissions. Amazingly the sun is an infinite resource of energy to fulfill all energy requirements forever. In the perspective of environmental pollution and fossil fuels vehicles utilizing the fossil fuel are main source of pollution by producing NOx and Cox. One of such kind of vehicles is auto-rickshaw. After considering all the facts mentioned above a state of the art rickshaw design which is powered by solar energy has been presented in this research paper. The objective of this paper is to design a control scheme for the electrical drive of a conventional auto rickshaw that can be driven by a solar electric power system. This solar rickshaw will also impact the economy by facilitating a lower middle class person through effective use of green energy. This purposed model is consisting of mono crystalline solar panel, an efficient MPPT (maximum power point tracking) for charging system, charge controller for batteries, a rheostat speed control with resistance control method and DC series motor.

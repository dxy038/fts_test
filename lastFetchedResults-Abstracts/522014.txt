Objective: To study the effects of a high dose alpha-tocopherol on serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and the high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels of patients with schizophrenia receiving olanzapine. Method: Thirty six adults diagnosed with schizophrenia based on DSM-IV who were taking olanzapine for a minimum of thirty days entered this eight-week, double blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to receive alpha-tocopherol 400IU or placebo capsules twice a day for 2 weeks, then three times a day for 6 more weeks. Fasting total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride(TG), and HDL levels were measured at the baseline and weeks 4 and 8. Results: TC, TG and HDL levels did not change significantly during this study. There were no significant differences in TC, TG and HDL levels between the two groups at the baseline and weeks 4 and 8. Conclusion: High-dose vitamin may not improve triglyceride and cholesterol levels in patients who are already on olanzapine. Further studies with greater number of patients and for a longer duration are needed.

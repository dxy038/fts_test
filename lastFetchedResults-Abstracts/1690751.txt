Several variants of genetic algorithms have been used to study the surface profiles of hot rolled slabs, quantified in terms of crown, a major parameter related to their geometric tolerances. Two different models are presented, and simulations in a multi-objective mode are carried out to generate the relevant Pareto fronts, which, in turn, are tested against the operational data of an integrated steel plant.

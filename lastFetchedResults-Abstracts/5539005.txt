The great environment coverage capability and the faster response to dynamic changes are of advantage to the future application of military affairs and environment monitoring. Network Modeling plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of self-organization, motion planning and controlling. Proceeding with initial node deployment, environment, node and network modeling, the objective is to build the model including the robot dynamics, communication restriction and the dynamic interaction among robots simultaneously.

Pupillary diameters were obtained of 16 subjects with normal vision of colors. These were stimulated by 26 different chromatic stimuli, which include the visible spectrum from 400 to 650 nm. Based on his pupillary diameter of white color and the chromatic composition of the stimuli, the first approach of the pupillary changes due to the colors is proposed. This paper is focused on the determination objective and quantitative of the chromatic perception of the human being, based on his pupillary response

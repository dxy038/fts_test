Objective(s): Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) causes pulmonary toxicity. Infliximab (Ib) is a potent inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). We aimed to investigate whether Ib has a protective effect on CCl4 induced lung injury.
Materials and Methods:Rats were divided into control, CCl4, and CCl4+Ib groups. A single dose of 2 ml/kg CCI4 was administered to CCI4 group and a single dose of 7 mg/kg Ib was given to CCl4+Ib group 24 hr before applying CCI4.
Results:TNF-α, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and caspase-3 levels of the CCl4 group were markedly higher than both the control and CCl4+Ib groups. The CCI4+Ib group had lower histopathological injury than the CCl4 group.
Conclusion:Ib as a strong TNF-α blocker decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines, MDA, and oxidative stress leading to a protective effect against CCl4 induced lung tissue injury.

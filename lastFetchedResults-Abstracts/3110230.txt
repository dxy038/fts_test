This paper discusses the study of a one-on-one aircraft pursuit-evasion gidance scheme for high performance aircraft. The research objective is to implement a guidance law derived earlier [1] using differential game theory [2] in conjunction with the theory of feedback linearization. Unlike earlier research in this area, the present formulation explicitly recognizes the two sided nature of the pursuit-evasion scenario. Present research implements this guidance law in a realistic model of a modern high performance fighter aircraft [3]. The present paper will discuss the details of the guidance law, implementation in a highly detailed simulation of a high performance fighter, and numerical results for two engagement geometries. Modifications of the guidance law for on-board implementation will also be discussed.

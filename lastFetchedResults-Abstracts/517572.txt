This paper represents a model of strategic programming with limited resources in a complex supply chain. The main goal of the proposed model is to increase efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain with respect to income increases and cost decreases. Using special objective functions, has guaranteed the lean supply, production, distribution and suppliers' selection strategies. Furthermore, it can use for production programming in the supply chain. Moreover, customer satisfaction has also been perceived, by using minimization objective functions of shortage amount and restrictions of maximum allowed shortage. In this model, objective functions have been defined in a way, which directs the supply chain to the lean. Finally, after determining strategies according to objective functions and constraints, the optimal strategies using multi-criteria decision making - ELECTRE process- have been chosen.

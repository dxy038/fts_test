Grid is commonly considered as next generation network, under the heterogeneous high performance distributed computing environment, it is significant to monitor the state information of the resources obtained by each computing node. Resource monitoring plays a critical role in managing a large-scale Grid system. Traditional resources monitoring needs to read the information of each node periodically, the grid resources are consumed relatively greatly. Resource monitoring based on event-trigger can reduce the expenditure on service, but can not provide more exactter resource state information. This paper presents a method based on event-trigger and fixed polling for reducing the expenditure on monitor service and obtaining exact resource state information. Finally, a grid resource monitor system is implemented by this method in GlobusToolkit4 and an objective evaluation of the system is presented.

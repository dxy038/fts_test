Rapid progress of computing technologies is the major reason that the programs like electronics, computer and software engineering, robotics and control engineering need continuous updates. This paper is related to the development of an international curriculum in real-time software engineering. It focuses on identification of skills, attitude and knowledge the students need to acquire to become efficient engineers working in the field. To facilitate this objective, a survey administered to industry representatives in four countries is described and its results are discussed.

Background and Objective: Effort for improving athletic function makes athletes use stimulants. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of consuming steroids on liver enzymes and blood factors in male bodybuilders.

Materials and Methods: Ex post facto design comprising  48 male bodybuilders (age 25.02 plusmn  4.73 years old, weight 80.75 plusmn  6.33 kg) were assigned to three groups of steroid taking athletes (n1 = 16), athletes with a history of steroid taking discarded it in the last three months (n2 = 16), and athletes without a history of using steroids (n3 = 16). Consequent to anthropometric measurements and one repetition maximum assessment, blood sles were taken after 12 hours of fasting. Oneway ANOVA and post hoc tests were used for data analysis.

Results: Significant differences were found between the first group and other aforementioned groups in terms of their alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and hemoglobin levels
(ple  0.05), whereas there were no significant differences between the second and third groups in the above mentioned variables (pge  0.05). There were significant differences among all groups in the level of hematocrit (ple  0.05). Also, in red blood cells, significant differences were seen between the first and third groups
(ple  0.05). There were no significant differences in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme among groups
(p ge  0.05).

Conclusion: Taking steroids by bodybuilder athletes can lead to harmful effects such as increased red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase enzymes level. The findings are supportive of the idea that even after giving up the use of steroids as long as three months, the damage continues to exist.

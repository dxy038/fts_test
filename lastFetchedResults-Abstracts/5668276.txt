Resource allocation problem in universities belongs to office automation research issues, which is one of the important businesses for management departments in universities. Aiming at &#8220;Just, Fair and Open&#8221; principle and purpose of user-oriented resource management, rational allocation by means of informatization and efficient use of resources is certainly an effective way. In this paper, we study the problem of resource allocation method in universities with user participation. A layered reference model of reservation system for university resources is presented. Taking multiple constraints into account, including user satisfaction, resource utilization, user coverage etc., the resource allocation is made much fit to the actual situation, however, the problem complexity increases correspondingly, leading to the adoption of an intelligent algorithm solution. Hence, an improved ant-colony-optimization-based resource allocation algorithm with user participation is proposed. By feasibility analysis of algorithm, it is shown that the proposed algorithm to solve the multi-objective optimization problem with multi-constraint is feasible and valid. As the layered idea of the model is applicable to other system, so it has broad application value.

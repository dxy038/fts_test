The slope stabilization and soil conservation with geogrid materials in the Quaternary
alluvial sediments of Chandab region in southeast of Tehran was studied. The objective was
to study the efficiency of geosynthetic materials in technical and economical aspects for
high slope stabilization and decrease of soil erosion. The results could be applied for
stabilization of slopes next to dam reservoirs or trenches resulted by road construction. A
total of 24 plots with three repetitions with dimension of 12 x 2 meters on the slope of 85%
and 110% were established. After each event of rainfall the runoff and sediments in each
treatment were collected and the rates of sedimentation were measured. A total of 9 events
resulted runoff and sedimentation have been studied. The data were analyzed with the SPSS
statistical program. The results showed in both slope types: in the 110% slope the erosion
was much more than the 85% slope and the treatment plots which were stabilized with
geogrids indicated a lesser to no erosion.

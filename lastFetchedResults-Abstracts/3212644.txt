According to the growth of electric vehicle industry, the demand of new battery energy storage systems for vehicle-to-grid has been increased rapidly to improve electric power utilization. Projected BESS penetration levels across utility customer are a promising clue that BESS may dominate the market in the near future. In this paper, a novel BESS system with V2G function for onboard charger which composed of a bidirectional DC/DC converter using voltage compensation configuration is proposed and the mode of charging/discharging is verified by simulation.

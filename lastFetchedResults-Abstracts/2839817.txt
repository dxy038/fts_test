The article in hand deals present a new approach focuses on the electric modelling of split ring resonators based on an equivalent circuit. The elements of circuit are determined from geometric parameters forming the three dimensional model of this type of resonators. Firstly an analytic study is proposed about the determination of the components of the circuit in function the physical parameters with a review about comparison between obtained results when the simulation of two different models is presented. Secondly, a demonstrative study on the effect of varying the value of the relative permittivity and determination the error rate at level the resonant frequency in the two models. The objective is to put the conditions and constraints necessary to make our equivalent circuit most responded and most efficient with zero error. The results of simulations are confirmed with using the two commercials software HFSS and ADS.

Objective To investigate patterns of use of general practitioners
(GPs) and/or mental health professionals (MHPs)
for mental health reasons, across six European countries,
and the extent to which these patterns of use are associated
with differences in mental health-care delivering systems.
Methods Data are based on the European Study of the
Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD): a crosssectional
survey of a representative sample of 8,796
non-institutionalized adults from six European countries,
conducted between 2001 and 2003 using computer-assisted
interviews with the CIDI-3.0. Countries were classified
into: MHP- for countries where access to medical professionals
tends to predominate (Belgium, France, Italy),
and MHP? where access to non-medical MHPs predominates
(Germany, Spain, The Netherlands).
Results Among respondents consulting GPs and/or MHPs
in the past year (n = 1,019), respondents from the MHPgroup
more often consulted GPs (68 vs. 55 % in MHP?
group), GPs and psychiatrists (23 vs. 14 %). People from
the MHP? group more often used MHPs only (45 vs.
32 %), GPs and non-medical MHPs (16 vs. 8 %). GPs from
the MHP? group were more inclined to refer patients to
MHPs. Factors associated with use of GPs versus MHPs
were: being over 49 years, not highly educated, lower
income and suffering from mood or severe mental
disorders.
Conclusions Differences in the use of GPs versus MHPs
are markedly linked to individual as well as organizational
factors. Interventions are needed, in countries fostering
medical access, to reimburse sessions with non-medical
MHPs and improve cooperation between professionals to
obtain better practice in access to care.

Objective: The aim of this study was to predict retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis during the preoperative examination of patients with endometrial carcinoma and to determine whether lymphadenectomy must be performed. Study Design: This study was carried out on 214 patients with endometrial carcinoma. Preoperative evaluators were volume index, depth of myometrial invasion (as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging), serum CA 125 level, histologic type, and histologic grade. With the use of receiver operating characteristic curves, cutoff values of volume index and serum CA 125 levels were determined. The relationships of these evaluators with pelvic lymph node metastasis were investigated by multivariate analysis with a logistic regression model. The relationships of these evaluators with para-aortic lymph node metastasis were investigated in the same way. Results: Histologic type, volume index, histologic grade, and serum CA 125 level were found to be independent risk factors for pelvic lymph node metastasis; serum CA 125 level and volume index were found to be independent risk factors for para-aortic lymph node metastasis. Among 110 cases with no risk factors for pelvic lymph node metastasis, pelvic lymph node metastasis was observed in 4 cases (3.6%). On the other hand, only 1 case of 128 cases (0.7%) with no risk factors for para-aortic lymph node metastasis actually had metastasis. Conclusion: Careful consideration of the possibility of the elimination of the requirement of retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy is needed in cases with no risk factors for lymph node metastasis. However, our results suggest that para-aortic lymphadenectomy may not be necessary in cases with no risk factors for para-aortic lymph node metastasis. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1265-72.)

The goal of the next-generation all-IP wireless networks is to offer users the capability of achieving pervasive network access with the full support of integrated multimedia services that require various data rates and quality of service (QoS). In such an environment, a single service could be offered at different speeds at different locations/times via separate systems. In order to address resource management and call admission control in cellular/WLAN inter working, a Priority based service interworking architecture with hybrid coupling is presented. The main objective of this paper is to provide better QoS to high-prioritized voice traffic. An effective call admission control strategy is proposed for better QoS provisioning and efficient resource utilization. The results show that the proposed scheme is very efficient in serving voice traffic compared to WLAN-first scheme

Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of
exercise and token?behavior therapy on the negative symptoms of
schizophrenic patients.
Objective: Comparison of the effectiveness of exercise and
token?behavior therapy on the negative symptoms of schizophrenic
patients.
Methods: This research was a randomized controlled clinical
trial that was done on 45 schizophrenic patients, hospitalized in
Rasht, Iran. Through systematic random allocation, the samples
were placed in one control and two intervention groups, 15
patients in each. To assess the negative symptoms, the scale for the
assessment of negative symptoms (SANS) was used. The effect
of the interventions used (exercise and token?behavior therapy)
was studied by completing the relevant checklists before and after
using the interventions, and then, by comparing it with that of the
studied control group. In order to analyze the collected data, one
way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s test and SPSS software were used.
Results: Analyses showed that the token reinforcement approach
was highly and significantly more effective than exercise for
reducing the negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients (?36 ±
7 vs. ?21 ± 8, respectively; P < 0.001). Exercise was also shown to
have a highly significant advantage over no therapy, in controls, to
improve the negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients (?25 ±
8 vs. 0.2 ± 1.08, respectively; P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Both exercise and token?behavior therapies, along
with drug treatment, are very effective in reducing the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia; but the impact of token therapy
issignificantly higher.

Objective To explore the quantitative and qualitative
aspects of friendship in people with schizophrenia. To
examine emotional and behavioural commitment, experiences
of stigma, and the impact of illness factors that may
affect the making and keeping of friends. The difference in
the perception between the researcher and participants of the
presence of problems in friendships was also investigated.
Methods The size and quality of the social networks of 137
people with established schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder, aged 18â€“65 in one geographical area of southeast
England was ascertained using a semi-structured interview.
Qualitative aspects of friendship were measured using
objective, pre-determined, investigator-rated criteria.
Results The mean number of friends reported by respondents
was 1.57. Men were less likely to report friendships
than women (29 vs. 53%, v2 = 13.51, df 1, p\0.001). Of
the 79 people who had a friend, 75 named someone amongst
fellow service users. The quality of these friendships was
generally good. Emotional commitment to friendship and
mistrust were more important than current clinical state in
determining whether or not the participant has friends. Most
of those without friends did not see the lack of friendship as
a problem. The researcher was up to three times more likely
to report a problem than the participant.
Conclusions The friendship network size was found to be
small but the quality of friendship mostly positive and
highly valued. The majority of friendships were with other
service users made during attendances at day hospitals and
drop-in centres thus underscoring the importance of this
service provision. Psychosocial intervention programmes
need to take into account psychological factors that impact
upon friendship.

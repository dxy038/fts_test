Objective (s): Sexual dysfunction (SD) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is common, but often overlooked. The purpose of this study was to determine prevalence of sexual dysfunction and its predisposing factors in women with multiple sclerosis.  
Method: This was a cross sectional study. Participants were  recruited from  two MS clinics in Tehran.Sexual function and disability status were quantified by the Female Sexual Function Index-FSFI and Expanded Disability Status Scale(EDSS) respectively.Clinical characteristics and  the extent of physical  disability were examined by a neurologist .Data were analyzed  by univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
Results: In all 226 MS patients were studied.The mean age of participants was 35.77 years (SD = 8.07). Sexual dysfunction were diagnosed in 125(55/3%) of participants. The most common sexual problem in women was arousal dysfunction (44/2%) and the lowest frequency of the dysfunction was sexual pain (12/8%).
Results obtained from multiple logistic regression analysis showed that MS patients with sexual dysfunction had lower educational status (Odds ratio=1.95 CI 95%= 1.957-0.998), insufficiency low (Odds ratio=3.94 CI 95%= 1.614-90619), more than 3 children (Odds ratio=4.659 CI 95%= 1.517-14.314) and Secondary Progressive MS-(SPMS) (Odds ratio=3.034 CI 95%= 1.447-6.362). 
Conclusion: Awareness of sexual problems and related factors for the management and treatment of women with MS is necessary .It is suggested that sexual rehabilitation programs compiled as part of the comprehensive care of patients with MS.

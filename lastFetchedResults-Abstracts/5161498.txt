A sequential feasible optimal power flow (OPF) method is developed for large-scale power system. One distinguished feature of this method is that it can maintain feasibility for both equality and inequality constraints during iterations. In sequential feasible OPF, every iteration consists of two stages: objective improving stage and feasibility enforcing stage. Analytical basis for each stage is provided. Numerical studies on various power systems up to 2383 buses indicate that the proposed feasible approach is promising. Compared with the conventional OPF algorithms, such as interior point method, the proposed sequential feasible OPF approach can be terminated at any iteration and yet yields a feasible operating point.

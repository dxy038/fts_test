Syncopation of Chinese phonetic string is the basis of Chinese Sentential Input. The traditional matching algorithm of phonetic string only brings one segmentation result and thus leads to the incomplete containing of the ambiguous results and the failure of the phonetic string conversion. The paper raised a improved method for the syncopation of Chinese phonetic string. By adopting a Bidirectional Maximum Matching algorithm and combining the syncopation rules of double vowels, we are able to preserve all the disambiguity possibilities during the phonetic syncopation which would participate in the competition for the optimal sentence candidate, so that we can ensure the correctness of the conversion of Chinese phonetic string.

This paper proposed the use of a new constraint-preserving method (NCPM) to solve the nonconvex economic dispatch (NED) with linear constraint problems. NCPM always generates feasible solutions every time that reduces the search space (exclude the infeasible domain) to enhance the probability of obtaining the global optimum. Based on the benchmark of the same objective function, NCPM was compared with the other methods upon their search performance. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods, in both global search capability and computation time.

Objective To understand electromagnetic radiation field strength and its influencing factors of certain 110KV high-voltage lines in one urban area of Chongqing by measuring110KV high-voltage lineÂ´s electromagnetic radiation level. Methods According to the methodology as determined by the National Hygienic Standards, we selected certain adjacent residential buildings, high-voltage lines along a specific street and selected different distances around its vertical projection point as monitoring points. The levels of electromagnetic radiations were measured respectively. Results In this investigation within the frequency of 5Hz~1000Hz both the electric field strength, and magnetic field strength of each monitoring sites was lower than the public exposure standards as determined by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP); However, the electrical field strength on the roof adjacent to the high-voltage lines was significantly higher than that as measured on the other floors in the same buildings (P&lt;;0.005). The electromagnetic radiation measurements of different monitoring points, under the same high-voltage lines, showed the location which is nearer the high-voltage line maintain a consistently higher level of radiation than the more distant locations (P &lt;;0.005). Electromagnetic radiation generated by high-voltage lines decreases proportionally to the distance from the lines. Conclusion The buildings can to some extent shield (or absorb) the electromagnetic radiation generated by high-voltage lines nearby; The electromagnetic radiation intensity near high-voltage lines may be mitigated or intensified by the manner in which the high-voltage lines are set up, and it merits attention for the potential impact on human health.

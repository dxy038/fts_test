A high-performance method of modifying the time scale of speech signals into an arbitrary time scale was developed. It requires substantially reduced arithmetic operations. This process is performed within a time domain where the time-scale expansion or compression is performed by inserting or substituting composite segments into or from an original input signal, and the length of the segment is optimized by an objective evaluation process. A monosyllable articulation test comparing this method with a conventional time-scale modification method performed by a simple modification of sampling frequency proved that there are definite advantages to using the new method

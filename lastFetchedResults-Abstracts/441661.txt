Background. Systemic to pulmonary arterial collaterals often develop after bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (BCPA). It has been proposed that such collaterals may be related to perioperative outcome and duration of effusions after the modified Fontan procedure. However, the incidence and significance of collaterals after BCPA remain uncertain.
Methods. To evaluate risk factors for, and significance of, such collaterals, we reviewed angiographic and clinical data for all 76 patients who underwent BCPA between January 1990 and June 1996 and had follow-up catheterization during or before 1997.
Results. The median age at BCPA was 10 months, and the median duration from BCPA to follow-up catheterization was 18 months. Arterial collaterals were detected on follow-up catheterization in 45 patients (59%). Factors associated with collateral development included a prior right-sided systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunt, lower pre-BCPA end-diastolic ventricular pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, and use and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass during the BCPA operation. Fourteen of the 45 patients (30%) underwent coil embolization of the collaterals. Forty-three patients have undergone extracardiac conduit Fontan, with 1 early and 1 late death. Collaterals were present in 22 of these patients, 7 of whom underwent pre-Fontan embolization. The duration from BCPA to Fontan was longer in patients with collaterals, but these patients were not more likely to have prolonged effusions than those without, and the duration of tube thoracostomy was significantly shorter in patients with collaterals. Embolization of collaterals did not affect the duration of effusions.
Conclusions. Systemic-to-pulmonary arterial collaterals are common after BCPA. In contrast to prior reports, collaterals were not associated with a higher incidence of prolonged effusions after the Fontan procedure in our experience, and did not correlate with poor outcome.

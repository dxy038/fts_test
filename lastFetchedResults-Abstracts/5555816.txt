In the smart grid environment, appropriate power energy exchange strategies will be necessary for energy intensive industries (EIIs) with industrial power plants. This paper presents a systematic approach that can cope with the integration of industry consumers and an energy exchange strategy aiming at achieving balance between power production and consumption in EIIs. A basic balance model using Linear Programming (LP) is built and the generation levels of thermal units are obtained. The solution is further improved to provide a more smooth power output curve. The ramping constraints of thermal units are addressed to ensure the result obtained is energy realizable. Penalty terms are also introduced in the objective function to reduce the level of power energy exchange between EII and the grid. Finally, numerical tests are performed and the simulation results for a real system suggest that the method presented is effective.

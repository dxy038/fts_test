The estrogen receptor (ER) is a transcription factor that binds under 17-Î²-estradiol (E2) stimulation as homodimer to a short DNA consensus sequence named estrogen response element (ERE). The ER/ERE interaction has been assessed by several research groups through different methodologies notably by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques. The biochemical parameters and conditions (solvent, ER concentration, salt, time and temperature) used to prepare samples before analysis were very different from one study to another. But no studies have aimed to compare the effect of these modifications on ER/ERE interaction. Therefore the main objective of the present paper was to assess the influence of biochemical parameters onto the ER/ERE interaction with the final aim to improve the comprehension of this interaction. Our results highlighted that parameters like solvent, ER concentration, salt and surfactant concentration, temperature and time deeply modify ER/ERE interaction. Nevertheless, the dimer formation under E2 stimulation occurred with all tested conditions. Altogether, incubation parameters of ER with E2, deeply modify its binding level onto ERE. These data constitute an important key point to consider for the improvement of ER/ERE detection method depending upon the aim of the study (interaction measurement, environmental detection, development of new technologies or devices).

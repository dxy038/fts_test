Models are invaluable tools for resource management. Models help resource managers develop a shared conceptual understanding
of complex natural systems, allow testing of management scenarios, predict outcomes of high risk and high cost environmental
manipulations, and set priorities. Catchment modelling is a specialist field, and different modelling approaches are
specialist areas in themselves. There are a plethora of models available that apply to integrated catchment management, from
micro- to landscape scales, from deterministic models to broad-brush models. Different philosophies abound, with some experts
advocating topâ€“down systems approaches and others who dismiss these as being too uncertain and based on opinion rather than
fact. Even when the approach is agreed upon, experts may be at odds over which modelling product is superior and have a vested
interest in their particular product. So, how does the resource manager obtain objective, independent technical advice on needs
and applications, and then choose the best modelling approach? Model development can be onerous, expensive, time consuming,
and often bewildering for the resource manager. It is also an iterative process where the true magnitude of the effort, time and
data required is often not fully understood until well into the process. Resourcing can become problematic. This paper explores
the dilemmas faced by resource managers who dare to venture down the path of catchment modelling and proposes ways to minimize
the pain and maximize the gain.

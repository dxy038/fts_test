We propose here an objective study of the emotional impact of a movie on an audience. An affective benchmarking solution is introduced making use of a low-intrusive measurement of the well-known Electro Dermal Answer. A dedicated processing of this biosignal produces a time-variant and normalized affective signal related to the significant excitation variations of the audience. Besides the new methodology, the originality of this paper stems from the fact that this framework has been tested on a real audience during regular cinema shows and a film festival, for five different movies and a total of 128 audience members.

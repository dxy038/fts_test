Background and Objective: The prevalence of AIDS/HIV is dramatically increasing worldwide.  Iran and other Middle East countries are no exception in this regard.  The main aim of this study was to assess the effects of communication skills program and AIDS education on Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs among the health volunteers in Zanjan.
Materials and Methods: The study was conducted as a quasi-experimental trial.  Eighty health volunteers were divided into two equal groups. The interventional group participated in two educational programs on communication skills and AIDS, compared to the control group that participated in AIDS education program only. Data collection was done both prior to and 20 weeks after the intervention using a self-report type questionnaire.
Results: The results of this study show that combining AIDS education program and communication skills training had a significant effect on susceptibility, (P < 0.01) severity (P < 0.003) and perceived barrier (P < 0.0001) constructs of AIDS in the test group. By contrast, only the perceived barrier construct (P < 0.0001) showed a significant change in the control group. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor within the HBM.
Conclusion: Findings of this study indicate that a combination of communication skills training and AIDS education program could have a better effect on Health Belief Model constructs on AIDS in health volunteers than the AIDS education program by itself.

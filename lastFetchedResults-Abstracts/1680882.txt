With its obvious advantages, hydrogen is expected to be greatly used as a new energy, which can reduce vehicle emissions effectively and efficiently. Besides, it can be adopted as an alternative fuel for petroleum fuel of internal combustion engine. However, due to its unique physical and chemical characteristics, hydrogen often leads to abnormal combustion and decay of power, which can be effectively dealt with by optimal control. In this paper, thermodynamic analysis methods, like mass transfer and energy transfer, is combined with state space analysis methods of nonlinear control system, so that an optimal control model of nonlinear combustion control system for hydrogen fueled engines can be established. Through illustrating the inner relations between combustion and energy transfer of hydrogen fueled engines and operating parameter, state parameter and performance index, this paper provides theoretical analysis and found experimental research for promoting abnormal combustion and performance index after controlling operating parameters optimally and changing state parameters of the cylinder. Based on nonlinear programming theory and multi-objective genetic algorithm, the methods of establishing the optimal control model and carrying out the optimal value of operating parameters are shown in this paper. Whatâ€™s more, some new ways are proposed to integrate the optimal control aspects of multi-variate, multiple targets and multiple constraints for hydrogen fueled engines by changing the multi-objective and multi-constraint optimal control into the single-target integrated optimal control.

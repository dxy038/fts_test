The adhesion and tackiness of cosmetic patches are very important factors, especially
when the patches are applied to an area with sensitive skin. such as face. The
objective of this work is to study the influence of varieties of alpha hydroxy acids
concentration as ingredients of cosmetic patches on their tackiness. Different amounts of
two cosmetic patch ingredients, glycolic acid(GA) and lactic acid(LA), were mixed thoroughly
with solution of a acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive(PSA). Films with 32 urn
thickness were prepared by casting formulations on a polyethylene terephthalate film.
Tack test was carried out on different formulations according to ASTM 03121-94. It was
observed that tack value increases by increasing LA concentration up to 6 % (w/w). Tack
value increase by increasing GA concentration up to 1 % (w/w), then it decreases by
increasing GA concentration up to 3 % (w/w), and then increases again by increasing GA
concentration above 6 % (w/w). These results are due to changes in entanglements,
glass transition temperature, plateau modulus GO of adhesive, and functional groups that
exist in additives.

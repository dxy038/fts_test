The mandate that Intercom Ontario be a user-centered trial involved the making of a number of choices. This paper describes what these choices were, the rationale behind these choices, their consequences, and the proposed solutions. The objective of the trial is to determine what services the user community in Ontario wants, needs and will use in the emerging electronic superhighway; and to examine the impacts of these solutions in a real world setting and their practicability over the long term. It is expected that the trial will generate knowledge to support all relevant stakeholders: information users as well as information providers at private, public and government levels

Objective (s): To develop a measure for assessing oncology nurses’ attitudes toward providing spiritual care.
Methods: This was a two-part study (qualitative and quantitative) that carried out in 12 hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti and Tehran Universities of Medical Sciences. In all 154 nurses (24 nurses in qualitative phase and 130 nurses in quantitative phase) took part in the study. Data were collected through semi- structured and focus group interviews with oncology nurses. Interviews were analyzed with qualitative content analysis approach. Then items derived from content analysis mixed with items derived from literature and item pool was assessed for content, face, construct, and criterion validity. Internal consistency and stability was performed to assess reliability.
Results: In all 286 items were identified and after indicating the content validty index and the content validity ratio, the number of items was reduced to 68 (CVI 0.75% and CVR 0.45%). To determine construct validity, we used factor analysis that was identified 3 principal components consisting of knowledge, emotion and performance that explained 45% of variance observed. Taylor spiritual care perspective was used to assess criterion validity. The correlation coefficient between two questionnaires was acceptable (r = 0.548). The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to determine internal consistency and test- retest for stability of the scale and both showed satisfactory results (?= 0.903 and r= 0.734) respectively.
Conclusion: Oncology nurses attitude towrd providing spiritual care is a valid and reliable measure.

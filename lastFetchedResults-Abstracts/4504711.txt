This paper presents the control design for a matrix converter, which interfaces a power generator to a passive charge. Matrix converters, which are direct power electronic converters, are able to provide important benefits such as bidirectional power flow and great potential for size reduction. On the other hand, the complexity of the matrix converter topology makes the study and the determination of suitable control strategies a difficult task. A matrix converter is used as an alternative concept to avoid the need for a gearbox upstream the generator in an electrical energy production process. This work also includes a real-time control of the matrix converter, control scheme and experimental results are presented too.

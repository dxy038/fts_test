In communication networks, traffic measurements serve two main purposes: the characterization of traffic load patterns and the monitoring of performances. This paper is a study of the applicability of traffic analysis methods as a mean to detect malfunctions and performance changes in packet data networks, through measurements of selected parameters. The main contribution is of a methodological nature and is motivated by the fact that wavelet analysis, which has come to be regarded as a standard approach, is by no means a straightforward method. Controversial results can be found, which are not always attributable to the complex nature of the measured object. Careful study of the uncertainty of traffic parameter estimates is also an important issue, which turns out to be somewhat neglected in the literature. The aim of the work is twofold: on the one hand, to enhance the model validation process; on the other, to provide for objective assessment of the feasibility of network monitoring procedures that rely on measurement and model-based diagnostics

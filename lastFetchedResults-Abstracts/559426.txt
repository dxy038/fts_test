Introduction: Organizational memory (OM) is a tool for implementation of knowledge
management. The objective of this study was designing an OM for medical records (MR)
departments.
Methods: This descriptive study was carried out in 2007. The study population consisted of all
employees in five teaching hospitals in Tabriz. Process and required knowledge identification
was performed through questionnaires and structured interviews with 65 employees. OM models
were derived from the available literature and the Internet. Our model was provided according to
the assessment and review of models. Then, experts in health information management gave their
opinion on the model by Delphi technique.
Results: The studied employees believed that their performance could have been better if the
required knowledge had been provided (85%). They considered OM as necessary (98%) and
indicated mistakes, work slowness, dissatisfaction and confusion of clients as some subsequences
of employees transfer. Most models provided for OM (86%) were process-based. Our model was
considered as a system in which inputs, processes and outputs were determined.
Conclusion: An OM system which relates organizational knowledge to the business processes is
a necessity for an MR department. This system can lead to organizational learning and
productivity. In this study, a set of items and entities required for a process-based OM system
were provided.

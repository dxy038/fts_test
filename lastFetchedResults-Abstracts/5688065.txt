This paper mainly deals with a new mode of comprehensive evaluation of dinking water quality, which is based on interval-valued fuzzy mathematics. During this evaluation mode, aiming at index system of quality evaluation of drinking water, we will value the quality of drinking water on the basis of interval-valued fuzzy mathematics by expertsÂ´ setting the matrix of fuzzy evaluation after our fixing weights of various indexes through interval values. Then we program computer software of the evaluation model so that we evaluate the quality through computer. This method makes evaluation results more in line with objective facts because it combines the objective weight with subjective experience to avoid the subjectivity and one-sidedness of the previous evaluation.

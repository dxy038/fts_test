This paper is aimed to research into military vehicle scheduling problems by means of Genetic Algorithm. By converting the constrain conditions of delivery time windows and vehicle capacity constrains into penalty function of objective function, the paper built up a vehicle scheduling model based on minimum length of total transportation distance. It analyzed characteristics and application prospects of the model. It put forward a improved Genetic Algorithm program to solve the model. In the algorithm program it designed a chromosome coding to describe delivery routes, proposed a fitness function and constructed a reproduction operator, a crossover operator and a mutation operator to do optimization operation. Finally it provided an example to demonstrate feasibility of the algorithm. The study indicates that the improved Genetic Algorithm has higher algorithm efficiency and can effectively solve vehicle scheduling problems of military distribution centers.

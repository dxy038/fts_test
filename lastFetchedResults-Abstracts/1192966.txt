Objective: Major depression is a mood disorder that causes changes in physical activity, appetite, sleep and weight. Regarding the role of zinc in the pathology of depression, the present study was aimed to investigate the effects of zinc supplementation in the treatment of this disease.
Methods: This study was a double-blind randomized clinical trial. Forty four patients with major depression were randomly assigned to groups receiving zinc supplementation and placebo. Patients in Zinc group received daily supplementation with 25 mg zinc adjunct to antidepressant; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), while the patients in placebo group received placebo with antidepressants (SSRIs) for twelve weeks. Severity of depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory at baseline and was repeated at the sixth and twelfth weeks. ANOVA with repeated measure was used to compare and track the changes during the study. 
Results: The mean score of Beck test decreased significantly in the zinc supplement group at the end of week 6 (P < 0.01) and 12 (P < 0.001) compared to the baseline. The mean score of Beck Depression Inventory reduced significantly compared to the placebo group at the end of 12th week (P < 0.05)
Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that zinc supplementation together with SSRIs antidepressant drug improves major depressive disorders more effectively in patients with placebo plus antidepressants (SSRIs).

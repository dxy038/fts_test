The e-learning applications continue to be developed following the emergence of new communication techniques. They became able to adapt their behaviors to the requirements of the new generation of users, in particular those mobiles. Therefore, a variety of sophisticated elearning solutions appears on the teaching market. In addition, the training operators, public and private, are more and more interested in these new methods of teaching with the principal objective to attract the maximum of learners. They are invited to choose a solution among those that fulfill their technical and budgetary constraints. The choice of a best E-learning solution remains a difficult task because it depends on several factors. It must combine the objective and strategic needs of the training operators to the technical requirements of the e- learning environments as the transport networks, the used equipments, the learner\Â´s features and the security [1]. Considering the multitude of these factors and the complexity to combine them, the decision makers find difficulties to evaluate the e-learning applications and to estimate their cost, in particular, when several environments meet the same needs. To solve this problem, we design an E-learning Decision Making System (EDMS) that helps the decision-makers in the choice process of the right e-learning solution. This system is based upon two components: e-learning applications classifier and e-learning application cost assessment. The EDMS is conceived as a system that receives in input, the objectives and the features expected of the e- learning application and provide, in output, an elearning class that includes one or several most suitable applications. If several classes have to be considered, EDMS will order them according to their relative costs. This paper will present more thoroughly the "e-learning application cost assessment" component of EDMS.

The objective of this research was to simulate the high performance wrought alloy AA4032 using conventional press-and-sinter powder metallurgy (P/M). P/M alloys were formulated using mixtures of elemental and master alloy powders so as to yield a nominal composition of Al–12.2Si–4.5Cu–0.9Ni–0.5Mg. The processing response of these alloys was investigated as was response of the sintered product to hot swaging and heat treatment. The optimal raw powder blend contained 70% of the added silicon in a master alloy form and 30% as a pure, elemental powder. This combination imparted a significant refinement in the size of primary silicon crystals and enhanced mechanical properties. In a swaged and heat-treated form, the P/M alloy exhibited hardness and tensile properties that closely replicated those of the wrought counterpart.

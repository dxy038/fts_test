The log likelihood measure has been widely used in speech research for comparing speech signals. Recently, it has been proposed as a measure for assessing the quality of coded speech. In this paper we present an interpretation of the log likelihood ratio measure within the theoretical framework of a waveform coder distortion model. We then discuss the implications of this interpretation and show how it can be applied to the formulation of better objective measures of waveform coder performance.

Unlike the Franklin lightning rod which achieves protection
by providing a sacrificial point for the termination of lightning flashes,
special devices employing the point-discharge phenomenon have been
marketed since the early 1970s with the objective of eliminating
lightning strikes. The application of those devices has been mostly
limited to communication towers and other tall structures, with the
manufacturers claiming success and the scientific community
expressing strong scepticism. In recent years, the manufacturers have
been attempting to sell those devices to electric utilities for use in
substations and on power lines. This paper presents a new theory
which reconciles the apparent success of such devices in
minimizing/eliminating lightning damage to many tall towers with the
established scientific position regarding their inability to eliminate
lightning. This paper also shows that lightning elimination devices
would not benefit power lines nor substations.

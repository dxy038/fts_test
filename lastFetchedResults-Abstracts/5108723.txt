The pelvic floor can be subjected to different disorders, coming from a physiological change in the spatial configuration of the organs of interest: the bladder, the rectum, the uterus and the vagina. However, resort to surgery to replace them is complicated to achieve. In order to support the decision of the surgeon as to the invasive method to use for the patient, the MoDyPe (Pelvis Dynamics Modeling) project was launched, aiming at building a patient specific pelvic organ behavior. Our approach consists in creating thick surfaces of hollow organs, using periodic B-splines and offsets, then in controlling their discretization and in exporting a hexahedral model to provide input data for the study on the dynamics of the soft bodies of interest. From a segmentation step providing a dataset of 3D points, a function is built to measure the bidirectional distance between the surface and the data. It is minimized with an alternate iterative Hoschek-like method, by updating the parametric map and moving the control points. Several offsets of the base surface are then created to build up the thickness of the organ.

The objective of this paper is to develop innovative approaches to obtain analytical expressions of the radar cross section (RCS) of perfectly conducting random rough surfaces under the physical optics (PO) approximation. The led approaches take into account the specific geometrical properties of the considered surfaces to calculate their RCS. The objective is to reduce the computing time with respect to the numerical PO technique, which requires two numerical integrations. All developed approaches are validated by comparison with a commercial code (the multilevel fast multi-pole method (MLFMM) of FEKO), used as a reference, and with measurements performed on three selected rough surfaces samples.

This paper is about a high temperature superconductor (HTS) electromagnet for uniform magnetic field generation, without a magnetic core. More specifically, we are concerned with the design of a field winding made of HTS wire, for a homogeneous magnetic field in the working place, and with the evaluation of the electrodynamic interactions (Laplace forces) to which the winding is subjected. Another objective is the thermal stability of the HTS winding, which is provided by a Gifford-McMahon cryocooler for cooling down the winding and a confining cryostat system. Its thermal design and performance assessment are of concern too. Mathematical modeling and numerical simulations with Comsol Multiphysics are used to size the device and to evaluate the quality of the generated magnetic field.

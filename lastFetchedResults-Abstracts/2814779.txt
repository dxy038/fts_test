This paper present a novel superresolution algorithm for real-beam scanning radar based on the iterative adaptive strategy. Firstly, we establish the objective function based on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion, then we build the iterative expression by update the covariance matrix. This algorithm has better superresolution performance than traditional deconvolution method. Simulation results verified the analysis before.

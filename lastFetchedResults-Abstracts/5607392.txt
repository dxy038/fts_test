This paper will focus on the proposed logical key tree, called the LKH (Logical Key the Hierarchy) and analyze this scheme. An optimization method based on the LKH will be proposed. When the network users to join or leave group, the update method and its changes in the structure of original tree will be analyzed. The LKH structure and the improved LKH structure will be simulated by the NS2 simulation software. Besides, the impact of the two options on the network delay in the network communication will be analyzed, and NS2 software will objective analysis the advantages and disadvantages of these two programs and its application environment.

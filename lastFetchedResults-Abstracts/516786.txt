Objective: The objective of this study was to introduce and explore the effectiveness of detached mindfulness techniques in the treatment of a par-ticular case of obsessive compulsive disorder. Methods: In a single-subject experimental trial of A-B type, the detached mindfulness techniques were carried out on a subject with obsessive compulsive disorder. The subject was assessed at both stage A (base line) and stage B (last session) by Yale- Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Thought Control Questionnaire (TCQ), Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES). In addition, the subject completed Y-BOCS and DASS-21 in the fourth session and after the end of treatment sessions, as well as the follow-up session. Results: The subject's Y-BOCS score decreased from 36 in stage A to 12 in the last stage, and 10 in the follow-up stage. There was a significant reduction of scores in the pun-ishment and worry subscales of TCQ. Other findings include score reduction in subscales of MCQ, depression, anxiety and stress and score increase in GSES. Conclusion: The detached mindfulness techniques were effective in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder.

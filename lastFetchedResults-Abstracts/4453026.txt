We present deterministic algorithms for k-k routing and k-k sorting on circular processor arrays with bidirectional connections. We distinguish between cases where k&lt;4, 4&#10877;k&lt;n<sup>2</sup>, and k&#10878;n<sup>2</sup>. Standing results are considerably improved; for most problem instances, near-optimality is achieved. A very simple algorithm has good performance for dynamic routing problems

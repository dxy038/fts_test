In this paper, we present a circuit partitioning and test pattern generation technique for pseudo-exhaustive built-in self-testing of VLSI circuits. The circuit partitioning process divides a given circuit into a set of subcircuits which can be exhaustively tested, while the test pattern generation process generates reduced exhaustive test patterns for each subcircuit using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). In conventional approaches, these two problems are considered separately. However, in this paper, both problems are considered and solved in the same phase. A graph theoretic model of VLSI circuits is proposed. Based on this model, a circuit partitioning algorithm using the concept of minimum vertex cut is devised to partition the circuit into a set of exhaustively testable subcircuits with restricted hardware overhead. Each time a subcircuit is generated by the partitioning algorithm, the test pattern generation problem is considered. A new algorithm, based on the subcircuit modification technique, is proposed with the objective of generating reduced exhaustive test patterns of limited length (e.g., &#10877;2<sup>20</sup>) using LFSRÂ´s, for each of the subcircuits. This task is embedded in the circuit partitioning process itself, leading to an efficient and well-coordinated solution. Experiments using ISCAS benchmark circuit simulation have been conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is very good

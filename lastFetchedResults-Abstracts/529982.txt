Priming is one of the seed enhancement methods that might be resulted in increased seed performance (germination and emergence). The objective of this research was to evaluate effect of priming on seed emergence and yield under wide ranges sowing dates in cotton. Treatments were combinations of 6 sowing dates and 2 seed treatments (control and primed seeds). Hydropriming method was used; seeds of Siokra 324 were moistened in water for 16 h at 25°C. Results indicated that priming affects seed emergence components. Primed seeds had faster and more uniform emergence at all sowing dates. Priming also affected germination response to temperature; primed seeds "emerged" at lower base temperature. Base temperature was 15.4°C for control seeds, but was 13.5°C for primed seeds. Primed seeds had high yield than unprimed seeds (control) at all the sowing dates.

Objective To study the prevalence of
behavioural and emotional problems and the scope of
symptoms in preschool children. The results serve as
baseline in a 4-year follow-up study. Method The
sample consisted of 1887 preschool children who
started primary level education within 6 months upon
data collection. The sample represented the complete
1-year intake of all first year primary school children
in a northern German town of 254,000 residents. The
data were collected with standardized parent questionnaires.
Results The 6-month prevalence of
behavioural and emotional symptoms was 12.4%. The
overall score for internalizing symptoms (INT) was
significantly higher than the score for externalizing
symptoms (EXT). The disturbed children had the
highest mean scores on the syndrome scale ‘‘Anxious
or Depressed’’. Conclusions The level of psychopathology
in preschool children was already as high as
levels seen elsewhere in school children. The predominant
role of INT was unexpected, particularly for
boys. The attention of child mental health services
need to focus on preschool children as on school
children and on INT as much as on EXT, especially in
boys.

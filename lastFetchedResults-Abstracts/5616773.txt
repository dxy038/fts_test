A robust model predictive control algorithm is proposed for linear systems with input saturation in this paper. Polytopic uncertain systems and structured time-varying uncertain systems are respectively considered. An infinite horizon worst-case performance function is used as on-line optimization objective. Using a saturated linear feedback controller, the control action can be obtained by solving an LMI optimization problem. The feasibility of the optimization problem at the original time implies the robust stability of the closed-loop control system. Two simulation examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm.

Objective of this paper is to describe the Development of Innovative Theoretical Framework for e-business strategy for the purpose of creating value and to generate action in an e-enterprise. The model suggests that the value creation and action generation are two of the four perspectives of the proposed framework, other two being the `people´ and the `knowledge´. The effort of brining out this model is to explicitly provide the factored view with internal aspect and external aspect that are explicitly lacking in the four perspectives of the balanced score card. So to enable such factored view we offer the business model construct as a unit of analysis for future research on value creation and action generation in e-enterprise. Our model depicts the design of transaction content and structural aspects of the proposed framework. We propose that a firm´s business model is important locus of innovation and a crucial source for value creation and action generation for the firm and to its suppliers, partners and customers. Thus this paper is an attempt to fill the theoretical gap by seeking to identify the sources of value creation and action generation.

Objective(s):The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative status and DNA integrity in testes of wistar rat offspring exposed to omega-9 monounsaturated (MUFA) at different times of late organogenesis. Materials and Methods:Sixty female rats were divided into six groups of 10 animals. The first group served as control and received the drug vehicle, olive oil (1 ml/kg/day). The second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth group received 1000 mg/kg of oleic acid on gestation day 15 (D15), 16 (D16), 17 (D17), 18 (D18) and 19 (D19), respectively. Male pups were allowed to attain puberty and thereafter, blood was taken for hormonal analyses. Sperm count and motility were assessed. Testes homogenate was used for the determination of biochemical variables. Testes DNA was also determined. Results:The results showed that sperm count and motility were significantly decreased in the treated groups as compared to the control. There was a marked increase in the malondialdehyde level in rat testes from all of the treated groups as compared to the control (P<0.05). DNA from the testes of rats of D19 had the highest level of fragmentation as compared to the control. Conclusion: Omega-9 MUFA exposure in utero imposes negative effects on sperm variables and increases the level of sperm DNA fragmentation and oxidative stress.

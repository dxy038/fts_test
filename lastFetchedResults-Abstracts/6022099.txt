Leading Enterprise systems such as SAP, Oracle, Sage, Microsoft etc. With high adoption of these Enterprise systems, it is no longer sufficient for a new graduate to have knowledge of an academic subject as increasingly it is necessary for students to gain those skills which will enhance their prospects of employment.

A leading Academic Institution in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has established an initiative to ensure that each of its students engages with hands-on skills and has embedded this within the academic curriculum for all disciplines under its &#8220;Learning By Doing (LBD)&#8221; strategy. The integration project was conceptualized after thorough Literature Review, followed by meticulous planning, implementation and validation phases. The objective of the paper is to illustrate a successful model of experiential learning through design of a curriculum that is enriched through the hands-on experience gained by students working on a leading Enterprise System (ES) system - SAP.

Introduction Since community-based
health care was introduced, the use of mental health
services by patients with serious mental disorders has
been an issue of much interest. However, our
knowledge of intervening factors is both scarce and
partial. Objective To study socio-demographic variables
which may predict time-lapse (in days) between
each out-patient contact among a cohort of schizophrenia
patients. Method Data comes from the South
Granada Schizophrenia Case Register. We used Coxâ€™s
regression analysis to study the influence of the sociodemographic
variables in the time lapsed between
out-patient contacts. Results After adjusting for all
other socio-demographic variables included, we
found that to live in a rural area and being younger
independently predicted a longer time-lapse between
out-patient contacts while being retired predicted a
shorter interval between such contacts. Other variables
such as sex, educational level and marital status
did not determine such length between out-patients
contacts. Conclusion Socio-demographic variables,
and not only psychopathological ones, determine
mental health out-patient service use.

Objective
To evaluate outcomes of students in a longitudinal clerkship.
Study design
Clerkship grades, written examination scores, and clinical evaluations were compared between students participating in a longitudinal clerkship and students in block rotations. The percent of students pursuing an obstetrics and gynecology residency from each group was evaluated.
Results
There was no difference in clerkship grade (3.3 versus 3.5, P = .158). Longitudinal and block students received similar clinical evaluations with no significant difference in any category. The average written examination score was lower for students in the longitudinal clerkship (76.9% versus 80.0%, P= .008). A higher percent of students in the longitudinal program chose an obstetrics and gynecology residency, 12.5% versus 6.17% (odds ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval 0.57-6.89, P = .18).
Conclusions
Longitudinally trained students received similar clinical evaluations to their colleagues but may need assistance in acquiring the knowledge needed for the written examination. This program should be examined closely for factors influencing a higher percent of students to pursue a residency in obstetrics and gynecology.

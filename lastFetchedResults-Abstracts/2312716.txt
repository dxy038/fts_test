Data analyzed in the present work correspond to a 40 days field experiment carried out in Teide Volcano (Canary Islands, Spain) with two short-period small-aperture dense seismic antennas in 1994. The objective of this experiment was to detect, analyze and locate the local seismicity. We analyzed also the background seismic noise to investigate the possible presence of volcanic tremor. From a set of 76 events, we selected 21 of them in base of their good signal-to-noise ratio and their possibility to locate their seismic source by using the seismic antennas. A visual classification based on the S–P time and seismogram shape has permitted to establish three groups of events: local seismicity (S–P time between 3 and 5 s), very local earthquakes (S–P time smaller than 3 s) and artificial explosions. These earthquakes have been located by applying the Zero Lag Cross-Correlation technique and the inverse ray-tracing procedure. Those earthquakes that were recorded simultaneously by both seismic antennas were also located by intersecting both back-azimuths. The analysis of the seismicity has revealed that the amount of seismicity in Teide Volcano is moderate. This seismicity could be distributed in three main areas: inside the Caldera Edifice (below the Teide–Pico Viejo complex), in the eastern border of the Caldera Edifice and offshore of the island. At present, this activity is the only indicator of the volcano dynamics. The analysis of the back-ground seismic noise has revealed that at frequencies lower than 2 Hz, the Oceanic Load signal is predominant over other signals, even over local earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.0. Due to this, although if in the Teide area were present a weak volcanic tremor, or other volcanic signals with predominant peaks below 2 Hz, to observe them would be a very difficult task.

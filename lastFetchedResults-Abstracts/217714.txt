Tumor-to-tumor metastases are uncommon. Lung cancer is the most frequent donor tumor while renal cell carcinoma is the
most common malignant, and meningioma the most common benign recipient of metastases. Other reported host benign
lesions include thyroid adenoma, adrenocortical adenoma, ovarian cystoma, and hepatic cavernous angioma. A 41-year-old
male smoker presented with a mass in the right axillaryâ€™s fossa, cough and weight loss. Chest x-ray showed left lung
collapse. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed vegetation in the left main bronchus and biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
Biopsy of the right axillary mass showed benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH) with metastasis from adenocarcinoma. To our
knowledge, this report represents the first case of tumor-to-tumor metastasis to BFH. (Tanaffos 2008; 7(3): 73-75)

The Internet has become a method of mass communication during disasters and emergencies. Using Media Richness Theory, the design parameters of emergency communication techniques are examined and new methods of using the web are proposed. The objective is to better serve those in need at the time of need with targeted communications that provide value. The new methods proposed are starkly different than those in common use today, but after testing during hurricane Ike in 2008, they appear to offer functionality not currently available through existing methods of communication.

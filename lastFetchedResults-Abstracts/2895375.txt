We study stable wireless link scheduling under the physical interference model in wireless networks. Given a set of elastic wireless communication requests arriving in an online fashion, the objective is to perform link scheduling to maximize the network throughput capacity. This well-motivated problem under an arbitrary physical interference model is notoriously hard. In this work, we develop efficient interference-aware scheduling protocols under different transmission power control settings, i.e., uniform power control and monotone power control. The novel proposed scheduling protocols can attain a provable efficiency ratio. The extensive simulations validates the proposed protocols under various environmental settings.

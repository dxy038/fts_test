The advancement of the internet technology had brought revolutions to our society. Numerous changes are taking place in today´s business operation, sources of information, and transaction behaviors. As the computer hardware and dot com technology growing even more mature, more and more people are doing their everyday shopping on the internet. One of the examples is the establishment of the online bookstore. However, consumers have been increasing their demand toward the business of online bookstores; how do we provide satisfactory quality services to today´s customers has become one of the important subjects confronting business owners of the online bookstores. Service itself exhibits qualities of being hard to define and measure. Therefore when consumers attempt to measure the quality of service performed, their judgments usually tend to be both subjective and fuzzy; hence, this research adopted the fuzzy multiple criteria decision making method. First we use the analytic hierarchy process to obtain the subjective weights for the evaluation criteria; the objective weights were also obtained through the entropy method; then subsequently the combinational weights were calculated. In the end, the one with the best service quality was derived and the overall online bookstore service quality was sorted. This research based on samples taken from five domestic online bookstores for analysis with the hope of providing useful future references for further evaluation and improvements.

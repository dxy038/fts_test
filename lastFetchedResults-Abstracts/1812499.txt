CD11c is involved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis phagocytosis by human macrophages. CD11c has not been evaluated during antituberculosis (anti-TB) treatment. CD11c expression was evaluated on monocytes from peripheral blood leukocytes of pulmonary TB (PTB) patients and healthy controls by flow cytometry, whereas CD11c/Arg47Trp polymorphism was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. PTB patients had increased levels of CD11c on blood monocytes as compared to healthy controls. CD11c levels decreased in response to anti-TB treatment. CD11c/Arg47Trp polymorphism is not associated with PTB.

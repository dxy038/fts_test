The authors give the status of wavelength standardization in RACE and report on the procedures involve in getting RACE-generated standards accepted in Europe and worldwide. Five operating wavelength ranges have been allocated to bidirectional optical transmissions of interactive and distributive service signals within RACE. From several RACE projects a consensus has been reached on wavelength allocation which is layed down in the RACE Common Functional Specifications (CFSs E330, E333, E334 and E335). These results have been sent to the relevant ETSI STC. In this STC (TM1/TM3) the RACE and other contributions will lead to an ETSI consensus in Europe. A contribution by ETSI to CCITT will then result in a worldwide approved recommendation. Thus, a 3-stage approach RACE-ETSI-CCITT is required for a worldwide standardization

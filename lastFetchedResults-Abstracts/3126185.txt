The inexpensive tiny wireless sensor can be embedded in devices to enable any commercial application, but are prone to intruder attacks. Due to the limited resource constraint in wireless sensor network, security in protocols is sacrificed or kept minimal. The distributive and self-organizing nature of sensor based on environment requires protocol to be adaptive, energy efficient and secure. In this paper, we analyze the different encryption schemes and their shortcoming in providing an energy efficient solution for sensor network. Secondly, we propose a communication protocol that balances resources while achieving mission critical solution using bio-inspired multi-objective algorithm. Thirdly, the accuracy of threat detection is analyzed using threshold approach based on sensor characteristics.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nursing is one of the stressful jobs and its employees have high ranking in visit the doctor because of psychological problems. On the other hand stress causes reduced level of serum zinc and complications related to its deficiency. So the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zinc supplement on ICU nurses under job stress in educational hospital, Sari-Iran in 2011.
METHODS: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT), 90 female ICU nurses who completed Osipow job stress questionnaire and had job stress and had been qualified for study entry, randomly allocated in two equal intervention and control groups. At the beginning of the study, five milliliter blood was sampled from antecubital vein for measuring of serum Zinc. Intervention group received one capsule zinc sulfate 220 mg per 72 hours for four weeks and control group received one capsule placebo in the same way. Again at the end of the 4th week, job stress and serum Zinc level was measured in both groups and compared.
FINDINGS: In intervention group serum zinc level at the end of the study (88.25±13.2 mcg/dl) was significantly increased in comparison to before the study (56.63±15.8 mcg/dl) (p < 0.05). But in control group the difference between serum zinc level before (54.72±15.1 mcg/dl) and after the study (59.35±14.7 mcg/dl) was not significant. There was no significant change in overall value of job stress before (208.39±31) and after the intervention (206.65±29) in both study groups. In intervention group, in three dimensions of job stress (role overload, role ambiguity and responsibility) significant reduction was seen (p < 0.05) but in control group there was no significant change in any dimensions of job stress. 
CONCLUSION: Considering to the finding of the present study, to reduce some dimensions of job stress in ICU nurses, zinc supplement usage seems logical.

Multi-objective optimization and multiple criteria decision making problems are the process of designing the best alternative by considering the incommensurable and conflicting objectives simultaneously. One of the first interactive procedures to solve multiple criteria decision making problems is STEM method. In this paper we propose a modified interactive procedure based on STEM method by calculating the weight vector of objectives which emphasize that more important objectives be closer to ideal one. We use the AHP and TOPSIS method to find these weights and develop a multi-objective group decision making procedure. Therefore the presented method tries to increase the rate of satisfactoriness of the obtained solution. Finally, a numerical example for illustration of the new method is given to clarify the main results developed in this paper.

We formulate a pair of multiobjective nonlinear symmetric dual variational
problems. For the single objective problems our problems become the symmetric
dual pair of I. Smart and B. Mond J. Math. Anal. Appl. 152, 1990, 536]545..
Under invexity assumptions, we establish the weak, strong, converse, and self
duality theorems for our variational problems by using the concept of efficiency.
Also, we give the static case of our symmetric duality results

Managing disassembly sequence has been receiving much attention in recent years. One disassembly problem that has been of interest to researchers is the multi-objective selective disassembling model where disassembly time and disassembly profit must be both taken into consideration. The available literatures do not discuss this effect in the remanufacturing process. This may not be true in remanufacturing firms where labor cost is expensive. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed and an improved heuristic method based on scatter search is proposed to tackle this problem. In the algorithm makes use of PPX (preserving priority crossover) procedure as a subset combination operator, and makes use of local search operator to improve new solutions generated by the combination operator. Then, the numerical example is provided and the computational results are compared with the solution obtained by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII). The computational result shows that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding a set of trade-off solutions and management may use this model to better plan the disassembling work, and improve the efficiency of reverse logistics.

An economic three-phase AC/DC power converter is proposed. The proposed converter uses only four active switches to simplify the hardware circuit and reduce the cost. In addition to the characteristics of unity power factor and sinusoidal input current waveform, the proposed power converter also possesses bidirectional power flow capability. A mathematical model of the power converter and a critical inductance condition are derived in this context for simulation and design. Finally some simulated and experimental results are presented for verification.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Background
 the identified risk factors for anterior shoulder instability is bone loss on the anterior-inferior glenoid rim. The aim of our study was to assess intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of the Bernageau view to estimate glenoid bone loss and validate this radiographic method with computed tomography (CT) scan. The second objective was to find correlation between Bernageau and arthroscopic bone loss measurements.
als and methods
 patients were included retrospectively. Two independent observers evaluated glenoid bone loss with the ratio between glenoid joint surface diameters of the pathologic and healthy shoulders on Bernageau views. Results were compared with CT (gold standard) and arthroscopic measurements. Validity and reliability of Bernageau measurement were assessed with Spearman correlation coefficients (r) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ρ).
s
terobserver and intraobserver reliability and the validity of Bernageau measurement compared with the reference test, the CT scan, were all excellent, with a Spearman ρ between 0.56 (P = .0002) and 0.95 (P &lt; .00001) and an intraclass correlation coefficient between 0.82 (P = .0007) and 0.97 (P &lt; .10−5). There was no correlation with arthroscopic evaluation.
sion
enoid bone defect measurement on the Bernageau profile view is a valid and reliable method. Furthermore, it is easy to use in current clinical practice. Surgeons can therefore consider it as a tool for preoperative planning, and its use could decrease CT scan indications.

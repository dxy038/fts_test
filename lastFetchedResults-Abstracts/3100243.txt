In this paper, a novel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on adaptive niche calculation method is presented. This proposed algorithm can automatically adjust the niche radius according to the distribution of the non-dominated solutions to solve the problem that niche radius is difficult to be specified in prior when niche technique is used. In addition, a mutation operator is incorporated to avoid premature convergence of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm is applied to several standard test functions and compared with some multi-objective evolution algorithms. Results indicate that the algorithm is of high efficiency and strong competitiveness.

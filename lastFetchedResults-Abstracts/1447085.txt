The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamin E supplementation on characteristics of enhanced beef cuts during retail display. Twelve steers were fed either a control (Eâˆ’) diet or a diet supplemented with dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate (E+) for 117 days prior to slaughter. Paired strip loins, clods, and inside rounds served as the control (C) or were pumped (P) to 110% of raw weight to contain 0.4% sodium chloride and 0.4% phosphate on a finished weight basis. Steaks were cut (2.5 cm) for sensory evaluation and retail display. No flavor or texture differences existed in strip steaks due to vitamin E. Enhanced steaks were more tender, juicy and salty than controls, however they discolored more rapidly than did controls. Steaks from supplemented cattle were slightly, but significantly, less discolored, indicating that vitamin E may provide some improvements in color stability of enhanced meat products. Vitamin E supplementation may improve short term color stability (up to 2 days in display) of retail beef enhanced by injection of a salt-phosphate solution.

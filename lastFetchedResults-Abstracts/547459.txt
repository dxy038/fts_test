Background and purpose: Echinococcosis in dog, due to infection with adult stages of the tape worm Echinococcus granulosus, poses significant economic and public health problems in endemic areas of Iran particularly in Northern provinces. The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of E. granulosus parasites in stray dogs' population of Sari city, in two separate studies carried out in 1999 and 2007.
Materials and methods: In two studies performed in 1999 and 2007, 80 stray dogs were collected by shooting from urban areas of Sari city, Northern Iran. They were necropsied and gastrointestinal tract was opened. Recovered parasites were collected and the taxonomic study was carried out by measuring different parts of the body of parasites.
Results: In these two studies, 30 and 50 stray dogs were studied in these areas. The overall prevalence rate of E. granulosus in 1999 was 46.7% in 30 stray dogs. In the second study carried out in 2007 no E.granulosus egg or adult worm was found in stray dogs.
Conclusion: The reduction of the prevalence of E. granulosus in stray dogs seems to be due to increase of health care in this area, especially construction of new industrial slaughterhouse.

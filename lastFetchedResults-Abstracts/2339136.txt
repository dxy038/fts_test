Objective
Recognition of risk factors for febrile seizures (FS) and epilepsy is essential.
Studies regarding the role of melatonin in these convulsive disorders are limited.
This study determines the relationship between serum melatonin levels and FS
and epilepsy in children.
Materials & Methods
A population of 111 children with simple FS, complex FS, and epilepsy (37
children per group, respectively) were included as case groups. In addition, 37
febrile children without seizures comprised the control group. Serum melatonin
levels were measured and compared between all groups.
Results
The serum melatonin levels in the simple, complex FSs, and epilepsy groups
were 2, 2.4, and 2 pg/ml, respectively. The serum melatonin level in the control
group was 2.1pg/ml.
Moreover, there were no significant differences observed while comparing the
case groups.
Conclusion
The present study reveals that there is no association between serum melatonin
level and simple or complex FS and epilepsy. It appears that melatonin plays no
significant role in these convulsive disorders.

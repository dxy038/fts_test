Objective
Developmental delay is one of the most common causes of conferring the pediatric
neurologist. The main part of neurological growth and development occur in the
first two years especially in the first 6 months of life. Metabolic or skeletal diseases
are important causes of developmental delay. Early diagnosis of deviance from the
normal diagram of development in lower ages is important.
Materials & Methods
Specific ages and stages questionnaires (ASQ) for 6 months was completed in the
health centers for 800 infants conferring for their vaccination in Isfahan and the retest
was performed at 24 months of age by ASQ and then these two questionnaires were
compared.
Results
10.5% of the infants were delayed in at least one domain. At 24 months, 38.4%
of them remained delayed; 21.1% in one domain, 9.6% in two domains, 3.8%
in four domains and 3.8% in five domains. Of the children who had problem in
communication, 20%; in gross motor, 25%; in fine motor, 20%; and in problem
solving, 30% remained delayed. In the personal social domain, none of the delayed
children at 6 months remained delayed at 24 months.
Conclusion
ASQ is feasible, inexpensive, easy to use and was appreciated by the parents. It can
be used as a screening test for detection of developmental delay in lower ages, but its
results must be followed by other standard tests or diagnostic tools.

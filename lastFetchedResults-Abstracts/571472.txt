Objective(s): There are four ideologies regarding the validity and Manbaee’at (being the primary source) of Quran and the traditions:
1)Quran-orienticism discusses that the only source for perceiving religion is the Holy Quran.
2)Tradition-orienticism argues that resorting to the Infallibles’(AS) Sunnah is the only source for learning about religion.
3) Quran-orienticism and Tradition-orienticism focuses on the issue that Tradition is the same as Quran in validity and Manbaee’at.
4)Double-orienticism says that Tradition is infereior to Quran with respect to validity and Manbaee’at.
Method(s): the present research is based on a descriptive-exploratory method. Thus , for deduction
of the Quranic data, the writer has analyzed the content of the Quran.

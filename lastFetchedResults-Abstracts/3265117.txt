In this paper the matter-element model based on the extenics theory is established to determine the drought degree of Dalian in 2002. Firstly to describe the land condition of Dalian City in the form of matterelement, to determine the classical field and segmental field and to confirm the weight coefficients using the simple dependent function, then the synthesis dependent degree and the final grade index are calculated. Thus the degree of Dalian City´s drought condition is obtained. And the assessment result is more objective and accurate because the method obtaining the weight has avoided over depending on experts´ subjective factors.

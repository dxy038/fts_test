A simulation model composed using reusable components is semantically valid if it produces meaningful results in terms of expressed behaviors and meets the desired objective. This paper focuses on the validation of component-based data-driven simulation. In data-driven simulation applications, it is necessary to model entity behavior at higher resolution. In simulations such as military training scenarios where entity behavior changes dynamically, additional input data is required to express complex state transitions. This can significantly increase the composed model state space and presents a major challenge in simulation validation. Using a component-based data-driven tactical military simulation, we propose a layered and automated approach for semantic composability validation. While the expressivity of data driven models increases the semantic equivalence of the validated model, it incurs higher validation cost.

In this study, we have undertaken the modeling and performance evaluation of a PCS network supporting IN services. We have taken into account the interconnectivity between the PCS network and the PSTN. Furthermore, we have accurately modeled the underlying signaling protocol, namely the SS7 and IS-41. The study has considered additions to the IS-41 protocols aiming to provide security mechanisms to limit the fraud present in PCS networks. The results show that when the IS-41 security mechanisms are not implemented, the network is able to support considerably higher arrival rates of register, mobile call originating and mobile call delivery service requests that in the case when the security mechanisms are implemented. The quality of the service provided by the system has been evaluated in terms of the end-to-end delay experienced by the users requests for the aforementioned services. The results also showed that the implementation of security mechanisms in PCS will require faster databases to accommodate the same capability achieved by the actual IS-41 implementations (no security). The main objective has been to stress the important role played by the databases within the IN architecture

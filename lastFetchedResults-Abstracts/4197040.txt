In keeping up with advances in renewable energy conversion technologies and the continued growth in the renewable energy area along with its impacts on electrical power systems, we believe it is important and timely to develop an upper-level undergraduate course on renewable energy and power systems. Therefore, it is the objective of this paper to describe our efforts in developing the course and present the course outline (including subjects, projects, and references). The course outline can be used as a starting point for other instructors considering offering a similar course. Our renewable energy and power systems course was first offered in fall 2004 at The University of Texas at Austin.

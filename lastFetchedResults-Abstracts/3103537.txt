A new Lower bound is present for the NP-hard problem of scheduling N jobs on a single machine with due dates, sequence-dependent setup times, and no preemption where the objective is to minimize the total tardiness. One branch-and-bound algorithm with the new lower bound is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of lower bound. A comparison with Ragatz&#8217;s B&amp;B approaches indicates that the lower bound is competitive.

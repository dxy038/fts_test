The objective of this paper is to describe the construction of special weighting and objective functions which can be used to facilitate a robust synthesis which is motivated by the techniques of Vidyasagar (1985) and McFarlane and Glover (1990). To this end, in going from a physical description of the plant to a standard &#8459;<sup>&#8734;</sup> problem to be solved, the authors include weights in a way which reduces the conservatism associated with the overbounding of uncertain blocks

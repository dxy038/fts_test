The use of weather forecasting models in energy applications has proven to be an effective tool in the management of renewable energy sources in power distribution networks which requires precise predictions and high-resolution of solar radiation and wind speed data. Therefore, the use of data from meteorological satellites such as Meteosat second Generation (MSG) can produce improvements in weather forecasting results. The integration of satellite data in weather prediction models is a developing field, because the assimilated data for these types of models mainly proceed from in-situ data at multiple stations, with low spatial resolution. The objective of this work has been the integration of data from the MSG satellite in the assimilation of meteorological model Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW), trying to improve results in meteorology predictions used in renewable power applications.

This paper presents an efficient hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm based on combining Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Simulated Annealing (SA), called ACO-SA, for distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) considering Distributed Generators (DGs). Due to private ownership of DGs, a cost based compensation method is used to encourage DGs in active and reactive power generation. The objective function is summation of electrical energy generated by DGs and substation bus (main bus) in the next day. The approach is tested on a real distribution feeder. The simulation results show that the proposed evolutionary optimization algorithm is robust and suitable for solving DFR problem.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: One of the side effects of diabete is subfertility. Diabete induces oxidative stress and cellular death in testis. Lepidium sativum is a plant with antidiabetic effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of lepidium sativum (LS) extract on diabetic and injured rat testis induced by streptozotocin (STZ).
METHODS: In this experimental study, 36 adult rats were used. They were randomly divided into 6 groups. Group 1 (control) received normal saline. Groups 2 and 3 received 200 and 400 mg/kg, LS respectively. Group 4 received 65mg/kg, STZ for induction of diabetes. Groups 5 and 6 received 200 or 400 mg/kg LS plus STZ. STZ were administered in a single dose. LS extract and normal saline were administered once daily for 21 consecutive day. On the 22nd day after the experiment all animals were dissected and their testis were analyzed for histologic and morphometric studies.
FINDINGS: STZ induced spermatogenesis impairment and a significant decrease in germinal epithelial height 70.8 ± 4.65 µ compared to control 95.60± 6.87 µ (p < 0.05). Treatment with 200 and 400 mg/kg LS reduced germinal epithelial height to 70.20 ± 7.56 and 77.5± 6.12 µ respectively (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Administration of LS in doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg for 21 days has toxic effects on testis. Therefore it cannot protect spermatogenesis in diabetic testis induced by STZ.

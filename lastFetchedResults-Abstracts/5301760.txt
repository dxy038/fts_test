HIFLIRTS is an ERA led collaborative project supported by the DTI under the Advanced Technology Programme, Tracked Transport Initiative (TRACTS). The overall objective of HIFLIRTS is to advance the UK industryÂ´s capability in the field of data communications for light rail transport applications. The tangible outcome of the HIFLIRTS will be a laboratory demonstrator system giving a working demonstration of the results of the research and investigatory work carried out during the programme. This paper outlines the technical objectives and status of the HIFLIRTS programme. Audio and video communications from train to control room will be achieved using cellular telephone technology, and GSM has been selected as the most promising candidate

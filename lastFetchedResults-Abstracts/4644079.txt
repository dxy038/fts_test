Thus we can get target indicators in accordance with reality in the evaluation area and the weight of the indicators has been identified by subjective (Analytic Hierarchical Process) and objective (Entropy weight) synthetic approach. On this basis, risk assessment of water resources has been made by comprehensive evaluation method which is based on extension theory. RS-ET (Rough Set - Extension Theory) method of water resources risk assessment has been built coupling with the above theory. Finally, the water resources risk assessment of Quanzhou has been made by RS-ET method, and the results show that the RS-ET method is practicable.

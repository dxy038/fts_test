The technology is advancing so unstoppable even in times of crisis. Sometimes it is difficult to take advantage of it because in no time a new and improved version of the above techniques appears to continue this progress. Within educational technologies aimed at enhancing remote laboratories is the same. From HTTP to websockets communication protocols the technology offers new alternatives to improve bidirectional communications between the client and the server. This paper shows how an integrated development initially HTTP has evolved to lead to a websockets-supported system for controlling a servomotor. The introduction of this communication technology is simplified to allow reuse existing laboratories, thus allowing reuse HTTP previous architectures, hardware and services, including a more advanced environment that uses websockets as communications support. How couldnÂ´t it be otherwise, the characteristic of the IoT hardware, in this case Arduino and Raspberry Pi, has been essential in this task. The goal: to reuse existing remote laboratories improve their communication protocol and expand the possibilities of client-server interaction retaining its character as an educational tool.

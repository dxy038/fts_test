The primary objective of this work is to carry out the 3D parametric geometry representations of hypersonic waveriders, and to calculate its aerodynamics by engineering experiential formula. Finally, an approach is proposed to determine a quasi-equilibrium glide trajectory with constraint on the stagnation point heat transfer rate. The benefit of solving this problem is that the angle of attack is the only control to be determined.

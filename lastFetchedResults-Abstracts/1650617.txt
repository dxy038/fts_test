The main objective of this study was to identify the factors contributing to the improvement and development of tourism in Nahavand. Tourism is considered as one of the major reasons of urban development. Tourism has been a phenomenon existing for a long time in human societies with its own specific features and gradual historical development, but it is not developing anymore. There are various reasons for tourism among which trip, resettlement, psychological, cultural, social, and economic ones can be mentioned.  Tourism development, particularly the increasing number of tourists, helps spurring a range of economic activities in the host country or region (Karegar, 1386, p.39). No considerable progress has been made considering the importance of this issue in the present time and in the ancient city of Skinheads which is said to date back to 3500 to 4500 years BC to advertise and promote the city as the capital of Iran’s civilization. Therefore, proper planning and attention is necessary in the development of tourism in the city. According to the mentioned criteria, investigating the pathology of the city which deals with the development of tourism in order to examine the causes of underdevelopment of Nahavand tourism seems necessary to develop the tourism industry in the city. Perhaps internal problems can be regarded as the reason that the city despite having various capabilities and diversified tourism and the factors of distance is not well-known.
 In the present study, the researchers tried to give a general definition of tourism as an industry, factors affecting its development, tourism and the adverse effects of social and cultural barriers. Then, a brief summary of the historical aspects of Nahavand and its attractions were given. Finally, the findings of this descriptive – analytical study were analyzed.

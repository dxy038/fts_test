Background and Objective: The intake of calcium plays an important role in the osteoporosis prevention. We aimed to evaluate the effect of health belief model-based education on improving the calcium intake among female students of middle schools in Kalaleh, Iran.
Material and Methods: This pre-experimental study was conducted on 140 middle school students selected via multistage random sampling and divided into two equal groups of case and control. The data was collected through a standardized questionnaire based on Health Belief Model (HBM) for osteoporosis and a food frequency questionnaire, and analyzed by software SPSS 16, using independent t-test and Mann-Whitney and Paired t-test. 
Results: The two groups matched with family size and demographic characteristics were not significantly different. Before the intervention, the scores of the knowledge and the HBM constructs in two groups were not different significantly, but after the intervention the increase was significant. (p < 0.001). The mean performance score, two months after the training,  had a significant increase (p  < 0.001).
Conclusion: The Design and implementation of a HBM-based-training program can be helpful in improving the knowledge, attitude and practice of students in the field of osteoporosis preventive behaviors.

Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is a useful imaging modality which is used during RF ablation procedures to identify anatomical structures. Utilizing ICE in conjunction with myocardial elastography (ME) can provide additional information on the mechanical properties of cardiac tissue and provide information on mechanical changes caused by ablation. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that ICE can be used at high frame rate using a diverging beam transmit sequence to image myocardial strain and differentiate myocardial tissue properties before, during, and after ablation for a clinical ablation procedure. In this feasibility study, three normal canines and eight patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were studied in vivo. A 5.8-MHz ICE transducer was used to image the heart with a diverging beam transmit method achieving 1200 frames per second (fps). Cumulative axial displacement estimation was performed using 1-D cross-correlation with a window size of 2.7 mm and 95% overlap. Axial cumulative strains were estimated in the left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) using a least-squares estimator with a kernel of 2 mm on the axial displacements. In the canine case, radial thickening was detected in the lateral wall and in the interatrial septum during LA emptying. For AF patients, the mean absolute strain in the ablated region was lower (6.7 &#177; 3.1%) than before the ablation (17.4 &#177; 9.3%) in LA at the end of the LA emptying phase. In the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) region, mean absolute strain magnitude at the end of the RA emptying phase was found to be higher during ablation (43.0 &#177; 18.1%) compared with after ablation (33.7 &#177; 15.8%). Myocardial strains in the LA of an AF patient were approximately 2.6 times lower in the ablated region than before ablation. This initial feasibility indicates that ME can be used as a new imaging modality in conjunction with ICE in RF ablation guidance and lesion monitoring.

Aiming at Delaunay triangulation with islets constrains in terrain simulation. A general Delaunay triangulation
algorithm for constrained data set with islets is proposed. The algorithm firstly constructs Constrained
Delaunay Triangulation with constraint polygons which are inner boundary of islets, then according to topological
relations within edge, surface, arc segment, applies bidirectional search to find the triangle in islet,
lastly it carries on certain corresponding processing to complete the Delaunay triangulation algorithm with
islets. The analyses show the algorithm simple, fast speed. The algorithm can be used in 3-D terrain vision.

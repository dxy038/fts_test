In this paper, a vision system motion tracking controller with high performance motion estimation mechanism is developed, With the emergence of the information era, the userÂ´s demands on video communication become more and more sophisticated, especially the requirements for both the functionality of video communication and quality. Take the video-meeting system for example, conventionally the camera can only be aimed on a particular direction. Through analyzing the movement of the object, we can estimate the new motion direction of objects. Then, according to the estimated value, the shooting direction of camera can be changed with the motion of object. In addition, the proposed method can be employed by the user to estimate the motion of his/herself to control the modon of focal point. Hence, the objective of this research is focused on the approaches to estimate the motion direction and locus by computing the motion vector of object.

Differentiating dry and wet cough is an important factor in respiratory disease. The main objective of this paper is to analyze cough sounds and extract features that can be used in differentiation of dry and wet cough sounds. This paper proposes two features to achieve this goal. The first feature is the number of peaks of the energy envelope of the cough signal. The second feature is the power ratio of two frequency bands of the second phase of the cough signal. A set of eight highly dry and eight highly wet cough sound recordings were used. Using these two features, a clear separation was observed among the dry and wet cough sound recordings.

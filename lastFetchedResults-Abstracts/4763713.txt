Using ground-penetrating radars to investigate the subsurface of Mars will be a key scientific objective over the next several years, especially in light of the large possibility that water could exist within the planet. Radars operating from a few megahertz up to a gigahertz will be able to provide valuable information concerning the subsurface electrical structure at resolutions ranging from a few centimeters near the surface to a few tens of meters at greater depths. One of the major goals of the work presented was to develop a lightweight, low-power, frequency-modulated radar system that could be used to detect subsurface deposits of ice and water. An inexpensive prototype system was developed using off-the-shelf connectorized components and evaluation boards. To verify the operation of this prototype system, a preliminary experiment was conducted in Lawrence, Kansas. Next, experiments were conducted over locations containing permafrost and ice in Fairbanks, Alaska. Results from these experiments are presented.

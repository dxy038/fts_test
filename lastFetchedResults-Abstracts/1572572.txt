This work explores the heavy metal retention capacity of materials developed from minerals that are abundant in nature, with low cost and minimum environmental impact. To accomplish this objective we have: (a) characterized commercial samples of calcite (CA) and hydroxyapatite (HAP)—including their surface properties (BET area, electrophoretic mobility, SEM, and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy); and, (b) qualified and quantified the interaction of Cd, Zn and Co with calcite (CaCO3) and hydroxyapatite [Ca5(PO4)3OH] through batch experiments, in a range of metal concentrations (4&lt;pMe&lt;8) and pH (6&lt;pH&lt; 8.6).

s show that the affinities of the studied heavy metals for CA and HAP surfaces follow the sequence: Cd&gt;Zn&gt;Co and Cd&gt;Zn≈Co, respectively. Retention increased with pCa and pH and could be modeled by: (a) a non-ideal ion exchange mechanism (Me/Ca) for the adsorption of Cd, Zn and Co onto CA; and, (b) a mechanism of non-ideal ion exchange and specific adsorption (Me/Ca and ≡PO4O–Me) in the case of HAP. The pH dependence is indirect in CA and is related to its solubility changes (pCa increases with pH, and so does sorption of Cd, Zn and Co).

aterials, HAP and CA, can be used for heavy metal retention. The former has better performance for water treatment due to its greater efficiency for the retention of Cd, Zn and Co (over two orders of magnitude per gram of material) and its lower solubility in a wide range of pH (6&lt;pH&lt;9).

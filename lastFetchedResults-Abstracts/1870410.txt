The frequency, subsets and activation status of peripheral blood invariant NKT (iNKT) cells were evaluated in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients and in chronically HIV-1-infected subjects. The absolute numbers of iNKT cells were significantly decreased in TB patients and in HIV-1+ individuals who were antiretroviral therapy naive or had detectable viremia despite receiving HAART. iNKT cell subset analysis demonstrated a decreased percentage of CD4+ iNKT cells in HIV-1+ subjects, and a decreased percentage of double negative iNKT cells in TB patients. Peripheral blood iNKT cells from HIV-1+ and TB patients had significantly increased expression of CD69, CD38, HLA-DR, CD16, CD56, and CD62L. The expression of CD25 was significantly increased only on iNKT cells from TB patients. These findings indicate that peripheral blood iNKT cells in these two chronic infections show an up-regulated expression of activation markers, suggesting their role in the immune response to infection.

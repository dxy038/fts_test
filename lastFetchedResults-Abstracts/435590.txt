Background
There are distinct physiologic differences between patients with single-ventricle lesions who have undergone the Norwood procedure with a right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery conduit (NW-RVPA) compared with those patients who have undergone the Norwood operation with a Blalock-Taussig shunt (NW-BTS). We evaluated bidirectional Glenn operation outcomes and compared the two groups to assess whether the type of Norwood operation influenced outcomes.
Methods
A retrospective chart review compared bidirectional Glenn operation outcomes for children undergoing the Norwood operation with NW-RVPA or NW-BTS at Children’s Hospital Boston from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2003.
Results
Of 80 patients undergoing the Norwood operation, 56 (NW-BTS, 27 versus NW-RVPA, 29) returned for the bidirectional Glenn operation at our institution. The NW-RVPA group had a lower median age at presentation for bidirectional Glenn (4.5 months versus 5.8 months; p = 0.01), but had better weight gain (20.6 g/day versus 16.5 g/day; p = 0.03) than the NW-BTS group. No interstage deaths occurred in the NW-RVPA group. There were no differences in morbidity or mortality after the BDG between the two groups.
Conclusions
There were no differences in morbidity and mortality outcomes after the bidirectional Glenn operation between the NW-RVPA and NW-BTS groups. Despite younger age at presentation, the NW-RVPA patients had better growth rate, which may have contributed to the similar postoperative outcomes.

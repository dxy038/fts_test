    The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of short-time cold exposure at early age on the incidence of ascites syndrome and its parameters in broiler chickens hatched at low altitude. Three hundred day-old (Ross 308) broiler chicks hatched at low altitude were transfered to a high altitude farm. Two hundred and fifty chicks were selected based on body weight and divided in two experimental groups (cold and control). At 3 and 4 d, the cold-group chickens were exposed to 15 ?C for 3 h, while the control birds reread under normal condition. During the period of 14 to 28 days, for ascites induction, both group chickens were again exposed to low environmental temperature. For hormone analysis, blood samples were taken 3 and 4 d (before and after cold exposure), and followed at 7, 14, 28 and 42 d. Daily mortality was examined for lesions of ascites. Ascites mortality was markedly higher in control, compared with the early cold exposed chickens. Mean plasma corticosterone and T3 levels were significantly higher in cold group chickens after their exposure to low temperature at early age. But the result was significantly reversed at day 28 of age. Evaluation of growth parameters showed that body weight of cold group chickens was significantly higher than control chickens at 42 d, however the differences between two groups in feed intake and feed conversion ratio were not significant throughout the experiment. The results of present study indicated that cold exposure at an early age can induce an improvement in thermotolerance or cold-stress resistance during the period of cold stress at later age in broiler chickens. This can be related to the change in endogenous functions of chickens such as plasma corticosterone and thyroid hormones levels, leading to decrease of ascites syndrome incidence.

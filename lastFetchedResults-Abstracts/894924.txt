Background: Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is difficult to diagnose
because of its nonspecific symptoms. Although echocardiography can reliably
and rapidly recognize the presence of pulmonary hypertension, chest X ray
(CXR) is more widely used because of its availability. The objective of this study
was to find a parameter, which, by changing the scale of CXR, is still useful for
detection of PAH.
Materials and Methods: This case control prospective study included 100
subjects with a clinical finding of dyspnea. Additionally, thirty healthy
volunteers (control group) were included in this study. Systolic pulmonary
artery pressure (SPAP) was determined by echocardiography. Widening of
pulmonary hilum, projection of the right side of the heart border (PRHB) and
the ratio of these parameters to the chest diameter were compared to SPAP
using the regression method. A cut-off point was determined for parameters
that showed significant correlation.
Results: The most prevalent disease in the dyspnea group was COPD (28%).
Average SPAP was 41.8Â±17.3 (ranging from 10 to 87 mmHg). Multivariate
analysis of the covariance revealed significant correlation between SPAP, age,
sex and hilar widening (r=0.44, P=0.0001) that was higher than PRHB and hilar
widening + PRHB (r= 0.374. and r= 0.438, respectively). The ROC curve showed
that the area under the curve was not significantly different for all parameters
and the best cut-off point with sensitivity of more than 80% was as follows:
hilar size more than 112 mm, PRHB more than 44 and hilum/chest ratio more
than 0.44.
Conclusion: Hilum/chest ratio is the proper substitution for the hilar size in
case of changing the scale of the chest X ray. Evaluation of hilar widening and
PRHB could lead to identifying more subjects suffering from undiagnosed
PAH.

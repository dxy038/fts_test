A nonlinear equivalent magnetic network (NEMN) model of a proposed hybrid excitation doubly salient machine (HEDSM) is developed to predict the electromagnetic performance. Taken nonlinear magnetization and local saturation in the poles into account, the permeances of different sections are investigated, and simple permeance correction factor of pole saturation is presented. Phase flux linkage, back-electromotive force (back-EMF) waveform and air-gap flux density distribution at bidirectional field currents and different rotor positions are predicted. Results from NEMN model are validated by the finite-element analysis and experimental ones, which indicates the validity and efficiency of the developed NEMN model for the preliminary design of the HEDSM.

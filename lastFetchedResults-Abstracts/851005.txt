It is clear that the private sector is pursuing profit . It has neither motivation to enter such an area nor it feels that it has such a mission ., So, the involvement of the government into urban development area is inevitable.  However, such an intervention is the source of the emergence of shortages and may damages.  The most important challenges in this area is to view new cities as big, temporary, isolated , artificial and far from identity and spirituality sleeping places. In such a place , the role of taste and desire of people is highly colorless.  The lack of interest of people to house in these cities and their lack of residents in some of them is exactly a reflection of the lack of city planners to cultural, social and human planning and therefore the emphasize on the industry-oriented ideology in the establishment of these cities. The main objective of this article is to study the rate of government success in urban development in post-Islamic revolution period through descriptive and analytical method. The results show that in building new cities, the government has not paid attention to the peoplesâ€™ views on design and also to the employment of technical standards.

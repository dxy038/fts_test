By overloading the evolutionary operation of differential evolution algorithm that we can deal with discrete optimization problems effectively. Define the adaptive crossover-factor and stagnation variation mechanism to prevent premature stagnation of the algorithm, and improve the population diversity. Simulation results show that the IDE algorithm can excellently solve the three-dimensional container-packing problem.

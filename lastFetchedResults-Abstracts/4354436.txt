Summary form only given. Optimization has a strict mathematical meaning but it is not often the definition used when the scientific literature refers to optimization. In this talk we will reflect on what we actually mean when we use the term &#8220;Optimization&#8221; and consider some of the optimization methodologies that are used. In particular we will focus on exact methodologies, meta-heuristics, hyper-heuristics, multi-objective optimization and real world problems. The DMO2012 Workshop on Best Practices in Reporting Results is also relevant to this talk as this will cover some of the ways that we can (and should) report experimental results when we are carrying out optimization.

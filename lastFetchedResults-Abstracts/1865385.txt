We have hypothesized that individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that exhibit different patterns of immune reactivity in serial interferon (IFN)-γ release assays (IGRA’s) correspond to different status within the immune spectrum of latent tuberculosis (TB). Accordingly, we analyzed the possible association between the consistent results (negative or positive) in an IGRA test and relevant immune parameters, mainly the levels of Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes and T regulatory (Treg) cells in the peripheral blood of TB case contacts. We found that individuals with a persistently positive IGRA showed increased levels of Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes upon in vitro stimulation with MTB antigens. In addition, a significant increase in the proportion of CD4+CTLA-4+ and CD4+Foxp3+ cells was detected in assays with blood samples from these individuals. Our data support that different immune phenotypes can be identified into the spectrum of latent TB, by combining different parameters of immune reactivity against MTB.

Modernity involves such essential and common concepts as rationalism, empiricism, humanism, scientism, secularism and the rule of law in which all modem schools and ideologies believe thus constituting the foundations of modernity. However, modernity, in practice, appeared with two separate faces over the preeminence or priority that refer to the historical necessities, transformation and backgrounds of every society. While the first face of modernity emphasizes democracy, the second face stresses on development, that frequently making these two in contact to each other. On the other hand, the second face has been more salient in transitional societies and societies with inadequate socioeconomic structures. It ultimately led to the dominance of the second face. Hence, societies which stress on this aspect of modernity consider the achievement of any progress conditional on making the conditions ready particularly from the objective perspective the most important of which is concentration of power, wealth and power centers at the hand of the state, order, bureaucracy, national unity, nationalism, social justice and industrialization. What occurred in Iran during the 1925-1941 period is the preponderance of the second face of modernity over the first one, i.e. democracy. Development appeared to be of utmost priority for the founders of the Pahlavi regime. What we deal with it in this article is role of the elite of iran in formation of development discourse in those years, which indeed was the defeat of democratic ideals of the Constitutional Revolution.

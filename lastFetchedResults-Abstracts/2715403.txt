While more accurate and reliable than ever, the trustworthiness of biometric verification systems is compromised by the emergence of spoofing attacks. Responding to this threat, numerous research publications address isolated spoofing detection, resulting in efficient counter-measures for many biometric modes. However, an important, but often overlooked issue regards their engagement into a verification task and how to measure their impact on the verification systems themselves. A novel evaluation framework for verification systems under spoofing attacks, called expected performance and spoofability framework, is the major contribution of this paper. Its purpose is to serve for an objective comparison of different verification systems with regards to their verification performance and vulnerability to spoofing, taking into account the systemÂ´s application-dependent susceptibility to spoofing attacks and cost of the errors. The convenience of the proposed open-source framework is demonstrated for the face mode, by comparing the security guarantee of four baseline face verification systems before and after they are secured with antispoofing algorithms.

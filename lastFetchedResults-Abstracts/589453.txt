Objective: The present study examined and analyzed citation frequency of ISI cited journals in organic chemistry for 2006. Number of citations to each reference within a given text was counted. By employing citation analysis based on frequency, the study posits the possibility of using citation frequency as a significant indicator in citation analysis researches based on citation count.
Methodology: A standard citation frequency analysis was used. It is a type of citation analysis focusing on citation frequency which is standard since both articles and citations were drawn from ISI indexed journals.
Findings: Findings indicated that out of every 10 citations, 8 in-context citations belong to journals indexed in ISI. The distribution of this frequency is not normal. 3.5% of journals had the highest frequency while 40% had been repeated only once. A significant distinction between citations means and frequencies was discerned.

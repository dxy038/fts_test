Study objective: To compare the tensile strength of lacerations closed with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive, with suture, and with a combination of tissue adhesive and suture.

Design: Randomized, controlled animal model study. Setting: Animal care facility. Participants: Sixteen albino guinea pigs. Interventions: Four incisions to deep fascia were created on the dorsum of each animal. Lacerations were closed with either tissue adhesive alone, tissue adhesive with subcutaneous suture, percutaneous suture alone, or percutaneous suture with subcutaneous suture. After 4 days, the breaking strengths of all wound closures were measured. Results: Wound closures made with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive alone exhibited significantly less tensile strength at 4 days than closures made by the other three methods. Wound closures made with combined percutaneous and subcutaneous sutures were significantly stronger than all other groups. Conclusion: Wound closures made with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive alone have less tensile strength at 4 days than those made with tissue adhesive and subcutaneous suture or those closed by traditional suture methods.

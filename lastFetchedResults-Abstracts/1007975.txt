 Mycobacterium tuberculosis is still widely spreading and to control and eliminate its danger it has to be detected fast and efficiently. The current methods of detection are culture-based and sensitive enough to detect minute numbers of bacilli; however, they take long time. Other methods such as smear microscopy (AFB) take less time but they are not able to detect low numbers of bug. It is possible to apply two fast and sensitive methods, PCR and ELISA, in urban area; however, they are too expensive and are not accessible in remote geographical places. The progress of biosensing technology has made it possible to implement electronic technology for detection of bacteria under   AC Altrnate and DC status. In this study conductance and Zeta potential of bacillus at different concentrations based on CFU/ml was used to detect its presence, status of population in singular, cord or large colonies arrangements. The results showed that in different concentrations of bacterium from 101 to 108 CFU/ml the conductivity varies linearly, and increased from 4?S to 34?S respectively. Zeta potential was also representative of the concentration being -4mV in 10 CFU/ml that increased to -12mV in 108 CFU/ml linearly. The size of colonies was also worked out by means of resulted conductance and Zeta potential. Changes in the size of colony over time were less than relative variations that occurred in Zeta potential and conductance. Therefore, with increase number of bacteria, the colonization occurred with mild rated and only to some extent.
Therefore, based on the trend of changes in conductance and Zeta potential number of bacterium at any time could be worked out. Thus ultimate aim of this study is to build a portable diagnostic tool able to distinguish species and number of bacterium reliably has been fulfilled to some extent and paves the path for better and earlier detection and ceasing the spread of bacterium.

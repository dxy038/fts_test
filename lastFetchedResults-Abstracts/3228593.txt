With the increasing international concern about carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, it is no longer adequate to plan spinning reserves taking only the lowest production cost into account. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to present an optimal spinning reserve planning scheme considering CO2 emissions and the variations in the system reliability index while incorporating renewable energy in the power dispatch selection. First, two different objective scheduling modes of production costs and CO2 emissions were introduced, and then solved the unit commitment problem in different spinning reserves and wind penetrations. In order to obtain a higher probability of the global optimum, the simulation process used appropriate coding techniques to meet the constraints. Secondly, the Monte Carlo simulation to acquire the reliability assessment of these unit commitment solutions was utilized. The salient feature of the simulation strategy was that the decision-maker could make a proper spinning reserve level involving environmental, economic and reliability factors simultaneously. Finally, taking the 27-unit system of the Taiwan power system as a test example, the simulation results showed that the proposed approach could indeed assist the power industry in setting the value of the spinning reserve.

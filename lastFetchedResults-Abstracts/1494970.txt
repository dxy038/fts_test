Wheat yield is low under rainfed condition in many countries of the world. The objective of this study was to determine whether micro-watershed treatment can improve rainfall use efficiency and yield of wheat under rainfed condition. Field trials were conducted during 2003–2004 and 2004–2005 under rainfed condition at Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak, NWFP (Northwest Frontier Province) Pakistan. Five micro-watershed, raised 0.45–0.5 m above ground level, were treated with either (1) plastic sheets, (2) stones, (3) compacted soil, (4) un-compacted soil, (5) left as untreated control. The experiment was conducted according to randomized complete block (RCB) design with six replications. Micro-watershed treatments significantly affected emergence m−2, days to 50% heading, plant height, spikes m−2, grains spike−1, grain yield and rainfall use efficiency. Maximum emergence m−2 (83.1) and plant height (94.7 cm) were recorded from micro-watershed treatments covered with plastic sheet, while maximum spikes m−2 (173.8), grains spike−1 (56.0), grain yield (2394 kg ha−1) and rainfall use efficiency (6.22) were recorded from micro-watersheds treatments covered with stones. Maximum days to 50% heading (116.4) were recorded in control plots. Micro-watershed enhanced days to 50% heading (114.5). It is concluded that the stone or plastic sheet covered soil surface was the best micro-watershed treatment that improved crop yield and rainfall use efficiency.

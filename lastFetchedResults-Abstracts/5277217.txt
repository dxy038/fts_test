Recently, it is required that the high efficiency and small size DC-AC inverter and DC-DC converter are developed for the applications such as solar cells, fuel cells and secondary batteries in the telecommunications, home electronics, industries, electric cars and so forth. A novel bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed and developed, which realizes the small size and high efficiency 98% is achieved in the prototype bidirectional DC-DC converter.

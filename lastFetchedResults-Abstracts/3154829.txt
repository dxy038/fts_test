This paper establishes a index system of manufacturing enterprise´s credit risk based on logistics finance, which includes product demand attrbute index, enterprise´s operation capability index, industry risk index. The qualitative index and quantitative index are measured by fuzzy evaluation (FE) method and principal components analysis (PCA) method respectively. Then the qualitative rating and quantitative rating are put forward, which weights are decided by analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Finally, the comprehensive evaluation rating model is set up, which combines subjectivity of FE and AHPwith the objectivity of PCA. The evaluation results are more objective and rational, compared to the usual method.

Background and Objective: Natural organic matters (NOM) are known as precursors to disinfection byproducts. As conventional treatment processes cannot get disinfection by-product standards, novel methods have been increasingly applied for the removal of disinfection by-products precursors. The UV/ZnO process is one of the advanced oxidation processes using photocatalytic technology. The present study aims to investigate the effect of UV/ZnO photocatalytic technology on the NOM removal from aqueous solution. Materials and methods: This study was conducted in a lab-scale batch photocatalytic reactor. The volume of reactor was 1liter and covered with UV lamps. Peristaltic pump was used for complete mixing. Humic acid is a key component of natural organic matter and it was used in this study. Each of the samples taken from the UV/ZnO process and other processes were analyzed for their UV absorbance at 254 nm by spectrophotometric. Initial concentration of Humic acid, contact time, pH, and UV irradiation were investigated. Results: The highest efficiency of the UV/ZnO photocatalytic process for removal of Humic acid from aqueous solution was achieved at initial concentration = 2 mg/L, contact time = 120 min, UV irradiation = 3950 &muw/cm2, and pH=3. In this process, the removal efficiency for 2 mg/L humic acid was 100 % at 2h retention time. Conclusion: The research showed that performance of system was increased by increasing contact time and UV irradiation and was decreased by increasing HA initial concentration and pH and UV radiation with ZnO agent could not remove NOM lonely. Photocatalytic system using zinc oxide immobilized on glass have high performance to remove humic acid from aqueous solution. The UV/ZnO process was efficient and environmental friendly for natural organic matter removal.

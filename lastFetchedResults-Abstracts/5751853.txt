The spread of multimedia data has drastically differentiated the current landscape of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) networks, posing the need for further enhancements in its Radio Resource Management (RRM) strategies. Introduced in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) Release 6, the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Services (MBMS) framework aims at the efficient usage of network and radio resources for the transmission of multimedia services. The main requirement during the provision of MBMS multicast services is to minimize the transmission power of UMTS base stations. To this direction, several mechanisms have been proposed that either allow a simultaneous deployment of Point-to-Point (PTP) and Point-to-Multipoint (PTM) transmissions, or a single transport channel deployment (PTP or PTM) in a cell at any given time. Main objective of this paper is to study these mechanisms, compare them in terms of power consumption, underline the advantages that they may offer; and finally to propose enhancements that will ensure the lowest possible power consumption during MBMS transmissions.

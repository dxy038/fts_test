This paper focuses on the problem of determining the ordering and disassembly schedules of used or end-of-life products while satisfying the demand of their parts\components over a planning horizon. To represent and optimally solve the basic case of the problem, an integer programming model is suggested for the objective of minimizing the sum of purchase, set-up, inventory holding and disassembly operation costs. Then, the basic model is extended to consider more general cases with parts commonality, i.e. single and multiple product types with parts commonality. Computational experiments done on the problems obtained from the literature and a number of randomly generated test problems show that the integer programming models suggested in this paper work well up to mediumsized test problems.

This paper presents a three-phase voltage-source 36-pulse converter that draws almost sinusoidal currents. The converter results from the combination of a series-connected 12-pulse voltage-source rectifier with a passive voltage-injection circuit and a bidirectional switch, referred to as hybrid injection. The voltage-injection circuit uses a single-phase rectifier bridge and a single-phase transformer. Both the voltage-injection circuit and the bidirectional switch operate at six times the supply frequency and have a low rating. In this paper, the converter operation is explained and analyzed. Subsequently, the converter is evaluated experimentally using a 4-kW 400-Hz prototype, where the THD<sub>I</sub> of the line currents was measured to be below 1.2%.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of age, sex on thyroid’s hormones levels and rhythmicity of these hormones in turkey chickens. 20 turkey chickens were randomly assigned to two groups (male=10&female=10). Blood samples were collected at 10 d intervals during 80 days.  Data were analyzed with Proc Mixed of SAS. In second experiment, circadian rhythmicity of thyroid hormone in male and female was studied. 16 turkey chickens (male=8&female=8) were randomly selected and blood samples were collected at 2 hours intervals for 24 hours.Then, the plasma concentration of thyroid’s hormones were measured. Results showed that the effect of age on plasma concentration of thyroxin was significant but there was not significant different between male and female birds. By aging the birds, concentration of thyroxin enhanced.  Plasma concentration of thyroxin in female and male was 20.63±1.6 vs. 20.58±1.7 µg/dl, respectively. Effect of genus and age on plasma concentration of triiodothyronine was significant. Overall mean plasma concentration of triiodothyronine in female chicken (209.72±0.34 ng/ml) was higher than male chicken (187.74±0.30 ng/ml). Possitive correlation was indicated between age and triiodothyronine level in male birds, while negative correlation was detected in female birds. Results of second experiment showed thyroxin increased during the night and decreased during the daytime, while the mean plasma concentration of triiodothyronine increased during the daytime and decreased during the night.

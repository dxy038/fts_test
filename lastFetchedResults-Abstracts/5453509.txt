The objective of this tutorial is to introduce in a tutorial fashion the employment of partial order techniques for analysis and synthesis problems in hybrid systems. While familiar to computer scientists, partial order notions may be less familiar to a control audience. The session will present fundamental notions in partial order theory including the definition of a partial order, properties of maps, and complete partial order (CPO) fix point theorems. The application of these notions to hybrid systems will be illustrated for the synthesis of safety controllers, for the design of state estimators, for robust verification, and for the analysis of the dynamics. Finally, problems in the context of intelligent transportation will be introduced and the application of partial order tools will be discussed.

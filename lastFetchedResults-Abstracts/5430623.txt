This paper proposed a bidirectional contactless power transfer (CPT) system with controllers at both primary and secondary sides to regulate the power flow. By involving energy feedback mode in the converters of both sides, a backward power flow channel from load to source is achieved which helps pumping out the surplus power from the output filter capacitor to the resonant tank at the secondary side and from the resonant tank to the power supply at the primary side. Furthermore, synchronous rectifying and zero current switching technologies are involved to reducing switching losses. Therefore, with the proposed dual-side control method, rapid regulation and high efficiency can be achieved. Simulation and experimental results show that the output voltage can be controlled to be constant against load variation by regulating the power flow direction dynamically.

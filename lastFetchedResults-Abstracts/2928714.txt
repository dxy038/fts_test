The problem of envelope-constrained filters with uncertain input (ECUI) was first formulated as a nonsmooth optimization problem. Previously, it was shown that this nonsmooth problem is equivalent to a standard quadratic programming problem which can be solved efficiently. The objective of the present paper is to investigate several issues relating to the sensitivity of ECUI filters. They are: (i) the output mask tolerance; (ii) the effect of the location of the pulse peak in the output response on the output mask tolerance; and (iii) the effect of the order of ECUI filters on the output mask tolerance. Theoretical analysis is supported by numerical simulation studies

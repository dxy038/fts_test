The overall goal of this research was to determine how to improve online delivery of programming courses, with the objective of advancing student engagement and learning outcomes. In order to improve the learning process for students with different pre-knowledge and preferred learning styles, a certain degree of adaptability must be introduced to eCourses. In learning environments that support this kind of functionalities students can choose different paths through course contents or can be directed to different parts of the instructional material depending on the pace of their advancement. This paper presents the implementation of such an environment by extending an Open Source Learning Management System Moodle, as well as possibilities of its usage in a typical introductory university course on Object-oriented programming in Java.

The application of synthetic aperture techniques to side-scan sonar imaging systems is investigated. Wideband echoes (one octave) are processed in the time domain. The relative merits of narrowband and wideband systems are shown using numerical simulations including sonar motion perturbations such as sway. Sonar image quality is described by azimuthal resolution. Although this criterion is an objective one, it can be insufficient for a highly perturbed situation

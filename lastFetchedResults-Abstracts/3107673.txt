The problem of converting existing continuous data control systems into digital control systems is considered. The objective of this paper is to develop a computer-aided method for synthesizing the pulse-transfer function of the digital controller. This is done by matching the frequency response of the digital control system to that of the continuous system with a minimum weighted mean square error. Formulas for computing the parameters of the digital controller are obtained as a result. The design technique is illustrated with a numerical example and a comparison with previous methods is also presented.

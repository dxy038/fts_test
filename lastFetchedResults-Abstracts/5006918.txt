This paper put forward dominance granule based multi-objective sorting algorithm (DGSA). The dominance granule can be obtained by the dominance relation in the information system and granular computing. It is the basis of multi-objective sorting and fitness assignment. Therefore, the dominance granule based multi-objective sorting algorithm is designed and reduces the computational complexity highly.

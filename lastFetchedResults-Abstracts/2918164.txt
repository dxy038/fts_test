Summary form only given. Bond graphs are of significant use in modelling systems which involve complex energy interchange mechanisms. For example, in mechanical engineering the coupling of rotational and translational energy sources is often complex to model and difficult to visualize. The complexity of modelling can be resolved in a number of ways (e.g. variational analysis). Bond graphing, however, permits the modeller to represent graphically the dynamic coupling between rotation and translation mechanisms. The example considered is the dynamical modelling of vehicle chassis systems. Typically, this topic involves translating suspension system components coupled to the rotational (roll, pitch) and translational (heave) modes of the chassis. The aim of this presentation is to illustrate the modelling of classic interactions of this type using bond graphs. The objective of the exercise is to device a dynamical simulation suitable for chassis control studies

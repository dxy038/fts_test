Objective
n infect cells of epithelial origin and is closely associated with carcinomas. Studies investigating its presence in salivary gland neoplasms are few and conflicting.
s
ion of HPV types 16 &amp; 18 was done on 34 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material of different salivary gland neoplasms using Digene HPV types 16 &amp; 18 probe using in situ hybridization technique.
s
of neoplastic salivary gland specimens were positively infected by HPV types 16 &amp; 18. Seven of them were benign (4 Warthin's tumour, 2 pleomorphic adenoma and one myoepithelioma), in addition to one malignant specimen (lymphoma). Correlation was found between the incidence of HPV infection and histological differentiation of salivary gland neoplasms.
sions
ociation exists between HPV infections and salivary gland neoplasms. However, given the sparse pattern of reactive cells, it cannot be confirmed that this virus is implicated in the aetiology of this group of tumours.

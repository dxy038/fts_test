Inroduction& Objective: Given the side effects of fertility drugs and other therapies,the researchers have embarked on investigating the effects of medicinal plants on reproductive processes.This study seeks to investigate the effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of olive seed on the levels of LH,FSH,estrogen and progesterone in immature female rat
Materials and Methods:The study is of experimental type carried out under laboratory conditions.In doing so,40 immature female Wistar rats,with weight difference of less than10%and age range of4-5weeks were entered into the study.The rats were divided into groups of ten as follows:control consisting of 10rats receiving nothing during the trial period of28day.sham group consisting of10rats which received 1 ml distilled water as drug solvent for 28 days,As for the experimental groups,there were 2 groups of 10 treated as follows:Experimental group consisting of two subgroups of ten receiving orally varying amounts of olive seed extract,250mg/kg and 500mg/kg for a period of 28 days.Blood sampling was performed on all the rats at the end of 28 days from ventricular region of their hearts and levels ofLH,FSH, estrogen,progesterone were measured using RIA method (technique).The obtained data were statistically analyzed by one way Anova and Tukeyâ€™s post hoc test.The level of significance was set at p < 0/05.
Results: Statistically,a significant increase in LH hormone serum concentration was in the experimental groups receiving varying amounts of hydro alcoholic extract of olive seed after 28,compared to that in the control and sham groups.FSH serum concentration increased significantly in the experimental group receiving 500mg/kg of the extract,after28 days.As for estrogen concentration, the respective level rose significantly in the experimental group receiving 500 mg/kg after 28 days .Also, a significant increase in progesterone level was observed in the experimental group with 500mg/kg extract treatment after 28 days
Conclusion:Taking into account the present study findings, we can conclude that hydro-alcoholic extract of olive seed can enhance the ovarian pituitary hormone axis activities, i.e, increase in the levels of the hormones LH, FSH,estrogen,Progesterone in immature female rats.

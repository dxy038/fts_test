Accumulation of Na+ in the soil represents a problem for agricultural production. This may be alleviated by calcium. Our objective was to determine the relative effects of Cl- and SO4-2 on Ca+ alleviation of Na+ stress. We treated Triticum aestivum L Sakha-69 seedlings growing under natural conditions to NaCl or Na2SO4 at the level of 15,30 and 45 mM/L either alone or in combination with 15 and 30mM CaCl2 or CaSO4 in addition to a reference control. Nutrient solution with added treatments was applied once a week. Increasing NaCl concentration decreased Chl a concentration at the tillering stage, the reduction in case of Na2SO4 was more than the previous case, while carotenoids concentration was significantly increased. Activity of amylases and concentration of soluble protein were depressed, while concentration of reducing sugars was significantly increased with increasing NaCl concentration. The response of Sakha-69 wheat for such parameters, on applying Na2SO4, was completely inverted. Sucrose concentration was increased concomitant with a decrease in polysaccharide concentration at the heading stage for both treatments. Addition of CaSO4 to NaCl alleviated the depressive effect of salinity on Chl a, carbohydrate fractions as well as soluble protein. On the other hand, addition of CaCl2 to NaCl was more beneficial for alpha amylase activity. It is observed that alternative anions had a better effect on the concentration of soluble protein. It is also noticed that the depressive effect of Cl" at early growth stage was diminished at the advanced stage. Application of CaCl2 at both concentrations with 30mM Na2SO4 highly significantly increased polysaccharide concentration compared to both corresponding and reference control

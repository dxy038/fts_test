All kinds of interferences have enormous negative impacts on accomplishing the control of underwater vehicle, especially for small one, the influences of turbulences are more fiercely and complicate. This paper proposed a generalized predictive control algorithm that can track position along the X-Y planes by controlling the propulsion vector, which can be used to a small underwater vehicle. The algorithm adopted the online system identification and changing variables over time which were verified based on a designed vectored water-jet-based spherical underwater vehicle. Based on the established objective model, the Simulations show the virtues that can track the position and resist the white noises very well.

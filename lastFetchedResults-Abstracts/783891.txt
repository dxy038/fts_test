Background Depression has been shown to be a common
co-morbidity in diabetes. From a public health point of
view, there is a lack of population-based studies regarding
the use of antidepressant medication in non-clinical samples
of people with diabetes. The objective of the present
study was to provide demographic and clinical information
about the use of antidepressant medication in a representative
community sample of people with diabetes.
Method The Canadian Community Health Survey 1.2
(CCHS 1.2) is a cross-sectional survey that collects information
related to health status, health-care utilization and
health determinants of the Canadian general population.
Diabetes presence was ascertained by self-report of physician
diagnosis. Depression and anxiety were assessed
using a modified version of the World Mental Health
Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Antidepressant
use was determined through self-report.
Results The population prevalence of self-reported antidepressant
use in the past 12 months was 8.4%
(SE = 0.95) among people with diabetes (n = 1,662).
People who took antidepressants had higher average body
mass index (M = 32.6, SD = 6.5) than those not taking
antidepressants (M = 29.2, SD = 5.7). The use of antidepressants
was associated with poorer health status and
higher number of co-morbid chronic conditions. Half of
diabetes subjects who used antidepressant medication in
the last year did not have a lifetime history of major
depression.
Conclusions In a community sample of people with diabetes,
the prevalence of antidepressant use exceeded the
prevalence of major depression. Anxiety disorders and
other somatic chronic conditions were associated with the
prescription of antidepressant medication in people with
diabetes, but without a history of major depression

We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a microscale positioning system. The system was designed in the SUMMiT V process to produce in-plane, bidirectional, micrometer-scale linear motion of a shuttle using a ratcheting mechanism and multilayered chevron actuators. A single latching system with oppositely faced ratchet teeth on either side of the shuttle is used for achieving the bidirectional actuation. The device has a smaller footprint and fewer electrical connections compared to similar devices, without compromising performance. Moreover, this device is capable of generating more force compared to previous devices. A LabVIEW-based optical characterization setup was developed for automated testing of the device. The device produced a maximum displacement of ~180 &#956;m with a step size of 9 &#956;m.

This paper presents an application of modified artificial bee colony algorithm (MABC) to determine the optimized solution of economic and emission load dispatch (EELD) problem. The EELD problem is formulated as a biobjective problem by taking minimization of fuel cost and emission levels as objectives. In order to convert a biobjective problem into a single objective function weighing factor is used. Effectiveness of the MABC algorithm is verified by applying it on five standard test systems and the outcomes are compared with the latest reported literatures. It is proved from the results that MABC algorithm is more powerful than other algorithms.

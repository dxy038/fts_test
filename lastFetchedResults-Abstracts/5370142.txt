Most approaches to image fusion determine the building of image fusion model based on experience, and the parameter configuration of the fusion model is somewhat arbitrary. In this paper, a novel approach to image fusion based on multi-objective optimization was presented, which could achieve the optimal fusion indices through optimizing the fusion parameters. First the uniform model of image fusion in DWT (discrete wavelet transform) domain was established; then the proper evaluation indices of image fusion were given; and finally the adaptive multi-objective particle swarm optimization (AMOPSO) was introduced to search the optimal fusion parameters. Experiment results show that AMOPSO has a higher convergence speed and better exploratory capabilities than MOPSO, and that the approach to image fusion based on AMOPSO realizes the Pareto optimal image fusion

The Objective of this research, is the study of the effective factors on traffic violations
in Iran. Based on the theoretical analysis of topic, the auto regressive distributed method
has been used. The research result of this method, indicate that impact coefficient of
all variables have been expected based on theoretical and coefficient for all variables
are significant. So that both short run and long run, respectively, the number of driving
without a license and driver’s revenue have significant positive and negative relationship
with traffic violations and in the long run, one percent increase in the number of driving
without a license, increase 0.94 percent of the amount of traffic violations and one
percent increase in driver’s revenue, decrease 0.47 percent of the amount of traffic
violations. Also, the results based on error correction model indicate per period (per
year), about 58/0 short term imbalances to achieve long term balance is adjusted.

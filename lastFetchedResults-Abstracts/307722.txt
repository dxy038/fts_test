Objective:
To identify independent predictors of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activity and examine its relationship with the metabolic syndrome.
Design and methods:
Serum BuChE activity was measured and metabolic syndrome risk factors were assessed in 1097 healthy subjects recruited from the Newfoundland adult population.
Results:
Serum BuChE activity was related to insulin homeostasis and correlated with fasting insulin levels (r = 0.266, P < 0.001) and insulin resistance (HOMA-R) index (r = 0.292, P < 0.001) and was higher in individuals with risk factors for the metabolic syndrome. BuChE activity was higher in males than in females and correlated most strongly with serum triglyceride levels (r = 0.363, P < 0.001) and indicators of abdominal obesity (r = 0.355, P < 0.001). Percent trunk fat (β = 0.185, P < 0.001), triglyceride levels (β = 0.225, P < 0.001), sex (β = −0.202, P = 0.001), glucose (β = 0.209, P < 0.001), insulin (β = 0.360, P = 0.011), HOMA-R (β = −0.319, P = 0.044), and age (β = 0.086, P = 0.002) were independent predictors of BuChE activity.
Conclusions:
These results suggest the involvement of BuChE in the pathophysiological process constituting the metabolic syndrome. Whether increased BuChE activity precedes or follows the development of risk factors is not known.

The objective of the present study is to develop a miniaturized four-sensor conductivity probe, applicable to a wide range of two-phase flows to obtain the time-averaged local two-phase flow parameters of various types of bubbles. Experimental data acquired by the probe are categorized into two groups in view of two-group interfacial area transport: namely spherical/distorted bubbles as Group 1 and cap/Taylor bubbles as Group 2. Benchmark experiment employing the image analysis method is performed. The results from the benchmark experiment assess both the measurement principle and signal processing scheme of the newly developed four-sensor conductivity probe method.

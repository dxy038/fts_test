Objective Our aim was to study the association between
psychotic-like symptoms and inattention/hyperactivity
symptoms in a general adolescent population.
Subjects and methods The sample is based on a population-
based prospective mother–child birth cohort, the
Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986. In the 15–16-year
follow-up survey, the adolescents completed the Youth
Self-Report questionnaire as well as the PROD-Screen
questionnaire that addressed prodromal symptoms of psychosis.
Meanwhile, their parents assessed inattention and
hyperactive symptoms of their offspring by completing
the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and
Normal Behaviors questionnaire (N = 5,318). The crosssectional
associations between psychotic-like symptoms
and inattention/hyperactivity symptoms were studied with
logistic regression models.
Results The association between negative psychotic-like
symptoms and inattention symptoms, especially the
dreamy type of inattention symptoms (e.g., difficulties in
organizing tasks, losing things, being forgetful), was statistically
significant for both genders. Psychotic-like
symptoms, however, were not associated with hyperactivity
symptoms.
Conclusions The present findings demonstrate that an
association between psychotic-like symptoms and attentional
dysfunction, which has been found in clinical samples,
is also present in a general adolescent population

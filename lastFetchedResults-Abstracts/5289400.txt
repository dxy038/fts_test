This paper presents an architecture of an IR-UWB MB-OOK non-coherent transceiver. Channel measurements performed for both LOS and NLOS short-range communications in real indoor environment based on this realized prototype are provided. A comparison between the use of directional and omnidirectional antennas at both emission and reception is presented. Then, an estimation of the data rate of the communicating system is given. Also, an implementation study of an analog CMOS pulse detector is presented. The main objective is to realize the pulse detection function with less complexity design, low power consumption and low mass fabrication cost. Also, it must operates in the 3.1-10.6 GHz UWB band for a multi-band impulse radio receiver. The noise performance of the detector is studied. CADENCEÂ´s spectre simulation results in 0.35 &#956;m CMOS technology are presented to validate this approach. The proposed detector consumes only 2 mW with a &#177;1.8 V supply.

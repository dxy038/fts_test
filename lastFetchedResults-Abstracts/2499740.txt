Background: Recently, there are increasing concerns and interests about the potential effects of Electromagnetic Field (EMF) on both human and animal health.Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the harmful effects of 50 Hz non-ionizing EMF on rat oocytes.Materials and Methods: In this experimental study 30 rats were randomly taken from laboratory animals and their ags and weights were determined. These 3 month's old rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. The control group consisted of 10 rats without receiving any treatment and kept under normal conditions. Experimental group 1 (10 rats) received EMF for 8 weeks (3 weeks intrauterine +5 weeks after births) and experimental group 2 (10 rats) received EMF for 13 weeks (3 weeks intrauterine +10 weeks after birth). After removing the ovaries and isolating follicles, granulosa cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide. Electron microscopy was used to investigate the traumatic effects of EMF on follicles. Results: In control group nucleus membrane and mitochondria in follicleâ€™s cytoplasm seemed normal in appearance. Theca layer of primary follicles in experimental group was separated clearly, zona layer demonstrated trot with irregular thickness and ovarian stroma seemed isolated with dilated vessels showing infiltration.Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that EMF has harmful effects on the ovarian follicles

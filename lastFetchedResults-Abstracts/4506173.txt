The general objective of anomaly detection (AD) in hyperspectral imagery is to detect full-pixel targets. To meet this purpose, the global AD methods can achieve more reliable results than the local methods in terms of time and accuracy. The kernel-based Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) has recently received great attention in the hyperspectral AD applications. This paper presents a global SVDD-based method for autonomous full-pixel AD. The method consists of three steps: clustering, background modeling, and autonomous AD. Experimental results on a hyperspectral dataset show the superiority of the proposed method comparing to the global based SVDD method.

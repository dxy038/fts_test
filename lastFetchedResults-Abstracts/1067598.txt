Preferential flow through soil macropores in tile drained soils can significantly increase the risk of pollution of surface water bodies by agricultural chemicals such as pesticides. While many field studies have shown the importance of preferential flow in tile-drained fields, few have included detailed numerical modelling of the processes involved. The objective of this study was to compare four conceptually different preferential flow and/or transport approaches for their ability to simulate drainage and pesticide leaching to tile drains. The different approaches included an equilibrium approach using modified hydraulic properties near saturation, and three non-equilibrium approaches: a mobile–immobile solute transport model, a dual-porosity approach, and a dual-permeability formulation. They were implemented into the HYDRUS-2D software package. The model predictions were compared against measurements of drainage and pesticide concentrations made at an undulating, tile-drained field in southern Sweden (Näsbygård) during a period of 6 weeks following spray application of the herbicide MCPA.

Based on a new distance, a novel noise-resistant fuzzy clustering algorithm called alternative noise clustering (ANC) algorithm is proposed. ANC is an extension of the noise clustering (NC) algorithm proposed by Dave (1993). By replacing the Euclidean distance used in the objective function of NC algorithm, a new distance (non-Euclidean distance) is introduced in NC algorithm. Based on robust statistical point of view and influence function, the non-Euclidean distance is more robust than the Euclidean distance. So the ANC algorithm is more robust than the NC algorithm. Moreover, with the new distance ANC can deal with noises or outliers better than NC and fuzzy c-means (FCM). The better performance of the proposed algorithm is shown by performing experiments on data sets

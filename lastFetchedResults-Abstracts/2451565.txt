The linear IFMIF prototype accelerator (LIPAc) has been launched within the framework of the Broader Approach Agreement with the objective to validate the low energy part (9 MeV) for the IFMIF linacs (40 MeV, 125 mA of D+ beam in continuous wave). Starting in mid-2007, the project is managed by the two Home Teams (JA-HT and EU-HT) and headed by the Project Team at the Broader Approach site in Rokkasho with the aim to complete the validation activity with the installation and commissioning of the whole LIPAc by June 2017. Following a short description and current status of each accelerator component, this paper describes the integration activities such as the 3D mockup integration and the Interface Management System (IMS) tools developed for use at the Integrated Project Team level. In preparation of the first equipment delivery in Japan at the beginning of 2013, implementation and installation activities of the various components are described, in particular assembly procedures associated with each subsystem.

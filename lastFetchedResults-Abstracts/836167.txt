Method: Method of this study was cross-sectional. From all drivers involved in accidents and were referred to four traffic centers of Ardabil city within second half of 2010 (N=400), 30 participants  were selected with simple random sampling as study group and from drivers who haven’t reported accident, 30 participants  were selected with matching method as comparable group. All participants were individually surveyed by Cattell's 16 factor test (1964) and Arnett's sensation seeking (1993). Results: Results of MANOVA analysis showed that average of shy/bold, self-assured/apprehensive, tolerates disorder/perfectionist, and relaxed/tense subscales is significantly higher in the drivers involved in accidents than drivers who weren’t involved. Also sensation seeking variable is higher in the accident-experienced drivers than others.

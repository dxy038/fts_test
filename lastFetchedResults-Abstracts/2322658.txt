Inroduction & Objective: This study was done with the purpose of recognizing rs2738864 polymorphism in DISC1 gene in schizophrenic patients and comparing it with healthy individuals.
Material and Methods: This survey which was performed on 300 schizophrenic patients and 300 healthy individuals was the first one of its type in Iran in which the patients were chosen through DSM-IV method and questioners were used to collect information. Nested allele specific PCR technic was applied in order to analyze this polymorphism and more than 50 samples were sequenced then the results were aligned with the gene sequences existing in the gene bank so as to confirm the correctness of the study. The final result was afterward statistically analyzed through SNP Analyzer and SPSS ver.22 software.
Results: Finally analyzing the rs2738864 SNP in the Iranian population demonstrated that there is a tight relationship between this polymorphism and the disease; the following results were also obtained: Allele Frequency=0.629 C /0.371 T, p = 0.0000, Chi-square=46.385.
Conclusion: Finally analyzing the rs2738864 SNP in the Iranian population demonstrated that there is a tight relationship between this polymorphism and the disease; the following results were also obtained: Allele Frequency=0.629 C /0.371 T, p = 0.0000, Chi-square=46.385.

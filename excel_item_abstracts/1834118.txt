Cytogenetic study in a case of a human chromophobe renal cell carcinoma revealed a hypodiploid chromosome number of 36 with loss of chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 13, 15, 17, 21, and X. The tumor DNA showed microsatellite instability in dinucleotide repeat microsatellite markers. This is the fourth case that has been fully karyotyped and showed a low chromosome number in a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Our data in the present study are consistent with those in the literature. It is suggested that human chromophobe renal cell carcinoma may possibly be characterized by tumor cells with low chromosome number or microsatellite instability.

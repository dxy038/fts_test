A decision feedback equalizer (DFE) with interpolation, for use with 16 QAM which is an effective technique for achieving high-spectral-efficiency data transmission under frequency-selective fading in land mobile communications, is discussed. To improve the BER of 16 QAM and reduce computation, a bidirectional DFE using interpolation with a diversity combining is proposed. Computer simulation confirms that the proposed method can sufficiently compensate for frequency-selective fading, and needs only half the computation of the conventional DFE

A relative approach degree method of grey relation projection is presented to deal with multiple attribute making in which the attribute weight is unknown and attribute value is hybrid index. firstly, the normalized method of different type indices and the formula of distance for the same type indices are defined, and a objective weights determination model based on hybrid index type is constructed according to the optimization idea that the bigger the relation degree between alternative and positive ideal solution, the better the alternative and the smaller the relation degree between alternative and negative ideal solution, the better the alternative; then, the grey relation projection values of each alternative on the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution and the relative approach degree of each alternative are calculated, respectively, and at last alternatives are ranked by the relative approach degree; at the end of the paper, an application case is given to illustrate the decision making steps of the method, and it shows the validity and superiority of the method by comparing with TOPSIS.

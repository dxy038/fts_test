This paper presents a Multi-objective Artificial
BEE Colony (MOABC) algorithm for the solution of
Economic/Environmental load Dispatch (EED) problem.
The EED problem is a nonlinear constrained multiobjective
optimization problem. Because, the three
competing and non-commensurable fuel cost, system loss
and pollutant emission objectives should be minimized
simultaneously while satisfying certain system
constraints. To cope with different solutions, Pareto
dominance concept is used to generate and sort the
dominated and non-dominated solutions in multiobjective
optimization process. The effectiveness of the
proposed method has been verified on IEEE 6-generator
30-bus test system. The numerical results demonstrate the
great potential of the proposed MOABC approach to
generate well distributed Pareto optimal non-dominated
solutions of multi-objective EED problem. The
comparison with the recently reported results using
NSGA, NPGA, SPEA, MOPSO and MODE methods
reveals the superiority of the proposed MOABC approach
and confirms its capability for the solution of multiobjective
EED problem in the real world power systems.

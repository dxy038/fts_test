Objective:
We compared leukocyte counts obtained by cytometric analysis and Fuchs–Rosenthal (FR) chamber counting in different proportions of lymphocytes (Lym%) suspensions and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Design and methods:
UF-100 (UF) was evaluated. For preparation of cell suspensions, gradient density centrifugation method was used.
Results:
The regression equation for UF and FR chamber counting of the cell suspensions was y = 0.88x + 18.8 WBC/μL (r = 0.832, n = 106). For a few high Lym% samples, markedly underestimated WBC counts were obtained by UF.
Conclusions:
Underestimated WBC count is due not to systematic error but to random error. Counts of the “other” population by UF may be useful for detection of underestimated samples.

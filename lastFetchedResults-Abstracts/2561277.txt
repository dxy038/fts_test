In this paper, simultaneous placement of distributed generation, capacitor bank and protective devices are utilized to improve the efficiency of the distribution network. The objectives of the problem are reduction of active and reactive power losses, improvement of voltage profile and reliability indices and increasing distribution companiesâ€™ profit. The combination of firefly algorithm, particle swarm optimization and analytical hierarchy process is proposed to solve the multi-objective allocation problem. The proposed method is implemented on IEEE 69-bus and also an actual 22-bus distribution systems in Tehran-Iran. Test results approve the effectiveness of the proposed method for improved reliability and network performance of the distribution network.

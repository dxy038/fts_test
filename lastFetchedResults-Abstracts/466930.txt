Objective: Our purpose was to investigate the risk of urinary tract infections in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis. Study Design: In a cross-sectional study, 503 pregnant women were examined for bacterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections from July 1999 through April 2000. Results: Nineteen (13.6%) of 140 women who had bacterial vaginosis had urinary tract infections compared with 24 (6.6%) of 363 women without it. Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for urinary tract infections (odds ratio 2.21, 95% CI 1.16-4.18). Conclusion: Pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis are more likely to have urinary tract infections. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:916-7.)

In this paper, a design and analysis of compact coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed wideband slot antenna is presented. The proposed antenna has simple structure consisting of rectangular slot, triangular feeding structure at the anterior portion of the feed. The overall dimension of the antenna comes around only 21 mmtimes20 mmtimes1.6 mm and fed by 50 Omega coplanar waveguide. The impedance matching and radiation characteristics of the designed structure is investigated by using MoM based commercially available electromagnetic solver IE3D. The simulation results show that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna reaches about 85% with return loss better than -10 dB over the chosen frequency spectrum. The proposed antenna gives bidirectional pattern in the E Plane and omni directional radiation pattern in the H Plane over the frequency range of 4.1 GHz to 10.1 GHz. This antenna configuration would be quite useful for many wireless applications as it is easy for fabrication and integration with RF circuitry.

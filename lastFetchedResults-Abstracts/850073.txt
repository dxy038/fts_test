Objective (s): To estimate the rate of safety belt use and its related factors among the car drivers of Kerman, Iran.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected by observation and were recorded by two researchers in terms of safety belt use.
Results: In all 10,309 drivers were screened. Of these, 5483 derivers (53.19%) used their safety belt. Safety belts were significantly used by women more than men (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between different age groups (p=0.138). The use of safety belts was significantly higher in the city center (P < 0.001) and higher in the morning hours compared to the afternoon (P < 0.001).

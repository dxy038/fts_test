Trends in the automotive control systems are toward more comprehensive and electronic control. The objective of this paper is to study the effectiveness of Internal Model Control PID (IMC-PID) method to develop a traction control system based on engine torque control for an automobile. A plant model is developed based on the governing equations and implemented in MATLAB. This is then captured in a Simulink model and simulated to evaluate performance of the open-loop system for both step and ramp inputs. A proportional-integral (PI)-type controller is then developed using IMC-PID tuning method to improve closed-loop system response. Finally, potential future applications and research opportunities are identified.

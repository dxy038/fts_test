Objective: This ex-post facto research compares neuropsychological aspects of preschoolers with and without neuropsychological/developmental learning disabilities. Method: 20 preschoolers with and without neuropsychological/developmental learning disabilities aging 4 to 6 were recruited utilizing a multiple stage randomized cluster sampling. The instruments included NEPSY, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI), and a checklist consisting of neuropsychological /developmental learning disabilities for preschoolers. Results: The results showed a significant difference between the neuropsychological aspects of children in the two groups. Accordingly, we can suggest that preschoolers with learning disabilities had serious problems with their neuropsychological functions. Conclusion: This study stresses on assessment of neuropsychological and executive functions in preschool children showing learning difficulties.

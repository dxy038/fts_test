Gas cooled quenching and many other applications require high-speed uniform-velocity flows, with minimal pressure drop. The flow ducting geometry is often rather complex, with flow splitting, 90–180° bends, and circular-to-rectangular cross-section transition ducts (the latter are used, for example, between the circular blower duct and the rectangular quenching baskets). Similar situations exist in forced convection furnaces. To provide design guidance in the choice of such ducts, and focusing primarily on circular-to-rectangular transition ducts, the flow was modelled and computed, and the results were successfully validated. Sensitivity of the velocity uniformity and pressure drop with respect to the primary geometric parameters, pressure, and Reynolds numbers was examined in the range (1.3)105 # Re # (7.8)105, with an ultimate objective to produce optimal designs. For a length-to-diameter ratio AL = L/D < 1.0, flow nonuniformity at the exit plane and pressure drop are increased by 33 and 83%, respectively, as the aspect ratio (rectangular duct width-to-height) AR decreases from 4 to 1. Increasing AR beyond 1.5 leads to linearly increasing nonuniformity and pressure drops. A diverging–contracting duct has proven to lead to lesser nonuniformity, while it did not influence the pressure drop. Increasing the inlet pressure from 1 to 20 bar led to a decrease in flow distortion by 11% at the duct exit planes. At atmospheric pressure, increasing the Reynolds number from (1.3)105 to (7.8)105 increased distortion by 8%. Some preliminary design recommendations for circular-to-rectangular duct transitions are to try and keep AL > 1 and AR < 1.5.

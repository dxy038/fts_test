Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of perception of classroom on mathematics self-regulation through the mediation of achievement goals and mathematics self-efficacy. For this reason. 800 eleventh students (400 male, 400 female)
were chosen randomly and completed a questionnaire which consists 7 sub scales. Method: The structural modeling analysis indicated that motivational tasks and mastery evaluation had a direct and significant impact on self-regulation; and autonomy perceived had an indirect impact on self-regulation via mastery goals and self-efficacy. Results: The mastery goals had a direct impact on self-efficacy but the relationship between performance goals and self-efficacy was not significant. The mastery goals had a direct impact on self- regulation. In general, the results indicated the direct and indirect impact of perception of
classroom (through mediation of goals achievement and self-efficacy) on self-regulation.

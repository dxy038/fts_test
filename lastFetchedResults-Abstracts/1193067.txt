There are some important questions in Land use change literature, for instance "How much land to allocate to each of a number of land use type in order to maximization of (household or individual) rent -paying ability, minimization of environmental impacts or maximization of population income". In this paper, we want to investigate them and propose mathematical models to find an answer for these questions. Since Most of the parameters in this process are linguistics and fuzzy logic is a powerful tools to handle them, a fuzzy linear programming model is used in model building. To this end, Fuzzy Linear Programming Problem(FLP) with fuzzy related system of constraint and fuzzy coefficient vector in the objective function, that is a full fuzzy system of simultaneous equations with fuzzy objective function is discussed. The related production operations in the objective function and in the constrains are performed in the basis of standard production between fuzzy numbers. The constraint which can be take into account depend on the case but representative objective include: Lower and upper limits on land use, availability of Labour and so on.

The objective of this prospective study was to determine the association between presence of abnormal radiographic findings attributed to orthopedic disorders of development (ARF) with subsequent performance among yearlings in Texas. The study population was 348 yearlings offered for sale at the Texas Summer Yearling Sale during 2002 and 2003 for which presale radiographs of limbs were available for review. Radiographs of yearlings were reviewed and presence of ARF were recorded. Additionally, the following data were recorded for each horse: identifiers [name of dam, name of sire, hip number, and name (when available)], year of sale, state of birth, and sales price. Subsequent performance data were obtained for each horse at the conclusion of their 2nd and 3rd years of life. Results indicated that no ARF was significantly associated with performance outcomes. Lesions of the proximal dorsal aspect of the sagittal ridge of the 3rd metacarpus/metatarsus resulted in significantly lower sales prices than either horses without this ARF or horses without any ARF. In conclusion, multiple radiographic abnormalities of Thoroughbred yearlings were not associated with reduced performance during the first 2 years of the racing careers of horses studied. Presence of some abnormalities, however, may be associated with reduced sales price.

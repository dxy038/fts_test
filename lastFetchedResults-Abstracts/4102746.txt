The aim of this paper is to quantify the interest of using hardware field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to implement complex control algorithms. As a benchmark, authors have chosen a sensorless speed controller for a synchronous motor. The estimation of the rotor position and speed is achieved using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), eliminating the need of their corresponding mechanical sensors. Due to the EKF complexity, such sensorless controller is systematically implemented in a software digital signal processor (DSP) device. The execution time is frequently evaluated to several tens or hundreds of microseconds. The motivation here is to prove that, when exploiting the treatment fastness of FPGAs (less than 6 &#956;s ), it is possible to enhance the control bandwidth. To reach this objective, a comparison between the developed FPGA-based sensorless speed controller and its DSP-based counterpart is made. The same sensorless controller (with the same complexity) has been implemented in both cases. To prop up this comparison, simulation, hardware-in-the-loop, and experimental tests are presented.

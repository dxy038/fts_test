The weighting model is to evaluate the importance of each attribute to further obtain a reliable priority or make a reasonable decision. However, owing to the increasing complexity of real-world conditions, the uncertainty of evaluation also increases. Therefore, this paper proposes an objective weighting model which takes the weighting model based on the maximum deviation with precise number as the main structure, integrating the operations of interval number and interval number distance function into it to deal with the uncertain information. An illustrative example of hospital maintenance quality audit is adopted to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model is efficient and robust, and quite good for real-world applications.

The main objective of this paper is to present a Territorial System of Sustainable Mobility developed by the Pole for Sustainable Mobility (POMOS) and its partners, in the framework of a regional R&amp;D project. This project, named "Bonifica 2.0", aims at the touristic exploitation of the Pontine territory, a large naturalistic area in the region of Lazio in Italy, configuring mixed routes (waterways, channels and bicycle/pedestrian paths) out of the road network paths and expanding the concept of land sustainable mobility to waterways and coastal lakes that characterize all the Pontine area. The goal is the restoration of historical, archaeological and natural zones in an innovative way and with the use of new technologies and environmentally sustainable means of transportation. A mobility system integrated with the mainland has been studied and will be implemented. The system will allow to manage the fleet and the infrastructures assuring safe routes and the exploitation of historical / cultural sites. Moreover the system will be used as best practice of an Integrated Territorial System of Sustainable Mobility under development in Europe and to be used as a reference case to be proposed and reproduced to other similar areas in the world. The system and its main components are described in this paper illustrating what has been achieved till now.

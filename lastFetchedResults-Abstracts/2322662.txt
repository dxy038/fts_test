Inroduction & Objective: Natural products have fewer side effects than synthetic drugs and their preparation is much easier. Brittle sea stars contain ingredients such as saponins, naphtoquinone. This materials are active in inflammatory conditions. In this study the effects of methanol extract of Brittle Stars was evaluated.
Material and Methods: The anti-inflammatory activity of methanol extract of Brittle star was assessment by denaturation of albumin, erythrocyte membrane stabilization and inhibition of proteinase activity assays. As standard anti-inflammatory drug aspirin was used. Brittle stars extract in concentrations 100, 200, 300, 400 Âµg / ml was prepared. Data was obtained analyzed using SPSS statistical T test at in significant level of the P < 0.05
Results: The results exhibited that total methanol extract of Persian Gulf Brittle star has anti-inflammatory effects so that suppressed denaturation of albumin at a concentration of 300ug/ml. also it caused cell membrane stability of red blood cells and avoided the proteinase activity at a concentration of 400ug/ml and concentration of 400 ug/ml, respectively.
Conclusion: The results showed that the brittle stars have anti-inflammatory effects , thus this marine natural product can consider as a suitable candidate for more study in common inflammatory diseases.

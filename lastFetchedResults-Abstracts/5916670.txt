Engineering problems are dealing with conflict objectives. The problem is multi-objective optimization. The solutions of this problem are solution set. The methods use to solve this problem base on genetic algorithm, GA. The methods generate the solutions first and choose later. After studying multiobjective GA method, it is obvious that this method did not give even Pareto solution set, so the designer hardly decides to choose it. The purposes of the research are to improve distribution of the solution set with using even Pareto filter and to propose the method that be measures distribution of Pareto solution set, with using distribution evenness factor. The results of this research bring to be better even Pareto solution set and the method uses to measure distribution evenness factor that is one way to present distribution of Pareto solution set.

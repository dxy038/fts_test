This study proposed different techniques of mental rehabilitation to healthy elderly subjects in order to assess the results in terms of subjectively perceived changes in quality of life. Thirty-two elderly subjects (60–76 years) were assigned to one of the four groups: aerobic training, mental training, combined aerobic and mental training and a control group. Before and after 2 months of training, all subjects took two memory tests. After training, a French validated questionnaire of quality of life was administered individually. Memory parameters such as logical memory (P&lt;0.05), paired associated learning (P=0.05) and memory quotient (P=0.01) were enhanced in all groups except the control group, but in terms of quality of life all the elderly subjects were dissatisfied. V̇O2max and ventilatory threshold were significantly improved in the two groups who were engaged in a physical training program (AT and AMT) and these improvements were associated with a better quality of life in the domain of functional life. Association of the two techniques did not enhance the results for cognitive function. In conclusion, despite objective improvement in cognitive function, all subjects reported dissatisfaction in terms of improvement in quality of life, whatever their assigned group. Nevertheless, an improvement in quality of life was acknowledged after aerobic training for the physical component of functional life.

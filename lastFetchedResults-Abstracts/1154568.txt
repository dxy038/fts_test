This paper outlines the development of an optimization strategy to determine the optimum cutting parameters for multi-tool milling operations like face milling, corner milling, pocket milling and slot milling. The developed strategy based on the maximum profit rate criterion and incorporates five technological constraints. In this paper, optimization procedures based on the genetic algorithm, hill climbing algorithm and memetic algorithm were demonstrated for the optimization of machining parameters for milling operation. This paper describes development and utilization of an optimization system, which determines optimum machining parameters for milling operations. An objective function based on maximum profit in milling operation has been developed. Results obtained are used in NC machine. An example has been presented at the end of the paper to give clear picture from the application of the system and its efficiency. The results are compared and analyzed with method of feasible directions and handbook recommendations.

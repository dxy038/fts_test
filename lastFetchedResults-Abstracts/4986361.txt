This paper proposes an optimal design of a hybrid system for the mitigation of wind-induced vibration in high-rise buildings. Even if effective control performance can be achieved by the hybrid system which applies simultaneously both active and passive control devices, its design is extremely complicated due to the increase of the design variables. This paper considers a hybrid system composed of hybrid mass damper and viscous dampers. The corresponding design variables are the mass, tuning ratio, damping ratio, damper locations and capacity of the dampers. Since the minimization of cost factors is also a matter of utmost importance, the required control efforts and dynamic responses of the target structure are selected as objective functions to be minimized. Therefore, the problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem involving the design of two different types of systems. The validity of the proposed optimization technique is verified through a wind-excited 20-story building with hybrid control system and comparative results with non-hybrid design approach are presented.

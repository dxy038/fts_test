Background: Epidemiologic studies have reported that moderate alcohol consumption is inversely associated with the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but sex-specific results are inconsistent. The present study examines the association between alcohol intake and the risk of RCC among men and women. Methods: Mailed questionnaires were completed by 1138 newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed RCC cases and 5039 population controls between 1994 and 1997 in eight Canadian provinces. A food frequency questionnaire provided data on eating habits and alcohol consumption 2 years before data collection. Other information included socio-economic status, lifestyle habits, alcohol use, and diet. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived through unconditional logistic regression. Results: Total alcohol intake was inversely associated with RCC in men and in women; the OR for the highest intake group (≥22.3 g/day among men and ≥7.9 g/day among women) versus the non-drinkers was 0.7 (95% CI, 0.5–0.9) for both sexes. Analysis of menopausal status produced ORs for the highest intake group versus the non-drinkers of 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7–2.1) among premenopausal women and 0.6 (95% CI, 0.4–0.9) among postmenopausal women. Smoking and obesity were not important effect modifiers. Conclusion: Moderate alcohol consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of RCC in men and in women (mainly postmenopausal women).

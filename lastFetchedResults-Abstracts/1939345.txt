Inroduction & Objective: Today, consume of alcohol is social problems and as well as causing various diseases and abnormalities in physiological disorders in the human body, especially the liver. In this study has tried to, the effect of Lactuca sativa leaf on serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT) and albumin, total protein and liver tissue, followed by alcohol, were investigated.
Material and Methods: In this study, in order to induce liver damage, ethanol was used. 48 adult male Wistar rats weighing 190 Â± 10 g were randomly divided into 6 groups of 8 and with doses of 20%, 40% and 60% of Lactuca sativa and ethanol (30%) were treated. Daily dose of 2 mL of ethanol orally and Lactuca sativa combination with diet was administered daily for 28 days. After blood sampling and separation of serum, the activity level of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT) and albumin and total protein in serum were measured and in histopathological studies of liver tissue sections were prepared.
Results: Changes in body weight and liver levels in the groups receiving ethanol and Lactuca sativa are not significant compared to the control group. Reducing the level of enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT) and increased total protein and albumin in the group receiving Lactuca sativa compared to the group treated with ethanol alone, in the statistics level p ? 0.05 was significant. Histological studies showed that group treated with ethanol, there were large areas devoid of hepatocytes. Improvement was observed in the group receiving Lactuca sativa. Conclusion: Lactuca sativa consumption at a dose of 60% due to higher phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, cause of protect liver cells is against oxidative stress induced by ethanol , as a result, the level of liver enzymes and biochemical parameters returned to normal and liver tissue damage is minimized.

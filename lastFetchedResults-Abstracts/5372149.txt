As active safety system features are being introduced to the passenger vehicle market segment, there is an immediate need to develop a standardized testing protocol and scoring mechanism which enables an objective comparison of similar active safety system performance as implemented across various vehicle platforms. It is desirable that this standard is adopted by the entire automotive industry to further advance active safety technologies. This paper describes a proposal for the establishment of such a standard to evaluate and compare the performance of Crash Imminent Braking (CIB) systems. The operation of CIB system is described as a three-state state machine. A standardized scoring matrix is proposed to assess the performance of the system in each state. This standard ensures that every CIB system operates in one and only one state of the state machine at any given time. Subjective and arguable test scenarios are avoided as much as possible in this standard. The proposed scoring system is implemented based on track testing data in the evaluation of a 2011 model year passenger vehicle equipped with a CIB system.

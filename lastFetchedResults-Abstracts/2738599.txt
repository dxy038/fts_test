An occlusion-adaptive bidirectional motion compensation method using pixel-based motion vectors that reduces ghost artefacts due to occlusion is proposed. The proposed method constructs each pixel in the intermediated frame as a weighted average of its motion-compensated pixel candidates. The weighting factor for each pixel candidate is determined adaptively by utilising a temporal motion consistency metric. Moreover, a local support window mechanism is presented in bidirectional interpolation to enhance the intensity transition smoothness among neighbouring pixels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of the interpolated frames without annoying visual artefacts.

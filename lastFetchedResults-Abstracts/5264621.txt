This paper describes quality improvement methods based on multivariate data analysis and their application to an industrial steel process. The PCA-LDA, which combines principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis, is used for influential factor analysis of the qualitative quality variables. In addition, Data-Driven Quality Improvement (DDQI) is used to determine the optimal operating condition that can achieve the desired product quality under a given objective function and various constraints. The PCA-LDA and the DDQI can provide useful information to improve product quality. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

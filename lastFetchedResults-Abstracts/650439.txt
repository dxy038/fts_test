A combined chemical and biological treatment scheme was evaluated in this study aiming at obtaining the simultaneous removal of metalloid arsenic and cationic heavy metals from contaminated soils. The treatment involved the use of the iron reducing microorganism Desulfuromonas palmitatis, whose activity was combined with the chelating strength of EDTA. Taking into consideration that soil iron oxides are the main scavengers of As, treatment with iron reducing microorganisms aimed at inducing the reductive dissolution of soil oxides and thus obtaining the release of the retained As. The main objective of using EDTA was the removal of metal contaminants, such as Pb and Zn, through the formation of soluble metal chelates. Experimental results however indicated that EDTA was also indispensable for the biological reduction of Fe(III) oxides. The bacterial activity was found to have a pronounced positive effect on the removal of arsenic, which increased from the value of 35% obtained during the pure chemical treatment up to 90% in the presence of D. palmitatis. In the case of Pb, the major part, i.e. approximately 85%, was removed from soil with purely chemical mechanisms, whereas the biological activity slightly improved the extraction, increasing the final removal up to 90%. Co-treatment had negative effect only for Zn, whose removal was reduced from 80% under abiotic condition to approximately 50% in the presence of bacteria.

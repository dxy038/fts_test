Objective A number of studies have looked at the prevalence
rates of psychiatric disorders in the community in
Pakistan over the last two decades. However, a very little
information is available on psychiatric morbidity in primary
health care. We therefore decided to measure prevalence of
psychiatric disorders and their correlates among women
from primary health care facilities in Lahore.
Methods We interviewed 650 women in primary health
care settings in Lahore. We used a semi-structured interview
and questionnaires to collect information during faceto-
face interviews.
Results Nearly two-third of the women (64.3%) in our
study were diagnosed to have a psychiatric problem, while
one-third (30.4%) suffered with Major Depressive Disorder.
Stressful life events, verbal violence and battering
were positively correlated with psychiatric morbidity and
social support, using reasoning to resolve conflicts and
education were negatively correlated with psychiatric
morbidity.
Conclusion The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is in
line with the prevalence figures found in community
studies. Domestic violence is an important correlate which
can be the focus of interventions

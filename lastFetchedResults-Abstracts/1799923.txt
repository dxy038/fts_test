Background and aim: Spine deformity detection, initial evaluation (screening) and also identify the factors affecting that, especially in children and adolescents is very important and can play an important role in prevent musculoskeletal disorders. Matthias arm raising test is a method of visual assessment of posture. The main objective of this study was investigating the relationship between quantitative score of Matthias test (hand, scapula and abdomen) and angle of thoracic and lumbar curvatures in 8-13 years old students. Materials and methods: Sixty 8-13 aged male student from elementary schools of Varamin were selected and predicated in current study. Matthiass test was recorded using digital camera and their compensatory movements of hand, scapula and abdomen were analyzed by computer. Angle of thoracic and lumbar curvatures was measured by using flexible ruler. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for analyzing the measured data. Results: The results of study showed that there were only significant correlation between angle of thoracic and lumbar curvatures and total score of Matthiass Test (r= 0.73, p <  0.05 and r= 0.56, p <  0.05 respectively). There were no relationships between components of Matthiass test and angle of thoracic and lumbar curvatures (p  >  0.05). Conclusion: Based on results of current study, it suggests to assessing and screening of spine posture of schoolchildren by using of Matthiass test the total score of it applied.

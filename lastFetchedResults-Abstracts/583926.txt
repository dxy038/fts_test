Objective: To evaluate the possible interaction between religious
beliefs and psychiatric disorders among Black Americans.
Methods: In this study, we used data of 5181 adult Black
Americans who had participated in National Survey of American
Life (NSAL) from February 2001 to June 2003. Variables such as
socio-demographics, religious beliefs, and psychiatric disorders
were entered in a Cox regression to determine the possible
interaction between psychiatric disorders (0, 1, ?2) and the
subjective religiosity on age of onset of suicidal thought among
the participants. Main outcome was age of the first serious suicidal
ideation.
Results: A dose-dependent effect of number of psychiatric
disorders on suicidal ideation was observed. Psychiatric disorders
had a higher impact on age of suicidal ideation among those with
low self-reported religiosity.
Conclusion: Religious beliefs may buffer the effect of psychiatric
disorders on suicidal thought. Blacks who are less religious and
suffer psychiatric disorders are at the highest risk for early suicidal
ideation.

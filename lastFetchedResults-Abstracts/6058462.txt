Wireless mesh networks with multi-channel multi- radio availability are attracting more and more attention from the research community because of its performance improvement and relative low complexity. In this paper, we address the channel assignment problem for multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks. We focus on heterogeneous static wireless mesh networks where multiple non-overlapping channels are available for each wireless radio. Our objective is to find the optimal channel assignment which maximizes the number of bidirectional links that can be activated simultaneously, subject to the interference constraints. We present an applied integer linear programming model for solving the fixed channel assignment problem with multiple radios. We then use this model to study the impact of channel and radio constrains.

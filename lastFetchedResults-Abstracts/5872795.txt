A hybrid greedy algorithm integrated with ant colony optimization is proposed to solve the car sequencing problem. The objective is to determine a vehicle sequence that minimizes the violations of sequencing rules on a mixed-model assembly line. Pheromone and heuristic information are used together to choose the car to be added to the end of the partial sequence. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

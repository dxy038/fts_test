Multifunctional grid-tied inverters (MFGTIs) have been paid much attention to handle the commonly concerned power quality issues of the microgrids. An MFGTI can not only interface the renewable energy resource into the utility grid, but also can compensate the harmonic and reactive current in the microgrid as an auxiliary service. However, the apparent capacity of an MFGTI for power quality compensation is limited. Therefore, how to enhance the power quality of the microgrid by optimal utilization of the limited and valuable capacity becomes a technical challenge. In this paper, two optimal control objectives of MFGTIs are presented based on a comprehensive power quality evaluation algorithm by means of analytic hierarchy process theory. One objective aims to obtain the expected power quality using minimal apparent capacity of the MFGTI. Another objective focuses on enhancing the power quality as well as possible in the given available apparent capacity condition. The two proposed strategies are compared in performance, and the paper also discusses how to use them in practice for the best performance. Experimental results performed on a microgrid in the laboratory confirm the validation and feasibility of the proposed optimal control strategies.

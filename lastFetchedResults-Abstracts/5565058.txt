Summary form only given. In December 1994, AT&amp;T, Bellcore, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, and Pacific Telesis formed the Multiwavelength Optical Networking (MONET) Consortium, which is partially supported by ARPA and has the participation of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The objective of the MONET program is to advance, demonstrate, and integrate network architecture, advanced technology, network management, and business drivers to achieve high-capacity, high-performance, cost-effective, reliable multiwavelength optical networking over a national (or global) scale to serve both commercial and government applications. This talk presents the MONET vision and summarizes the current status of the program.

In order for the design and analysis processes to benefit from high fidelity CFD simulations, a CFD user must be able to improve the throughput dramatically to produce data in a timely and cost-effectively manner. Unfortunately, many users, especially those casual or novice CFD users, are frustrated with the difficulties in setting up correct input files for CFD solvers and further hampered by the complexity of using the Linux-dominated HPC systems, as many of them are mostly familiar with the WINDOWS operating system. Therefore, the main objective of CaseMan is to develop an intuitive user environment that allows the user to prepare, submit, monitor, and manage large numbers of CFD simulation jobs for parametric studies. It is designed to hide the complexity of using CFD tools and computer clusters from casual users while improving productivity for expert users. CaseMan takes advantage of a revised version of an existing code called ISE by reusing some of its codebase

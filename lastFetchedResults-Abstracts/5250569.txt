The authors address visual interface and virtual manipulation for full text management. Their objective is to investigate the retrieval/reference mechanism of computer-readable full texts as if paper-form books were being manipulated directly in the real world. This mechanism is derived basically from the object-linking facility of hypersystems. Of course, the facility must be applicable to the manipulation of a great deal of electronic-formed books, like the traditional information retrieval systems, through hypersystems are suitable to only private filing applications

Background & Objective: Bone densitometry is an appropriate method for the evaluation of the
patients' skeletal status. This study was done to determine, the relationship between MI (Mental
Index) of mandibular bone in panoramic radiography and skeletal status in femoral neck and
lumbar vertebrae (L2-L4) in women referring to the radiology department.
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional descriptive study, the panoramic radiographs of 67
healthy women over 35 years old referring to radiology department Mashhad, Iran during 2004,
were assessed and their Mis recorded, All of the patients were then referred to Toos Bone
Densitometry Center, for bone densitometry in left femoral neck and lumbar vertebrae (L2-L4),
using DEXA technique with Osteocore apparatus. The patients were divided into three categories
of normal, osteopenic and osteoporotic in each skeletal region according to their T-score. The
data were analyzed using ANOYA and Pearson's correlation coefficient.
Results: The mean of Mental Index between normal and osteopcnic subgroups of skeletal status
in femoral neck showed a significant difference (P=0.042). The mean of Mental Index between
normal and osteoporotic and osteopenic and osteoporotic subgroups of skeletal status in lumbar
spine rcgion showed a significant differences (P=0.02 & 0.05, respectively). The Mental Index
was significantly related to T-scores in femoral neck and L2-L4 regions (r = 0.33 & 0.32.
respectively, P<O.O I).
Conclusion: This study showed that using Mental Index of mandibular bone can be useful for
estimating skeletal status of patients but is not enough for precise evaluation of skeletal status of
patients.

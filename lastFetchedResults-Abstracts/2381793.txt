Cantaloupe is a common crop and relatively important in Iran which show high genetic diversity. The objective of this study was the investigation of interrelationships among different traits in Iranian cantaloupe cultivars and comparison of different cantaloupe genotypes based on different traits using biplot method. Forty nine genotypes including seven Iranian endemic cantaloupes Rishbaba, Shahabadi, Samsori, Dastjerdi, Magasi, Tiltorogh and Savei and their direct and reciprocal crosses were evaluated during two years using triple lattice design. Results indicated the positive and significant correlations between yield and yield components in both of years. Three traits including fruit weight, flesh thickness and fruit width indicated positive and significant correlation with yield among of traits. The ranks of the genotypes relative to yield were indicated the differences between genotypes in two years. The genotypes ranks according to total soluble solids and early maturity indicated that Magasi × Savei (G57) cross and Dastjerdi (G4) parent were the most superior genotype in two years; so Magasi × Savei (G44) cross and Dastjerdi (G4) parent can be considered for the production of cultivars with high sugar and early mature cultivars, respectively. Results also showed that the yield were independent from total soluble solids and early maturity so in cantaloupe breeding programs we can individually modified yield trait in breeding projects. The two traits, total soluble solids and early maturity had the negative correlation with each other; so these traits could be considered simultaneously for breeding.

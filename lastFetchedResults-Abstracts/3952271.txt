This paper presents a modified C-dump converter for brushless DC (BLDC) machine used in the flywheel energy storage system. The converter can realize the energy bidirectional flowing and has the capability to recover the energy extracted from the turnoff phase of the BLDC machine. The principle of operation, modeling, and control strategy of the system has been investigated in the paper. Simulation and experimental results of the proposed system are also presented and discussed.

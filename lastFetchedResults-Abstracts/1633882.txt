Chondrocytes in situ experience fluctuations in extracellular osmolarity resulting from mechanical loading. The objective of this study was to determine whether hyperosmotic stress causes or exacerbates interleukin-1 (IL-1)-mediated effects in bovine articular cartilage. Disks of cartilage cut from the articular surface of calf radiocarpal joints were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of IL-1 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium adjusted to various osmolalities with sucrose or NaCl. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 levels in the cartilage were examined by Western blot. Culture media were assayed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitrite as an indicator of nitric oxide (NO) production, and sulfated glycosaminoglycan as an indicator of proteoglycan degradation. We report the osmolality-dependent potentiation of COX-2 and PGE2 production, and the osmolality-dependent inhibition of NO production and proteoglycan degradation in IL-1-activated cartilage. The data demonstrate that osmotic and cytokine signaling interact to differentially modulate IL-1-stimulated effects in calf articular cartilage.

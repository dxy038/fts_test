Background: MS is a disease of the central nervous system affecting all economic, financial, social, and emotional aspects of individual, family, and community. Performing continuous care leads to chronic stress in caregivers of patients and this in turn threatens their self-efficacy and quality of life.
Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on self-efficacy and quality of life in caregivers of patients with multiple sclerosis.
Methods: This was a controlled clinical trial in which 70 family caregivers of MS patients were investigated. The study population was divided into two age- and sex-matched case and control groups. Progressive muscle relaxation techniques were employed for the case group for three months (90 sessions) and its application was followed using a self-report checklist. After three months, self-efficacy and quality of life questionnaires were re-filled by members of both groups. Data were analyzed using descriptive and presumption statistical tests while a p?0.05 was considered as significant.
Findings: Paired t-test showed a significant difference in self efficacy and quality of life for family caregivers of case group three months after intervention (p=0.001). On the contrary, no significant difference regarding the efficacy and quality of life in family caregivers of MS patients in control group was found (P?0.05).
Conclusion: Several interventions such as progressive muscle relaxation program with low cost, good safety and effect can help reduce the stress of family caregivers of patients in particular those with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis and thus leading to an increase in their self-efficacy, care quality, and quality of life.

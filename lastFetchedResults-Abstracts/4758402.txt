The paper presents the China Digital Cordless Telecommunications (CDCT) system and its characteristics. We analyze its queuing model and focus on discussing the call setup time and the data distribution time. The key point related with the CDCT network performance is the time require for database inquiry and updating. The connection setup strategy of the air interface and the means of transmission between the global network center and the local network center are the factors related to the network performance. The objective of the CDCT project is to set up a field trial PCN that provides calling, location registration, handoff, and roaming functions that confirm to the ETSI DECT standard

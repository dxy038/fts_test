The objective of the work was to make a simple wireless one channel limited (3-lead) home electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission system for home and ambulance use. The wireless ECG monitoring system significantly improves the quality of life of the cardiac patients, reflected primarily in the permanent monitoring. In case of an accident, an immediate alarm is being transmitted to the physician. A long-term monitoring facilitates the capturing of sporadic events and therefore is an important contribution for the improvement of the therapy and, consequently, for the health of the patients. The task has been accomplished by Bluetooth technology, ECG detector and personal computer as monitor.

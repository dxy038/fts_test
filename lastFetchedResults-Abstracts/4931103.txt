This paper shows how a class of objective functions can be incorporated into a prioritised, multiobjective optimisation problem, for which a solution can be obtained by solving a sequence of single-objective, constrained, convex programming problems. The objective functions considered in this paper typically arise in model predictive control (MPC) of constrained, linear systems. The framework presented in this paper can be used to design a flexible, multiobjective MPC controller that takes priorities into account during the online computation of the control input.

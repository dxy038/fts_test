Control theory is introduced to the scientific research quality monitoring system in universities. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of scientific research quality control system and the variable qualities of scientific research quality objective, we explore the components of system, the function of various links and its operating mechanism, and constitute the scientific research quality control system which combined the open-loop feedforward control with the closed-loop feedback control. According to the management practice of scientific research, we describe the mathematical model expressed the relation of information transmission between various links from the perspective of qualitative analysis.

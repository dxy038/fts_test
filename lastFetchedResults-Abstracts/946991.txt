Objective: To compare “Early Maladaptive Schemas” and their parental origins in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and non-clinical sample. Method: The present research is a post-hoc (causal-comparative) cross-sectional study that was carried out on a sample of 45 subjects (including 15 patients with OCD and 15 patients with OCPD and 15 non-clinical individuals) who were selected using convenience sampling. The subjects were assessed using Young Maladaptive Schema Questionnaire and Young Parenting Inventory. Data were analyzed using MANOVA and descriptive statistics. Results: The study demonstrated significant differences among OCD and the non-clinical sample in all schemas. The group with OCPD had significant differences with the non-clinical group in most schemas except for dedication, defeat and emotional deprivation. The two clinical groups (OCD and OCPD) had significant difference only in emotional deprivation. In parental origins, the difference between OCD and non-clinical groups was higher than that of the OCPD and non-clinical groups. The two clinical groups were also different based on emotional deprivation, handicap/shame, neglect/instability and suspicion/bad behavior in parental origins. Conclusion: In total, results showed significant difference among clinical groups and the non-clinical sample in early maladaptive schemas. The results of the current study also suggest that the two clinical groups are similar in deep cognitive constructs. Therefore, the current study supports relationship between these disorders (OCD and OCPD).

The rotor of the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is fed back from the grid via back-to-back converters. Under the disturbance, the rotor current increases to maintain the terminal voltage and the rotor rotating speed of DFIG, while the current in the grid side converter also increases to keep the DC-Link voltage constant. In this situation, the overshoots of the currents flowing through the converters stress the operation condition of the back-to-back converters, even destroy the converters. The controllers of the back-to-back converters have significant impact on the dynamics of the rotor current. In this paper, the parameters of back-to-back converter controller are tuned with the objective of reducing the maximum value of the currents using particle swarm optimization. Using the parameters optimized, the overshoot of the currents can be decreased.

The digital medical image has its own particularity, in order to diagnose correctly disease, the medical image need be enhanced. According to the features of the digital medical image, the methods based on Gradient smooth and Context smooth are put forward to. The image is smoothed with the smooth function composed by gradient and context in this method. The theory of "Gradient smooth and Context smooth" is used to enhance the image and the enhanced images are operated twice by transformed space stretching. The experiment and the subjective and objective analysis show that the general effect of enhancing the digital medical image by the method in this thesis is superior to histogram equalization, homomorphic filtering and multi-scale Retinex method.

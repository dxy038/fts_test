An experimental system for public demonstration of speech and data transmission in a digital mobile environment is described. The speech link incorporates multipulse coding at 10 kb/s and Reed-Solomon channel coding of 3 kb/s for a total of 13 kb/s per channel. The data codec uses a packet assembler/disassembler to convert from a radio data-link-layer protocol to a 9.6-kb/s asynchronous communication protocol. The data stream is protected by a (56,39) Reed-Solomon code and by the automatic repeat request of the data-link-layer protocol. Speech and data are carried on independent 16-kb/s streams multiplexed into a 48-kb/s TDMA channel. Subjective and objective performance results reported for a variety of transmission experiments verify that good-quality speech transmission and high-throughput data transmission with excellent integrity are achievable over a channel characterized by a 14-dB carrier-to-interference ratio

This paper presents a methodology to design the flatness-based controller (FBC) for a nonlinear half-car hydraulic active suspension system. Vehicle dynamics is provided by using handling the trade-off of the ride comfort and safety. For this purpose, considered output variables are vertical acceleration and displacement of the car and vertical displacements of front and rear wheel. The main objective is to design a differential FBC which can isolate car body from the vibrations due to road disturbances acting and provide efficient control under model uncertainty. Extensive simulations are performed for different road profiles and different values of suspension parameters. The obtained results show that the proposed controller performed well in improving the ride comfort and road handling for the half-car model with a hydraulically actuated suspension system.

The objective of this research was to determinate genotype x environment (GE) interaction and also to determine stable faba bean (Vicia faba L.) cultivar(s) for grain yield in Turkey. The study was carried out during two years at six different locations around South Anatolian Region. According to stability analysis results, cultivar 1 (Eresen, 87) was the most stable for grain yield. Among the cultivars, the highest grain yield was obtained from cultivar Eresen 87 (3.21 t ha-1) across environments. This genotype had regression coefficient (bj =1) around unity and deviations from regression values (g =0) around zero. This suggested that both these attributes were responsive to changing environments and could be recommended for favorable environments. Â© 2010 Friends Science Publishers

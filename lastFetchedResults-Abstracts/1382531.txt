This paper presents the Eulerâ€“Newton formulation of oscillatory behaviour of multi-body systems interconnected by spring elements with three orthoganal stiffnesses and dampers and introduces the application of a genetic algorithm (GA) as an optimization tool to the problem of vibration synthesis. The state variables of the problem space are the mounting parameters such as two end positions, stiffnesses and angular orientation. It is demonstrated in the paper that in optimizing the vibratory characteristics of a system, the redundancy of variables does not cause a serious problem for the genetic algorithm. Furthermore, due to its flexibility, the algorithm imposes little restriction in the selection of the objective function.

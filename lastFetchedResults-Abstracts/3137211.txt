An optimization algorithm is presented for geometric nonlinear analysis of the rigid frame. The principal character of the optimization algorithm is that the equilibrium state with large deformation is chosen as the study object. The endpoint coordinates are given by means of coordinate recursion formulae. The objective function is defined, and the dynamic design variable is unknown endpoint coordinates of slight segments. The optimization problem is established for large deformation analysis of the rigid frame, and the optimization program is programmed. Typical examples are calculated by optimization algorithm, and the results are in very good agreement with those by existing methods, which provides a new and effective idea for geometric nonlinear analysis of the rigid frame.

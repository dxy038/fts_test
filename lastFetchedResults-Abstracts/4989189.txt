The objective of this paper is to identify several vehicle lateral and vertical dynamics parameters, including the horizontal center of gravity (CG) position and the CG height that has a major role in rollover. Least Squares and Kalman Filtering techniques are employed in order to propose a novel identification algorithm that is robust against speed variations, hence it can be coupled with a rollover controller effectively while identification is in progress. Extensive simulations are carried out in order to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

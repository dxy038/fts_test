This paper proposes a portable wound area measurement method based on the segmentation of digital images. Its objective is to provide a practical, fast and non-invasive technique for medical staff to monitor the healing process of chronic wounds. Segmentation is based on active contour models which identifies the wound border irrespective of coloration and shape. The initial segmentation can also be modified by the user, providing higher control and accuracy. Area measurements are further normalized to remove effects of camera distance and angle. The application has been implemented for the Android platform version 2.2 with a prototype model running on Samsung Galaxy Tab. The results to evaluate the efficacy of the application have been encouraging with an accuracy level of 90%.

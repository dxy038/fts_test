This paper deals with water flow in a backward-facing step with blowing of different nanofluids. The
objective is to evaluate the effect of nanofluid blowing on the heat transfer rate. For this purpose, the
Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase model is employed. The accuracy of the current simulations is demonstrated
by comparing the obtained results with those of open literature. The results show that increasing the
nanofluid blowing as well as nanoparticles fraction therein improves heat exchange from different
surfaces of the channel. Comparing the results of different nanofluids leads one to conclude that the
bottom wall heat transfer attains its maximum value when the blowed nanofluid contains nanoparticles
with the highest thermal conductivity. However, it is found that maximum heat transfer in the top wall is
achieved during blowing of a nanofluid with the highest nanoparticle penetration into the channel flow.
Moreover, it is observed that discrepancies appearing between the results of different nanofluids become
more remarkable as one increases the nanofluid blowing or nanoparticles fraction therein. Finally, the
Eulerian-Eulerian model demonstrates that among the interphase forces, the effects of the virtual mass
force and the particle-particle interaction force are negligible in such a way that they can be ignored.

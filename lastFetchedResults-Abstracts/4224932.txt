A decentralized fuzzy gain scheduling control is designed and tested in simulation on a multipool open irrigation canal prototype. The main objective of the controller is to regulate the downstream level of each canalÂ´s pool in spite of large inflow disturbances. Each local controller, of the decentralized control, is a gain scheduling controller composed by a bank of three Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulators switched by fuzzy logic. The adequate closed-loop performance obtained suggests the evaluation of the developed scheme on field applications.

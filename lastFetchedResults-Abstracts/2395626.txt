Understanding the consequences of application of organic and inorganic soil amendments is very usefull in management of low-fertile soils. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of addition of natural zeolite, cow and poultry manures on some chemical properties in soils cultivated with maize. Two series of experiments were conducted separately in a loamy sand soil and in a clay soil. The studied factors were zeolite (at three levels of 0%, 10% and 20%), manures at a rate of 20 g kg-1 of dry weight basis (no manure, poultry manure and cow manure)  and  soil sampling zone at two levels including rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere. At the flowering stage of maize growth, soil samples from the rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere zones were analyzed. The result showed that addition of zeolite and manures to both loamy sand and clay soils changed the soil chemical properties considerably, increasing soil pH only in clay soil and cation exchang capacity (CEC), exchangeable+soluble K and salinity in both soils. However, available P was decreased significantly in the light soil treated with zeolite and cultivated with maize. The addition of manures especially poultry manure increased the CEC of the light soil, and available P and exchangeable+soluble K in both soils. Rhizosphere soils compared to nonrhizosphere soils had significantly (P < 0.05) lower pH and available P and exchangeable+soluble K but higher CEC and EC in all treatments.

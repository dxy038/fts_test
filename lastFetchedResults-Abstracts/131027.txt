The objective aim of this research was to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in a full scale activated sludge reactor. So tested a function for oxygen transfer. The activated sludge model No.1 was used to describe the biochemical processes. The function of dissolved Oxygen was used byfirst- order differential equations. This model was simulated by MATLAB Software. The simulated model was tested for a laboratory pilot and shahrak Ghods treatment plant. The obtained results confirmed the data obtained from the model and the experimental one.

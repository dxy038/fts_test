A bond graph model of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain test cell is proposed. The test cell consists of a motor/generator coupled to a HEV powertrain and powered by a bidirectional power converter. Programmable loading conditions, including positive and negative resistive and inertial loads of any magnitude are modeled, avoiding the use of mechanical inertial loads involved in conventional test cells. The dynamics and control equations of the test cell are derived directly from the bond graph models. The modeling and simulation results of the dynamics of the test cell are validated through experiments carried out on a scaled-down system.

The time interval error (TIE) is a measure of inaccuracy that is widely used now in timekeeping and evaluating the clock performance. In this paper, we investigate and develop a system (hardware and software) for TIE measurements. The system contains two TIE counters, a divider of frequency, reference rubidium clock, local crystal clock, and GPS timing receiver. Applied software provides reading and processing the TIE and decodes the negative sawtooth from the GPS timing receiver. The objective is to estimate the TIE of a local clock with and without the sawtooth correction.

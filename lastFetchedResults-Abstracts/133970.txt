Introduction & Objective: ECG is a test which is used for diagnosis and confirmation of cardiovascular diseases. Many studies regarding the validity of this test in different age groups have been performed and different results were obtained. This study was performed to assess the role of ECG on anesthesia planning in elderly patients. Material & Methods: One hundred elderly patients who referred to Nikocari hospital in Tabriz for eye surgery were enrolled in this study. Findings of clinical examination and medical history were compared with those obtained from the interpretation of ECG by anesthetists. Results: The data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results showed that only 4% of the patients without positive findings in clinical examination had ECG abnormalities; 3% had RBBB; and 1% had T inversion in pre-cordial leads. It is noticeable that reported abnormalities are not so important on the basis of anesthesia care planning. Conclusion: According to the results obtained, it seems logical to pay more attention to selection of patients for ECG and ordering ECG test only for patients with positive clinical findings.

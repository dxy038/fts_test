The presented paper deals with the matrix converter induction motor drive with emphasis on the PWM modulation strategies design. Matrix converters provide an all-silicon solution to the problem of converting AC power from one frequency to another, offering almost all the features required of an ideal static frequency changer. They possess many advantages compared to the conventional voltage or current source inverters. A matrix converter does not require energy storage components as a bulky capacitor or an inductance in the DC-link, and enables the bidirectional power flow between the power supply and load. The most of the contemporary modulation strategies are able to provide practically sinusoidal waveforms of the input and output currents with negligible low order harmonics, and to control the input displacement factor. Sophisticated pulse width modulation strategies in terms of various optimization criteria are known in case of indirect frequency converters, whereas both the inverter and the rectifier can be operated with pulse width modulation. The instantaneous state of both the output and the input converter waveforms depend at any time on the switch state of the converter power switches. Suitable switch states sequence of the nine matrix converter switches can be indirectly derived from the given switch states sequence of the twelve switchers of the indirect frequency converter.

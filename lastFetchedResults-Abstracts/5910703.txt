Wireless sensor networks (WSN) will enable the reliable monitoring of a variety environment for both civil and military applications. Routing protocols have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of sensor networks. This project present the development of an energy efficient routing protocol which consumes significantly less power compared to existing routing protocol for wireless sensor network. The design was developed based on low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) routing protocol. Clustering is an energy efficient and scalable way to organize the WSN. The main objective is to minimize the energy dissipation of each sensor node and reduces the energy dissipation for the whole network. Stable cluster head election (SCHE) analyzes the cluster head selection to find the optimal probability of becoming a cluster head. Simulation of Matlab shows that this design reduces communication energy by as much as 95% compared to LEACH, due to stable cluster head election.

A multi-objective genetic algorithm, based on NSGAII, is implemented to find an optimal condition of minimum voltage deviations, minimum power losses and minimum number of control actions of a transmission network system. The system used as model is an IEEE 30-bus system. Generators and transformers with off-nominal tap ratio are the devices to be controlled. Different probabilities of mutation factors are compared and it is proved that a more important mutation factor can improve the velocity of convergence without getting into a random search. The algorithm is compared with other published results and a successful performance of the implemented algorithm is proved.

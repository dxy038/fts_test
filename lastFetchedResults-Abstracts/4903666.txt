Mobility is one of the important services in the 3G wireless networks. However the current handover technique lacks quality of service (QoS) support. The objective of this paper is to provide a QoS enabled dynamic handoff to provide high quality media transmission during mobility. Three different handoff mechanisms are proposed and their performances are analyzed. These methods overcomes the handoff delay; QoS issues and reduces the bandwidth requirement

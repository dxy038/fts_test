The objective of this study is to document the relationship existing between liquid composition and streamer propagation in large gaps. Measurements are carried out in a series of hydrocarbon liquids of various chemical natures (aliphatic, aromatic, polyaromatic), both in short point-plane gap (6 mm distance, 1 &#956;m tip radius), and in larger gaps up to 20 cm. These measurements are based on fast imaging techniques (2D and streak photographs), coupled to transient current and light recording. A correlation is established between the threshold propagation voltage of filamentary streamers, the tendency to form branches, and the behaviour at very high voltage.

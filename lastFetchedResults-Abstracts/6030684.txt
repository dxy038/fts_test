The <e1>n</e1>-ary vertical partitioning problem is addressed, and an objective function that generalizes and subsumes earlier work is derived. The objective function derived provides a basis for developing heuristic algorithms for vertical partitioning. The objective function is also useful for comparing previously proposed algorithms for vertical partitioning. The current implementation status of a testbed is indicated

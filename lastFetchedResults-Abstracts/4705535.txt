An order schedule problem in a short planning period on multi-mixed-model assembly lines under assemble-to-order environments is discussed. Each line is characterized by different start time, cycle time and operation cost. We seek to minimize the total assembly cost and assembly time for certain orders. A mathematic model is proposed firstly. Then, a hybrid multi-objective genetic algorithm composed on double-generation and an elitist strategy is then developed to solve this problem. Finally, an industrial case study demonstrates its optimality and computational efficiency.

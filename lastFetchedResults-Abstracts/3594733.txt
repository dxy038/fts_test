This paper presents the development and real-time implementation of a nonlinear controller for the speed control of an induction motor (IM) drive. Neglecting the iron loss in an IM model causes performance deterioration, and there has been research to investigate and cope with this problem in the vector control of an IM. However, little work has been done in the area of the nonlinear control of an IM. In this paper, an adaptive backstepping-based nonlinear controller incorporating the iron loss is developed under the parameter uncertainties. To reduce the complexity in the design of the controller, the motor model is referenced to the rotor magnetizing current, and the controller is developed in the rotor-flux-oriented control scheme. The adaptive backstepping technique is utilized to estimate the parameters online and maintain the global stability of the drive through Lyapunov. The proposed controller is successfully implemented in real time using a digital signal processor board DS 1104 for a laboratory 1/3-hp IM. Both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed controller successfully achieves the rotor-speed-tracking objective and improves dynamic responses as compared to the one without parameter adaptation.

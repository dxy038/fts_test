Nonlinear passivity-based control (PBC) algorithms for power converters have proved to be an interesting alternative to other, mostly linear, control techniques. The control objective is usually achieved through an energy reshaping process and by injecting damping to modify the dissipation structure of the system. However, a key question that arises during the implementation of the controller is how to tune the various control parameters. From a circuit theoretic perspective, a PBC forces the closed-loop dynamics to behave as if there are artificial resistors-the control parameters-connected in series or in parallel to the real circuit elements. In this paper, a solution to the tuning problem is proposed that uses the classical Brayton-Moser equations. The method is based on the study of a certain "mixed-potential function" which results in quantitative restrictions on the control parameters. These restrictions seem to be practically relevant in terms stability, overshoot and nonoscillatory responses. The theory is exemplified using the elementary single-switch buck and boost converters.

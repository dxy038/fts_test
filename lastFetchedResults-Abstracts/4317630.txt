Mobile ad hoc networks are becoming an important concept of modern communication technologies and services. It provides some advantages to this communication world such as self-organizing and decentralization. In this paper, we are going to design a cluster-based multi source multicast routing protocol with new cluster head election, path construction and maintenance techniques. The main objective of this work to compute the maximum performance of proposed routing protocol in various environments, and also it has been compared with On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) to prove the better performance of delivery ratio, control overhead and forwarding efficiency.

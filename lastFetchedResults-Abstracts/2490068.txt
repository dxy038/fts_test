
Background: Achieving esthetics is the most important objective of the modern orthodontics. The introduction of a standard, called the divine proportion for the evaluation of a profile, can lead orthodontic, orthopedic and surgical treatment to obtain maximum facial beauty.

Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyze the divine proportion in the face of Iranian normal females and the ability of that using as a standard and index to analyze harmony in patientâ€™s face before and after orthodontic treatment along with other common cephalometric analyses.

Materials and Methods: The selected samples included twenty 19 - 26 years old females. Full-face and profile photography and lateral cephalometric radiography were taken; initially the cephalometric radiography were used for conducting common cephalometric analyses in order to compare them with the results gained from the divine proportion measurements. Seven ratios in photography and twelve ratios in radiography calculated. Radiographic and photographic data were analyzed separately using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and one-sample t-test and compared with 1.618 (golden ratio).

Results: The average values vary from 1.4 to 1.7; the ratio R11 with the average value of 1.613 was the closest value to 1.618. Three cephalometric variables (R3, R8, R12) and two photographic ones (R6 and R7) had a significant difference with 1.618.

Conclusions: The divine proportion on the soft ratio can be a good standard to assess an orthodontic treatment. Divine proportion covers a wide domain and there is a long way ahead of these studies; so it can be extended even more in future.

Wireless sensor networks (WSN) offer a powerful combination of distributed sensing, communication and computing. An environmental WSN testbed, REALnet is proposed and implemented at our University Campus. The objective is to monitor environmental parameters from the air, water and ground, and to become a generic platform that serves different purposes. This work presents the starting current state of REALnet. A temperature sensor and an original water level sensor for the Campus pond are implemented and a basic wireless network, composed of three nodes, is deployed to communicate the sensor node with a central station. The paper includes a brief description of all the parts that form the network from the sensors to the central node and the experimental achieved results.

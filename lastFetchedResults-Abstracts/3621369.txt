Electromigration reliability of interconnect under bidirectional current stress has been studied in a wide frequency range (mHz to 200 MHz). Experimental results show that the AC lifetime rises with the stress current frequency. The current density exponent and the activation energy of AC lifetime are found to be twice that of DC lifetime. Pure AC current stress failure at extremely high current density is believed to result from thermal migration of metal at hot/cold transition points.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

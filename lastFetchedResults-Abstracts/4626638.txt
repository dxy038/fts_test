Medium Voltage DC (MVDC) infrastructure serves as a platform for interconnecting renewable electric power generation, including wind and solar. Abundant loads such as industrial facilities, data centers, and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) can also be powered using MVDC technology. MVDC networks are expected to improve efficiency by serving as an additional layer between the transmission and distribution level voltages for which generation sources and loads could directly connect with smaller rated power conversion equipment. This paper investigates an EVCS powered by a MVDC bus. A bidirectional DC-DC converter with appropriate controls serves as the interface between the EVCS and MVDC bus. Two scenarios are investigated for testing and comparing EVCS operation: 1) EVCS power supplied by the interconnected MVDC model and 2) EVCS power supplied by an equivalent voltage source. Comparisons between both are discussed. The CCM/DCM buck mode operation of the bidirectional DC-DC converter is explored as well as the system isolation benefits that come with its use.

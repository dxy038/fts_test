A new fuzzy multi-objective decision-making model based on vague set theory and entropy method is presented in this paper. In the proposed model, the alternative schemes are weighted evaluation according to the integrated vague value of its elements relative to the ideal scheme. In order to calculate attributes weights objectively and accurately, a modified entropy weights calculation formula is proposed aiming at the problem of entropy weights be inconsistent with the information of entropy. Finally, the proposed model is applied to solve a practical reservoir flood control decision problem. The results show its rationality and feasibility.

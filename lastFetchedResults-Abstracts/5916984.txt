This paper proposes a new method for the control design for reference tracking in a two degree-of-freedom (2DOF) robust optimal control framework. The main contribution of this paper is formulation of 2DOF multi-objective optimal control problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed method enables formulating and solving for a larger set of performance specifications than existing conventional 2DOF designs. This method also provides a platform for implementing mixed-norm optimizamixed-norm optimization problemstion problems that model many tracking applications. The theoretical results are corroborated by experiments that apply the proposed control design for a tracking problem on a positioning system.

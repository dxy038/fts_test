The Solar America Initiative (SAI) PV Technology Incubator Program, funded by the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has the objective of shortening the timeline for companies to transition prototype and precommercial PV modules into pilot and full-scale manufacture. Entrance opportunities for the Incubator project are anticipated every 9 &#8211; 12 months as funding become available. This program targets US small businesses with a minimum entrance criterion of a demonstrated PV cell process, lab device or module. The successful exit criterion is anticipated to be prototype modules and pilot production demonstration of approximately 3MW/year. Ten U.S. Small Businesses received subcontracts from NREL in the fall of the calendar year 2007, averaging approximately $3.0 million each of NREL/DOE funding over an 18-month period. The subcontracts were awarded in two 9-month phases with the second phase of funding contingent upon successful completion of the first phase deliverables and a Stage-Gate review. The award winners represent a diverse range of technologies including: polycrystalline thin-films; thinand wafer-silicon devices; high-efficiency III&#8211;V devices; thin-film organics; and concentrating systems.

The Center for Agroforestry at the University of Missouri has tested numerous native legumes for potential use in agroforestry and selected Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis (Michaux) MacMillan ex Robinson and Fern.) and panicled tick clover (Desmodium paniculatum (L.) DC.) for further testing. Our objective was to document the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) (Glomus spp.) and Rhizobium on growth and nutrient concentration of these legumes. Seeds were planted in a greenhouse and inoculated with one of two species of AM and/or one of two strains of Rhizobium. Plants were harvested after 80 d and data taken on leaf and stem dry weight, root fresh weight, stem height, nodulation, AM colonization, and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration. Inoculation with Rhizobium did not affect plant growth in Illinois bundleflower, but colonization by Glomus intraradices increased all plant growth variables except stem height. Nutrient concentration was unaffected by the presence of either endophyte. In contrast, inoculation of panicled tick clover with Rhizobium str. 41Z10 increased leaf dry weight (32%) compared to the control and root fresh weight (41%) compared to str. 32Z3, and colonization by G. intraradices increased leaf dry weight (35%) and stem height (26%). Both species of AM increased P and K concentration (41% and 55%, respectively) in panicled tick clover. Our results suggest that the growth of these legumes can be improved by the use of proper AM species and/or Rhizobium strains. However, additional research to identify the best Rhizobium and AM inoculates for these plant species is important in developing strategies for their use in agroforestry.

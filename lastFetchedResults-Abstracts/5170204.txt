This paper proposes the application of metaheuristic methods to Reactive Power Planning (RPP). RPP involves optimal allocation of reactive sources to satisfy voltage constraints during normal and contingency states. The main objective of the proposed RPP is to make a trade-off between economy and security by determining the optimal combination of fast and slow controls (load shedding, new slow and fast VAR devices). The overall problem is formulated as a large scale mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. The proposed RPP problem is a combinatorial optimization problem, which cannot be solved easily by conventional optimization methods. Metaheuristic methods are reported to be efficient to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Among the well-known metaheuristic methods, this paper discovers the efficiency of Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Evolutionary PSO (EPSO) in solving the proposed RPP problem. The proposed approaches have been successfully tested on IEEE 14 bus system and a comparative study is illustrated.

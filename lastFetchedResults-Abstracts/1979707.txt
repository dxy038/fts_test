This article presents a hierarchical location-allocation model that combines a maximum covering model and p-center models. The objective herein is to adapt the spatial distribution of supply to various levels of demand. The model resolution step relies both on the myopic and Lagrangian relaxation algorithms and on an empirical study to optimize locations of the three levels of maternity hospitals found in France. Results show that 100 major sites cover 80% of the demand. If these models are able to maximize perinatal care accessibility, then they would choose, from among the best locations, the most centralized places for level 2 and 3 maternity hospitals, which correspond to higher premature birth risks and pathological pregnancies.

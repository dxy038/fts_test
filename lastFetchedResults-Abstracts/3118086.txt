Unmanned systems are used where humans are either unable or unwilling to operate, but only if they can perform as good as, if not better than us. Systems must become more autonomous so that they can operate without assistance, relieving the burden of controlling and monitoring them, and to do that they need to be more intelligent and highly capable. In terms of ground vehicles, their primary objective is to be able to travel from A to B where the systems success or failure is determined by its mobility, for which terrain is the key element. This paper explores the concept of creating a more autonomous system by making it more perceptive about the terrain, and with reconfigurable elements, making it more capable of traversing it.

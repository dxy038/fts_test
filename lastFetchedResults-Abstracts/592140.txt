In the relation of existence nad quiddity it is well – known that quiddity is subject to existence and is abstracted from it, and more strictly and more analytically it has no status but a shadowy and derivative status in relation to existence. Such an analysis and explanation of quiddity is compatible with the principle of principality of existence and unity of being but there is serious doubt in allowing the ascription of it to those theosophists who have not been in a position to determine one of these two (existence and quiddity) as a most original one, in particular Ibn Sina. In the books of Shaykh there are many phrases in which the quiddities have been considered to have an independent and thingness of their own and a bove it there are books in which Shaykh has dealt with the determination, origination and subsistence of quiddity before the occurance of existence (wether objective existence and intellectual existence or imaginary) and even has located a place and locus for this status of quiddity.On the other hand, searching in Mulla Sadra’s works shows us that although in his teaching method – that in early stage as far as possible he walks in with the ancients and agrees with them – sometimes he accepts a kind of status regardless of existence for quiddity but when he speaks from his own true position with an emphasis on his principles, he negates any thingness independent of existence for quiddity and accepts no status for it except as a shadow in relation to existence.Therefore, on the one hand according to texts of Shaykh which we have at our hand does not confirm the place and qualifications Mulla Sadra accords to quiddity, and on the other hand the fundamentals of Shaykh unlike that of Mulla Sadra does not demand such a necessity.

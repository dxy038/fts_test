The classification criteria for Sjo&#776;grenÂ´s syndrome includes the salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS) as one of objective tests for assessment of salivary gland function. We have developed the software for the automatic calculation of commonly investigated quantitative salivary and oral indices (maximum accumulation, maximum secretion, modified secretion velocity, uptake ratio, parotid : submandibular ratio, ejection fraction, pre-stimulatory and post-stimulatory oral activity) derived from dynamic SGS. Our software enables the standardization of processing protocols in multicenter studies.

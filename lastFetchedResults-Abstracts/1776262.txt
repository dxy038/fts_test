Inroduction & Objective: Silver nanoparticles may be toxic. The mechanism of toxicity is not known. Great concern for the health of humans in nature has created. The changes in body weight, liver index and spleen index can be effective in identifying harmful factor in the body. This study was performed to examine the effects of silver nanoparticles on body weight and liver and spleen index in rats.
Materials and Methods: 21 adult female rats were randomly divided into 7 groups. The mice were weighed. Group 1 was sham. Control group 2 and group 3 to 7 experimental groups were treated respectively with 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 ppm of silver nanoparticles. Mice treated for 10 days. On the eleventh day the rats were killed by diethyl ether anesthesia. The mice were weighed and then dissected; the liver and spleen were removed. Liver and spleen were weighed in order to calculate their index. 
Results: The results showed no significant change in body weight of mice, spleen weight, liver weight and liver index and spleen index.
Conclusion: Intraperitoneal injection of silver nanoparticles does not affect the index in rat liver and spleen.

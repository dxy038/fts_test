The non-linear behaviour of statically loaded concrete results mainly from the development of cracks. In addition, highly dynamically loaded concrete is influenced by the failure of micro-pores. Several authors use a damage model to consider both effects. The objective of this work is to test the capability of a discrete crack model to simulate shock wave-loaded concrete. Discrete cracks are modelled using the element-free Galerkin method, which allows cracks to be implemented independently of the mesh. The discrete crack model is used in combination with a fracture process zone to simulate the cohesive behaviour of the cracks in concrete. The behaviour of the micro-pores is described by a compression modulus, which depends on hydrostatic strain (Hugoniot curve). The strain rate effect is considered by modifying the failure surface for calculating crack development. Static and dynamic benchmarks with several concrete beams show good agreement with experimental results. Experiments with concrete loaded by contact detonation show the development of cracks below the crater. The simulation model used shows good agreement with the experimental crack pattern.

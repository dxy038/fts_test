Objective The early detection of patients
with comorbid mental illness is of high clinical importance
in chronic somatic diseases. To identify cases,
screening instruments are recommended. The study
compared the discriminant validity of the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to detect mental disorders
in the most frequent chronic somatic diseases.
Methods Five hundred sixty-nine patients with musculoskeletal,
cardiovascular, and cancer diseases participated
in the cross-sectional, two-stage survey. First,
patients were assessed with the GHQ-12 and the HADS.
Second, they were examined for DSM-IV mental disorders
by clinical standardized interview (CIDI). Using
CIDI diagnosis as a criterion, the validity of the instruments
for the detection of any mental disorder
as well as of depressive and anxiety disorders was
analyzed with receiver-operating characteristics analyses.
Results The HADS performed better in all analyses
compared to the GHQ-12. Best screening results
with the HADS total scale were achieved for depressive
disorders with an area under the curve of 0.82, a sensitivity
of 74%, a specificity of 80%, and a misclassification
rate of 21% (cutoff point=18). The positive
predictive value is best (44%) for the detection of any
mental disorder, with a cutoff point of 17. Conclusions
The HADS total scale can be recommended as a valid
screening instrument for the detection of comorbid
mental disorders in patients with chronic somatic
diseases. The use of the single HADS subscales has no
advantage for screening performance.

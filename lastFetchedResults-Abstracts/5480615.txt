The objective of this work is to assess the accuracy of LAI maps retrieved from ENVISAT MERIS data over wheat fields. The method consists of comparing, at catchment scale, the LAI maps retrieved from MERIS data to those retrieved from ASAR AP data. The latter were preliminary validated, at field scale, by means of in situ data. The experimental site is an agricultural area, mainly devoted to wheat cultivation, located in the Basilicata region, close to Matera city (Italy). On this area ENVISAT MERIS, ASAR AP and ground data were intensively acquired during the 2004 growing season. Results indicate that errors affecting wheat LAI estimations derived from optical and radar data are comparable.

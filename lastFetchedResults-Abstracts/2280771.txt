A study was carried out to estimate the nutritive value of four indigenous multi-purpose tree (MPT) species (Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Treculia africana, Gliricidia sepium and Millettia griffoniana) by the evaluation of their seasonal chemical composition, in vitro fermentation and in sacco dry matter (DM) degradation. The main objective of the study was to assess the potential of these indigenous MPT in supplementing the feed of ruminant animals during the dry season when grasses are scarce and their quality generally fall short of animal requirements. Leaf samples were randomly collected from the trees for estimation of DM, crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), ash, neutral detergent fibre (NDFom), acid detergent fibre (ADFom), lignin (sa), in vitro fermentation and in sacco DM degradation. Samples were collected three times to represent seasonal variations as follows: November: early dry; February: mid-dry and April: late dry seasons. All samples had high CP (160–199 g/kg DM) and moderate fibre concentrations (NDFom, 380–580 g/kg DM; ADFom, 290–400 g/kg DM and lignin (sa), 75–107 g/kg DM). T. africana recorded the highest (180–199 g/kg DM) (P&lt;0.001) CP content throughout the seasons. The values obtained for the in vitro fermentation characteristics and in sacco DM degradation of these indigenous MPT indicated the presence of potentially degradable nutrients in the MPT. Data from this study showed that E. cyclocarpum, T. africana, G. sepium and M. griffoniana have potentials that could be harnessed as feed supplements for ruminant animal production in Nigeria during the dry season.

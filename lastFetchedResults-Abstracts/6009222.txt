Wind power output is a random variable, and before the random variables realized, the power system scheduling decisions must be made. Based on stochastic chance-constrained programming theory, a dynamic economic dispatching model for wind farm integrated systems was established to solve this problem. The power system security and stability, environmental protection and system cost were all taken into the objective function. The model was solved by a hybrid particle swarm optimization and tabu search algorithm(PSO-TS) in which the closed Monte Carlo simulation was introduced. The closed Monte Carlo simulation solves the problem that the Forecasting level of wind power output cannot meet the demand of power system. The results of IEEE30 system with wind farms show that the proposed dispatch model is reasonable and the algorithm is feasible.

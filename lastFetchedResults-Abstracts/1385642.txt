A case control study was conducted between October 2004 and April 2005 to determine the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in cattle in central Ethiopia relative to the tuberculosis status of their owners. A total of 174 farmers (87 with active tuberculosis and 87 with no active tuberculosis), and 1041 cattle (506 owned by farmers with active tuberculosis and 535 by farmers without active tuberculosis) were included. The comparative intradermal cervical tuberculin test was used in cattle while clinical symptoms, chest X-ray and Ziehl-Neelsen staining were used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the farmers. In addition, mycobacterial culture, biochemical tests, and drug susceptibility tests were performed for the identification Mycobacterium spp. from both humans and cattle.

evalence of BTB was threefold higher (odds ratio [OR] = 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.79–6.2) in cattle owned by farmers with active tuberculosis (24.3%) than in those owned by farmers who did not have active tuberculosis (8.6%). Cattle owned by farmers with active tuberculosis were four times more likely to have tuberculosis than cattle owned by farmers with no active tuberculosis. Furthermore, cattle owners who consumed raw milk were at greater risk (χ2 = 14.1, P &lt; 0.001, OR = 3.34) of having active tuberculosis than those who consumed boiled milk. Of the 42 human isolates, 31 (74%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis, seven (16%) were Mycobacterium bovis while four (10%) were considered a typical mycobacteria on the basis of biochemical and drug sensitivity tests. Of the 11 cattle isolates, two (18%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis, five (46%) Mycobacterium bovis, and four (36%) were atypical mycobacteria. The prevalence of tuberculosis was higher in cattle owned by farmers with active tuberculosis than in cattle owned by farmers who did not have active tuberculosis, which could suggest possible transmission of Mycobacterium spp. between cattle and their owners.

The primary objective of the project titled &#8220;A Retrospective Oral History of Computer Simulation&#8221; is to document the emergence of computer simulation since World War II. We seek to capture the early history of the field through digital videos of interviews with the pioneers whose seminal contributions have had long-lasting impacts on simulation practice and theory. This project involves the following activities: (a) identifying those pioneers who are to participate in the project; (b) making the logistical arrangements necessary to produce high-quality digital-video recordings of structured interviews with those pioneers; and (c) carrying out the interviews, editing the recordings, and posting those recordings in a universally accessible permanent digital repository. The digital videos produced by this project will be made freely available on the Web site of the Simulation Archive hosted by the North Carolina State University Libraries. We discuss progress to date and future plans for the project.

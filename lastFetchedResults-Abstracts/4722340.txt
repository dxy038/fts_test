Adaptive Web-based educational systems are a continuously growing area of research. However, despite the relatively numerous approaches, adaptivity from the point of view of student learning styles is not properly addressed. We therefore plan to create a framework for devising and deploying university courses that will take into account not only studentÂ´s knowledge level but also his/her cognitive traits, interests and motivation. A first step towards achieving our objective is the choice of an existing LMS, suitable for being extended into an adaptive one. The netUniversite platform proved to be a successful candidate.

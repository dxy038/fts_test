This paper presents a particle swarm optimization with differentially perturbed velocity hybrid algorithm with adaptive acceleration coefficient (APSO-DV) for solving the optimal power flow problem with non-smooth and non-convex generator fuel cost characteristics. The APSO-DV employs differentially perturbed velocity with adaptive acceleration coefficient for updating the positions of particles for the particle swarm optimization. The feasibility of the proposed approach was tested on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems with three different objective functions. Several cases were investigated to test and validate the robustness of the proposed method in finding the optimal solution. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was tested including contingency also. Simulation results demonstrate that the APSO-DV provides superior results compared to classical DE, PSO, PSO-DV and other methods recently reported in the literature. An innovative statistical analysis based on central tendency measures and dispersion measures was carried out on the bus voltage profiles and voltage stability indices.

A theoretical analysis of the cell loss probability performance of an explicit priority assignment partial buffer sharing scheme for asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks is provided. A two-service-class traffic model is used in which each service class consists of bursty traffic generated by a multiple number of discrete-time Markov sources. The effect of cell loss probability on both traffic load and burstiness characteristics, as well as on system parameters such as buffer size and buffer sharing threshold, is examined. These results are useful for system design. The many examples examined yield no significant priority separation for either high- or low-priority cells. This is particularly desirable for fulfilling the objective of two quality of services (QOS) bearer services to provide only two cell loss probability levels of service

The cyclic variation in echogenicity (CVE) was observed from the cross-sectional images of the common carotid artery using coded harmonic imaging of a GE ultrasound system. The objective of this research is to study the smoking acute effects on the amplitude of the CVE (Acve). A<sub>cve</sub> was analyzed among the 28 smokers before and after 1-2 cigarettes were smoked. The smokers were optimally divided into two clusters with respect to the change in A<sub>cve</sub> and the intrinsic characteristics of smokers (i.e., daily consumed cigarettes and smoking years) through a two-step cluster analysis (TSCA). The relative change of A<sub>cve</sub> after smoking was significantly higher in the heavy smoker cluster compared with the light smoker cluster. However, there is no significant difference in the absolute value of A<sub>cve</sub> between before and after smoking for both two clusters. The effect of tissue attenuation on A<sub>cve</sub> was compensated with body mass index (BMI). The compensated parameter, A´<sub>cve</sub>, is significantly increased in heavy smoker group after smoking (BS: 0.47&#177;7.4; AS: 5.4&#177;8.0; p&lt;;0.05). It is in agreement with the analytical result of &#916;A<sub>cve</sub>. Furthermore, after smoking, A´<sub>cve</sub> is significant higher in heavy smoker group (5.4&#177;8.0), compared with light smoker group (-1.3&#177;6.7; p&lt;;0.05). It suggests that the compensation of A<sub>cve</sub> is help to reduce the interference from tissue attenuation and is good for the comparison among individuals.

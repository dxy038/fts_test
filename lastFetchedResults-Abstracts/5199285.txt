In the underwater communication, the biggest challenge is to reduce the masking effect of underwater ambient noise. The main objective of this paper is to develop an optimum modified LMS adaptive algorithm for accurate detection of underwater acoustic signal, which is prone to the effect of ambient noise in the near and far seas. Comparative analyses on various algorithms are performed. This modified LMS algorithm is found better than the other existing algorithms with respect to the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE). For this analysis, data collected using passive Sonar at a depth of 5 meters in shallow water region.

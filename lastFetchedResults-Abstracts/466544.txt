Objective: Our purpose was to compare the effects of agents activating particulate or soluble guanylate cyclases on the spontaneous contractile activity of the isolated pregnant rat uterus. Study Design: Uterine rings from midpregnant (14-day) and late pregnant (21-day) rats were suspended in organ chambers to record spontaneous contractile activity. Concentration-response curves were obtained for the following natriuretic peptides: atrial, brain, and C-type; concentration-response curves were also obtained for diethylamine nitric oxide, 3-morpholino-sydnominine, and authentic nitric oxide. Results: All 3 natriuretic peptides inhibited spontaneous uterine contractions equally at midgestation and late gestation. The inhibitory effects of the nitric oxide donors diethylamine nitric oxide, 3-morpholino-sydnominine, and authentic nitric oxide were attenuated in uterine tissues from animals in late stages of pregnancy. Conclusion: Agents activating either soluble or particulate guanylate cyclase inhibit contractions of uterine rings from midgestation rats, whereas the effects of soluble guanylate cyclase are attenuated at late pregnancy. Thus spontaneous uterine contractions are under the control of both soluble and particulate guanylate cyclases; the former is dependent on gestational age but the latter is not.

Objective (s): In the present study, the role of irrational health beliefs, health locus of control and health-oriented lifestyle was studied in predicting the risk of diabetes.
Methods: This was a cross sectional study of 100 diabetics and healthy participants in Iranshahr, Iran. Data were collected using a number of questionnaires including the irrational health beliefs questionnaire, multidimensional health locus of control questionnaire and health-oriented lifestyle profile and were analyzed by logistic regression analysis using SPSS24 software. 
Results: The results demonstrated that the variables were able to predict diabetes in 0/92 of female (x2=45/45, df=10, p > 0/001) and 0/90 of male (x2=88/70, df=10, p > 0/001) with the disease. Overall, the model had a good fit according to the 0/89 correct prediction between healthy and diabetics participants.
Conclusion: Irrational health beliefs, health locus of control and health-oriented lifestyle have the predictive power of diabetes and it seems that by changing the irrational beliefs, the health locus of control and changes in lifestyle of individuals the probability occurrence of diabetes will reduce.

Semantic issues are highly concerned with high-level interpretation in image understanding, which include text-image gap and its own affinity. Concentrating on text-formatting with entities in images, three sophisticated methodologies are roundly reviewed as generative, discriminative and descriptive grammar on the basis of contextual features. The following objective benchmark for visual words is also directly presented for semantic coherency. Finally, the summarized directions on semantics in image understanding are discussed intensively for further researches.

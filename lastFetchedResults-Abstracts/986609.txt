Design and expansion of distribution systems seems inevitable in view of the need to satisfy the rise in energy consumption in a technical and economical way. Optimal location, sizing and determining the service area of substations is one of the principle problems in expansion of distribution systems. Also uncertainty is one of the important factors that increase risk of exact decision makings. This paper presents a fuzzy multi-objective model for HV/MV substations planning so that uncertainties are modeled using fuzzy numbers (trapezoidal form). The proposed fuzzy model is based on the risk of economic and technical objectives as well as fuzzy values of investment, operation and loss cost of the substations and primary feeders. This model determines the optimal time, location and size of substations using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The proposed model is applied on a typical distribution system to assess the efficiency of the approach.

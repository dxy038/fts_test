This paper proposes a simple but efficient bidirectional ranking method to improve person re-identification results across non-overlapping cameras. Previous methods treat person reidentification as a special object retrieval problem, and compute the final rank result purely based on a unidirectional matching between the probe and all gallery images. However, the expected person image may be excluded from the probeÂ´s ??-nearest neighbor due to appearance changes caused by variations in illuminations, poses, viewpoints and occlusion. To solve the above problem, our method queries every gallery image in a new gallery composed of the original probe image and other gallery images, and revises the initial query result in accordance with both content and context similarities between bidirectional ranking lists. A latent assumption of our method is that images of the same person should not only have similar visual content, known as content similarity, but also possess similar k-nearest neighbors, known as context similarity. Extensive experiments conducted on a series of standard data sets have validated the effectiveness of our proposed method with an average improvement of 5-10% over original baseline methods.

This paper presents the mechanism of the machine and the numerical result of attractive force in the Electro- Permanent Magnet Lifter (EPML) and an improved niching Genetic Algorithm (GA) applying the concept of auto-tuning and detecting traces. Population size and both (right and left) niche radii of each peak in an asymmetrical objective function can be determined automatically. The validity of the proposed method is verified by simulation results.

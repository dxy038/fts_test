This paper is used to investigate the application of hybrid differential evolution (HDE) method in the design of output feedback power system stabilizers (PSSs) to enhance damping of electromechanical modes. The HDE is useful to get the parameters of PSSs to suppress oscillations of a power system subjected to disturbances. The PSSs have the output feedback configuration, and thus they could be implemented easily. In the design procedure, the objective function is chosen to ensure the real parts of electromechanical modes and/or the damping ratios. The searching for nearly global optimal solutions could be obtained and the computation time is short. The design purposes are to guarantee the damping effects of the entire power system. The effects of system loading are also considered. Nonlinear system time domain simulations are used to demonstrate the design results.

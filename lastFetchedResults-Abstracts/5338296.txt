Software Defined Radios (SDR) allow a dynamic reconfiguration technique of reusing hardware to implement the physical layer processing of a Cognitive Radio (CR)equipment. This paper exhibits three hardware implementation approaches for an SDR respectively called velcro, parametrization and dynamic partial reconfiguration. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the best way to design a flexible, high performed and a low power consumption CR equipment.

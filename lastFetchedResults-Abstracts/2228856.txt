Introduction: the cause of preeclampsia has not been precisely understood. One of
the reasons, as stated by some, might be resistance to insulin however, the role of
insulin resistance in occurrence of preeclampsia has not been proven so far. Hence,
the objective of this study is to find out the relationship between insulin resistance
and severe preeclampsia.
Materials and Methods: In this case-control study 26 healthy pregnant women
and 26 women with severe preeclampsia, for whom termination of pregnancy was
concluded, were included. Both groups in terms of age, weight, parity and body
mass index (BMI) were identical. Furthermore, FBS level, fasting blood insulin and
resistance to insulin at the same laboratory and by similar procedures were evaluated
for both groups throughout the study and documented in relevant forms. The
data were analyzed by SPSS software and P value  < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: The results showed that the level of FBS was not significantly different in
preeclamptic patients and healthy pregnant control (p=0.062). Moreover we found
that the levels of fasting insulin was similar within two groups (P=0.80).
Conclusion: In current study no relevant was observed between severe preeclampsia
and resistance to insulin.

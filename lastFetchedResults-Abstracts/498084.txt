Background and objective: Screening Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients for proteinuria would result in early diagnosis and treatment of HIV associated nephropathy. This study aimed to determine the frequency of proteinuria and its associated factors in HIV positive patients.

Materials and methods: In this study, 171 HIV-positive patients who referring to behavioral disease consulting center in Tehran were screened for proteinuria. Proteinuria was defined as >=1+ protein on the urine dipstick. HBsAg, anti-HCV, serum albumin and creatinine were tested in all of the patients. CD4 counting was also done by flow*cytometry.

Results: Out of 171 HIV positive patients, 12% had proteinuria. There was not any significant difference between patients with and without proteinuria, regarding age, sex, risk behaviors for HIV acquisition, stage of the infection (HIV/AIDS), concurrent anti-retroviral therapy, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum albumin and creatinine, GFR and presence of anti-HCV or HBsAg. Patients with proteinuria had a lower CD4 count and creatinine clearance than those without proteinuria.

Conclusion: Proteinuria was relatively high in HIV positive patients .The group at the higher risk was the patients with lower CD4 count and creatinine clearance.

Background & Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine self efficacy, perceived benefit/
barriers to exercise of students in Hormozagan University of Medical sciences (HUMS).
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Using stratified sampling, 350 current students of HUMS were
studied from November to December 2007 in Bondar Abbass, Iran. Data regarding self efficacy,
perceived benefits/barriers to exercise among participants were assessed through Exercise self efficacy
scale and Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale. Data were analyzed by SPPS version 13.
Results: In all, the data of 249 participants with mean age of 21.7 ± 2.7 were analyzed. Among them
65 participants (26.5%) including 36 girls and 30 boys were doing physical activity. Mean scores of
self efficacy, perceived benefits, perceived barriers were 23 ± 7.1, 96 ± 12.5 and 31.9 ± 6.1,
respectively. There were statistically significant relationship between self efficacy and perceived
barriers with physical activity (P<0.05).
Conclusions: This study revealed perceived barriers such as insufficient time, money and also tiredness
due of exercise could decrease physical activity. However perceived self-efficacy and encouraging by
friends and family members have a key role of doing regular physical activities.

In this paper we present the generalization of two recent frequency-domain methods for evaluating robust stability of uncertain systems to the complex polynomial case. Both methods are based on Mikhailov criteria and have been established recently for real continuous-time systems. Besides generalization to the complex case, we relate these two methods for both real and complex cases, make an objective comparison between them, and include some illustrative examples.

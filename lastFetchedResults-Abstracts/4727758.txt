Communication software has become more complex and therefore more difficult to test. In order to handle the complexity of tests for communication protocols, a research topic known as the design for testability (DFT) has emerged. The main objective of DFT is to reduce the cost and the complexity of tests. Testability activity and its analysis necessitate the use of estimation techniques or measures. The early estimation of testability in the design phase helps designers to identify parts of the specification that are hard to test; then appropriate transformations can be proposed to enhance the testability of the end product

As a part of its ongoing effort to promote electrical safety in the workplace, the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) has undertaken the collection and analysis of objective data on occupational electrical injuries, providing industry decision makers with information to help them better allocate their safety resources to achieve maximum impact on employee electrical safety. The ESFI is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting electrical safety at home and in the workplace. Founded in 1994 as a cooperative effort by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Underwriters Laboratories, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the ESFI is funded by voluntary contributions from electrical manufacturers, distributors, independent testing laboratories, retailers, insurers, utilities, safety organizations, and trade and labor associations.

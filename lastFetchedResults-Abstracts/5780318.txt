The objective of the paper was to design and development of a stereo vision system to build 3D model for underwater objects. The developed algorithm first enhance the underwater image quality then construct 3D model by using iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. From the enhanced images feature points are extracted and feature based matching was done between these pair of images. Epipolar geometry was constructed to remove the outliers between matched points and to recover the geometrical relation between cameras. Then stereo images were rectified and dense matched. Then 3D point was estimated using linear triangulation. After the registration of multi-view range images, a 3D model was constructed using a Linear Triangulation technique.

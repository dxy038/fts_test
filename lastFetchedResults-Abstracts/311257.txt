Objective. To investigate the structural integrity of intramedullary nails with two lag screws, and to give guidance to orthopaedic surgeons in the choice of appropriate devices.

Design. Alternative designs of the construct are considered, and the use of a slotted upper lag screw insertion hole is analysed.

Background. Intramedullary fixation devices with a single lag screw have been known to fail at the lag screw insertion hole. Using two lag screws is considered. It has also been proposed to use a slot in the nail for the upper lag screw to prevent the upper lag screw from sticking.

Methods. Bending and torsion load cases are analysed using finite element method. Consideration of both load conditions is essential.

Results. The results present the overall stiffness of the assembly, the load sharing between lag screws, and the possibility for cut-out to occur.

Conclusions. While the slot for the upper lag screw might be advantageous with regard to the stresses in the lag screws, it could be detrimental for cut-out occurring adjacent to the lag screws.

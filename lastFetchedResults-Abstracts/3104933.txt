Electronically-interfaced converters (EIC) have been widely used in utility network such as Distributed Power Generation Systems (DPGS), Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS), and High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Transmission, in which synchronization with the utility network is a key function. In the past decades, phase locked loop (PLL) techniques have been used for the synchronization purpose. The objective of this paper is to present a state of the art on the phase locked loop techniques to researchers, designers and application engineers dealing with synchronization techniques of EIC. A classified list of 31 research articles on PLL is also appended for a quick reference.

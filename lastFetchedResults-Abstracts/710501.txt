Study Objective: To examine the etiology of MURCs anomalies and the management of a patient with these anomalies as well as cardiac and anorectal abnormalities causing primary amenorrhea and abdominal pain.
Design: Case study.
Result: Relief of pelvic pain following GnRH agonist therapy and continuous oral contraceptives.
Conclusion: MURCS (MÃ¼llerian, Renal, Cervical Spine) is a well-described grouping of multi-organ, nonlethal abnormalities that are infrequently detected in women with menstrual abnormalities. The association of MURCS with cardiac and anorectal abnormalities may be one of coincidence or may indicate that the abnormalities share common genetic or environmental (cellular or microbiologic) etiologies.

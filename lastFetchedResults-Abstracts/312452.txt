The history and evolution of total knee and total hip replacement has been influenced substantially by the knowledge obtained from gait analysis studies. Many of the mechanical problems associated with these devices have been analyzed and evaluated in terms of the mechanics of walking. The magnitude and pattern of the forces at the hip and knee joints derived from gait analysis studies have provided valuable input into the design criteria of both total hip and total knee replacements. Information generated from the gait analysis of patients with total joint replacements has provided objective criteria for assessing functional recovery following this procedure. In addition to providing a basis for design evaluation, the key to the analysis of function following joint replacement is the ability to identify functional adaptations specific to design features. Gait analysis provides a unique opportunity to obtain objective information that cannot be obtained through other clinical means and provides a means for evaluating current designs and future design modifications.

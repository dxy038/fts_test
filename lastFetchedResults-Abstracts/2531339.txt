Background: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is caused by different factors, including genetics and thrombophilia. Beside Factor V Leiden, another nucleotide change in a factor V (FV) gene (A4070G; His1299Arg) has been identified linking to hereditary thrombophilia. Also, two proposed MTHFR polymorphisms, C677T and A1298C (Glu429A) are linked with RPL.
Objective: In this study, the effect of two factors, A4070G in FV and A1298C in MTHFR are evaluated in RPL patients from Mazandaran province, Iran.
Materials and methods: Sample population of 100 women with RPL and 100 controls with Mazandarani ethnics from northern Iran were consist. The factor V (A4070G) and MTHFR (A1298C) polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Results: Molecular study showed 5 women from patients and 9 women from control group were heterozygous AG for A4070G. Frequency of "A" allele in patient and control groups was 97.5% (0.975) and 95.5% (0.955) respectively, and "G" allele frequency was 2.5% (0.025) and 4.5% (0.045) respectively. No significant association (pâ‰¤0.05) between FV A4070G genotype and RPL with an OR=1.88, CI 95%=0.6-5.82, was observed (p=0.4). Also, for A1298C, all patients and control individuals were AA genotype. "A" allele frequency in patients and control was 100% and "C" allele frequency was zero. There was no significant difference for A1298C between groups.
Conclusion: Our finding showed that A4070G and A1298C polymorphisms cannot be considered as a cause of PRL in women from Mazandaran province, northern Iran.

This paper constructs an equivalence class of objective functions that produce the same linear state-feedback decision rule. Members of this class are distinguished by the relative weight placed on state variability and the minimized  norm of the systemâ€™s transfer function. This result is used to show that in models of dynamic policy formation a concern for robustness in the presence of model uncertainty can substitute for the ad hoc incorporation of adjustment costs.

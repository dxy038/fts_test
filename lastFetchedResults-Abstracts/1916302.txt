BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Since Capparis spinosa and Morus alba traditionally have been used to treat some diseases, this study investigated the anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects of hydroalcoholic Capparis spinosa seeds and Morus alba aqueous leaves xtract separately and in combined on blood glucose and lipids in diabetic. 
METHODS: In this experimental study, 60 rats weighting 200-220 gr were divided into 6 groups of 10 each: diabetic control group, treated diabetic groups with different concentrations of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kgbw with the extracts of these two plants separately and in combination and treated diabetic group with Glibenclamide. Streptozotocin was used to induce diabetes. The extracts of Capparis spinosa and Morus alba with doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kgbw and glibenclamide with 600 doses were fed them separately and in combination. Taking blood from rats was done in fasting condition and blood glucose level was determined with enzym and triglyceride, cholesterol and lipoproteins method using Pars Azmon Kits.
FINDINGS: The extract of Morus alba leaves had the best effect on reducing the blood glucose level with dose of 200mg/kg (92.26±16 mg/dl) (p < 0.01). 800 mg/kg concentration reduced cholesterol (74.8±16 mg/dl), triglyceride (25.7±12 mg/dl) and LDL (10.2±1.5 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). 400 mg/kg dose of Morus alba extract increased the amount of HDL (63.2±2.5 mg/dl, p < 0.05). The extract of Capparis spinosa with 200 mg/kg concentration had the best effect on reducing the blood glucose (117.1±16 mg/dl, p < 0.01) and triglyceride (82.02±14.2 mg/dl, p < 0.05) levels. This extract with 800mg/kg concentration declined cholesterol (83.3±1 mg/dl) and LDL (9.7±2.1 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). Its concentration of 400mg/kg increased the amount of HDL (74.8±19.7). The combination of two extracts with dose of 200 mg/kg reduced blood glucose (106/4±24) and triglyceride (73.23±18 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). 800 mg/kg of this combination reduced cholesterol (69.4±2.4 mg/dl) and LDL (14.4±3.9 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). 400 mg/kg of it increased HDL (60.5±17 mg/dl, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The results showed that there are some effective materials in Capparis spinosa and Morus alba extracts which have the capability of reducing blood glucose and lipids.

Background and Objective: Pterygium is a common ocular surface disorder. A number of surgical procedures are used to remove it. The purpose of this study was to compare recurrent, visual acuity and intraocular pressure after pterygium surgery using mitomycin C during and after surgery.
Materials and Methods: In this interventional study, 119 patients with indications for pterygium surgery were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. In the first group, intraoperative 2% mitomycin C was used for 3 min and in the second group, 2% mitomycin C was given four times a day for 2 weeks  The patients were followed up for 15 months after the surgery. The data was collected and analyzed by using SPSS software (version 16), and repeated measurement test at a significance level of 0.05.
Results: The mean visual acuity showed no significant difference in intraoperative and postoperative mitomycin (P=0.8). Also, the difference in the mean of intraocular pressure between the two groups was not significant (P=0.3).
Conclusion: The use of intraoperative mitomycin-C in pterygium surgery was not correlated with visual acuity and intraocular pressure. It is recommended to use mitomycin C in intraoperative methods due to its fewer problems.

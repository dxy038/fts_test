We describe in this paper a tool named PTF (Passive and Temporal Fingerprinting) for fingerprinting network devices. The objective of device fingerprinting is to uniquely identify device types by looking at captured traffic from devices implementing that protocol. The main novelty of our approach consists in leveraging both temporal and behavioral features for this purpose. The key contribution is a fingerprinting scheme, where individual fingerprints are represented by tree-based temporal finite state machines. We have developed a fingerprinting scheme that leverages supervised learning approaches based on support vector machines for this purpose.

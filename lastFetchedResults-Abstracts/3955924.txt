Variable rate speech coding is now recognized as an important system component for high-capacity cellular networks because it exploits speech statistics to reduce the average bit rate, which results in reduced interference and increased capacity. Once a variable rate capability is available, an additional capacity enhancement can be achieved by introducing network control of the user bit rate in response to changing traffic levels. We introduce the concept of network control of rate and propose a particular network-control method for code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems. Based on an M/M/&#8734;//M queueing model applied to a cell under heavy traffic conditions and a new performance measure called averaged speech quality, we obtain simulation results to demonstrate how network control of rate can achieve improved speech quality or increased capacity for a given quality objective

Objective voice quality assessment has been the subject of research for many years. Up until very recently, objective models required a copy of the unprocessed signal for estimating the quality of a signal transmitted across a telecommunication network, making live call monitoring impossible. This paper introduces a method for nonintrusive assessment of speech quality for narrow-band telephony, which was approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) in May 2004. Essentially based on models of voice production and perception, the algorithm demonstrates good performance on more than 48 subjective experiments representing most distortions that occur on voice networks

The Nigerian rice sector has made remarkable improvement
in the last decade as production has increased significantly
thereby reducing the gap between domestic supply and demand.
In the last three decades, rice imports make up greater proportion
of Nigerian imports as rice forms a structural component of
the Nigerian diet. Past government inconsistent policies were
not successful in securing good market share for domestic rice
producers, hence producers suffered great losses. The recent
resurgence of interest by the present administration to intensify
domestic rice production has yielded positive results. The objective
of this study is to analyze and assess the costs and
benefits of intensification of rice production systems in southeastern
Nigeria using a policy analysis matrix approach. Multi
Stage sampling technique was employed in selecting 75 upland
and 75 lowland rice farmers who were interviewed with
structured and validated questionnaire. Data were analyzed
using Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM). The result shows that
upland; lowland and double rice cropping systems in southeastern
Nigeria are profitable based on the policy analysis matrix
(PAM) model, and rice production under various systems and
technologies is socially profitable and financially competitive.
While there exist comparative advantage in the various
production systems, with lowland and double cropping being
highest, substantial tax was imposed on rice imports in Nigeria
and government investment in intensifying rice production
had a positive impact on the output of local rice production.
The study concludes with strategies for the development of
rice sub sector in Nigeria.

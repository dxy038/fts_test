Abstract- In this paper, a control technique based on
simultaneous regulation of all control coefficients for
Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) and Power
System Stabilizer (PSS) is proposed. Non-Dominated
Sorting Particle Swarm Optimization (NSPSO) has been
used for parameter optimization. Studies in time and
frequency domains for single machine infinite bus power
system (SMIB) in different operational conditions are
performed. In the control system, local state variables are
choose as inputs to control blocks and simultaneous
regulation of control parameters established out through
NSPSO algorithm led to appealing results and some
advantages over the control systems used formerly in
similar settings. Different scenarios are simulated in this
learn and compared to the proposed control system using
the characteristics of the objective function in time
domain and the position of system poles in frequency
domain. The efficiency of the proposed system is
established under different conditions for disturbance and
variations of loads in the simulation.

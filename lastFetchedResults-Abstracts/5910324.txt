The Cloud computing presents advantages of reutilization, multi usage and resources sharing, and especially cost minimization. In particular, the software distribution model SaaS (Software as a Service) enables to produce multiuser services. This raises the concern of the adaptation of this type of applications to answer in a personalized way the different needs of users. To achieve this goal, the proposed researches in this topic recommend or use techniques adopted from the Software Product Line engineering domain to model the variability (variable and customizable aspects) of the SaaS applications. This paper presents a review of the main models used in this context. The objective of this work is to assess the relevance of the studied models and their capacity to cover different aspects linked to the variability of the SaaS applications.

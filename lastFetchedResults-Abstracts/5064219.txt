The practical problem of multi-objective controller synthesis can be solved exactly in the LMI framework. This paper considers the excitation controller design as a multiobjective H<sub>&#8734;</sub> synthesis problem, and solves it by means of LMI techniques. A systematic procedure is presented to obtain an output-feedback controller that meets the design specifications such as good voltage regulation ability, good damping behavior, and reasonable cost of control. A numerical example explains the whole design process and proves its feasibility.

In this work, metabolic flux analysis (MFA) method was used to estimate the effects of the culture conditions on both the producing and uptake hydrogen flux inside the cell of Klebsiella pneumoniae ECU-15. The results indicated that higher temperature could reduce the amount of the uptake hydrogen and enhance the hydrogen production from the NADH pathway. Moreover, both the producing hydrogen flux from formate and the uptake hydrogen flux were attained to the maximum at pH 7.0â€“7.5. The producing hydrogen flux was higher at 5 g/L initial glucose than that of the other concentrations, and the uptake hydrogen flux showed the minimum value under the same condition. The apparent hydrogen generation was caused by the combined action of producing hydrogenase, uptake hydrogenase and bidirectional hydrogenase. These results were helpful to deeply understand the mechanism of the biohydrogen evolving process and establish the suitable molecular strategies for improving hydrogen production.

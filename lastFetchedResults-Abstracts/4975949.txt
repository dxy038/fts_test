In this paper, a new method for market-based transmission planning is proposed. This method covers the main objectives of transmission planning in deregulated environment such as facilitating competition among market participants, providing non-discriminate electricity market, improving the reliability of power system, increasing the flexibility of system operation, reducing the investment cost, and decreasing the congestion cost. The main contributions of this paper are organized as follows: I) For calculating the locational marginal price (LMP), the fictitious nodal demand (FND)-based DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) is applied. The recent works only focus on the energy term of LMP. The loss and congestion terms of LMP are covered by this method. II) To modeling the Uncertainties, the probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) is used. III) The new parameter as probabilistic expected energy not supplied (PEENS) is considered in this paper. This parameter is applied as probabilistic reliability criterion. IV) In this work, Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) is used as multi-objective optimization algorithm. V) The Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and TOPSIS method are used as decision making process in this paper. This proposed model is applied to IEEE 24 bus test system.

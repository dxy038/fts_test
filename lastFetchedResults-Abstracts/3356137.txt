The paper proposes a new hybrid error concealment for the multi-view video (MVV). Firstly, the lost macroblocks (MBs) are classified into the static MBs and the motive MBs by the motion information. Then the static MBs are repaired by image inpainting, which is improved to apply to inter and inter-view frame. The motive MBs are fixed by outer boundary matching algorithm (OBMA), in which candidate motion vector (MV) set is also expanded to inter and interview frame. The experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm can conceal the lost MBs with lower complexity and improve the subjective and objective quality, compared with traditional concealment algorithm.

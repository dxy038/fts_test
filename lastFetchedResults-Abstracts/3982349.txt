This paper presents a method to reorganize rules in knowledge bases with the objective of improving their performance. Knowledge reorganization is achieved through the combination of rule compression and abstraction techniques. The effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated in terms of pattern matching activity and execution times using knowledge bases from several application areas

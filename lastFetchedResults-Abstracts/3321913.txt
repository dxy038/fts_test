Automatic control is currently used in many processes of E&#769;lectricite&#769; de France (EDF). However, the wide range of advanced design methodologies are not sufficient to guarantee their successful use without additional expert assistance. The objective of this paper is to present a knowledge based environment (SPIDER) to aid control engineers in the design of robust controllers. The SPIDER software prototype is connected to a knowledge based reasoning system.

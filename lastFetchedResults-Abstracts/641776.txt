Objective: We investigated whether solutions of enteral vitamin supplementation are involved in the generation of peroxides and whether that contamination is biologically significant.

Methods: Peroxide contents of oral multivitamin preparations were measured over 3 wk after the initial opening of the containers. In selected premature infants (younger than 35 wk gestation), urinary peroxides were measured after initiating oral multivitamin supplementation.

Results: Peroxides in multivitamin solutions for enteral use are predominantly organic peroxides because they resist catalase. After the initial opening of the containers, there was a two-fold increase in total peroxides levels (P < 0.05) even in the preparation without riboflavin, a catalyst for the generation of peroxides. Initiation of oral vitamin supplementation was associated with increased (P < 0.05) urine peroxide levels. The high organic peroxide load did not correlate with its urinary excretion, mostly in the form of H2O2. The excretion of H2O2 corresponded to its oral intake from the multivitamin solution.

Conclusions: Compared with parenteral multivitamin solutions, the enteral preparations contained higher organic peroxide levels starting with the initial opening of the bottles. The increased urinary excretion of H2O2 after enteral multivitamin supplementation suggested a systemic diffusion of peroxides or of components of the multivitamin preparation responsible for the generation of peroxides. This oxidant load was not quenched by the immature antioxidant defenses of premature infants.

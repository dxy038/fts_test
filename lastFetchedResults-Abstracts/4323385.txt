This work presents on-chip bidirectional signaling scheme. The current signals are transmitted bidirectionally on the interconnection to double the data rate. The voltage swing on the wire is reduced so that the proposed scheme consumes less power at higher data rate. Using 0.18 &#956;m device models for simulation, the results show that the proposed scheme has a 40% power reduction than conventional driver. It also performs higher data rate at an extension of wire length.

Background and objective: Anemia is present in 60-80% of hemodialysis patients. Recombinant erythropoietin is the treatment of choice for anemia in these patients, but it is expensive. Many researchers have shown the effect of carnitine on anemia. Therefore, this work was designed to evaluate the influence of intravenous carnitine on hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in chronic renal disease patients who were under hemodialysis.
Materials and Methods: This study was accomplished as a clinical trial on 29 patients who were under hemodilysis for at least one year and did not have other reasons for their anemia. Using balance block randomization method the patients divided in to two groups: placebo group (n=15) and case group (n=14). After each dialysis session (3 times a week for 3 months) the case group was injected 1 gr intravenous carnitine while the placebo group received 1 gr distilled water.
Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding sex and age. The average amount of hemoglobin and hematocrit was equal in two groups before the intervention. But, finally after the intervention the amount of hemoglobin and hematocrit significantly increased in the case group (P=0.001 and P=0.003 respectively).
Conclusion: Findings of this study revealed that carnitine increases the amount of hemoglobin and hematocrit in hemodialysis patients and improves their anemia. However, further studies with more patients are recommended.

Based on linear programming (LP) decoding with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), Liu et al. proposed an ADMM penalized decoder for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that can improve the error rate performance at low signal-to-noise ratios. In this letter, we propose a new ADMM penalized decoder to improve the error rate performance further for irregular LDPC codes. The proposed decoder modifies the penalty term of the objective function by assigning different penalty parameters for different variable node degrees. Simulations over three irregular LDPC codes show that the proposed decoder performs considerably better than the ADMM penalized decoder.

Some important results of our research on semiconductor gas/odor sensors are reviewed. Our research is focused on observation of nonlinear I-V characteristics of sensors, elucidation of influences of reactivity and diffusivity of both objective and oxygen gases in a porous sensing layer, optimization of catalytic activity of sensing materials to objective gases, control of oxygen readsorption, and so on. Based on the important findings obtained, sensors are designed for fish smells such as trimethylamine and dimethylamine to measure freshness of fish

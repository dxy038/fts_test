The changes in human population often correspond with change in land use, including expansion of urban areas, agriculture and
increasing industrialization, which necessitate increasing the available amount of drinking water. As the surface water sources are
under the pressure of pollution, it has become necessary to use groundwater at an increasing rate. Groundwater recharge can be
abundant in the alluvial plains where the urban areas are often located. Such areas can face danger of pollution of groundwater and
the changes in land use are likely to result in change in groundwater quality. Keeping these aspects in view, it was planned to
development a groundwater water quality index in the Ganga-Yamuna interfluve area of northern India, The objective of the present
study is to develop the Index of Aquifer Water Quality (IAWQ) inside the Geographic information system (GIS) environment, which
can be used by the field investigators and modeler's in assessing the groundwater vulnerability. The formula to estimate the IAWQ
index is adopted from the procedure suggested Melloul and Collin (1998). The procedure developed for this involves weights
assigned to these 8 parameters as per their analytical hierarchy in violating the (drinking water) standards and not as an arbitrary
means (as taken by Melloul and Collin). The suggested procedure can be extending to include more number of chemical parameters
as necessitate in individual case studies. In the modified procedure presented in the present study, the number of measured chemical
parameters n is taken as 8 (Cd, Mn, Pb, Fe, NO3-, Total Alkalinity, TDS and Ca2+) as against n=2 (chloride and nitrate) as taken in
the Melloul and Collin's work.

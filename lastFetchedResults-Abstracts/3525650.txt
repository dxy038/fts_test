Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is intended to facilitate interworking between data terminal equipments (DTEs) of different designs and from multiple vendors, thus providing the user community with a broad level of independence in the procurement of IT equipment. Whilst OSI local area network (LAN) standards have aimed to fulfil this objective, actual variations in data rates, media types and cabling topographies have hindered progress. The `tree and branch´ cabling architecture presented in the paper provides a powerful solution to these problems. Based on twisted-pair and optical-fibre media, it could support today´s industry standard LANs, point-to-point communication links such as V24, and circuit-switched telephony within an elegant, integrated cabling system

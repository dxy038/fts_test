When multiple video streams share a wireless network, careful rate allocation is needed to prevent congestion, as well as to balance the video qualities among the competing streams. In this paper, we present a unified optimization framework for video rate allocation over wireless networks. Our framework applies to both unicast and multicast sessions, and accommodates both scalable and non-scalable streams. The optimization objective is to minimize the total distortion of all video streams without incurring excessive network utilization. Our system model explicitly accounts for heterogeneity in wireless link capacities, traffic contention among neighboring links, as well as different video rate-distortion (RD) characteristics. The proposed distributed media-aware rate allocation scheme leverages cross-layer information exchange between the MAC and application layers to achieve fast convergence at the optimal allocation.
We evaluate performance of the proposed scheme for streaming of high-definition (HD) and standard-definition (SD) video sequences over 802.11-based wireless networks, both in unicast and multicast scenarios. The scheme consistently outperforms conventional TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) in terms of overall video quality, and achieves more balanced qualities among the streams.

Under the global trend of low-carbon economy, the sustainable development of tourism is very important for the adjustment of economic structure, regional economic development promotion, and improvement of city taste, community environment and conditions of public service facilities. More and more leisure cities take their own tourism products as leader, which is becoming the comprehensive industry complex market to meet the leisure consumption of foreign tourists and local residents. The State Council clearly takes Chang-Zhu-Tan area as a "two-type" demonstration area. All society circles advocate establishing ecological civilization conception, to develop tourism rapidly and healthily is the objective and direction of Changsha, and their goal is to create "The Central Leisure Capital". Changsha is a leisure city in middle China, has their own main background resources for tourism development, such as long-depth history and cultural tradition, and their characteristic mountains, water, continents, and city landscape. And also urban residents have good recreational traditions. The tourism developed together with leisure industry, and now has form the economic structure and industrial clusters of main tourism, entertainment, service and cultural industries. Therefore, it is a practical issue to make the comprehensive study on sustainable development of tourism by using landscape ecology theory, which also is a breakthrough to predict the future development.

This study introduces an electromagnetic interference detection technique to increase the immunity of a microcontroller-based system in a complex electromagnetic environment (EME). The detection method is explained. First, the interference in the power supply and at the input port of the microcontroller is detected. The simulation results are achieved in both time domain and frequency domain. The measurement results are obtained to verify the correctness of the detection method and the application of the detection method in the automotive field is presented. The final objective of the work is to ensure that the microcontroller-based system works fast in a normal EME and correctly in a complex EME without adding too much cost.

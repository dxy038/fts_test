Bacterial contamination is the main cause of food poisoning which can lead to diarrhoea, abdominal cramp, vomiting as well as death. Bacterial contamination can potentially be controlled by application of gaseous ozone due to its antibacterial activity. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of gaseous ozone for reducing food-borne pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium on fresh-cut bell pepper. Efficacy of gaseous ozone to reduce bacterial populations was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that optimum effect of ozone on reducing bacterial populations was achieved with short term exposures of less than 6 h. Ozone reduced the bacterial population by disrupting bacterial cell structure, which lead to cellular death. Results also showed that bacterial cells have different resistance to ozone where ozone was more effective against L. monocytogenes, followed by E. coli O157 and Salmonella Typhimurium. Optimal reduction of the bacterial population on fresh-cut bell pepper was achieved with exposure to 9 ppm ozone for 6 h. This treatment reduced 2.89, 2.56 and 3.06 log of E. coli O157, Salmonella Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes populations, respectively. In conclusion, exposure to 9 ppm ozone for 6 h helps in reducing food-borne pathogen on fresh-cut bell pepper and has high potential to be an alternative sanitization treatment to reduce pathogen population on fruit.

Depressive symptoms are common among post myocardial infarction (MI)
patients and may cause negative impacts on cardiac prognosis. Depression is observed in 35-45%
of MI patients. While depression is an independent risk factor for MI, post-MI depression has
been shown to be a risk factor for mortality, morbidity, and decreased quality of life in patients.
The link between depression and MI is bidirectional in which behavioral and biological
mechanisms have been proposed to be involved. The combination of these mechanisms is likely
to involve in increasing the risk of mortality. Epidemiological studies have shown the link
between depression and increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease, MI, and
cardiac mortality. The adverse impact of depression on prognosis of heart disease is preventable
with the right treatment. A number of therapeutic approaches including cardiac rehabilitation,
social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressants have been suggested for post-
MI depression. However, due to their adverse effects, tricyclic antidepressants are recommended
to be avoided for treating post-MI depression. On the other hand, administering selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) shortly after MI would lessen their major side effects.

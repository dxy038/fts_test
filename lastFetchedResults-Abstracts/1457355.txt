Incorrect sampling operations can cause huge economic losses to the mining industry. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate with four real case studies the tremendous economic impact that incorrect sampling and assaying can cause. On the other hand, when the Sampling Theory is applied correctly in the mining industry, a considerable amount of money can be saved.

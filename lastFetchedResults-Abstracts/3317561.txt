This paper addresses the problem of an optimal actuator configuration in an economic perspective. The objective is to minimize the economical cost of operating a given plant. Functionals encapsulating information of the business objectives given the different actuators have been established with particular focus on a boiler in a power plant operated by DONG Energy - a Danish energy supplier. The problem has been reformulated using mathematic notions from economics. The selection of actuator configuration has been limited to the fuel system which in the considered plant consists of three different fuels - coal, gas, and oil.

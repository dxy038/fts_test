In this paper propose a unifying framework for efficient encoding, transmission, and quality assessment of atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound video. The emergence of H.264/AVC standard, combined with wide deployment of 4G wireless networks, will provide significant support toward the adoption of mobile-health (m-health) medical video communication systems in standard clinical practice. LTE facilitates significant improvements with respect to 3G and HSPA systems. Recently investigate the high resolution (4CIF-704&#215;576) medical video communications over mobile WiMax networks for emergency telemedicine. Here the system allows for the transmission of high-resolution (16CIF 1408&#215;1152 and 4CIF 704&#215;576) clinical video that is encoded at the clinical acquisition resolution and is decoded with low delay. We evaluate our scheme on a representative collection of ultrasound videos of the carotid artery for packet loss rates up to 10%. Here NS3 simulator is used for modelling the mobile LTE Network. Finally Video quality assessment is done based on clinical evaluations and results are discussed both subjective and objective evaluations.

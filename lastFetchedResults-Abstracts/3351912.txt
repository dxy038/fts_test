We propose the prediction-adaptation-correction RNN (PAC-RNN), in which a correction DNN estimates the state posterior probability based on both the current frame and the prediction made on the past frames by a prediction DNN. The result from the main DNN is fed back to the prediction DNN to make better predictions for the future frames. In the PAC-RNN, we can consider that, given the new, current frame information, the main DNN makes a correction on the prediction made by the prediction DNN. Alternatively, it can be viewed as adapting the main DNN´s behavior based on the prediction DNN´s prediction. Experiments on the TIMIT phone recognition task indicate that the PAC-RNN outperforms DNN, RNN, and LSTM with 2.4%, 2.1%, and 1.9% absolute phone accuracy improvement, respectively. We found that incorporating the prediction objective and including the recurrent loop are both important to boost the performance of the PAC-RNN.

In this paper, the authors describe a sensorless control scheme for a three-phase bidirectional converter that operates without line current sensors. With this scheme, the converter operates under a fixed switching frequency and can handle zero states. This improves the total harmonic distortion of the source current and eliminates the problems associated with a variable switching frequency control. The scheme can handle any space-vector modulation scheme. The implementation of the converter control is in a synchronous frame, thereby enhancing the dynamic bandwidth of the system

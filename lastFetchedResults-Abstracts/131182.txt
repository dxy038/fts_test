Skin disorders are commonly seen in the neonatal period. Erythema toxicum neonatrum, milia and mongolian spot are among the many benign skin conditions that occur in newborns. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of above mentioned lesions. A total of 615 neonates were examined and the incidence of mongolian spot, milia and erythema toxicum were 43.9%, 47.8% and 43.4%, respectively. There were no significant differences between male and female infants in any of the lesions. Milia was more common in the LBW infants (62%) than the babies with normal birth weight (45.6%). Regarding the erythema toxicum and milia between the LBW and permature infants and the term babies with normal birth weight, no significant differences were found. The most common site of mongolin spot was the sacrum and the buttocks were the second common area. The common locations for milia were nose, cheeks and for erythema toxicum were face and trunk.

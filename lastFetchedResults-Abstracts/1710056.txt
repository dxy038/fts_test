BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although hyperprolactinemia in women with menstrual dysfunction, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries can rule out the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO), but hyperprolactinemia in women with PCO is common. Chronic ovulatory disorders are common complications of PCOS and hyperprolactinemia. Despite advances in the management and treatment of both problems, there has not been a clear relationship between them. The purpose of this study was to determine serum prolactin levels in patients with PCO.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, serum prolactin of 120 women aged 18-40 years with PCO who presented to Fatemeh Zahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center in the years 2009 to 2013 was investigated. Patients with pituitary adenoma, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, endometriosis, tranquilizer, cashing syndrome and using medicine which affect prolactin were excluded. Prolactin value  <  25 ng/ml considered normal.
FINDINGS: Mean serum prolactin levels in patients were 21.89Â±13.57 with ranges of 3.2-72 ng ml. Twenty two (18.3%) patients had prolactin levels above 32 ng ml that was noticeable. Pearson regression test showed a weak positive correlation between prolactin level and infertility duration.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that prolactin level is higher than normal value in PCOS women.

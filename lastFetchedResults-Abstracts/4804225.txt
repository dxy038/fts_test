Assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) means assigning a series of task elements to uniform sequential stations under certain restrictions. This paper considers a special type of assembly line balancing problem with mixed models, fuzzy operation times and drifting operations, which has the objective of minimizing the total work overload time. According to chance constrained programming, a fuzzy &#194;&#191; total work overload time minimization model is built. Moreover, fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm are integrated to design a hybrid intelligent algorithm to solve the above model. Finally, extensive computational results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.

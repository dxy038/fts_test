Application of the information technologies in the education process is nowadays unthinkable part of the high quality education. In the paper provided is the possibility of the application of the comparative analysis method for the evaluation of the environmental level of the products as the designing tool with regard to the environmental aspects of the product. As this method ranges among the non-software tools, with the objective to simplify the calculation and minimise the possible problems related to the manual calculations, which follow out from the comparative analysis method, proposed was its software application. This application significantly simplified the process of the calculation and enabled the following generation of the results in the graphic form as well. It also enables the students to evaluate the recent condition of the product and subsequently realise the proposals of the solutions to minimise the environmental impacts operatively.

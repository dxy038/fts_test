The objective of this paper is to propose a packaged integrated dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) concept which results in a compact antenna structure suitable for Bluetooth or wireless applications. The antenna design is optimized using commercial software based on finite element method. Measurement results are in good agreement with the simulated ones. The fabricated antenna possesses wide impedance bandwidth (13%) and high radiation efficiency (94%).

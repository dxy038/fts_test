A new technique &#8220;basin region recognition&#8221; (BRR) is introduced to particle swarm optimization (PSO). BRR utilizes the objective function information obtained by PSO to recognize the attraction basin regions of local minima, and help the algorithm escapes from the attraction of local minima. It is also possible to get multiple local solutions in one experiment with BRR.

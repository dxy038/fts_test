In service oriented Grids; everything is represented by a service. Computational resources, storage resources, programs, and so forth are all services and thus managing the services in a proper manner is an important issue. in this article an intelligent and adaptive agent for managing Grid services is presented named FAGS. The FAGS manages service consumers advanced reservation requests, schedules service instances, monitors the instances, and manages service factory. The main objective of the proposed agent is balancing between service instances utilization and service consumers QoS delivery in respect of their QoS class. As usually these parameters are in conflict with each other, the agent continuously monitors system status and uses its novel fuzzy-based algorithms to make proper decisions with aim to adapt with latest conditions. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed agent.

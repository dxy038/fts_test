The purpose of this paper is to improve the robustness of the multimodel control of discrete systems by using observers. The new strategy of the multimodel control is based on the use of a dynamic library of generic models and observers. The main idea of this paper is to re-initialize the state of each model by the corresponding state estimated from the process when the error between them exceeds a certain value. A good choice of the observer besides a fusion applied on the coefficients of each controller allows the multimodel control strategy to reach the desired objective for the global control of the system. The desired performance is reached by the use of this new strategy of multimodel control. Then, the breakthrough aspect of this work is the introduction of observers in the multimodel control as a technique to improve the validity of the generic models. The global control obtained by this new strategy of control is presented. Computer simulation results show that a design of robust multimodel control based on a good selection of the models plus re-initialization steps based on observers is feasible and provides good performance

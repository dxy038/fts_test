Recently, industry has focused attention on plant matrices rich in phytosterols and phytostanols for their ability to reduce serum cholesterol levels. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the phytosterols and phytostanols contents of different fractions (endosperm, pericarp, germ) of corn kernel. The germ fraction contained more oil (24.2–30.7%) than endosperm and pericarp fractions (0.4–1.2%). Endosperm oil had the highest levels of phytostanols and 4,4-dimethylsterols, while pericarp oil had the greatest amounts of 4-desmethylsterols and 4-monomethylsterols. In the oil extracted from three corn kernel fractions sitostanol was the predominant phytostanols (77–87%), followed by campestanol (13–23%). The high percentages of 24–methylencycloartanol and cycloartenol were detected in the endosperm and pericarp parts, respectively. Citrostadienol was detected in corn germ oil as the main component of the 4-monomethylsterols fraction. In different parts of corn kernel, β-sitosterol (62–69%) was the major 4-desmethylsterol, followed by campesterol (11–18%) and stigmasterol (5–13%).

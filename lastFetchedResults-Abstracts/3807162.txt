The modeling of antennas on complex platforms is reviewed. The objective is to analyze the modification of the basic antenna performance due to its environment. This includes pattern distortion, antenna to antenna spacial coupling, and radiation hazard predictions. High frequency methods are used to develop computer codes to accomplish these tasks. Several types of generally available codes are discussed

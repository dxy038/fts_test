The main objective of this work is to obtain an efficient three-dimensional boundary element (BE) formulation for the simulation of layered solids. This formulation is obtained by combining an alternative multi-region technique with an infinite boundary element (IBE) formulation. It is demonstrated that such a combination is straightforward and can be easily programmed. Kelvin fundamental solutions are employed, considering the static analysis of isotropic and linear-elastic domains. Establishing relations between the displacement fundamental solutions of the different domains, the alternative technique used in this paper allows analyzing all domains as a single solid, not requiring equilibrium or compatibility equations. It was shown in a previous paper that this approach leads to a smaller system of equations when compared to the usual multi-region technique and the results obtained are more accurate. The two-dimensionally mapped infinite boundary element (IBE) formulation here used is based on a triangular BE with linear shape functions. One advantage of this formulation over quadratic or higher order elements is that no additional degrees of freedom are added to the original BE mesh by the presence of the IBEs. Thus, the IBEs allow the mesh to be reduced without compromising the accuracy of the result. The use of IBEs improves the advantages of the alternative multi-region technique, contributing for the low computational cost and allowing a considerable mesh reduction. Furthermore, the results show good agreement with the ones given in other works, confirming the accuracy of the presented formulation.

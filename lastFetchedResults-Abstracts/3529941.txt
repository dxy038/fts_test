The transconductance-mode (T-mode) approach is extended to implement analog continuous-time neural network hardware systems to include on-chip Hebbian learning and on-chip analog weight storage capability. The demonstration vehicle used is a 5+5-neuron bidirectional associative memory (BAM) prototype fabricated in a standard 2-&#956;m double-metal double-polysilicon CMOS process. Mismatches and nonidealities in learning neural hardware are not supposed to be critical if on-chip learning is available, because they will be implicitly compensated. However, mismatches in the learning circuits themselves cannot always be compensated. This mismatch is specially important if the learning circuits use transistors operating in weak inversion. The authors estimate the expected mismatch between learning circuits in the BAM network prototype and evaluate its effect on the learning performance, using theoretical computations and Monte Carlo HSPICE simulations. These theoretical predictions are verified using experimentally measured results on the test vehicle prototype

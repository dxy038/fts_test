This paper presents a newly developed adaptive fuzzy post-filter for removing blocking and ringing artifacts in the highly compressed images and videos. The proposed post-filter adoptively adjusts its filtering window size and the spread parameter in the fuzzy membership function according to the variance value in an edge map. The post-filtering operation is directly applied to the classified edge blocks in the image under the guidance of the edge map, while keeping smooth and textured blocks unchanged. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses a good edge preserving property and can maximally remove coding artifacts. Compared with our previous method, the proposed post-filter achieves better objective and subjective quality and further reduces computational complexity.

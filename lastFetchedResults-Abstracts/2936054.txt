This paper presents the use of ERS-1 repeat-pass interferometric data for forest environment study. The overall objective is to assess the potentialities of interferometric information-degree of coherence and phase difference-to retrieve forest parameters. Coherence is shown to be a good discriminator between forest stands and bare soil surfaces. The resulting map using coherence for different interferometric couples is in good agreement with ground data. Phase difference statistics are shown to be helpful in discriminating forest stands of different heights

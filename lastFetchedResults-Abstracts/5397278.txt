We devote to provide teachers and students with short-range wireless learning environment. The wireless learning platform consists of wireless handheld devices (PDA, notebook, etc.) carried by the guide and learners. A content-based image retrieval system (CBIR) is constructed to provide learner with required information using image recognition and wireless transmission technologies, such that the objective of outdoor ecology learning can be achieved. A firefly database is used as an instance to illustrate the operations of CBIR system. Instead of learning from textbook, a real firefly in natural environment can be observed and learned through digital camera and image recognition system. During the learning activity, the teacher can use this CBIR system to control the learning progress, evaluate the learning effects and provide necessary assistances to students in order to have a flourish learning environment.

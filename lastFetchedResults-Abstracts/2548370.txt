The primary objective of the current study is to produce karstification potentiality maps in northeast of Khuzestan province, Iran, using both fuzzy logic and AHP models as an additional tool in hydrogeological research. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) are used to create two maps depicting the development of the karstification, consisting of five classes, showing the karstification potentiality ranging from very high to very low. The extractions of these maps are based on the study of input data such as: lithology, lineament density, elevation, slope, rainfall, temperature, drainage density and vegetation cover. Eventually, two maps based on weighted spatial modeling system are created. The verification results show that the fuzzy logic model outperformed AHP model for the study area. Based on hydrogeological survey, hydrodynamic characteristics perceived at the outlet of major springs consisting of DareAnari (DA), Abshekaloo (AS) and Sarhooni (SH) revealed poorly and well developed karstified systems. The collected data indicated that one of the main factors for karst development in the area is tectonic activity and occurrence of lineaments in various scales.

Reptiles are in decline globally, and one-third of turtle species are considered endangered or vulnerable. Conservation of turtles presents special challenges, as turtles are long-lived, and have delayed sexual maturity, making long-term study necessary for accurate calculation of life history parameters. The spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) is listed as an endangered species in Canada. A population in eastern Georgian Bay, Ontario has been the focus of the longest-running ecological study (30 years) on the species to date. The objective of the current project was to use the long-term demographic data to parameterize a stage-classified matrix and to use the model to asses several hypothetical management scenarios. Elasticity analyses and simulations indicated that small changes in adult survivorship would have the largest proportional effect on population growth rate, and that increasing survivorship of juveniles to 100% would result in the largest increase in population growth rate. Simulation of nest protection and headstarting scenarios indicated that these are inefficient conservation strategies for this species. We recommend that adults, and when possible, juveniles, be the stages targeted for conservation in spotted turtles and other long-lived iteroparous vertebrates.

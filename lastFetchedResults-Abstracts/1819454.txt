Objective
as been suggested that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), though this role has yet to be fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate this role as concomitantly expressed in the saliva and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL/‘lavage’).

y consenting patients (mean age 62 ± 13-year-old), with/without COPD and/or smoking habit, participated in the study. The following antioxidant profile was examined both in saliva and lavage of the patients: total antioxidant status (TAS), uric acid (UA), peroxidase and super oxide dismutase (SOD). Total protein (TP) and albumin (Alb) were also evaluated in both saliva and lavage while amylase was measured only in saliva.
s
ease of TAS (by 100%) and of SOD activity levels (by 60%) in the lavage of COPD patients indicated oxidative stress. The salivary UA in COPD patients was 125% higher (p = 0.05) while the peroxidase was 20% higher. Another novel finding was that levels of salivary antioxidants in smoking versus non-smoking COPD patients were lower by 25–48% (for all four: TAS, UA, peroxidase and SOD) while the albumin was significantly reduced by 60% (p = 0.018).
sion
ative-stress-related changes demonstrated both in the lavage and saliva of the COPD and/or smoking patient indicate cumulative effects of both, also emphasizing the pathogenetic role of free radicals in COPD. Salivary analysis, which is less invasive and much easier to perform as compared with lavage analysis, is suggested as a new and effective diagnostic tool in COPD patients.

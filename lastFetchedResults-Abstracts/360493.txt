Study objective: To determine whether family members accept field termination of unsuccessful out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation. Methods:  We carried out a prospective cohort study, using a structured interview, in an urban, municipal, advanced life support emergency medical services (EMS) system. The interview subjects were family members present at the scene in a consecutive series of unsuccessful out-of-hospital resuscitation attempts. Results:  During the 4-month study period, 140 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurred. Follow-up with a family member was performed in 42 of the 53 cardiac arrests that met the inclusion criteria (79%). When resuscitation was terminated in the field (n=25), 24 family members (96%) reported satisfaction with the decision. When resuscitation was terminated in the emergency department (n=17), 14 family members (82%) reported satisfaction with the decision to transport the victim to the hospital. However, responses indicated that 13 of the family members (76%) might have accepted termination of resuscitation in the home. In all cases, relatives reported satisfaction with the paramedics' care and with the manner in which they were informed of the victims' deaths. Conclusion:  Family members accept termination of unsuccessful out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation in the field.

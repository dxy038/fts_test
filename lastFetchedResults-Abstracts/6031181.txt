During transmission over error-prone networks, the compressed video signal may suffer a large drop in video quality for the block-based motion-compensation scheme. Error recovery is widely used in video decoders to reconstruct corrupted regions. In this paper, we propose a new spatial error recovery method utilizing multi-directional inpainting. It contains eight single-directional inpaintings which perform unsymmetrical matching to search for suitable information and keep local continuity. We also present a linear combination method which merges different directional matching patches to alleviate the error propagations. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides significant gains in both subjective and objective measurements.

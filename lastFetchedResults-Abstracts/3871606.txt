A new method for controlling single-link flexible manipulators is proposed. The objective is to control the tip position of a flexible manipulator in the presence of changes in its payload. Particularly, a new adaptive control system has been designed. The proposed control system requires calculating only one parameter, the tip load, instead of all the transfer functions as in conventional adaptive control methods. The tip load identification algorithm is based on the equivalence existing between a manipulator with payload and a manipulator submitted to the action of external forces. Moreover, this equivalence provides a new technique for modeling these systems which simplifies the methods usually applied. This results in a simple control law that needs minimal computing effort and, thus, can be used for real-time control of flexible arms

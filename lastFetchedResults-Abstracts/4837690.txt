The primary objective of the work was to create an innovative approach to design and optimize the cam profile on the basis of DoE (Design of Experiments) method as well as to take advantage of the simulation tool, AVL Excite Timing Drive, to facilitate the redesign and analysis of the valvetrain. Furthermore, the comparison of results in kinemics and dynamics between the original and modified cam profiles was made, which indicated DoE method can satisfy the design criteria. Compared to the original cam profile, the optimized one decreased the maximum contact stress at cam/tappet interface and jerk by 5.8% and 28.0%, respectively, without sacrificing the volumetric efficiency too much, which was merely decreased by 0.22%.

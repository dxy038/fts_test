In this paper, a multi-objective directional sensor placement problem for wireless sensor networks is considered. The goal of the multi-objective optimization problem is to obtain sensor placement solutions with reasonable trade-offs between two conflicting objectives, namely energy consumption and detection capability. An adaptive normalized normal constraint method is proposed to solve such optimization problem. Simulation results show that, when comparing with a conventional normalized normal constraint method and NSGA-II, the proposed method is more capable of finding extreme solutions on an approximated Pareto frontier.

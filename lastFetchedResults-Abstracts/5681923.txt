Our objective was to investigate an influence of some factors contributing to the bed caking tendency during the hop extraction process. It is important to keep the process free of bed caking since it prolongs extraction. In our research, three data sets describing the extraction process were used for knowledge discovery using rule induction and generation of belief networks. Experts analyzed discovered knowledge from the view point of potential applications. Finally, an error rate for all used methods was estimated using ten-fold cross validation.

This paper presents comparison of a class of 3D optimal geometric reconstruction approaches by using L<sub>infin</sub>-norm with respect to three pixel distance measures. Linear programming and second order cone programming are implemented to minimize the objective function of reconstruction respectively. The experiments show that the root mean squares (RMS) errors defined by different pixel distance measures are determined by reconstruction algorithms. The optimality of L<sub>infin </sub> optimal reconstruction is confined to its own objective function

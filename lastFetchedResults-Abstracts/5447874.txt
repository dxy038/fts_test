The objective of this study was to develop an environmental education material that is appropriate to Kanazawa. Since 2003, we have been observing the summer ground air temperature in Kanazawa, Japan. The results are effectively applied as teaching materials for environmental education classes. The curriculum contents are used to explain the land use and the heat environment in Kanazawa. This paper contains a description of the teaching materials and the system used for observing the temperature in Kanazawa.

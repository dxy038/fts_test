We study in this paper the resource allocation matter for unlicensed multiband ultra-wideband (UWB) users in the context of high-rate wireless personal area network (WPAN). The problem is viewed as a coexistence problem with existing licensed systems. The QoS support and the interference mitigation are jointly considered in this study to derive a novel interference power control mechanism that differentiates between the unlicensed users. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, a constrained multiuser optimization problem is studied and optimal sub-band and power allocation functions are derived. Second, in the scope of a joint QoS-aware channel allocation and interference control mechanism, we propose two solutions for the optimization problem. The first one is based on a high-complexity iterative process for the search of the optimal solution, and another low-complexity suboptimal solution based on a distributed cross-layer approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal and suboptimal solutions perform close and that the allocation scheme makes a good tradeoff between the QoS satisfaction of high-priority UWB users and the limitation of the interference affecting the licensed users.

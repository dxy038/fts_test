Objective: To study the effect of garlic extract to reduce the colonies of salmonella typhimurium.
Methods: 78 female rabbits of Dutch- Polish type were divided into 13 groups of 6. 12 groups were infected by 3 concentrations of salmonella typhimurium (no:1186). 9 groups were orally treated by different concentrations of garlic extract. Rectal sampling were performed from all animals every day (Starting one day before infection & lasting for 7 days). The results were recorded.

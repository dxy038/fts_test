This study performs a set of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) using
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) soundings. The primary objective of the OSSEs
is to demonstrate that targeted observations can improve forecast accuracy by enhancing the initial
conditions and mitigating their uncertainties. Hurricane Floyd (1999) is chosen as a study case. The main
reason for choosing hurricane Floyd as a test case is that the movement of the storm was dictated by a midlevel
complex polar jet steering flow region. This well-defined feature allowed us to examine the inaccuracy of
analysis over the steering flow area using GOES soundings as targeted observations and its impact on the
forecast track error. The set of experiments starts from a baseline forecast of hurricane Floyd using the
Operational Multiscale Environment model with Grid Adaptivity (OMEGA). From GOES satellite
soundings, atmospheric vertical profiles were extracted to simulate targeted observations. These data
extracts were assimilated in the initial conditions to simulate new forecasts of hurricane Floyd which were
then compared against both the baseline track and observed track. It was found that targeted observations in
a forecast sensitive area can help to reduce hurricane forecast track error. Assimilation of only the subset of
data (about 50 soundings) from the subjectively chosen fully sampled target region produced a considerable
reduction of the track forecast errors (about 30%) within the first critical three days of the forecast.

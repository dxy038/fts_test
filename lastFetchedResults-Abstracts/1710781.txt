The objective of this study was to develop a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) from epoxidized skim rubber (E-LPSR) obtained from saponified low protein skim rubber (S-LPSR) and blended with poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) containing a tackifier, via solution and emulsion, respectively. The creep properties of PSA and E-PSA in the presence of a 60 hydrocarbon resin were improved by addition of 10 phr of PVA but the surface free energy, tack strength and peel strength of the two adhesives were slightly decreased. The optimal concentration of PVA for a good pressure-sensitive adhesive was found to be 20 phr because of its emulsion.

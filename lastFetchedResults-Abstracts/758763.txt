The integrity of a composite laminate can be greatly affected by an existence of embedded
interlaminar flaw. In general, identification of such a flaw often requires expensive tools and tedious
processes. The aim of the present work is to develop a novel method with the aid of an intelligent
post-processing scheme, thereby not relying on those sophisticated experiments. Essentially the
proposed procedure utilizes an inverse analysis to estimate unknown delamination parameters from
limited measurements. The procedure first constructs approximate functions relating the delamination
parameters to measurement parameters. Then, a multi-dimensional minimization technique is adopted
to search for the best estimates of unknown parameters corresponding to the lowest value of error
objective function. In the present verification and simulation analyses, surface strains at discrete locations
on a composite laminate under three-point bending are selected as the input measurements.
Although reasonable estimates are obtained with these measurements, to increase their accuracy, the
deflection at load point is also included as measurement input. Additional improvements are observed
when those measurements under multiple loading conditions are included. A detailed error sensitivity
analysis is also carried out to confirm the methodâ€™s robustness. These results suggest the current
method to be one of the alternate identification approaches for detecting a single embedded delamination
in composite laminates.

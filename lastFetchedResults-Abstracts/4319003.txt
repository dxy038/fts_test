The objective of this paper is to propose an improved dc bus voltage regulation strategy for the grid-connected PV/Wind power generation system. The proposed dc bus voltage regulation strategy can reduce the variation of the dc bus voltage and the size of the dc bus capacitor bank, significantly. Also, the change of the injected ac current amplitude will be moderate and the power quality of the utility can be improved. A 1.2 kW prototype system is built and tested to verify the feasibility of the proposed dc bus voltage regulation strategy. Hardware experimental results are shown to confirm the performance of the proposed dc bus voltage regulation strategy.

Introduction & Objective: Cervicovaginal infections, affecting millions of people throughout the world annually, are among the most prevalent infections in clinical medicine. This study was undertaken to analyze the frequency of infections due to tricomonas vaginalis,candida albicans and gardnerella vaginalis through cytological smears.
Materials & Methods: A group of 1942 women were studied from October 1999 to September 2000. They referred to health and therapeutic centers for routine pap smear. After collecting the data, they were analyzed using SPSS software.
Results: 802 (41.3) of the subjects lived in rueral areas and 1140 (58.7%) of them lived in urban areas. 255 (13.3%) had candidiasis, 82 (4.22%) had gardnerella vaginalis and 37 (1.9%) had tricomoniasis. The effect of age, contraception methods and other factors were studied. Results showed
that there was a significcant difference between infections, age and contraception methods(p<0.05).
Conclusion: It can be concluded that cytological smears can be used for cervicovaginal infection diagnosis but it is necessary to add other diagnostic methods.

Objective: We were curious ‎about the degree of anxiety and ‎depression and their effect on the ‎quality of life of the caregivers of ‎veterans with spinal cord injury ‎‎(SCI).‎
Methods: A convenience sample ‎of 72 out of 120 caregiver ‎spouses of veterans with spinal ‎cord injury participated in our ‎study. The Hospital Anxiety and ‎Depression Scale (HADS) were ‎considered as a measure of ‎depression and anxiety. The ‎World Health Organization ‎Quality of Life BREF ‎questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) ‎was considered to evaluate the ‎quality of life. To compare the ‎caregivers, we enrolled 74 ‎matched caregiver spouses of ‎patients without spinal cord ‎injury‏. ‏
Results: The average age of the ‎spouses was 44.7±6.5. The ‎average time elapsed from the ‎injury was 26.4±3.1 years. There ‎was a significant difference in all ‎domains of quality of life and ‎depression between the ‎caregivers and the control group, ‎but there was not a significant ‎difference in terms of anxiety. ‎There was a negative correlation ‎between depression and age, ‎level of education and quality of ‎life‏.‏
Conclusion: Mental care support ‎should be implemented for ‎veterans and their spouses in ‎addition to the provided facilities‏.‏

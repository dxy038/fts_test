Background: Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii. Infections of human are common and are usually asymptomatic. The infection may be serious if is transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy. Prophylactic measures, early detection of the infection and treatment can avoid congenital toxoplasmosis and many long term effects. Objective: Seroepidemiological study in young girls is useful to determine the prevalence of infection and to design prevention policies for them after marriage and during their pregnancy. This study was carried out in the years 2000-2001 in the region of Fasa of Fars province in the South of Iran, as a descriptive, analytic and cross sectional study. Methods: Serum Samples of 947 students were collected from high school girls of Fasa and studied by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). The positive and negative controls were also used. Results: The seroprevalance rate of toxoplasmosis ranged from 1 to 21 Percent in different parts of Fasa and 10% in all groups. Some variables including age, nutritional habits and contact with domestic cats were studied. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in girls of various high schools of Fasa is different and it may be related to the level of hygiene in different parts of Fasa. Water and food contamination with cat stool in regions with high contact with domestic cats can play an important role in infection rates. People of such areas should eat well-cooked meat to reduce infection.

6-Aryl- and 6-heteroaryl-9-benzylpurines have been synthesized employing palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions in the step forming the C–C or C–N bond between the aryl- or heteroaryl and the purine. The compounds were screened for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as representative Gram+ and Gram− bacteria, and for cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells. Several potent antimycobacterials were identified. These compounds probably act by a novel and selective mechanism; they exhibit low toxicity toward other bacteria as well as mammalian cells.

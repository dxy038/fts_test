Access to the information superhighway has been extended to aircraft in flight. This was made possible by the development of an aeronautical-mobile, high gain satellite-tracking antenna. The main objective of the antenna development was to provide a demonstration of aeronautical satellite communications that might be deemed commercially viable. This implies a number of related objectives. Video or full graphic applications (common uses of the new information super highway) are the most attractive form of entertainment or computer communications and require a high data rate. A high data rate requires a high-gain antenna with a narrow beamwidth, and that requires a precise satellite tracking system. Installation on an aircraft implies that the antenna must present a minimal aerodynamic impact, so it must not protrude much outside the fuselage. Furthermore, any modifications to a commercial aircraft require a formal, tedious FAA approval, and commercial airliners desire a quick installation so that aircraft down-time is minimized. An antenna design that accommodates a simple installation is very desirable in those regards. An attractively low cost is certainly an objective for commercial viability. We believe that we have achieved all these objectives with the antenna system described.

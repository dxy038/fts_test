The objective of this paper is to present an implementation of a system in which a data glove worn on a human hand is interfaced with a robot. A controlling program translates the movements done by the glove into robotic motion. This implementation may have future prospects in remote handling in a protected or hazardous factory environment. The equipment used in this implementation were two robots and their controllers, a data glove and itÂ´s controller, an X-Y glove sensor system and a personal computer

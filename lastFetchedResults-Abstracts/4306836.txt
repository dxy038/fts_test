Today, electromagnetic compatibility seems to be one of the major constraints of power electronics converters and especially for variable speed drives. Unfortunately, it is too often regarded as the last phase of the development of a converter since it represents the last step of its marketing. The estimation of conducted and radiated disturbances by simulation offers a considerable gain from the economic point of view. This work shows how relatively simple models can be used to forecast EMC, taking into account various control strategies. These models are validated on an experimental setup, and can be used during the design of a variable speed inverter motor association. The objective is to approach by "fast" simulations the conducted emission to consider optimization processes. It is then imperative to take into account the environment of the converter which implies the modeling of cables, motors and naturally filters.

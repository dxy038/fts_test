Design trade-offs between state consistency and system response time are commonplace in virtual environments. Systems typically rely on predictive consistency algorithms such as dead-reckoning to control consistency and response time. Dead-reckoning error threshold selection determines the consistency/response time trade-off. We extend this trade-off space to explicitly account for the concept of system fairness. We derive a multi-objective optimization problem and apply multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to solve for Pareto optimal error thresholds.

RFID, Radio Frequency Identification is an inexpensive technology, can be implemented for several applications such as security, asset tracking, people tracking, inventory detection, access control applications. The main objective of this paper is to design and implement a digital security system which can deploy in secured zone where only authentic person can be entered. We implemented a security system containing door locking system using passive type of RFID which can activate, authenticate, and validate the user and unlock the door in real time for secure access. The advantage of using passive RFID is that it functions without a battery and passive tags are lighter and are less expensive than the active tags. A centralized system manages the controlling, transaction and operation task. The door locking system functions in real time as the door open quickly when user put their tag in contact of reader. The system also creates a log containing check-in and check-out of each user along with basic information of user.

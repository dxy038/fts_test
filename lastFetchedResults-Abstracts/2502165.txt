centers of health tourism in the region. Due to the important role of the health tourism industry in the global economy and the
capabilities of Yazd Province, Iran, in this industry, the purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate barriers to the
development of health tourism in this province.

were familiar with the health tourism industry in Yazd Province. The data collection tool was a questionnaire. The reliability and
validity of the questionnaire were confirmed by experts in the field of health tourism and through a review of literature similar
researches. First, the barriers to development of health tourism were identified through literature review. Then, using the Shannon
entropy, the importance of each barrier was identified and they were ranked using multi-objective optimization and Fuzzy VIKOR

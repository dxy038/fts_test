In this research paper, along the lines of the goal of constructive neural networks, a novel neural network, as an alternative to Multi Layer Perceptron is proposed. Based on the idea of one step associative memories, a novel bidirectional one step associative memory is proposed. Also, an interconnected array of associative memories is proposed. Along the lines of logical basis of Hopfield neural network, two linear/non-linear dynamical systems are proposed.

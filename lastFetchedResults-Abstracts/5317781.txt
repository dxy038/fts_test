Prematurely born babies usually suffer from the treat of a nutrition deficiency problem. Total parental nutrition (TPN) has been one of the major treatments commonly used by clinicians to improve their nutritional needs. This paper described the application of an artificial neuromolecluar (ANM) chip to a database of prematurely born babies who received TPN. The objective was to investigate the weight changes of these babies from a number of factors that might affect their weight. Experimental results showed that the ANM chip achieved satisfactory results, outperforming the back-propagation neural networks.

The off-axis axial ratios and the radiation patterns of conical log spiral models have been examined experimentally at a single frequency with the objective of finding a circularly polarized antenna of small physical height, suitable for use in decametric dual-polarized riometers. Truncation of a narrow-cone-angle spiral produced rapid axial-ratio degradation below <img alt="0.75 \\lambda" src="/images/tex/13451.gif"/> height in tests performed at 960 MHz. A wide-cone-angle configuration was found, however, with all the characteristics desired, particularly axial ratio <img alt="\\cong 1.25" src="/images/tex/13452.gif"/> out to <img alt="50\\deg" src="/images/tex/1057.gif"/> zenith angle, with height only <img alt="0.16 \\lambda" src="/images/tex/13453.gif"/> .

Robot end-effector compliance is useful in robotic automation and robots with flexible limbs have been shown to provide the needed end-effector compliance. In this paper, the authors review several methods for completely solving the beam deflection curve of very flexible beams undergoing large deflections with the objective of compensating for these deflections. A simple numeric method is introduced. The authors then explore the feasibility of using a neural network to perform the nonlinear mapping between the load and the resulting beam curve parameters

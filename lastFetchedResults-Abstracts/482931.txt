This amount was 33.9% in women with male fetus (p< 0.0001). Ketonuria >3+ (P<0.016), Hyponatremia (P<0.035), Hyperuremia (P0.045) were 16.5 %, 41.8 %, 62.6% in the first group and this amount were 3.4%, 23.7%, and 3.61% in the second group. 84.6% of women with female fetus and 64.4% of women with male fetus hospitalized in their first trimester (p=0.006).

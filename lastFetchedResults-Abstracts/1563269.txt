In this paper, we prove a general version of Ekeland's variational principle in locally convex spaces, where perturbations contain subadditive functions of topology generating seminorms and nonincreasing functions of the objective function. From this, we obtain a number of special versions of Ekeland's principle, which include all the known extensions of the principle in locally convex spaces. Moreover, we give a general criterion for judging the density of extremal points in the general Ekeland's principle, which extends and improves the related known results.

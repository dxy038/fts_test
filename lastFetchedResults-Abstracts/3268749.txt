Electricity demand is increasing worldwide: the demand for larger and increased number of multiple bundle conductors power lines is required on major transmission networks &amp; UHV Power Lines, both AC &amp; DC. New generation HTLS conductors are becoming more and more popular and reconductoring stringing operations are becoming more frequent all around the world, due to the aging of existing power lines. Objective of manufacturers is to design and manufacture transmission stringing equipments able to meet the new demand, in terms of multiple bundle stringing processes by stringing all the conductors in the same bundle at the same time, large diameter conductor and new generation HTLS conductor stringing operations, providing machinery with diversity for any size project.

Summary form only given, as follows. This paper discusses the application of an AC side active power filter in HVDC schemes involving capacitor commutated converters. A suitable topology and control algorithm is selected to achieve the necessary objective of filtering the lower order characteristic harmonics. The dependence of the filterÂ´s rating on parameters such as the extent of de-tuning of its passive elements is investigated. The performance of this filter in a capacitor commutated converter application is evaluated using an electromagnetic transient simulation program.

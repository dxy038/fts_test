The vehicle routing problem is the fundamental problem in distribution management, and in
general it includes a set of problems in which a number of vehicles located in one or many depots
should meet and service to a set of customers, each requiring a certain amount of demands. On the
other hand, in most real world problems especially in logistics area we face multi-objective problems.
When looking for objectives, often objectives counteract and this is why considering multi-objective
problem can be efficient. In the competitive world there is a lot of attention to customer satisfaction.
Therefore, we should attempt to provide models that consider more needs of customers. One of the
most important factors for customers is providing the request timely. In this study, customers have
multiple demands; therefore a new mixed integer programming model for vehicle routing is presented
by combining concepts of time windows and multiple demands, and with two objectives: minimizing
total travel cost and maximizing demand coverage. Some of the generated instances are solved by
GAMS software to evaluate the new proposed model.

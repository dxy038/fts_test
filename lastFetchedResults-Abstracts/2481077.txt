ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common problems during the neonatal period. Despite the severe complications of jaundice, no reliable data is available regarding the prevalence of acute and chronic complications of jaundice and the predisposing factors in our community. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the complications of neonatal jaundice and the predisposing factors in neonates.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on icteric, term newborns with bilirubin level higher than 20 mg/dl, referring to Ghaem Hospital during 2003-2013. After history taking and physical examinations, developmental status of infants was followed within six and twelve months after birth, using Denver Developmental Screening Test-II. The newborns were divided into two groups, based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of complications (e.g., acute or chronic kernicterus, auditory disorders and developmental disorders). Afterwards, predisposing factors for these complications were evaluated.  
FINDINGS Complications of jaundice were reported in 143 (13.37%) out of 1069 neonates. The two groups were not significantly different in terms of variables such as neonatal age and gender or maternal age. However, there was a significant difference between the children with and withod complication regarding treatment modality and mean total serum bilirubin level (27 mg/dl vs. 32 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). The predisposing factors for neonatal complications were as follows: idiopathic jaundice (30%), ABO incompatibility (18%), Rh incompatibility (14.8%), G6PD deficiency (12.6%) and sepsis (3.3%).
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that ABO incompatibility, Rh incompatibility and G6PD deficiency were the most common risk factors for jaundice, followed by idiopathic jaundice.
KEY WORDS: Kernicterus, Developmental Disorders, Hearing Loss, Jaundice, Hemolysis.

The numerical annotations constitute an added value for the learning objects. They add knowledge to the original contents of these objects. The state of the art relative to these annotations is consolidating this point of view. Interactions of the reader, its criticisms, its remarks and its syntheses have the same interest as the original contents. Our objective is to benefit from these annotations and knowledge included. The question which arises how can we share this knowledge if all the annotations are implemented on heterogeneous servers relative to the same learning object. The study of the characteristics and tools used for the annotations show that the sharing is impossible because of the incompatibilities and the heterogeneities between these tools. In order to solve these incompatibilities, we are proposing a system labeled SA WHOT for wrapping and integrating heterogeneous annotations sources through a top-level ontology.

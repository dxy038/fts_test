Background and Objective: The evaluation of educational institutions' performance is an appropriate benchmark for making functional modification and improving the efficiency in such institutions. In order to achieve this important target, the researchers conducted a survey in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Zanjan University of Medical Sciences to explore students' viewpoints as the recipients of educational services to find out the department's strengths and weaknesses. 
Materials and Methods: This is a survey research. A questionnaire was used to gather data. Sampling was based on a census method.
Results: Availability of the faculty was rated high, but their flexibility, interactivity, sensitivity, and their ability to transfer knowledge was considered average by the students. Furthermore, the Friedman test confirmed the differences of the results (99% confidence level).
Conclusion: Active physical presence, availability and sensitivity to human relations from the studentsâ€™ point of view were assessed to be very good. This can be enhanced by holding journal clubs and hospital CPC sessions regularly as well as recruiting new members for the Department.

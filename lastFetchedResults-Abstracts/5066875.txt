This paper proposes a new switching pattern generating algorithm based on SVM (space vector modulation) technique for a high-frequency link soft-switching converter. Because of its totally soft-switched operation, isolated output stage and bidirectional power flow, the proposed converter system is suited for interfacing a new energy system, such as a PV (photovoltaic) system having a battery, with AC system line. The restriction of output vector transition in applying SVM technique is discussed first. Then, a suitable pattern which satisfies soft-switching operation is proposed. The validity of the proposed scheme has been proved with simulation study using PSIM and experimental results with DSP based prototype system

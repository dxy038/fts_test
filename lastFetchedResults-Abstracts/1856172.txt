The PERT/CPM network techniques are based on the assumption that all needed resources will be available. The scarcity of resources is a usual reason for project delays. For the solution of the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) other methods have been applied. The objective of these methods consists in minimizing the projectâ€™s duration by considering both the precedence and resource constraints. Project Management software packages solve the resource conflicts using resource levelling. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of resource levelling tools of three popular packages by comparing the results when levelling two real construction projects as case studies.

Background and objective: Intravascular catheters continue to be one of the main sources of hospital- acquired bacteremia especially in high risk wards such as Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs). These infections can longer the hospitalization period and increase morbidity- mortality in hospitals. PlanectaÂ® (JMS Co., Ltd.) system is a close infusion system that has some profits: being needleless, easy to use, increasing the rate of infusion and elimination the dead space. We have compared the frequency of catheter related systemic infections with new hub device, Planecta, vs. conventional system.

Materials and methods: This clinical trial study was performed on hospitalized patients in PICU ward at Mofid Children Hospital after dividing them into two random groups based on the bed numbers from Jan 2007 to Aug 2007. A Planecta system (6 parts) was used for interventional group and the conventional method for comparing group. The rate of sepsis due to catheterization was assessed according to NNISS criteria.

Results: 254 patients were included with 99 in intervention and 155 in comparing group. There was no report of catheter related systemic infection in both groups. Median hospitalization period in Planecta group (4 days) was similar to comparing group (3days) (p-value=0.67). Overall mortality rate in two groups was equivalent too (22.2% and 16.8% respectively, p-value=0.28).

Conclusion: According to the results, it seems that Planecta wouldn't be cost-benefit as a device for reducing catheterization related systemic complications for all patients. Further studies should be done on special patients and applications such as infusion of viscous fluids and blood transfusion.

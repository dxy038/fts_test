BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections are an ongoing concern in the medical-healthcare industry, especially in high-risk areas such as the surgical environment, reception/admittance, and wherever there are immunocompromised patients. Aspergillosis fatality rates can be as high as 85% in bone marrow transplant patients and 55% in leukemia patients. Complicating the issue is the fact that hospitals tend to be home to more anti-resistant bacteria than other settings.

OBJECTIVE: To reduce the amount of airborne bacteria and fungi in the medical/healthcare setting and/or compliment existing airflow and filtering systems, thereby reducing the risk of infection caused by airborne pathogens.

METHODS: A new Air Quality Improvement system's ability to kill airborne bacteria and fungi was tested in four medical/healthcare settings: ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgery/treatment area; outpatient surgery center; hospital operating room; and a pediatrician's sick and well waiting rooms. The new technology used in the study uses a patented combination of germicidal ultraviolet light and a proprietary formula of titanium-based photocatalyst to kill and mineralize airborne pathogens.

RESULTS: The technology was able to consistently reduce airborne bacteria and fungi in the ENT surgery/treatment area by 69% and to reduce airborne bacteria in the outpatient surgery center by 92%, in the hospital operating room by 85%, and the pediatrician's sick and well waiting rooms by 47% and 70%, respectively.

CONCLUSION: The patented Air Quality Improvement system studied is effective in reducing the airborne bacteria and fungi in various medical/healthcare settings and was proven to compliment existing airflow and filtering systems.

Heart disease has become the top three deaths for over 20 years, with the mortality of approximately 85,000 cases per year or 236 cases per day. Most are the elderly. Therefore, the objective of this study is to produce an equipment to assist this group of patients. The equipment comprises 3 major components including an electrical signal data receiver from heart with a chest string containing ECG pole. The data will be sent further to a microcontroller for being processed in order to calculate the rate of heartbeat. In case that an abnormal heartbeat is detected, the system will send a warning signal to the patientÂ´s physician or relative with a short message service (SMS) via a mobile phone network. With the use of GSM Module from an experiment to find the rate of heartbeat between the device proposed and OMRON SEM-1, a machine for measuring the rate of heartbeat used at a hospital, the experiment has indicated that the average rate of heartbeat measured by the machine proposed has fluctuated for less than 2% compared with that of OMRON SEM-1. Moreover, the system can detect the abnormal rate of heartbeat with 100% accuracy. In addition, the warning signal can be sent to the physician or the relative just in time.

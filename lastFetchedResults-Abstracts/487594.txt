Data were analyzed by Independent T Test, ANOVA, Kruskai Wallis and Mann Whitney. Results: There were significant differences between two groups in respect to all the Grice's cooperative principles (PcO.OOl), maxim of quantity (P<0.001), maxim of relevance (P<0.001) and maxim of manner (P=0.02), but in maxim of quality there was no significant differeance (P=0.07).

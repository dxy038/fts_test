The present study was conducted with the objective to compare growth rates in Acipenser persicus (Persian sturgeon) and Acipenser ruthenus (Sterlet sturgeon) in aquaria at the International Sturgeon Research Institute for the first time in Iran. A total of 30 A. persicus and A. ruthenus with the initial weight of 26.6 ± 4.9 g (mean ±SD)  and 29 ± 3.7 g (mean ±SD), respectively were randomly distributed in six 120 L aquaria. The sturgeons were fed a formulated diet, with 48 % protein, 18 % lipid and 20 % carbohydrate, with less than 10 % moisture. Depending on temperature, feeding rate was changed from 1 to 1.5 % of body weights. Fish were fed twice a day. To determine the fish growth rates in aquaria, data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. The analysis of variance revealed that there were no significant differences in FCR, Final  weight, SGR, Gr and   BWI % among treatments after 270 days of rearing (P < 0.05). At the end of the experiment, Persian Sturgeon reached an average weight of 182 ± 28 g and Sterlet sturgeon reached an average weight of 180.7 ± 34 g. Results obtained from total length were as the same as weight results. Also based on the feeding indices (FCR, SGR, BWI and GR) in this study, rearing of Persian and Serlet sturgeons in aquaria was more acceptable. However, there were no significant effects among growth and feeding parameters. Although the feeding of these two sturgeon species is related to dry formulated diets, results obtained from this study revealed that Persian and Sterlet sturgeons can grow up to 612% and 533% of their initial weights. No mortality was observed in experimental treatments during the rearing period.

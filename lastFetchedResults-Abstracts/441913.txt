We report intraoperative balloon angioplasty for recurrent aortic coarctation in hypoplastic left heart syndrome. After bidirectional Glenn anastomosis, balloon angioplasty was performed via ascending aorta. Pressure gradient across the coarctation decreased from 45 to 8 mm Hg. Intravascular ultrasound revealed successful splits of thickened intima without any extensive dissection. Intraoperative balloon angioplasty is a safe and favorable procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome because balloon inflation before bidirectional Glenn anastomosis could induce serious ventricular collapse or arrhythmias.

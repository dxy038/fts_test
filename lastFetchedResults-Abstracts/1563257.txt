The zero duality gap that underpins the duality theory is one of the central ingredients in optimisation. In convex programming, it means that the optimal values of a given convex program and its associated dual program are equal. It allows, in particular, the development of efficient numerical schemes. However, the zero duality gap property does not always hold even for finite-dimensional problems and it frequently fails for problems with non-polyhedral constraints such as the ones in semidefinite programming problems. Over the years, various criteria have been developed ensuring zero duality gaps for convex programming problems. In the present work, we take a broader view of the zero duality gap property by allowing it to hold for each choice of linear perturbation of the objective function of the given problem. Globalising the property in this way permits us to obtain complete geometric dual characterisations of a stable zero duality gap in terms of epigraphs and conjugate functions. For convex semidefinite programs, we establish necessary and sufficient dual conditions for stable zero duality gaps, as well as for a universal zero duality gap in the sense that the zero duality gap property holds for each choice of constraint right-hand side and convex objective function. Zero duality gap results for second-order cone programming problems are also given. Our approach makes use of elegant conjugate analysis and Fenchel's duality.

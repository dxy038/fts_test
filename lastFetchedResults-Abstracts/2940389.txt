A new algebraic method for the design of conventional QMF banks is proposed. The method uses a self-convolution technique to reformulate a 4th-order objective function whose minimization leads to the design of QMF banks. It is shown that the reformulated optimization problem can be solved iteratively with improved computation efficiency compared to several existing design methods. It is also shown that the method can be extended to design both linear phase QMF banks and QMF banks with low-reconstruction delay. Two examples are included to illustrate the design method proposed.

Objective Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to automatically measure the quality degradation perceived by human eyes. In this paper, a new reduced-reference image quality assessment algorithm for JPEG distortion (distortion specific metric) has been proposed. This algorithm uses an 8&#215;8 block of the original image (as a reduced-reference) and embeds this block as a watermark. To assess the quality of the image this block is extracted from the watermarked distorted image and is compared with the corresponding block from the same image. Proposed scheme results in the quality factor with which an image was originally compressed, hence gives a direct measure for quality.

For some challenges about water trade price, water-saving coefficients, approach and so on in application of multi-objective model for optimal allocation of water resources with two-story structure, this paper puts forward the solution to the bi-level programming model of the optimal allocation of water resources, which assigns values about water trade price of and coefficient of water-saving via random-points in a certain range, and applies genetic algorithm to solve the upper-story programming, and uses simplex method to solve the lower-story programming. It comparative studies solution and application from solution ideas, method design, calculation results, and so on, and puts forward some challenging issues for study.

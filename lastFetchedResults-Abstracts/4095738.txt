A depth image-based rendering (DIBR) approach with advanced inpainting methods is presented. The DIBR algorithm can be used in 3-D video applications to synthesize a number of different perspectives of the same scene, e.g., from a multiview-video-plus-depth (MVD) representation. This MVD format consists of video and depth sequences for a limited number of original camera views of the same natural scene. Here, DIBR methods allow the computation of additional new views. An inherent problem of the view synthesis concept is the fact that image information which is occluded in the original views may become visible, especially in extrapolated views beyond the viewing range of the original cameras. The presented algorithm synthesizes these occluded textures. The synthesizer achieves visually satisfying results by taking spatial and temporal consistency measures into account. Detailed experiments show significant objective and subjective gains of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.

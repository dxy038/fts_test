In this article, a time-varying controller for a mobile networked controlled system is designed. The controller architecture relies on an LQR-output feedback scheme. The parameters of the LQR-based cost are adjusted according to the communication latency. The tuning of these weights is accomplished via an LMI-approach, where the objective is to provide a closed-loop system with a specific prescribed stability despite the current measured data-packet transmission-delay. The overall scheme resembles that of a gain-scheduled controller, where the tuning of its gains indirectly depends on the communication latency. Experimental results are offered to highlight the efficacy of the proposed scheme.

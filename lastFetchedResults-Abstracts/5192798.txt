Proposes a hybrid algorithm for scheduling non-preemptive, single operation jobs in a multiclass production environment. The objective is to minimize the sum of the total weighted tardiness and setup costs of the schedule. The authors believe the problem is NP hard, and use an efficient suboptimal algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation and simulated annealing. The authorsÂ´ algorithm works well for a variety of scheduling problems

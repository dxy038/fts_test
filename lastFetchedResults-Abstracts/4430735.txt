This paper presents a way to control a DC-DC Boost converter by a robust controller embedded in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Normally, when the converter works for some time, the converter´s inductive and capacitive components suffer heating, causing an increase on the converter´s output resistance. This problem changes the system´s operating point, contributing directly in output power loss. The main objective of this work is to synthetize a robust controller embedded in FPGA that minimizes the effects of load variations and input voltage variations. The main objective of the controller is maintaining a constant voltage in the output load. The results showed that the robust control technique H<sub>&#8734;</sub> embedded in the FPGA minimized the effects of the uncertainties and the disturbances approximating the system output response to its operating point.

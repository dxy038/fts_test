The objective of context honeypot is to identify a probable privacy violator before he actually succeeds in capturing desired precious information. We believe that in the environment of robust implementation of privacy policy, privacy breaches can occur only through masquerading. Success of context honeypot depends on efficient luring (by using lure messages) of probable privacy violator. Lure messages are built by using real and fake data in such a way that the probable violator remains oblivious of being lured. In this paper, we propose a lure model and an architecture for generating lure messages.

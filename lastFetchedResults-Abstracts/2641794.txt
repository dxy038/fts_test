Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate validity and reliability of the Persian version of Coronary Artery Disease Education Questionnaire (CADE-Q).
Methods: This was a methodological study on 300 patients with coronary artery disease. After translating, content validity and face validity of the questionnaire were carried out qualitatively. Then, known groups comparison (in terms of education) and criterion validity (correlation between Persian version of CADE-Q and HADS scale) were carried out to examine validity. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency analysis and test re-test analyses.
Results: The instrument showed significant differences among patients who differed in education. The mean knowledge of patients with higher education was significantly higher than other patients. Criterion validity showed a significant correlation between CADE-Q Persian version and HADS scale (r = 0. 862). The internal consistency as measured by Cronbachâ€™s alpha was 0.843. The intraclass correlation coefficient to test stability with a two-week interval was 0.900.
Conclusion: The findings indicated that the Iranian version of CADE-Q has satisfactory psychometric properties. The questionnaire, now can be used in different situations, including clinical and research environments.

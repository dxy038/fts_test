In this paper, a supervised fuzzy clustering RBF neural network (SFC-RBFNN) based on kernel PCA is introduced for constructing the fabric sewability evaluation system. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system could efficiently be used as an objective seam pucker evaluation system with high accuracy and is robust for various structures and mechanical properties of middle-thickness woolen fabric.

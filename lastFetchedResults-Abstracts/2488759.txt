Objective: Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue should be considered as an
important factor for fertility preservation in young boys with cancer. The objective of this
study is to investigate whether immature testicular tissue of mice can be successfully
cryopreserved using a simple vitrification procedure to maintain testicular cell viability,
proliferation, and differentiation capacity.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, immature mice testicular tissue fragments
(0.5-1 mmÂ²) were vitrified-warmed in order to assess the effect of vitrification on
testicular tissue cell viability. Trypan blue staining was used to evaluate developmental
capacity. Vitrified tissue (n=42) and fresh (control, n=42) were ectopically transplanted
into the same strain of mature mice (n=14) with normal immunity. After 4 weeks, the graft
recovery rate was determined. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to evaluate
germ cell differentiation, immunohistochemistry staining by proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) antibody, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-
End Labeling (TUNEL) assay for proliferation and apoptosis frequency.
Results: Vitrification did not affect the percentage of cell viability. Vascular anastomoses
was seen at the graft site. The recovery rate of the vitrified graft did not significantly differ
with the fresh graft. In the vitrified graft, germ cell differentiation developed up to the secondary
spermatocyte, which was similar to fresh tissue. Proliferation and apoptosis in the
vitrified tissue was comparable to the fresh graft.
Conclusion: Vitrification resulted in a success rates similar to fresh tissue (control) in
maintaining testicular cell viability and tissue function. These data provided further evidence
that vitrification could be considered an alternative for cryopreservation of immature
testicular tissue.

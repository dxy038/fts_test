Diesel particulate filter (DPF) is being the dispensable post-treatment device reducing particulate emissions. The objective of this investigation was to develop and formulate diesel particulate filter radial pressure drop and filtration efficiency distribution model, based on microcosmic velocity distribution and capturing mechanism. DPFÂ´s pressure drop and filtration efficiency with different divergence angle, entrance velocity, channel width, wall thickness, are compared. The conclusion shows that the filtration efficiency of 7.5 nm diameter particles is highest, and the efficiency decreases while the particle diameter increases, until near 240 nm diameter particles, and increases with particles diameter increasing to 1&#956;m continuously. With decaying entrance velocity, channel width, and increasing wall thickness, radial location, the filtration efficiencies of different size particles ascend with different range.

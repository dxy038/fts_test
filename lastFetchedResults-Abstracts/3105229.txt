This paper deals with the quasi-continuous high order sliding mode controller and arbitrary order robust sliding mode differentiator to drive a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The control objective is to perform accurate tracking the motor position using these kinds of technology. The motor velocity is obtained via robust exact differentiation. The efficiency of the proposed quasi-continuous high order sling mode is illustrated on a Matlab/Simulink simulator.

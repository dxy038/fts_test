Creativity is an important issue in the world of collaboration and it is widely accepted that techniques of creativity can energize participants and improve effectiveness of meetings. Specifically these techniques have been applied to `creative problem solving´. This paper analyses why it can be difficult to be creative in conventional meetings and describes some current techniques for encouraging creativity. The paper then suggests that some of the features of Electronic Meetings naturally improve creativity and describes some research to measure creativity in meetings. A working agenda for creative problem solving in an Electronic Meeting is described. Creativity not an end in itself; creativity is a means to an end. The final objective of `creative problem solving´ is to get better results for the organization (e.g. increased profits, improved customer service, reduced cost, protection of the environment)

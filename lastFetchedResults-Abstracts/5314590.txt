The optimal motion generation problem is solved subject to actuator constraints while the motion is constrained to an arbitrary path. The considered objective function is a weighted time energy function. Existing methods consider only the time-optimal problem. We present some simulation results using a mathematical programming technique (sequential quadratic programming) existing in the NPSOL software. Then, a comparative study is made between existing methods and the proposed technique

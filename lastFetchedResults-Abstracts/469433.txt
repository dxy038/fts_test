Objective
The purpose of this study was to analyze our initial 10-year experience with laparoscopy and to determine risk factors for complications and conversions to laparotomy for technical difficulty.
Study design
We reviewed the charts of all laparoscopic procedures from January 1991 through December 2000 and divided the procedures into 4 levels on the basis of the degree of difficulty: level I, diagnostic; level II, procedures on the uterus and/or adnexa; level III, second look operations for malignancy; and level IV, lymphadenectomies/other complex procedures. Complications were graded from 1 (mild) to 5 (death). Standard univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.
Results
We identified 1451 evaluable procedures. The number of complications was as follows: grades 1 to 5, 129 complications (9%); grades 3 to 5, 36 complications (2.5%). On multivariate analysis, older age (P = .03), previous radiation (P = .03), and malignancy (P = .006) were associated with an increased risk of complications grades 3 to 5. Complication rates for grades 3 to 5 for patients with malignancy versus benign disease was 4% versus 1%, respectively. Technical difficulty led to conversion to laparotomy in 105 cases (7%). Previous abdominal surgery (P< .001) significantly increased the rate of conversion to laparotomy; more complex, higher procedure levels were associated with a significant decrease in conversions (P = .005).
Conclusion
Both simple and complex laparoscopic procedures can be performed by a gynecologic oncology service with a low rate of complications and conversions to laparotomy. Older age, malignancy, previous radiation therapy, and previous abdominal surgery were identified as significant risk factors for complications and/or conversion and should be taken into account in patient selection, preoperative counseling, and surgical planning.

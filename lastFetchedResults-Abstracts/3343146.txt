In this paper, based on the modified Jiles-Atherton model, the effects of eddy current and temperature were taken into account to study the hysteresis characteristic of any point on B-H loops. Then, as long as the initial demagnetization point is known from voltage and current waveforms in practice, the terminal of demagnetization, or the residual flux, can be determined. A low-frequency degaussing method is introduced to reduce the source power, but it´ll take more time when compared with the degaussing under the normal frequency. Accordingly, the multi objective programming approach was adopted to determine an optimal frequency trading off between power demands and degaussing time. What´s more, to assess the effectiveness of both residual flux measuring and degaussing methods, an experiment platform was built eventually.

In this paper a new approach for polyphonic piano note onset transcription is presented. It is based on a recurrent neural network to simultaneously detect the onsets and the pitches of the notes from spectral features. Long Short-Term Memory units are used in a bidirectional neural network to model the context of the notes. The use of a single regression output layer instead of the often used one-versus-all classification approach enables the system to significantly lower the number of erroneous note detections. Evaluation is based on common test sets and shows exceptional temporal precision combined with a significant boost in note transcription performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. The system is trained jointly with various synthesized piano instruments and real piano recordings and thus generalizes much better than existing systems.

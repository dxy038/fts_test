Vehicle routing optimization problem with time constraint is researched in this paper and a hybrid optimization algorithm-PBIL combined with ant algorithm is proposed and applied to VRP. The objective function is to minimize the cost and reduce the loss caused by customerspsila time restriction. The probability matrix of PBIL algorithm is modified with the positive feedback and information disappearing mechanisms of ant algorithm. Also, the probability statistics for the road traffic status distributed is considered in decision-making for the vehiclespsila routing. The hybrid intelligent evolutionary algorithm is tested on Jingyuanda Logistics Company and the good validity, accuracy, and stability performance are fully proved.

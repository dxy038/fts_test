Objective.  To examine the hypothesis that the differences reported in incidence of osteoarthrosis in Chinese and Caucasians could be associated with differences in habitual gait.

Design. The effects of race and age on walking speed and heelstrike transient were examined.

Background. The relatively low incidence of gonarthrosis in Chinese populations compared to Caucasians remains unexplained. Repetitive impulsive loading exhibited at heel strike in the walking process has been linked to the development of gonarthrosis, while the gait characteristics of people at different risk levels for gonarthrosis have not been compared quantitatively.

Methods. The gait of 117 healthy women, 76 Chinese and 41 Caucasians, was studied with an optometric system and two force plates in an 8-m walkway. Natural walking speed, stride length, cadence and maximum loading rate at heelstrike were collected.

Results. The Caucasian women over age 45 walked significantly faster with significantly higher maximal loading rate than age-matched Chinese women (P<0.005). Age effects on most gait parameters measured were found significant in the Chinese group (P<0.01) but not in the Caucasian group.

Conclusions. Chinese women slow down their walking speed and reduce the cadence of their gait earlier in their life span and, thus, lower their heelstrike transients. Significant racial differences in gait might explain the lower prevalence of gonarthrosis reported in Chinese women.

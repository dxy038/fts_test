In this paper polarization adaptivity on transmit has been used to enhance the received signals directed to a pre-selected receiver in a near-field multi-input multi-output (MIMO) environment. The objective here is to select a set of weights on the transmitting antennas adapted to each receiver based on the principles of reciprocity. Using the polarization properties, when the number of receiving antennas is greater than the number of transmitting antennas, the transmitted signal may be directed more to a particular receiver location while simultaneously minimizing the reception signal strength at other receivers. A numerical simulation has been made to illustrate the novelty of the proposed approach.

The growing demands for channel capacity is urging the utilisation of higher frequency bands. Attention is drawn towards the Ka frequency band for satellite communication services in order to accommodate new increasing demand and services. The beacon package on board OLYMPUS provides an opportunity for long term investigation into the propagation characteristics of the atmosphere at 12.5, 20 and 30 GHz. The overall objective of the propagation study is to produce reliable information on slant path attenuation and depolarisation introduced to the radiowaves by the propagating medium. to observe the effects of rain at 20 GHz, experimental arrangements for beacon and rain data have been made at the University of Surrey for copolar and crosspolar measurements. OLYMPUS satellite lost its orbital control in May 1991 and was restored in August 1991. In the absence of OLYMPUS the propagation measurements were continued using Russian satellite, MAYAK

For several years faculty members in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Physics at North Dakota State University have been creating new courses or substantially revising existing courses in order to better serve current industrial needs and foster regional economic development. In particular, three new courses have been developed with this objective: ECE 455/655 Designing for Electromagnetic Compatibility, ECE 453/ 653 Signal Integrity, and Physics 499/696, Optics for Scientists and Engineers. These and other courses position the institution to be a vital part in the development of engineering companies in the region.

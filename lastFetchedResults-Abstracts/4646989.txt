In this paper, an objective assessment model based on three-component weighted structural similarity is presented for stereoscopic image. Since different distortions affect details of stereoscopic image differently, the image is classified into three kinds of regions including edge, smooth and texture regions so that different weights are associated to different regions to assess distorted stereoscopic image. The experimental results show that the assessment scores are consistent with subjective stereoscopic perception when stereoscopic image is degraded by blur, white noise, JPEG and JPEG 2000 process. Thus the objective assessment results can well reflect the image quality and stereoscopic perception.

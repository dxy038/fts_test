Objective To identify cause-of-death categories in which
suicides might be misclassified in Taiwan.
Methods Weplotted secular trends (1971–2007) in sex- and
method-specific rates of deaths classified as suicide, undetermined
intent and accident for the Taiwanese population
aged 15? and compared the sex, age and marital status profiles
of deaths in these three categories by method of death.
Results The demographic profiles of registered suicides
generally resembled those for deaths of undetermined intent
and accidents by pesticide poisoning/suffocation but differed
from those for accidents from non-pesticide poisoning/
drowning/falling/poisoning by non-domestic gas. For the
period 1990–2007, suicide rates based on suicides alone
(14.8 per 100,000) would increase by 23, 7 and 1%,
respectively, when including deaths of undetermined intent,
accidental pesticide poisonings and accidental suffocations.
Conclusions Suicide rates may be underestimated by more
than 30% in Taiwan because some suicides are ‘hidden’
amongst deaths certified as due to other causes.

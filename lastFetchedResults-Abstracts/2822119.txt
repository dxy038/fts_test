The primary objective of designing the hand exoskeleton is to include a controllable degree of freedom (D.O.F) of the finger joints with minimum number of actuation modes. This paper describes the design and development of a multi D.O.F. hand-exoskeleton based on the rehabilitation criteria of an amputee to achieve different hand gestures on the passive amputee hand. The design contains 3 D.O.F finger links along with a separate flexion and extension of the wrist joint. The feedback sensors allow the exoskeleton to achieve perfect gripping as well as different hand gestures defined as classes in the library.

To assess civil servants´ performance involves a number of indices, each index weight is difficult to identify and the result is tend to be interfered by subjective factors. Therefore, the Projection Pursuit Classification Model (PPC) and a Real coded Accelerating Genetic Algorithm (RAGA) are presented to convert the problem from multi-dimensional to one-dimensional subspace and solve the multi-dimensional global optimization problem. According to projection values assess civil servants´ performance. It is easy to make decision, the result is relatively objective, and the projection values are dispersed. PPC provides a new approach to assess the civil servants´ performance.

The irrigation water requirements of major crops and the total available water through canal and ground water in the command of Shahi Distributory was estimated. A linear programming model was formulated to suggest the optimal cropping pattern giving the maximum net return at different water availability levels. The objective function of the model was subject to the following constraints: total available water and land during different seasons, the minimum area under wheat and rice for local food requirements, farmersâ€™ socio-economic conditions, and preference to grow a particular crop in a specific area. This model gave the optimal cropping pattern for a command area of 11,818 ha at water availability levels of 100, 70 and 50 and net returns of Rs. 185, 146 and 114 million, respectively. It was found that the water available in the command area may support optimally 4981, 3560, 1817, 632, 355, 87 and 3653 ha of wheat, sugarcane, mustard, lentil, potato, chick pea, and rice, respectively, to get a maximum net return of Rs. 185 million at 100% water availability level. Wheat appears to provide the most consistent profit in the command area.

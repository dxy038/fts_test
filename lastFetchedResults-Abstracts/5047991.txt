Investigation of approaches to solving of one-dimensional inverse scattering problem of electromagnetic waves is presented in the paper. Two approaches were analysed in detail as alternative ways of inverse scattering problem solving. One of them is based on analytical solution of Riccati equation and other realizes minimization of objective function defined by character of inverse problem. Efficiency of investigated methods was estimated at the solving of both profile reconstruction and multilayered structures synthesis starting from frequency dependence of reflection coefficients.

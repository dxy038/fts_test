Water is the soul of life and law is the organizer of life. Although water crisis is not a new concern, recently, it has been an objective problem. Unwritten law and canonical rule has an old root in country, but formal law which is a necessary for modern society is the young one esp. law of water which refers to 1930s. The three most effective laws in the field of water are: law of “water and trends of its nationalization (1968)”, law of “justice distribution of water (1982)”, and recently, law of "Determination for illegal wells (2010)". The main objective of this research paper was to study and criticize the law of "Determination for illegal wells”. This research was a descriptive- correlational research using survey technique which was done during 2013 and 2014. Semi-structured questions were used for interview. Also questionnaire as research instrument included closed and open ended questions. Research population includes technical and legal affairs experts in Fars Regional Water Authority, official experts of lawcourt in field of Water and also judges for water subjects. Data was extracted in quantitative and qualitative methods. For inferential statistics and drawing diagram, SPSS20 and Excel2013 were used. According to findings, law of "Determination for illegal wells” is not environmentally friendly and cannot preserve groundwater and aquifer (6.4 out of 20), it is not a holistic law (6.7 out of 20), and it is practically a weak law (10.7 out of 20). Mann-Whitney U tests show that there are no significant differences between in viewpoint of experts about the preservative role of this law in regards of gender, education level and field of study. At the end, legal objections and executive challenges are discussed in details. Allocating this law for Non-banned areas, delivering a bill to the parliament for deleting or fundamental revising the law and also preparing the “holistic law for water”, are the suggestions.

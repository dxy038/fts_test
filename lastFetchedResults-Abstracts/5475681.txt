This paper conducts research on thermodynamic modeling of the fluidized bed gasification and exergoeconomic evaluation to determine the total cost of a combined heat and power system with pressurized fluidized bed gasifier. The paper presents use of multi-objective evolutionary optimization for the systemÂ´s total cost minimization and exergetic efficiency maximization, and has been compared to conventional iterative optimization method. It shows that by evaluating with conventional iterative optimization, exergetic efficiency of total system can reach to 56.09% while using multi-objective evolutionary optimization it is 53.32%. However the product cost achieved by evolutionary optimization is about 6.3% less than the value of iterative optimization.

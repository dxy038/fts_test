Background: The exogenous and endogenous B-carbolines, and some of their metabolites have a stimulating effect on the dopaminergic system.  B-carbolines can also improve learning and memory while increase hippocampal dopamine levels and dendritic and synaptic proliferation.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic administration of norharman on spatial learning and memory in rats. 
Methods: In this experimental study, 48 female wistar rats were randomly divided into control, alchohol and 4 norharmane groups. The control group were received no treatment. In alchohol and norharman groups, rats were received 0.2 ml alchohol or 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/kg norharman intraperitoneally for 5 days before tests and 5 days during tests. All rates were tested for spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze. Data were analyzed using student T-test, one way ANOVA and LSD as post hoc test. 
Findings: Norharman improved spatial learning in a dose dependent manner. The difference between the 4 mg/kg norharman group and the control group was statistically significant in the 2nd day. Norharman also improved spatial memory in which lower doses improved spatial memory more than higher doses. The difference between the 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg norharman groups was statistically significant.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, norharman as an endogenous bioactive molecule, might have a key role in the modulation of learning and memory functions.

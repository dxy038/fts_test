Fault monitoring is one of the main activities of fault tolerant distributed systems. It is required to determine the suspected/crashed component and proactively take the recovery steps to keep the system alive. The main objective of the fault monitoring activity is to quickly and correctly identify the faults. There are many techniques for fault monitoring which have general and specific parameters which influence their performance. In this paper we find the parameters that can help us classify the fault monitoring techniques. We created a benchmark ACI (adaptation, convergence, intelligence) and applied it on current techniques.

The objective of this work is to analyse the properties of samples of materials composed of cement mortar, and the various proportions and granulometries of Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Methylene crumb rubber (EPDMCR).

astic modulus, and compression and bending strength, were established. A study on the acoustic emission of micro fissures was done. Finally, the damping of each compound was determined.

sults allowed conclusions to be drawn on the influence of granulometry and percentage of rubber on the value of all the properties studied and the compromise solution that permits its use for certain applications.

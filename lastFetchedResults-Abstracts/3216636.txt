The objective of our work is to reconstruct the dense structure of a static scene observed by a monocular camera system following a known trajectory. Our main contribution is representated by the proposition of a TV-L<sup>1</sup> energy functional that estimates directly the unknown depth field given the camera motion, thus avoiding to estimate as an intermediate step an optical flow field with additional geometric constraints. Our method has two main interests: we highlight a practical minimal parametrization for the given assumptions (static scene, known camera motion) and we solve the resulting variational problem using an efficient, discontinuity preserving formulation.

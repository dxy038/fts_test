<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate the effect of Meperidine, commonly administered for labor analgesia, on newborn weight and peripartum breastfeeding during two months after delivery.<br /><strong>Materials and methods: </strong>This pilot cohort study was conducted between October 2010 and October 2011 at the Women Hospital of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. In this study, we examined the effects of meperidine on breastfeeding and neonatal weight. A total number of 184 full term pregnant women, planned to deliver at this center (normal vaginally delivery or cesarean), participated in this study. The study group included the women who received meperidine in peripartum time to be compared with a control group who did not receive any opioid. Meperidine was administrated to them based on their peripartum breastfeeding behaviour and baby weight, two month after delivery.<strong><br />Results: </strong>Of the 184 woman recruited to the trial, 38 women had normal vaginal delivery and 146 had ccesarean. Within the first two-month, 4% of mothers in control group and 11% of meperidine group used formula. However, this differences were not statistically significant (p value= 0.07). Furthermore, baby weight distribution was not statistically different between two groups.<strong><br />Conclusion: </strong>The inhibitory effect of using Meperidine on peripartum breastfeeding and weight of newborn in the first two months was not statistically significant in this study. More research is needed to clarify the association between meperidine and peripartum breastfeeding.</p>

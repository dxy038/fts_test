Objective
This study was undertaken to determine whether the use of hormonal contraception affects the adequacy of colposcopic examination of the cervix.
Study design
A retrospective chart review of patients seen in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Colposcopy Clinic from 2000-2002. Patient age, use of hormonal contraception, and adequacy of colposcopic examination were recorded for analysis.
Results
Of all the colposcopic records reviewed, 526 of 1156 met inclusion criteria. Study patients ranged in age from 14 to 51 years. The prevalence of the visible squamocolumnar junction ranged from 75% to 91%. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that both age and use of hormonal contraception significantly influence adequacy of colposcopic examination (P< .001, P = .001, respectively).
Conclusion
The use of combination oral contraceptives is associated with an increased likelihood of adequate colposcopy.

Objective(s): To determine Quality of life in Elderly women residing in Kahrizak Charity Foundation (KCF). Methods: The subjects of this descriptive-analytical study were 87 randomly selected elderly women living in KCF who were able to answer the questionnaire. Data collection was by interview and filling Lipad's questionnaire. Descriptive and analytical statistical methods such as Spearman's p, means, standard deviations and 2*2 contingency tables were used for data analysis.
Results: Most of the subjects were in the 65-74 and 75-84y age groups of years (35.4% in each group) with an overall mean age of 12.5 years. Most were illiterate (63.2%) and 88.5% had a monthly income of less than 50000 Rials; 71.8% were widows and 12.9% were divorced. Their standardized mean quality of life score was 54.62, with a standard deviation of 10.22. The quality of life was fairly good both generally and in physical, self-care, social and satisfaction domains, while in the domains of depression, anxiety and cognition, the quality of life was found to be poor.
Conclusion: The findings are not consistent with similar studies: Quality of life in general and in most specific domains (especially with regard to life satisfaction) was higher in KCF than in other elderly care centers. This might be due to the good will of the charity donors and better services rendered in KCF.

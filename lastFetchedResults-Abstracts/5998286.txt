In mobile ad hoc networks, solving the standard problems encountered in fixed networks can be challenging because of the unpredictable motion of mobile nodes. Due to the lack of a fixed infrastructure to serve as the backbone of the network, it is difficult to manage nodesÂ´ locations and ensure stable node performance. In this paper, we introduce an extension of an algorithm, multi-path intelligent virtual mobile node (MIVMN) Abstraction, which effectively processes the unpredictable motion and availability of mobile nodes in MANETs. Earlier work has applied an abstract node, or virtual mobile node, that consists of a set of real nodes traveling on a predetermined path, or virtual path, which causes unavoidable failure when all the nodes that are emulating the virtual mobile node leave its region. The objective of this paper is to increase the message delivery ratio and decrease the fail ratio of the virtual mobile nodes. In order to achieve this, we allow the messages to switch between multiple Hamiltonian circles. Through simulation results we show that the MIVMN abstraction successfully meets our goals.

Economic load dispatch (ELD) is an important optimization task in power system. It is the process of allocating generation among the committed units such that the constraints imposed are satisfied and the energy requirements are minimized. There are three criteria in solving the economic load dispatch problem. They are minimizing the total generator operating cost, total emission cost and scheduling the generator units. In this paper Firefly Algorithm(FA) solution to economic dispatch problem is very useful when addressing heavily constrained optimization problem in terms of solution accuracy. Results obtained from this technique clearly demonstrate that the algorithm is more efficient in terms of number of evolution to reach the global optimum point. The result also shows that the solution method is practical and valid for real time applications In this paper the Firefly Algorithm(FA) solves economic load dispatch (ELD) power system problem of three generator system, six generator system with emission constraints and twelve generator system with introduced population-based technique - is utilized to solve the DED problem. A general formulation of this algorithm is presented together with an analytical mathematical modeling to solve this problem by a single equivalent objective function. The results are compared with those obtained by alternative techniques proposed by the literature in order to show that it is capable of yielding good optimal solutions with proper selection of control parameters. The validity and quality of the solution obtained Firefly Algorithm(FA) based economic load dispatch method are checked and compared with Artificial colony algorithm(ABC), Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO), simulated Annealing Algorithm(SA).

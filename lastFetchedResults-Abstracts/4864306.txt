In recent years, with the information increasing rapidly, WDM communication network traffic is paid more and more attentions. Traffic engineering (TE) is an interesting application in IP-based networks. TE main objective is to optimize the performance of a network through an efficient utilization of network resources. This paper discusses traffic technology and load balancing in optical networks. Traffic engineering involves adapting the routing of traffic to the network conditions, with the joint goals of good user performance and efficient use of network resources. In the network planning and in the evaluation of the effects of the changes in routing parameters, a network-wide view of traffic is crucial. The local traffic conditions, such as link loads, are just the result of the routing decisions already made in the network.

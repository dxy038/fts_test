Introduction: Higher education has increasingly been in line with the
progress of societies, and many countries have recently given priority to
knowledge-based economy. How to improve the effectiveness of the
universities to achieve the knowledge-based economy has been as a major
challenge for managers and planners who have applied various policies and
programs among which the changes in the mechanisms of financing and
financial resources allocation are considered to be crucial, in that the
mechanisms affect the performance of educational departments which are
the main pillars of the universities and higher education system.
Nevertheless, we empirically know little about the impacts of the changes.
Thus it is important to evaluate the impact of the mechanisms on educational
performance of the departments, which is the main objective of this article.
Materials and Methods: Taking into account the advantages of university
of Tehran as a case study, we selected 75 educational departments located in
Tehran city as the units of analysis. Data on the characteristics of the
educational groups for 2001-2005 period were collected through conducting
a field work (questionnaire) and using the faculty members profiles. Due to
the complexity of data structure and to achieve correct hypothesis testing, we
apply multilevel modeling through which the heterogeneities across the
groups are taken into statistical models.
Results: The results of empirical analyses show that (1) educational
performance among the departments has significantly been heterogonous;
this heterogeneity indicates that the structure of data used is complex and
dominated by a hierarchical structure which makes the application of multilevel
modeling method imperative, (2) the educational performance has had
a constant and considerable increase during the period, (3) each group has
experienced different trend in their educational performance during the

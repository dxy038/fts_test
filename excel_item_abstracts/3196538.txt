This approach presents a novel scheme based on fixed-manifold robust control for a step-down dc-dc converter, so that the described converter can generate a constant output voltage, which is lower than the input voltage, using closed-loop compensation while guaranteeing stability in a resistance load. The output phase trajectories, which are used to describe the system dynamics and to form a manifold, are to engage in constructing a vector field. To design the fixed-manifold robust control of step-down dc-dc converter, an experimental mathematics model is enough for a practical implementation and those parameters are estimated by curve-fitting method. That is, establishing a very highly precise mathematics model for a buck converter control system isnÂ´t essential. In fact, the model uncertainty can be eliminated by the proposed robust controller. To obtain the competitive control efforts, the methods of predicting the behavior of system dynamics and estimating the lumped uncertainty are adopted during every sampling interval. Finally, by adding an external disturbance in a buck converter system to verify the robustness and excellent stability, various experiments are performed for a wind power generation system to compare the output performance between the fixed-manifold robust controller and the other PI and fuzzy ones.

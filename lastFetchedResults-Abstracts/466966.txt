Objective: According to Orthodox Jewish law, abortion is only permitted before 40 days post conception. This evaluation was performed to determine the feasibility and safety of performing chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 7 to 8 weeks' gestation so that genetic results would be useful for these patients. Study Design: We evaluated a sequential series of 82 Orthodox Jewish patients who chose CVS at <63 days' gestation. Outcome measures included procedure success rates, laboratory success rates, pregnancy outcomes, and complications. Results: CVS was successful in all cases. Ninety-one percent were performed transcervically, with 30% requiring 2 or more insertions. Abnormal results were found in 16 (20%). Of 61 cases with normal genetic and ultrasound results, spontaneous losses at less than 28 weeks occurred in 3 (5%). These rates are higher than the 2.3% loss rate and the 1.2% multiple insertion rate seen at our center when sampling is performed at the usual gestational ages of 10 to 12 weeks. One baby had a severe limb reduction defect (1.6%). Conclusion: In very experienced hands, CVS can be safely and reliably performed at very early gestational ages. The ability to obtain an early diagnosis may be associated with increased but acceptable complication rates, including a 1% to 2% risk of limb reduction defects. There are patients for whom the usual paradigms do not suffice, and obtaining an early disgnosis provides them the opportunity to trade increased risks for reproductive choice. The ethical issues are complex, but such decisions can be supported by extensive and detailed informed consent. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:1133-6)

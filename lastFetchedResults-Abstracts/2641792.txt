Objective (s): One of the dimensions of couples' relationships is the quality of marital relationships that has a fundamental role in evaluating the quality of family relationships. Evaluation of marital quality using valid and reliable tools is crucial. The purpose of this study was to determine psychometric properties of the Relationship Quality scale (RQ).
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the English version of the scale was translated into Persian language using a standard translation technique. Validity of the questionnaire was assessed by qualitative and quantitative content validity, face validity, construct validity, convergent and known groups comparison. Reliability was determined by internal consistency and test re test. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 16 and statistical software AMOS version 22.
Results: In evaluation of quantitative and qualitative content validity, all questions were approved. Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR) were obtained 0.94 and 0.92 respectively. The Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed one -factor structure. In the evaluation of concurrent validity, the findings showed that the RQ scale is correlated with the relationship assessment scale (RAS) and the marital satisfaction ENRICH scale. The known groups comparison discriminated between people with and without marital satisfaction based on Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale (p < 0.001). The results showed that the score of RQ scale in satisfied group was significantly higher than those who were not satisfied. Reliability evaluation was demonstrated excellent internal consistency and test–retest reliability (Cronbach’s alpha and ICC were 0.90 and 0.92 respectively).
Conclusion: The results showed that the Persian version of the quality of the relationship scale had a good structural characteristic and it is a reliable and valid instrument in assessing the quality of the relationship between couples.

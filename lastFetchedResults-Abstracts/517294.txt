Objective : Research productivity is an important activity among aca -demics. This study was done to document the research productivity of the academics of a physiotherapy department in South Africa. Method: An  archival  research  design  was  used  to  document  the  re-search productivity for the physiotherapy department between 2002 and 2009. Data were analysed by two independent reviewers and con-sensus was reached on the information to be included in the study. Results : Among  the  nine  academics  there  were  67  publications,  20 articles  in  progress,  7  under  review  and  63  conferences  attended. While  the  overall  research  productivity  of  the  department  seems  to be good, the bulk of the productivity rests in the hands of the senior academics. Conclusion: There is a need to facilitate the acquisition of research skills in academic staff, particularly in upgrading staff to PhD level and improving publication output.

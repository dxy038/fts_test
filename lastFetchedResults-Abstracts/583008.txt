The present article focuses on the place of logic among other sciences.
Since the assessment of scientific distinction and classification play a pivotal role in clarifying the issue in question the paper will, in the first place briefly, discuss them and then begin proving the instrumentality of logic. It also mentions that we can look at logic both as something in itself and as something in relation with other sciences. The second perspective constitutes the objective behind logic and it is based on this outlook that logic has been deemed as instrumental science in relation with other sciences.
	Studying the meaning of logical instrumentality, the paper, in the end, explains that logic grantees the accuracy of thought both formally and materially, though it dose not generally discuss about the matter of thought.

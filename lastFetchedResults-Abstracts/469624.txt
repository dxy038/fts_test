Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine implications of increased perfect use on the cost-effectiveness of the contraceptive patch compared with combination oral contraceptives (COCs).
Study design
This study compared the patch with low-estrogen-dose COCs. It assumes that the risks of developing a medical condition during use are the same for both the patch and COCs. Differences in net cost and pregnancies avoided during use were modeled. With the use of a pharmacoeconomic model, both methods were compared with a hypothetical reference case of contraception nonuse. The base-case model considered women, ages 15 to 50, in average health in a long-term, mutually monogamous, heterosexual relationship.
Results
The base-case analysis showed that use of the patch resulted in a savings of $249 and 0.03 pregnancies per woman over 2 years compared with COCs.
Conclusion
This analysis demonstrated that patch use would be cost saving compared with COC use, resulting in a net avoidance of pregnancy for this population. The cost savings are attributed to reduced costs of pregnancy.

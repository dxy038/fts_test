In this paper, the application of the bees algorithm (BA) to the problem of crack detection in beams is introduced. A numerical as well as an experimental study is designed to predict a single open edge-crack in cantilever beams. The crack is modeled by a rotational spring, whose stiffness could be determined by the size of the crack. The weighted sum of the squared errors between the measured and computed natural frequencies is used as the objective function. The results show that both the size and location of the crack can be predicted well through this method.

In this paper performance assessment of univariate control loops with linear time varying (LTV) disturbance dynamics is investigated. The objective is to find a linear time invariant (LTI) optimal controller to regulate the LTV disturbance. In various disturbance dynamics, one of them is treated as a major upset to the system. In this paper an LTI benchmark control is proposed which ensures the sum of the weighted variances in response to all but one major disturbance to be less than a variance upper bound and the peak amplitude in response to the major upset to be no larger than a user-defined value. Performance limit problem and performance assessment problem are solved via LMI technique. A cone complementarity linearization algorithm is used to handle the resulting non-convex problem. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed benchmark control.

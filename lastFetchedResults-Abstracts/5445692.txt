This paper investigates video traffic management and packet-scheduling aspects for satellite Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (S-UMTS) transmissions based on high speed downlink packet access via geostationary satellite (S-HSDPA). In particular, this paper surveys resource allocation constraints to be considered for S-HSDPA and investigates the performance of different scheduling schemes in the presence of a GOOD/BAD channel and their influence on the objective video quality for typical UMTS video streaming scenarios. This work has been carried out within the framework of the European SatNEx II network of excellence

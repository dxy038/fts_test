Members of the Maintenance and Diagnostic Control subcommittee of IEEEÂ´s Standards Coordinating Committee 20 (SCC20) are developing a standard for testability and diagnosability characteristics and metrics. The objective of this standard, P1522, is to provide notionally correct, useful, and mathematically precise definitions of testability measures that may be used to either measure or predict the testability of a system. Notionally correct means that the measures are not in conflict with intuitive and historical representations. The end purpose is to provide an unambiguous source for definitions of testability and diagnosability metrics. In this paper, we present a summary of the work completed so far on P1522 and a roadmap for its completion. We cover the organization of the standard, the sources of the measures, how these measures relate to the other AI-ESTATE standards, and information modeling

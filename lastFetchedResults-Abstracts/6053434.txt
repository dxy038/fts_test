This paper presents a DC/DC bidirectional converter with DC-link voltage controller implemented with the PLD-Microcontroller technology. The controller is designed in order to maintain constant the DC-link voltage in a hybrid power system (HPS). The means by which the functionality of the controller is implemented is given. Simulation and experimental tests were carried out using an averaged model and a laboratory prototype respectively in order to analyse the performance of the investigated converter.

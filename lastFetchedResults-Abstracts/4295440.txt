In a multiphase drive system fed by a VSI, very large harmonic currents can be observed if conventional SVPWM is used due to the small impedance in some subspaces such as z1-z2 subspace. In this paper a novel multiphase SVPWM strategy is presented. Its objective is to synthesize the d-q subspace voltage vectors to satisfy the machineÂ´s control requirements and make the resultant voltage vectors on other subspace to be zero, at the same time to minimize the switching losses. A five-phase PMSM drive system is used as a practical example and experimental results prove its validity

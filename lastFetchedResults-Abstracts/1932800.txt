The objective of this study is to verify and compare the effects of acepromazine–tiletamine–zolazepam and propofol used in anesthetic protocols for semen collection by electroejaculation from captive collared peccaries. Ten sexually mature animals were physically restrained and anesthetized by either intravenous administration of tiletamine–zolazepam (2 mg/kg) after acepromazine premedication, or a propofol dose of 5 mg/kg. The onset of anesthetic recovery was determined by the animals regaining consciousness and attempting to stand. Semen was collected by electroejaculation and evaluated for volume, pH, sperm concentration, progressive motility, morphology, percentage of live cells and functional membrane integrity. Six anesthetized animals with the acepromazine–tiletamine–zolazepam protocol showed erection, but semen could be collected in only four (40%) attempts. Of the animals anesthetized using propofol, nine showed erection, and the ejaculates were collected in eight (80%) attempts. Furthermore, propofol afforded rapid recovery of animals, and ejaculates with enhanced sperm motility and functional membrane integrity as compared with those collected by the other protocol (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, use of propofol for anesthetic restraint of collared peccaries enhanced collection of semen by electroejaculation.

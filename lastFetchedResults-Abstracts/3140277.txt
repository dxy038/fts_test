To improve the utilization, the port company would like to reduce the turnaround time of ships, which may increase the production cost, and damage the interests of the company. Thus, a bi-objective optimization model was established with the turnaround time of ships and the production cost considered simultaneously. Then a solution method which included three phases was suggested. The first phase was an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to generate or iterate feasible solutions which could define the service order, the berthing position, and the number of the arranged quay cranes for each ship. The second one was to gain the exact berthing time by a quay crane scheduling heuristic. And the last one was to select a final schedule from the Pareto solutions. Experiments show that the solution method proposed can obtain a better schedule than the existing methods.

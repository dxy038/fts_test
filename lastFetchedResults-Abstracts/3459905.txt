The objective of building a low-cost pre-accelerator for low energy heavy ion particle accelerator was realized by using standard, readily available material and hardware. Some savings were obtained in the construction of the dome by avoiding welding, expensive metal spinnings and unnecessary corona rings. Larger monetary economies were realized by a unique approach to building the high voltage column utilizing a glass tube.

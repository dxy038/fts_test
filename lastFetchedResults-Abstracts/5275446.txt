The population migration algorithm is a very effective evolutionary algorithm to solve optimization problem, but there are little application in solving the multi-objective optimization problem. On the basis of vector evaluated method and Dynamic Weighted Aggregation combined those advantage, this paper presents a population migration algorithm based on vector evaluated method and Dynamic Weighted Aggregation for multi-objective optimization problems. At the same time, this paper population flow approach, which can more effective in local search. Experimental results show the algorithm is feasible.

Current clinical interpretation of dynamic electromyography (EMG) data is usually based on qualitative assessments of muscle timing. Cross-correlation may provide a method for objectively comparing the timing and shape of EMG signals. This study used cross-correlation to compare EMG signals from different walking trials, different test sessions, and different individuals in able-bodied adults. Cross-correlation results (R-values) for different walking trials within a single test session were high, averaging  0.90 for all muscles tested (R=1.0 indicates exact agreement). Cross-correlation values were also high among trials from different test sessions conducted by the same and different examiners (average R 0.78 for all muscles). R-values were much more variable when comparing different subjects (average 0.40–0.81, range 0.00–0.91). R-values were lower for the medial hamstrings and rectus femoris compared with the other muscles tested. These results suggest that cross-correlation may be useful for evaluating changes in an individual patient's muscle activation patterns, such as before and after surgery, but not for comparing EMG patterns among different individuals, such as between patients and normative data. This is especially true for biarticular muscles such as the hamstrings and rectus femoris, which may have variable activation patterns and/or increased sensitivity to electrode placement. Cross-correlation may also be useful for identifying appropriate muscles for transfer, identifying “outlier” trials within a test session, and selecting representative EMG curves for a given patient. The advantages of cross-correlation are that it considers shape of the EMG signal in addition to timing and that the assessments it provides are objective, rather than subjective.

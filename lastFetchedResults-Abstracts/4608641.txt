In this paper we are introducing a new generation of 802.11n wireless network standard. The objective is to obtain numerical values for various measures of networking performance of 802.11n by simulating the system using Simulink. Our initial approach was to investigate the abilities of 802.11n standard to model a transmitter and receiver that communicated over a user defined channel. Traditional wireless communication systems use a single antenna for transmission and a single antenna for reception. Such systems are known as single input single output (SISO) systems. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing systems that use multiple antennas at the transmitter and the receiver to achieve better performance. Such systems are known as multiple inputs multiple output (MIMO) systems. We simulated a single OFDM symbol SISO system followed by Multiple Input Multiple Output system (MIMO). We tested the performance of the system using MatlabÂ´s built in bit-error rate (BER) tool in both SISO and MIMO Techniques. We also calculated different Variation in BER on varying Parameters like Delay and K factor.

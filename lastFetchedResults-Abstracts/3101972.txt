In this paper we present HDCU, a hybrid data mining and case-based reasoning user modeling system, which is used to monitor and predict the blood sugar level in diabetics. The practical objective for this project is to reduce the cost of direct blood sugar self monitoring by minimizing the number of times that a diabetic needs to measure his or her sugar levels every day. From the technological point of view, the main aim is using the support vector machine as the classifier and implementing a case-based reasoning cycle as the retrieval cycle in order to indirectly determine and predict blood sugar level in diabetics and finally implement this software into a mobile device with wireless sensor networks and link it to a server which houses the relevant knowledgebase.

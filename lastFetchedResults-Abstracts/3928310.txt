The SiC JFET is an attractive semiconductor device due to its superior switching performance and high-temperature operating capability. Its shoot-through protection remains a challenge due to the limited practical knowledge existent on this device and due to its inherent normally on nature. Addressing this limitation, this paper presents a novel shoot-through protection scheme in which a bidirectional switch, compounded by a Si insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and a relay,is embedded into the dc-link midpoint in order to detect and clear shoot-through faults, taking advantage of the well-known desaturation protection schemes of IGBTs to protect SiC JFETs. This paper describes in detail the proposed protection mechanism and its circuit design, presenting as well the experimental results that verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme using, first, Si MOSFETs and second, a 10-kW ac-ac converter system using SiC JFETs.

The coastlines and island of the Persian Gulf have exclusive climate and weather conditions, which is unique in the world. These conditions are exceptionally hazardous for the performance of reinforced concrete structures and may eventuate to their damage and failure. Contemporarily various large projects concerning buildings, industrial structures, and installations are being built or designed in the periphery of the Persian Gulf. In many of these structures pozzolans, especially silica fume, are applied as cement replacement materials. Unfortunately in most cases sufficient studies on the effects and required levels of these materials (cement replacements and additives) are not performed. In this research, performance of concrete specimens with various w/cm and silica fume were assessed in simulated Persian Gulf (totally submerged, wet and dry cycles and atmospheric) conditions. Tests, such as, compressive strength, depth of water penetration, rapid chloride penetration and profile of ion chloride were performed. This research project aims to incorporate Pick's law for the chloride ion attack in reinforced concrete structures. The main objective is defining the parameters of the model by applying experimental (laboratory) results that simulated the environmental conditions of the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea. Furthermore, the established model and parameters are corrected and calibrated with field data from structures experiencing chloride attack in that region.

Owing to the dataset, the derived model has some limitations, however, its major merit is that it can be modified, corrected and expanded during later experimental and empirical studies.

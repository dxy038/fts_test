Under conventional farming practices, lime is usually applied on the soil surface and then incorporated into the soil to correct soil acidity. In no-till (NT) systems, where lime is surface applied or only incorporated into the soil to very shallow depth, lime will likely not move to where it is required within reasonable time. Consequently, lime may have to be incorporated into the soil by mechanical means. The objective of this laboratory study was to characterize the effect of lime, incorporated to different depths, on chemical and biological soil properties in a long-term NT soil. Soil samples taken from the 0–5, 0–10, and 0–20 cm depths were analyzed in incubation studies for soil pH, nitrate, CO2 respiration, and microbial biomass-C (MBC). Lime (CaCO3) was applied at rates equivalent to 0, 4.4, 8.8, and 17.6 Mg ha−1. Application of lime to both 0–10 and 0–20 cm depths increased soil pH from about 4.9 by 1, 1.7, and 2.8 units for the low, medium, and high liming rates, respectively. Soil nitrate increased over time and in proportion to liming rate, suggesting that conditions were favorable for N-mineralization and nitrification. Greater respiration rates and greater MBC found in lime-treated than in non-limed soils were attributed to higher soil pH. Faster turnover rates and increased mineralization of organic matter were found in lime-treated than in non-limed soils. These studies show that below-surface lime placement is effective for correcting soil acidity under NT and that microbial activity and nitrification can be enhanced.

The main objective of the present work was to synthesis polyamide 6 through anionic polymerization of Îµcaprolactam in an internal mixer. The reaction time and the rheological properties of sles during the polymerization were studied. The sles were characterized by Thermo Gravimetry Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and FTIR spectrometer. The melt flow behavior and viscoelastic properties of the sles were studied by using a Rheometric Mechanical Spectrometer (RMS). The polymerization reaction was found to be very fast such that it completed within 6 minutes as could be detected by following the mixing torque which reached to a steady state after passing a maximum. These results suggest that there is a reaction time above which the viscoelastic behavior of the sles almost remained unchanged, while the viscosity and elasticity of the sles continue to decrease with polymerization reaction time as a result of thermochemical degradation.

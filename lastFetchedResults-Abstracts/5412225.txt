This paper develops a foundation for the representation of hazardous conditions for animated maintenance simulation. Specifically, the objective of this study was to furnish methods to calculate and display hazard thresholds in a simulation system called DEPTH (Design, Evaluation for Personnel, Training, and Human Factors). DEPTH allows maintenance procedures to be graphically simulated using three-dimensional human figure models (HFM) and computer-aided design geometry. By integrating existing equations and data to generate hazardous regions, DEPTH will be able to indicate when a human figure comes too close to an &#8220;unsafe&#8221; object. Once the capability is incorporated in DEPTH, it will be possible to develop safer weapon systems and maintenance procedures. This study focused on radiant and contact properties of objects including operating temperature, voltage, and noise as opposed to ambient factors such as arctic or tropical conditions

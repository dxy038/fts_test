Objective: Cutaneous melanoma is the most hazardous malignancy of skin cancer with a
high mortality rate. It has been reported that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for
malignancy in most of cancers including melanoma. The aim of this study is to compare
two common methods for melanoma stem cell enriching; isolating based on the CD133
cell surface marker and spheroid cell culture.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, melanoma stem cells were enriched
by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) based on the CD133 protein expression
and spheroid culture of D10 melanoma cell line,. To determine stemness features, the
mRNA expression analysis of ABCG2, c-MYC, NESTIN, OCT4-A and -B genes as well
as colony and spheroid formation assays were utilized in unsorted CD133+, CD133- and
spheroid cells. Significant differences of the two experimental groups were compared
using studentâ€™s t tests and a two-tailed value of P < 0.05 was statistically considered as
a signi?cant threshold.
Results: Our results demonstrated that spheroid cells had more colony and spheroid
forming ability, rather than CD133+ cells and the other groups. Moreover, melanospheres
expressed higher mRNA expression level of ABCG2, c-MYC, NESTIN and OCT4-A compared
to other groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Although CD133+ derived melanoma cells represented stemness features,
our findings demonstrated that spheroid culture could be more effective method
to enrich melanoma stem cells.

Tactical plan recognition differs from traditional plan recognition in a number of ways, after discussing the military demands and the difference between them we highlight the structure and uncertainty propagation in tactical plan recognition, and establish the relationship between the elements involved in the plan recognition problem by utilizing the causal links in the effects based operation theory, then the causal link logic is introduced to add the time dependence into the structure with uncertainty which helps us to observe the dynamic change of desired objective, by this means it realized the prediction of the plan to be recognized

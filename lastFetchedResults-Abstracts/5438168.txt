This paper presents a quantitative methodology for multi-objective environmentally conscious design. Environmental objectives include disassemblability, recyclability, material selection and serviceability. Some of them are qualitative in nature, leading to large uncertainties of measurement and comparison. Thus it is necessary to develop a generic methodology for quantitative measurement on specific environmental aspects as well as on overall environmental performance. The proposed methodology is based on fuzzy theory, graph theory, and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) theory

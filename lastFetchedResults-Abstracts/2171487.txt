The primary objective of this study was to investigate the propensity of Fenvalerate (FEN), a synthetic pyrethroid to induce oxidative stress (OS) in various tissues of growing male rats following a short-term (28 days) dietary regimen and its possible attenuation by dietary (10%) sesame oil (SO). FEN incorporated diet was fed to weanling male rats at the dosages of 0, 250, 500 and 1000 ppm. Terminally, significant induction of OS in liver, thymus, spleen and erythrocytes was noticed at higher doses as evidenced by the elevated levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO). Significant dose-dependent depletion of GSH levels, perturbations in antioxidant enzymes, and enhanced protein carbonyls further confirmed the potential of FEN to induce OS in hepatic tissue. In addition, FEN also caused significant increases in activities of hepatic transaminases, ALP and LDH. Interestingly, dietary SO significantly attenuated FEN-induced oxidative damage in liver and other tissues. The degree of protection was remarkably high, since LPO and GSH status, protein carbonyl content and antioxidant defenses in liver and other tissues were brought down to basal levels in the SO + FEN1000 group. These results clearly indicate the potential of FEN to induce oxidative damage in vivo and also suggest the ability of SO, a dietary fat to significantly offset the oxidative damage which may related to the presence of antioxidant compounds in the oil.

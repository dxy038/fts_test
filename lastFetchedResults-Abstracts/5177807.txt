Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been noticed and researched nowadays. These new type of networks have unique characteristics. These characteristics make them different rather than other networks. WSNs composed of set of nodes that collect and transmit information about their environment. They have different constraints such as computational power, storage capacity, energy and etc. Of course the main constraint in wireless sensor networks is energy. Nodes energy source is limited and in most cases not rechargeable. Fairness in nodeÂ´s energy consumption can increase network lifetime. In this paper problem of data transport in WSN as an optimization problem is formulated. Objective function is to maximize performing fairness in network nodes subject to flow and energy constraints. Out put of optimization problem is a vector which consists of all links portion. Output is investigated via Opnet simulator.

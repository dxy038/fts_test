Objective: To evaluate the effect of Exendine-4 (EX-4), a Glucagon-like peptide 1
(GLP-1) receptor agonist, on the differentiation of insulin-secreting cells (IPCs) from
rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells(ADMSCs).
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, ADMSCs were isolated from rat adipose
tissue and exposed to induction media with or without EX-4. After induction, the
existence of IPCs was confirmed by morphology analysis, expression pattern analysis of
islet-specific genes (Pdx-1, Glut-2 and Insulin) and insulin synthesis and secretion.
Results: IPCs induced in presence of EX-4 were morphologically similar to pancreatic
islet-like cells. Expression of Pdx-1, Glut-2 and Insulin genes in EX-4 treated cells
was significantly higher than the cells exposed to differentiation media without EX-4.
Compared to EX-4 untreated ADMSCs, insulin release from EX-4 treated ADMSCs
showed a nearly 2.5 fold (P < 0.05) increase when exposed to a high glucose (25 mM)
medium. The percentage of insulin positive cells in the EX-4 treated group was approximately
4-fold higher than in the EX-4 untreated ADMSCs.
Conclusion: The present study has demonstrated that EX-4 enhances the differentiation
of ADMSCs into IPCs. Improvement of this method may help the formation of
an unlimited source of cells for transplantation.

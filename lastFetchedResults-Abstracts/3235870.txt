The bin packing problem (BPP) a have many practical applications. The general single-objective formulation consists of allocating all objects in the minimum number of bins. However, BPP can be seen as a bi-objectives problem where the following objectives can be optimized simultaneously, the total cost and conflicts among the items within the bins. These objectives are conflicting. Their aggregation requires some compromise from the managers. In this paper, we will be proposing a goal programming model and the satisfaction functions to aggregate the objectives and explicitly integrates the managerÂ´s preferences.

A bidirectional system using 1.3 &#956;m lasers as a transmitter and a receiver are investigated. The lasers considered are commercially available Fabry-Perot and distributed-feedback lasers. It is found that the poor performance of a laser receiver, compared to a PIN receiver, stems from three factors: low responsivity, high capacitance, and polarization dependence of responsivity, high capacitance, and polarization dependence of responsivity. The effect of each factor is evaluated. It has been clarified that the polarization dependence of sensitivity originates from the TE and TM modes dependence of both mode confinement factor and reflection at a facet. Using the measured parameters, 1.3-&#956;m laser receiver sensitivity for a 10<sup>-9</sup> error rate is estimated. Burst data transmission experiments show that estimated sensitivities agree well with the measured values. Optical ping-pong transmission distance of narrowband services is determined based on estimated sensitivity

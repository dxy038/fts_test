In this paper, a modified discrete particle swarm optimization is presented to find the
optimal placement and size of capacitors in a distribution system. The objective function is
composed of the line loss and the capacitors investment cost. The bus voltage and the feeder
current as constraints are included in the objective function by a constraint penalty factor.
To validate the proposed method, the 18-bus IEEE distribution system and the semi-
urban distribution system which is connected to bus 2 of the Roy Billinton test system
are used. The proposed method is applied to the problem and its robustness and accuracy
are studied. The results are compared with pure DPSO, genetic algorithm, and nonlinear
programming. It is illustrated in two examples that the proposed optimization method is
more accurate and particularly more robust than others for the planning of capacitors.

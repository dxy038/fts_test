In this paper we describe the background, the concept and the current status of an international postgraduate course on the subject of integrated urban water systems. The course aims to overcome the typical fragmentation of the engineering curricula in that field. Hence, the objective is to give a comprehensive overview on the total urban water and pollutant cycle, thus hoping to provide the students with a wider perspective on the problem. The course is structured into 22 modules that can also be taught in certain combinations. Emphasis is given to engineering problem solving and modeling.

A waveguide containing gyrotropic media is shown to be bidirectional if it possesses at least one of the following symmetry operations: reflection in a plane perpendicular to the waveguide axis; 180&#176; rotation about an axis perpendicular to the waveguide axis; or inversion in a point on the waveguide axis. The relation between the modal electromagnetic field components for any complementary mode pair is given for each symmetry case.

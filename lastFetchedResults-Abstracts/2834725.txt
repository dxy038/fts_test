This paper deals with the optimal tuning of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for a pancake direct current (DC) torque motor system that belongs to a Diesel engine exhaust gas recirculation valve in automotive applications. The Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithms solve an optimization problem which targets the minimization of an objective function expressed as the weighted sum of overshoot plus the integral of squared control error, and the parameters of the PID controllers are the variables of the objective function. Our BFO algorithms are characterized by the validation of the position of bacteria only if the PID control system response is in a valid range. A digitally simulated case study which deals with the shaft angle control of a DC torque motor system is considered. The impact of four parameters of one BFO algorithm on the objective function values is discussed.

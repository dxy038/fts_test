This paper focuses on the development of advanced fuel elements for innovative pressure tube light water reactors. Considerations and constraints that affect the design process and various possible options are discussed. The two most promising fuel designs, which can survive a loss-of-coolant accident without primary coolant replenishment, while having sufficient margins to fuel design limits, are proposed, described and evaluated. It is demonstrated that this key objective can be achieved, provided that reliable SiC cladding or coating, which can withstand operating and accident conditions without failure, can be manufactured. Recent advances in ceramic coating technologies and experimental tests of coated specimens indicate that the attainment of this goal is feasible.

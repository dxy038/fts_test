A cost effective optical fiber system for transmission of video and telemetry signal (2 Mbps) in one direction and command signal (2 Mbps) in the other has been designed and developed. The optical fiber system using single mode optical fiber and semiconductor lasers operates at 1550 nm and 1300 nm wavelength full-duplex mode through optical Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM)/Bidirectional couplers. Pulse-Frequency-Modulation/Optical Intensity Modulation PFM/IM is adopted for the transmission of video signal while the transmission of telemetry signal adopts the Frequency-Shift-Keying FSK/IM technique. The system developed achieves a data bit error rate of better than 10<sup>-10</sup> and video signal-to-noise ratio of 48 dB for a transmission span of above 3 km with very good system margin. A computer simulation program for evaluation of optical fiber data transmission system performance was adopted in the system development

The paper presents a DAMA (demand assigned multiple access) algorithm for geostationary satellite systems, where the round trip time between the capacity request and the assignment is greater than the maximum tolerated packet queuing delay, in terms of quality of service (QoS). The objective of the algorithm proposed in this paper is to dynamically compute the capacity request according to the actual needs avoiding high transmission delays and increasing the link utilization. A control theory approach has been taken on: the satellite network has been modeled as a feedback system and a proper controller has been introduced, in order to perform a control strategy that dynamically computes a target equilibrium and then steers the system towards such a target equilibrium. This work has been partially sponsored by the IST-SatSix project funded by European Commission within the 6th Framework Programme.

Bakgrand and Objective: One of the best methods of performance evaluation that is of interest to managers is DEA. In this paper, with the aim of improving the results of the data envelopment analysis, by the principal component analysis approach and common weights is provided a model for the DEA. The proposed model is used for the evaluation and ranking of faculties Police University Amin.  Inputs are including the composition and the number of professors, composition and number of students and funding. The outputs of the model are composition and number of graduates and research and academicadministrative privileges. 
Method: First, the nature of the outputs is positive by a convertion and more than ratio of any output to any input for all the units is calculated. Using principal compponent analysis, the possible association between variables was destroyed and the principal components are used as inputs to the model of DEA. In the end, instead of the usual methods based on the complete rankings for each of the units, a multi objective MinMax problem is planned to find a common weight. 
Results: The obtained results based on the inputs and outputs of this research indicate that Faculty of Kosar is in first rank and last rank is Dafvs and traffic faculty together.
Conclusion: DEAPCA model is a good model for performance evaluation in which common wieghts using multiobjective programming techniques can be used to determine the performance of the units.

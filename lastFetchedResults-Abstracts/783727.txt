Objective To analyze the characteristics
of patients scheduled for discharge from acute psychiatric
inpatient facilities in Italy, and their pattern
of care. Methods Socio-demographic and clinical
characteristics, and patterns of care of 1,330 patients
discharged from public and private inpatient facilities
in Italy were assessed with a standardized methodology
during an index period in the year 2004.
Results About one half of the sample had schizophrenia
or bipolar disorder. However, the case-mix
differed between public and private facilities, where
in-patients had more frequently mood and anxiety
disorders. The use of two or more drugs was very
common, involving more than 90% of patients and
including typically benzodiazepines and antipsychotics.
Structured psychosocial treatments were rarely
initiated during the hospital stay. Increasing age, male
gender, long stay in the facility (>60 days), personality
disorder and type of facility were associated with
a higher likelihood of being discharged to a community
residential facility. Predictors of discharge to
another psychiatric facility were increasing age, being
single, schizophrenia, personality disorder and organic
mental disorder. Families were not involved in
decisions about patientsâ€™ discharge in a significant
proportion of cases. University psychiatric clinics
and private facilities were less coordinated with thecommunity system of care than General Hospital
Psychiatric Units. Referral of patients with substance
use disorder to drug addiction services occurred in
just 30% of subjects. Conclusions This study provides
information on the characteristics and the pattern of
care of patients discharged from inpatient facilities in
a country that has closed down all its mental hospitals.
This information may be relevant for those
countries that are affording now the downsizing of
MHs, and the expansion of community-based models
of care

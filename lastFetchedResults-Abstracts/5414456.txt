It is a difficult work to design a large power energy storage inductor in bidirectional DC/DC converter. In order to overcome this difficulty, this paper studied the interleaving magnetic integration theory of bidirectional DC/DC converter. In which all the 4-phase inductors in 4-phase Buck+Boost bidirectional DC/DC converter were interleaving magnetic integrated with two 2-phase coupled inductors. The steady state phase current ripple and transient phase current response speed in Buck mode of the interleaving magnetic integrated bidirectional DC/DC converter were studied deeply, and the design criterion of the bidirectional DC/DC converter was given. Finally, the theory was verified with simulation and experimental results.

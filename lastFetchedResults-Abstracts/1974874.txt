Seven phenolic acids related to the botanical origins of nine monofloral Eucalyptus honeys from Australia, along with two abscisic isomers, have been analyzed. The mean content of total phenolic acids ranges from 2.14 mg/100 g honey of black box (Eucalyptus largiflorens) honey to 10.3 mg/100 g honey of bloodwood (Eucalyptus intermedia) honey, confirming an early finding that species-specific differences of phytochemical compositions occur quantitatively among these Eucalyptus honeys. A common profile of phenolic acids, comprising gallic, chlorogenic, coumaric and caffeic acids, can be found in all the Eucalyptus honeys, which could be floral markers for Australian Eucalyptus honeys. Thus, the analysis of phenolic acids could also be used as an objective method for the authentication of botanical origin of Eucalyptus honeys. Moreover, all the honey samples analyzed in this study contain gallic acid as the main phenolic acid, except for stringybox (Eucalyptus globoidia) honey which has ellagic acid as the main phenolic acid. This result indicates that the species-specific differences can also be found in the honey profiles of phenolic acids. Furthermore, the analysis of abscisic acid in honey shows that the content of abscisic acid varies from 0.55 mg/100 g honey of black box honey to 4.68 mg/100 g honey of bloodwood honey, corresponding to the contents of phenolic acids measured in these honeys. These results have further revealed that the HPLC analysis of honey phytochemical constituents could be used individually and/or jointly for the authentication of the botanical origins of Australian Eucalyptus honeys.

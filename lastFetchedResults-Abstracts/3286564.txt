This paper presents a technique for the performance evaluation of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) sites in a power system network. The objective of installing PMUs in this work is to enhance the situational awareness for a wide area of power system. This is achieved by making large generating stations, critical tie-lines and major load centres observable through phasor measurements. A Multi Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) based approach is implemented to incorporate these different criteria into a structured framework. The overall performance of a site is finally evaluated with respect to the set criteria. The proposed method has been demonstrated on the Northern Regional Power Grid (NRPG) 246-bus system.

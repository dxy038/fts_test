An objective of this article is to discuss a dyad interaction for understanding the nature of interpersonal mental health using an agent based simulation. Especially I have been inspired from serial experiments and studies on dyad interaction model (Nowak,A et al) and other social and personality psychology. In this concern, I have examined a dyad model on interpersonal dynamics in terms of mental health in social relationships. And then I would like to show computational results, and finally discuss considerable issues.

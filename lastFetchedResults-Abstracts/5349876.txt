In this paper we describe experiments performed on a testbed of a novel dynamically reconfigurable access network capable of providing bandwidth on-demand to the end-users. Multiwavelength bidirectional transmission of 10 Gb/s channels in different bandwidth allocation schemes is achieved while sustaining substantial power budget to cover the attenuation of over 25 km standard SMF and related power penalties e.g. due to Rayleigh backscattering.

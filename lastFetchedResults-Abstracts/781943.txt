To asses the energy requirements of animals in open range has been an ambitious objective.
Years of laboratory work have resulted in the development of an array of methods to estimate
the energy expenditure (EE) on the base of calorimetry trials. Available and more usual
methods with application in grazing conditions are: mobile indirect calorimetry (MIC), factorial
method, heart rate (HR), and isotopic methods (DLW—double labelled water and
CER—CO2-entry rate). This paper gives an overview of these methods, their potential and
real use, and an account of EE values obtained, to our knowledge, by their application in
grazing goats.

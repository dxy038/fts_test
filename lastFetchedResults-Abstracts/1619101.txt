The objective of this work was to understand the mechanisms and the factors controlling the stability of frozen products through the study of the influence of polysaccharides on the physical properties of frozen sucrose solutions (to 57.5 and 67.5% w/w). The polysaccharides studied were dextran at different molecular weights (from 104 to 2×106 g/mol), pullulan (both considered like linear polysaccharide) and gum arabic (considered like branched polysaccharide).

% of polysaccharide, neither the structure nor the molecular weight of polysaccharide had an influence on the viscosity. However, with 10% of polysaccharide, pullulan was the only polysaccharide that increased the viscosity of the sucrose solution. Viscoelastic behavior (characterized by storage moduli G′, loss moduli G″ and loss angle δ) of sucrose solutions was not modified by the presence of dextran, gum arabic or pullulan. These results were confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

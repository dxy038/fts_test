This paper deals with the time and cost oriented balancing of a single assembly line where a vast quantity of one single product has to be assembled. The cost-oriented assembly line balancing problem is a generalization of the time-oriented assembly line balancing problem. The objective in cost-oriented assembly line balancing consists in minimizing the total costs per unit. Author of this paper proposes to solve the problem in two ways. First, for a time-oriented problem it will be used some of heuristic methods (RPW, IUFF, Kilbridge&amp;Wester, Moodie&amp;Young) and next for cost-oriented problem it will be used some other heuristic methods given in literature. We should very often consider different measurements of balance ( time of line, smoothness index, line efficiency) to find the best given solution for the calculated problem. As a conclusion author proposes a new measurement method which connects results for time and cost-oriented balance methods.

In this paper, strong discontinuities embedded in finite elements are used to model discrete cracking in quasi-brittle materials. Special attention is paid to (i) the constitutive models used to describe the localized behaviour of the discontinuities, (ii) the enforcement of the continuity of the crack path and (iii) mixed-mode crack propagation. Different constitutive relations are adopted to describe the localized behaviour of the discontinuities, namely two damage laws and one plasticity law. A numerical algorithm is introduced to enforce the continuity of the crack path. In the examples studied, an objective dissipation of energy with respect to the mesh is found. Examples of mode-I and mixed-mode crack propagation are presented, namely a double notch tensile test and a single-edge notched beam subjected to shear. In the former case different crack patterns are obtained depending on the notch offset; in the latter case special emphasis is given to the effect of shear on the global structural response. In particular, both the peak load and the softening response of the structure are related to the amount of shear tractions allowed to develop between crack faces. The results obtained are compared to experimental results. As a general conclusion, it is found that crack path continuity allows for the development of crack patterns similar to those found in experiments, even when reasonably coarse meshes are used.

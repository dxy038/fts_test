Laser shock peening (LSP) is an innovative surface treatment technique, and can significantly improve the fatigue performance of metallic components. In this paper, the objective of this work was to improve the fatigue resistance of TC6 titanium alloy by laser shock peening. Firstly, the effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties with different LSP impacts were investigated, which were observed and measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), residual stress tester and microhardness tester. Specially, nanostructure was detected in the laser-peened surface layer with multiple LSP impacts. Whereafter, a better parameter was chosen to be applied on the standard vibration fatigue specimens. Via the high-cycle vibration fatigue tests, the high cycle fatigue limits of the specimens without and with LSP were obtained and compared. The fatigue results demonstrate that LSP can effectively improve the fatigue limit of TC6 titanium alloy. The strengthening mechanism was indicated by analyzing the effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties comprehensively.

This paper investigates a method to remove hot spot speckle, which is produced by laser-long coherence, on a projection screen. The objective of the work has been to first create an image from a digital light processing (DLP) display system using an RGB laser source. We then successfully obtained a high-quality image with speckle contrast, which is less than 2% when the screen was rotated by piezoelectric motor.

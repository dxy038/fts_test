DC-DC converters by nature present hybrid behavior, which is described by a set of discrete modes associated with continuous dynamics. The control objective is accomplished by switching among the discrete modes. This paper presents a new model predictive control approach to optimize the performance of DC-DC converters. The proposed control algorithm is tailored to DC-DC converters, making full use of the fact of finite number of modes to transform the performance optimization problem into a combinatory optimization task. This approach has made the on-line computation very simple and effective for implementation.

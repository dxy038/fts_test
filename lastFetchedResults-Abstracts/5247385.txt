This paper describes a discrete-event simulation model for performance evaluation of practical fixed and moving block railway signalling systems using track conductor loops to transmit continuous information between wayside and train. The fixed block system simulated has unidirectional transmission, and the moving block system has bidirectional transmission. The simulation results identify the physical features which limit the performance of these types of block signalling systems, and show the importance of considering train dynamics in moving block signalling system design

The optical emission analysis to plasma polymerized nano-film growth was studied. The objective of this study was to examine the distinctive glow features of low-temperature RF difluoromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) plasma polymerization and its correlation with plasma polymerized nano-film surface characterizations. The photoemission plasma species in RF CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> plasma polymerization was identified by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The OES diagnosis data and deposition results evidently indicated that in CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>/Ar glow discharge, the polymerizable species resulted from the low-energy electron-impact dissociation of CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> molecules that creates polymerizable species, but the strong Ar emission lines was related to nonpolymerizable species such as argon atom. In this study, the optical emission analysis indicates that the possible contribution of super hydrophobic plasma polymerized film growth is mainly occurred at the combination of electron-impact-dissociation and ionization.

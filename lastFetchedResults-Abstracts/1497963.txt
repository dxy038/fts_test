In ejector refrigeration systems, the performance of the ejector is critical to the performance, capability, size and cost of the whole system. Construction of mathematical models has been used as an effective method for analyzing the performance of the ejector as well as the whole refrigeration system. These models can also be used to guide system operation, interpret experimental results and assist in system design and optimization. The overall objective of this paper is to provide a review of various researches of the mathematical model on the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic character within the ejector. The paper first briefly describes ejector including fundamental principle, flowing and mixing mechanism and the method of model establishment. Then various models consisting of ideal assumptions, governing equations, auxiliary conditions, solution methods and main results are presented. The models can be classified into two main categories: (i) steady thermodynamic models which can be further subdivided into single-phase flow model and two-phase flow model and (ii) dynamic models which are also subdivided according to the flowing phases considered. It has been shown that the dynamic models have higher prediction precision and give more information compared with the steady thermodynamic models. In addition, the simplified empirical and semi-empirical models based on measured data are briefly discussed. This review is useful for understanding the evolution process and the current status of the mathematical models on ejector and highlighting the key aspects of model improvement such as the mixing mechanism, the capture of the shock wave, etc.

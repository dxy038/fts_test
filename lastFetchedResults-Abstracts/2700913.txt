This paper proposes efficient techniques to compress a depth video by taking into account coding artifacts, spatial resolution, and dynamic range of the depth data. Due to abrupt signal changes on object boundaries, a depth video compressed by conventional video coding standards often introduces serious coding artifacts over object boundaries, which severely affect the quality of a synthesized view. We suppress the coding artifacts by proposing an efficient postprocessing method based on a weighted mode filtering and utilizing it as an in-loop filter. In addition, the proposed filter is also tailored to efficiently reconstruct the depth video from the reduced spatial resolution and the low dynamic range. The down/upsampling coding approaches for the spatial resolution and the dynamic range are used together with the proposed filter in order to further reduce the bit rate. We verify the proposed techniques by applying them to an efficient compression of multiview-plus-depth data, which has emerged as an efficient data representation for 3-D video. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly reduce the bit rate while achieving a better quality of the synthesized view in terms of both objective and subjective measures.

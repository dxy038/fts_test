The pollution of soil and underground water with organic and toxic materials is a common environmental problem and oil is one of the most important of them. In the present study, consolidation behavior of clay contaminated with gas oil and kerosene has been investigated. The main objective was to determine the parameters associated with the value and rate of settlement of contaminated soil. Influence of various test parameters such as degree of contamination, contaminant type and density of samples were investigated on the consolidation behavior of kaolinite clay. Results show that by increasing the degree of contamination, Compressibility of soil increases while the consolidation coefficient and the permeability coefficient decrease

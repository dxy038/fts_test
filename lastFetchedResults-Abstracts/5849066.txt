The objective evaluation of location management algorithms depends upon the underlying mobility model, and therefore more realistic mobility models should provide more accurate evaluations. An activity-based mobility model was developed, and used to evaluate both static and dynamic location management algorithms. We compare these results with evaluations of the same algorithms under two random mobility models. The simulation results show the significant impact of the mobility model on location management algorithm assessments

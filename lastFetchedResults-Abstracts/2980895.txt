Reset controllers are standard linear compensators equipped with mechanism to instantaneously reset their states. With respect to pure linear control, there is evidence that this reset action is capable of improving control system tradeoffs. This paperÂ´s objective is to analyze the stability of a particular example of reset control system when excited by constant inputs. Our main result shows that the equilibrium point of the closed-loop dynamics is asymptotically stable

This paper presents an analysis of a hybrid process consisting of simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography and crystallization and studies its performance for the separation of the TrŸêger's base enantiomers. The SMB is simulated using a detailed model including column efficiency, thus, implying a proper evaluation of the effect of column size on column efficiency and separation performance. The crystallization operations are accounted for through material balances, assuming equilibrium between enantiopure crystals and mother liquor. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the combined process, using proper definitions of objective functions. Multi-objective optimization of this hybrid process for productivity and evaporation cost in terms of operating parameters, column length, and SMB feed concentration shows an optimum SMB purity value as a trade off between increased SMB performance and recycle of the mother liquor.

Networked electronic control units (ECUs) are increasingly being deployed in automobiles to realize various functions and controller area network (CAN) is deployed for the communications among ECUs. Our primary objective is to build both hardware and software that interface and communicate directly with CAN network and extract CAN messages for reliable car communications. The hardware is a circuit board that is capable of capturing CAN signals released from an automobile. The software will be both the firm-wares programmed for the two microcontrollers found on the circuit board, as well as the graphical user interface on the PC that enables users to control the functionalities of automobile via a few simple clicks of the buttons. With the help of these developed components, CAN messages can be used for reliable car communications, for example, reliable traffic information routing. Tests and trials of the completed board are also carried out to ensure that the system is performing decently well.

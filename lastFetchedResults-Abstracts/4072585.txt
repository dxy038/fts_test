THE INITIAL OBJECTIVE of this AIEE Joint Subcommittee was to collect information on the frequency and severity of out-of-phase high-voltage switching operations and then to decide if further action was justified. It was felt that the Committeemembers, through their business and committee affiliations, would be in a position to give a reasonably representative picture of high-voltage out-of-phase switching troubles; therefore, as a first step a questionnaire was sent out to the Committee members on June 15, 1948. It was hoped that sufficient material could be obtained this way and that the industry in general could be spared another questionnaire.

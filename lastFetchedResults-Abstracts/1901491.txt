The utility of surgical resection of solitary metastatic sites in renal cell carcinoma remains controversial. Additionally, the small literature detailing the role of surgical management suggests that patients who have surgical resection of metachronous metastases have a better outcome than those presenting synchronously. We reviewed the medical records of all patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent nephrectomy at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between 1980 and 1993. Patients who had undergone surgical resection of metastatic disease, either at presentation or subsequent to their nephrectomy, were identified. Clinical parameters, time to treatment failure, and survival was evaluated. Eighteen patients underwent surgical resection of metastases, 7 were synchronous to their nephrectomy, and 11 developed metachronous metastases. Resected lesions in both groups included metastases to lung, bone, liver, brain, and soft tissue. The median survival of all patients from time of resection to death or last follow-up was 5.7 years (range, 2 days to 10.7+ years). Two patients remain alive, both with recurrent disease at 5.3 and 10.7 years. Mean time from nephrectomy to death was 2.69 years for the synchronous group and 5.97 years for the metachronous group (p = 0.0599). The role of surgical resection in metastatic renal cell carcinoma remains unproven. The survival of this population is significantly longer than that typical for the disease. In our experience there is no difference in time to treatment failure or survival between synchronous and metachronous resection of metastatic disease.

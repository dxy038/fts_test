The Canadian Tracking and Fusion Group (CTFG) was established to bring together tracking and fusion researchers and practitioners from across government, industry, and academia with the objective of providing a forum for issues of common interest across diverse fields of application, including land, air, space, maritime, and underwater. Annual workshops are held to promote discussion and collaboration.

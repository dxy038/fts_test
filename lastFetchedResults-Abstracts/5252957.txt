Various distributed generation (DG) systems with capacities in the range of several kilowatts to tens of megawatts can increase voltage along a feeder when they are injecting power into distribution systems. Thus, the main objective of this study is to analyze the transient behavior of such a distribution system integrated by DG systems. This study (1) models the IEEE 37-bus test feeder as a distribution network enhanced by DG systems in Simulink of MATLAB; (2) proposes case studies of DG systems with their total capacity of 10 and 38 percent of the feeder rating; and then (3) simulates the transient behavior of the test feeder when DG systems inject active power at the unity power factor during a few cycles of 60 Hz. Finally, it addresses the issues of an increase in voltage resulting from the installation of DG systems in a transient state.

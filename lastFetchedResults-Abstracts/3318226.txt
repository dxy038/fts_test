We consider the problem of reaching a target without leaving a prescribed constraint set for a dynamical system described by a controlled differential equation and a controlled reset function. First, we characterize the set of initial conditions from which the objective can be reached. Then, we characterize the optimal reaching time function. Our approach is based on set-valued analysis and viability theory.

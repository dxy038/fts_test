With the rapid size shrinking in electronic devices, radiation-induced soft-error has emerged as a major concern to the current circuit manufacturing. In this paper, we present a new error correction scheme based on the residue number arithmetic to cope with the single soft-error issue. The proposed technique called bidirectional redundant residue number system requires the redundant moduli to satisfy some constraints to achieve fast error correction. In this system, both the iterations for decoding the valid number and the error-correcting table that contains all combinations of erroneous digit, are not necessary. The detection and the diagnosis are simultaneously performed in plural parallel consistent-checking that has the capability of locating the corrupt digit. Finally, efficient pipeline architecture for the self-diagnosis decoder is detailed.

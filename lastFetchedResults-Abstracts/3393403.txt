The use of output feedback for eigenstructure assignment in linear systems is studied in ibid., vol. AES-19, p.711-729 (Sept. 1983). The achievability subspace, (the subspace generating the assignable eigenvectors) is characterized in that paper. In ibid., vol.28, p.920-921 (July 1992), the authors proffer a counterexample as proof that the characterization of the achievability subspace given in the original article is not correct. The objective of this note is to show that the counterexample provided in does not contradict the characterization given in the original article, because hypotheses of this characterization are violated.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Objective: Psychosis is a psychiatric disorder in which reality testing and interpersonal relationships in several important functional areas are impaired. Some biochemical disturbances occur during psychotic Period. In this way, once Serum Pptassium level changes may impact on cardiovascular system in psychotic patients and threaten them, we conducted the study to evaluate this topic. Method: A prospective non-Randomised pre/post test study (Quasi-experimental) was conducted on 103 prepared samples obtained from 103 patients hospitalized in Imam Hossein and Taleghani Hospital during 2005-2006 in Tehran. All subjects were initially interviewed in the first day then considering inclusion / exclusion criteria, blood samples were drawn and Brief psychiatric Rating scales (BPRS) were completed by the researcher. A same process was repeated in the day before release. Data were analysed through Spearmanmultiple regression, Paired test, chi-square and Kolmogrov-Smirnov tests. Results: BPRS were Significantly different in the first and last days of hospitalization (P<0.019) Serum Potassium levels of the first and last days were meaningfully different (P<0.05) there was a negative correlation between the severity of psychosis in the first day and serum potassium level. Conclusions: Psychosis disregarding other underlying factors may lead to the development of Hypokalaemia independently.

Exchange rate passthrough is one of the most important issues in the international economic studies. Determining the degree of exchange rate passthrough can be used to define the effectiveness of foreign policy, market structure and exporters behavior. The main objective of this study is to investigate the exchange rate passthrough to export prices of Iranian pistachios during the period 19612011. In the previous studies, the exchange rate passthrough was assumed to be fixed during different years. This assumption is not consistent with reality, because many factors can influence the exchange rate passthrough. In this study, sensitivity analysis in the framework of artificial neural network is used to address this shortcoming. The results shows that exchange rate passthrough to Iran&#039;s pistachio export prices has been more than 70 percent, and its trend has been periodic. Furthermore, the results showed that there is a direct relationship between exchange rate fluctuations and Iranian pistachio export prices. Thus, by reducing exchange rate volatility, it is possible to supply pistachio with lower prices to the world markets. Considering the high elasticity of demand for the Iranian pistachio prices, a reduction in prices would increase revenues of exporters. Incidentally, given the high elasticity of export demand for Iran&#039;s pistachio, the revenues from the export of this product can be increased by reducing the cost of pistachio production.

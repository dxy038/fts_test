A bidirectional active antenna for vehicular and mobile applications is presented. Via a shielding electrode inserted between the antenna electrode and the ground electrode active field compensation is performed and by this way the electrical antenna height is increased substantially. This allows the realization of flat conformal antennas for vehicular and mobile applications

The Multi-objective Solid Transportation Problem (MSTP) refers to a special class of vector-minimum linear programming problems, in which constraints are all equality type and the objectives, are conflicting in nature. A generalization of multi-objective solid transportation problem, in which the supply, demand and capacity constraints are not only equality type but also of inequality type is considered. All methods either  generate a set of non-dominated solution or find  a compromise solution. In this paper, fuzzy  programming  technique  is  applied  to  solve  multi-objective  solid  transportation  problem.  Special type of non-linear membership  functions - Hyperbolic and Exponential  are used to represent objective function into fuzzy environment. It gives an optimal compromise solution. The obtained result has been compared  with  the  solution  obtained  by  using  a  linear  membership  function.  The  method  is  illustrated with a numerical example

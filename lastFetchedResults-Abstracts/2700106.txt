This paper proposes and validates a bidirectional hybrid lightwave transport system based on fiber-invisible laser light communication (IVLLC) and fiber-visible laser light communication (VLLC) convergences with light injection and optoelectronic feedback techniques. This paper is also the first to employ light injection and optoelectronic feedback techniques in a bidirectional lightwave transport system based on fiber-IVLLC and fiber-VLLC integration. Light is successfully modulated directly with cable television (CATV), 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), and 16-QAM-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. Good carrier-to-noise ratio, composite second order, composite triple beat, and bit error rate (BER) are obtained for CATV, 16-QAM, and 16-QAM-OFDM signal transmissions over a combined 40-km single-mode fiber, a 1.43-km photonic crystal fiber, and 6-m free-space transmission. The proposed bidirectional hybrid lightwave transport system exhibits significant potential in providing broadband integrated services, such as CATV, Internet, and telecommunication, via optical fiber and free-space indoor networks.

Flavonoids are found in fruits, vegetables, and certain beverages that have diverse beneficial biochemical and antioxidant effects.Tomato, onion, garlic, green chilies and potato were selected for the study as these are important ingredients in food in Pakistan. Almost all of these vegetables are used in routine food. Mango, pine apple, grewia asiatica, strawberries and orange were also studied for their flavonoid content because these fruits are considered to be a part of healthy food and also these are easily available in Pakistan. Products of these fruits and vegetables available in local markets were analyzed so as to make a comparison with fresh ones. Garlic paste, onion paste, chili paste, tomato ketchup and potato chips were used to make comparison with vegetables. Grewia asiatica juice, mango and strawberry jam, pine apple juice and tang orange were used for fruits. Six flavonoids ( quercetin, luteolin myricetin, kaempferol, rhamnetin and isorhamnetin) were used as standards. Analysis was carried out on HPLC in acidified 50% water: acetonitrile system at 30 oc and 254 nm. Highest flavonoids in case of fresh vegetables fruits and were present in tomato (183.08 mg\kg) and strawberries (80.0 mg\kg) respectively. While in case of preserved products in strawberry jam (85.0 mg\kg) and garlic paste (177.0 mg\kg) respectively. This simply means that in case of tomatoes flavonoid content decreased due to processing but in case of strawberry jam flavonoid content increased due additives rich in flavonoids. Similarly, garlic paste contained highest flavonoid content in selected products. The objective of study was to analyze whether fresh fruits and vegetables or their products are rich in flavonoids, so, that we could have healthy food. So this study is very helpful in deciding about healthy food.

In this paper the three positivistic, interpretative and hermeneutic paradigms are introduced in order to investigate the epistemology of research in science of management and organization. Positivism attributes the originality to sensory cognition and as a result separation of the topic of research from researchers and social realities and elimination of values from the research process are considered as weakness of this approach. The interpretative approach is somehow indulged in extreme subjectivism and therefore deals with the problem of analysis of human behavior specifically on the basis of intention and objective. Meanwhile hermeneutic considers individuals as world within the context of organization. Therefore, lack of criteria for distinction between relevant and irrelevant interpretations is the main weakness of this approach. The positivistic approach considers organization as cross-cultural while according to interpretative and hermeneutic approaches, organization is influenced by culture.

The objective of this article concerns the city logistics in Germany. Reachability and mobility are essential elements with which one can measure e.g. the living quality of inhabitants as well as of tourists. However, traffic within a city is also necessary to guarantee sufficient supply (and disposal) of retail, gastronomy, service and trade. At the same time, there is a considerable pressure of cost and performance so that the efficiency of processes will become more prominent. The concept of city logistics was the big hope for a long-term solution of the problems concerning the cityÂ´s freight transportation in Germany in the mid 1990s. After a short description of the quantitative development of german projects with the aim of reducing unnecessary traffic in sensitive city areas, the exposition of a successful example - the city logistic of Regensburg - will follow. Based on the results of an empirical analysis in one of the four remaining city logistics projects, RegLogreg in the City of Regensburg, the article shows the general attributes of the project as well as the effects and experiences of the analysed integration of telematic solutions in city logistics cooperations.

Background: Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is a widely accepted form of operation in patients with early breast cancer. Recurrence remains one of the greatest concerns in breast conserving surgery. It can provoke serious anxiety in the patient and, when treated by mastectomy, negate the objective of conservation. 
Methods: In this study we investigated the prognostic value of demographic, clinical and pathological factors and biological markers in breast cancer patients treated with BCS. This study was performed on 258 patients who underwent BCS from 2002 to 2010. All of the surgeries were performed by a single surgical team. Recurrence and its risk factors were evaluated.
Results: The mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 50. The overall 10 year survival was 81%, 5 year survival was 88% and recurrence rate after surgery was 9%. Lymphovascular Invasion (LVI) was observed in 41 (16%) patients and in 11 (48%) patients with recurrence. 
Conclusion: Our study confirmed that tumors with estrogen receptor negative and LVI had more recurrence rate but other demographic, clinical and pathological factors and biological markers (progesterone receptor, P53, HER-2) did not have any significant effect on recurrence. We recommend considering LVI and estrogen receptor assay as a prognostic factor in the patients treated with BCS.

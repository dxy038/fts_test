Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the increase in pudendal nerve branch lengths using a 3D computer model of vaginal delivery.
Study design
The main inferior rectal and perineal branches of the pudendal nerve were dissected in 12 hemi-pelves from 6 adult female cadavers. Their 3D courses were digitized in the 4 specimens with the most characteristic nerve branching pattern, and the data were imported into a published 3D computer model of the pelvic floor. Each nerve branch was then represented by a stretchable cord with a fixation point at the ischial spine. The length change in each branch was then quantified as the fetal head descended through the pelvic floor. The maximum nerve strains ([final length minus original length/original length] Ã— 100) were calculated for 5 degrees of perineal descent: reference descent from the literature, 1.25 cm and 2.5 cm caudal and cephalad. The effect of alternative fixation points on resultant nerve strain was also studied.
Results
The inferior rectal branch exhibited the maximum strain, 35%, and this strain varied by 15% from the scenario with the least perineal descent to that with the most perineal descent. The strain in the perineal nerve branch innervating the anal sphincter reached 33%, while the branches innervating the posterior labia and urethral sphincter reached values of 15% and 13%, respectively. The more proximal the nerve fixation point, the greater the nerve strain.
Conclusion
During the second stage: (1) nerves innervating the anal sphincter are stretched beyond the 15% strain threshold known to cause permanent damage in appendicular peripheral nerve, and (2) the degree of perineal descent is shown to influence pudendal nerve strain.

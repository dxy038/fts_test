The intermittent nature of wind draws its attention for reliability evaluation to penetrate more in conventional power system. This paper presents a case study on reliability evaluation of three wind farms in North Karnataka region. The main objective of this study is to identify a reliable site based on the wind data analysis of historical wind speeds using Weibull distribution. The study illustrates that the reliability decreases with increase in load demand. Further, for a specified load demand at any time instant, reliability increases with increase in hub height. The usefulness of the present study in the site selection for wind power generation is demonstrated through detailed analysis.

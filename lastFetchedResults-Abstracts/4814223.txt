The paper deals with decentralized control of nonlinear interconnected systems. The objective is to control some specific modes, i.e., critical modes over a wide range of operating conditions. The paper presents an index to identify which control signal is most effective, and a second index to assess the effect of the control signal on other modes. The application of these indices allows determining which signal will control some specific modes without disturbing remaining modes. The methodologies are applied to a power system case study to demonstrate the proposed methodologies

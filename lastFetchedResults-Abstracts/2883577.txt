In this work, we address the emerging scheduling problem existed in the design of secure and energy-efficient real-time embedded systems. The objective is to minimize the energy consumption subject to security and schedulability constraints. Due to the complexity of the problem, we propose a dynamic programming based approximation approach to find the near-optimal solutions with respect to predefined security constraint. The proposed technique has polynomial time complexity which is about half of traditional approximation approaches. The efficiency of our algorithm is validated by extensive experiments.

Objective
m of the study is to determine the most appropriate method for construction of a sequential decision tree in the management of rectal cancer, using various patient-specific criteria and treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.
s
lytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the priorities of variables. Relevant criteria used in two decision steps and their relative priorities were established by a panel of five general surgeons. Data were collected via a web-based application and analyzed using the “Expert Choice” software specifically developed for the AHP. Consistency ratios in the AHP method were calculated for each set of judgments, and the priorities of sub-criteria were determined. A sequential decision tree was constructed for the best treatment decision process, using priorities determined by the AHP method.
s
tency ratios in the AHP method were calculated for each decision step, and the judgments were considered consistent. The tumor-related criterion “presence of perforation” (0.331) and the patient–surgeon-related criterion “surgeon's experience” (0.630) had the highest priority in the first decision step. In the second decision step, the tumor-related criterion “the stage of the disease” (0.230) and the patient–surgeon-related criterion “surgeon's experience” (0.281) were the paramount criteria. The results showed some variation in the ranking of criteria between the decision steps. In the second decision step, for instance, the tumor-related criterion “presence of perforation” was just the fifth.

nsistency of decision support systems largely depends on the quality of the underlying decision tree. When several choices and variables have to be considered in a decision, it is very important to determine priorities. The AHP method seems to be effective for this purpose. The decision algorithm developed by this method is more realistic and will improve the quality of the decision tree.

A cochlea-based preprocessor for speech recognition emulates the fluid ducts with two 4680-element diffusive grids, the basilar membrane with 360 2<sup>nd</sup>-order sections, and the auditory nerve with 2160 pulse-frequency modulators. Integrated in 10.9mm<sup>2</sup>in 0.25mum CMOS and consuming 52mW, this silicon cochlea employs active bidirectional coupling, a selective amplification mechanism that sharpens tuning (Q<sub>10</sub> is 2.7) and controls gain (24dB compression)

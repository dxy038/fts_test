The present accepted industry-wide method of evaluating integrated circuit metallization is scanning electron microscope (SEM) inspection. This method, which has recently been incorporated into Mil-Std-883 (method 2018), is costly, time consuming, and subjective. A simple pulse technique that is inexpensive and objective has proven to be an effective alternative to the SEM method. Because of physical limitations of the pulse method in discerning certain reduced cross-sectional areas, limited usage of the pulse technique is recommended. This method, supplemented by the SEM, can result in significant cost savings.

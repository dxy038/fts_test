In the deregulated environment, in order to sustain a regional electricity business, transmission restructuring is necessary. In transmission construction, the system stability, environmental problems and the economy must all be considered. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new transmission planning prioritization method using a Pareto optimal set as a multi-objective evaluation. Here, we first consider short circuit capacity, and then evaluate CO<sub>2</sub> emission, transmission losses and construction costs, comprehensively. Finally, we carry out simulations for the IEEJ EAST 30 machine system, and determine the transmission planning priority, to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

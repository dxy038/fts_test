On the basis of robust H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control, the output feedback controller is presented for a class of dynamic time-varying delay network systems. The objective of designing robust H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller is to achieve the desired queue size and to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the close-loop. The sufficient condition for the existence of a dynamic output feedback controller is presented via matrix inequalities. The prescribed level of H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance index is satisfied using the parametrized neutral model transformation, the free matrice W can be used to adjust performance of dynamic network systems. An LMI method for designing controller is given by matrix transformations, so it is convenient to obtain the expression of controller.

Background and Objective: Adhesion bands comprise the most important unpleasant consequences of pelvic surgeries. Green tea (Camellia sinensis), due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and prevention of production and accumulation of collagen seems to be beneficial in this event. Therefore, the present study was designed to elicit the effect of alcoholic extract of green tea on intra-abdominal adhesions.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study 30 healthy male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to two equal groups; one group taking green tea (A) and the other group taking normal saline (B). After anesthesia, their abdominal wall was opened, three longitudinal and transverse incisions of 2 cm in length were made on the right side of peritoneal surface and a 2Ã—2 cm piece of the left abdominal wall peritoneum was removed. Then, 4 ml green tea extract or normal saline was introduced into the abdominal cavity of the rats. Two weeks later in the second laparotomy, the adhesions were graded according to the strength, extent and appearance. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test, using SPSS v.16. 
Results: There were significant differences between the scores of groups A and B (P=0.001). The median adhesion scores were 3 and 8 in groups A and B, respectively. 
Conclusion: The results of this study provide the evidence that green tea extract has a potential capacity to effectively prevent postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions in rats and might be beneficial during clinical surgeries.

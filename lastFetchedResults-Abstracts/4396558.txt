The objective of present study is to determine if gender differences are likely relevant to the occurrence and progression of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Methods: A total of 24 healthy young adults (12 females) were recruited. All participants walked barefoot at self-selected velocity. Three-dimensional motion capture data were collected in synchrony with ground reaction force data. 3-dimensional moments at knee joint were computed through an Inverse Dynamics model. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between young healthy males and females in sagittal and frontal planes. However, females demonstrated 30% higher internal moment than male at 55% supporting phase. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the repeated and cumulative overload has a negative effect on the knee cartilage and ligament in transverse plane and therefore may be responsible for that females occurs double the incidence of KOA compared with male.

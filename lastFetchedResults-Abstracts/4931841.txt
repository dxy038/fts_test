Fast output sampling controllers have been proposed as an alternative to observer-based state feedback control. However, a typical problem with this type of controller is noise sensitivity due to large feedback gains. In this paper, it is proposed to allow a small deviation from the exact solution to the design problem in order to reduce noise sensitivity. This can be achieved by posing the design problem in the form of an LMI problem. Fast output error dynamics can be included as an additional design objective. A practical design example serves to illustrate the approach. The performance of the controller is compared with observer-based state feedback, and experimental results show that in this case fast output sampling has superior performance

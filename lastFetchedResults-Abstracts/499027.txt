Background and Objective: In this research, the brain-damaged patient's function in the visual-motor Bender-Gestalt Test was compared with their brain MRI portraits and normal subjects.

Subjects and Methods: Thirty patients with brain-damaged from neurosurgery department in Ahvaz Golestan Hospital were selected. Using matching method, 30 normal subjects were selected as control. The instruments used for this study were the Bender-Gestalt Test and brain MRI portraits. In order to analysis the data, t-test and correlation tests were used. Results: The results revealed that there was a significant difference between the performance of brain-damaged patients and normal subjects (control group) in the Bender-Gestalt Test. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the conclusions of the Bender-Gestalt Test and brain MRI portraits of patients. The qualitative performance of patients in the Bender-Gestalt Test was associated with their Brain MRI portrait.

Conclusion: There was a positive relationship between the performance of brain-damaged patients in the Bender-Gestalt Test and their Brain MRI portrait. Therefore, as the previous studies showed, the Bender-Gestalt Test as a neuropsychological test can be confidently used to studying the visual-motor performance of brain-damaged patients.

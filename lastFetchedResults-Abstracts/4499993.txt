The deployment problem of police patrol cars is more complicated than ordinary set cover problem due to the motility of vehicles and the multiple objectives, such as cost, response capability, deterrent capability and so on. This paper puts forward a new model for the solution of the patrol car deployment problem, which can be used to optimize the number of police cars and determine the patrol path. Road discretization treatment is introduced, simplifying the calculations and reducing the solution difficulty. Two criteria are set up in terms of response capability and deterrent capability for the judgment of a patrol scheme. A modified greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-objective model. As the test show, the modified greedy algorithm can stably produce reliable and cost-effective deployment scheme, which is helpful to find an equilibrium point between patrol cost and patrol effect and improve the level of public security.

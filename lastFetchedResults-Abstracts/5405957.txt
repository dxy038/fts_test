Sensor networks are often deployed more densely than would be minimally required. In such cases, node scheduling protocols can be used to determine which nodes are active, and which nodes sleep so as to conserve energy and prolong network lifetime. A drawback of node scheduling approaches, however, is delay due to node or communication failure(s), and subsequent wake-up of replacement node(s), during which monitoring coverage of some sub-region may be lost. This paper proposes an alternative approach for use in contexts in which the objective is to periodically collect sensing data that completely covers a region of interest. In the proposed approach, nodes dynamically determine during each round of data collection whether they should transmit their data, or whether their area is covered by neighbouring nodes that have already transmitted. Both unicast and broadcast-based data collection protocols are designed, and their performance compared using simulation to that of data collection protocols relying on node scheduling. Our results suggest that the coverage-preserving broadcast-based protocol can greatly improve reliability at the potential cost of increased traffic volume owing to non-minimal selection of transmitting nodes.

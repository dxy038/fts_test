To assist GK-12 teachers in their effort to improve science and math instruction, the STARS (Students, Teachers and Resources in the Sciences) program from the University of South Florida has developed a science training plan for teachers in the 3-5 band. STARS is a National Science Foundation project, which aims to promote systemic change in primary grade levels by enriching the math and science courses and by encouraging long-term professional development for the teachers. This paper discusses the tools employed to facilitate the integration of advanced concepts, such as materials science and nanotechnology, into the teacher curriculum through training modules. The modules were designed to target a population of lead science and math teachers. The main objective of the training program is to form and mature lead teachers that will disseminate to other elementary science educators the advanced science modules, and will provide the necessary in-class support during the implementation phase

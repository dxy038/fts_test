In this paper we apply a new joint synchronization-pilot sequence (JSPS) optimization design technique to multiple transmitter OFDM systems. One objective in the design of the JSPS for MISO transmissions is to eliminate the requirement for the different preamble fields used for coarse and fine synchronization and channel training. In this work, independent JSPSs are designed for each transmitter in a multiple antenna system, but are transmitted simultaneously from each antenna. Consequently, JSPSs can potentially reduce the overhead of multiple antenna preamble transmissions (improving bandwidth efficiency). The objective of this paper is to determine the performance advantages of joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel estimation using only the pilot portion of the JSPS. By jointly optimizing the position and power of each pilot across the transmitter antennas in Rayleigh fading channels with CFO, we show &gt; 15 dB SNR improvement in the performance of the channel estimator.

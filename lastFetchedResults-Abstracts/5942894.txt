The objective of this paper is to present performance peculiarities of industrial power systems employing single-tuned filters for harmonics mitigation and improved reactive power compensation. An industrial plant where harmonic problems occur was selected for this study. Measurements were performed to determine the harmonic generation of the plant loads. The filter harmonic problems were investigated using computer software.

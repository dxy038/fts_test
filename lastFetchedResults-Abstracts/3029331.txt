A new method for target motion parameter estimation is presented in this paper. A new objective function is proposed to avoid phase unwrapping procedure in the original method. The proposed method is more robust and accurate than the original one because it does not introduce any extra errors. To find a global optimum value, DE algorithm with a modification for constrained optimization problem has been applied. Computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Stereoscopic images have been widely studied in recent years from a technical point of view, but the related quality assessment does not follow this enthusiasm. An objective quality assessment method for serious noised stereoscopic images is proposed. It is based on 2D quality evaluation and the characteristics of stereoscopic images. The disparity map for stereoscopic image pairs is an important indicator of stereoscopic image quality assessment. The metric Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) is used to evaluate the quality of the noised disparity map, and the value of which is defined as DPSNR. The DPSNR methodology is used for objective quality assessment of serious noised stereoscopic images. The experimental results show that the proposed method could accurate and objective evaluation of stereoscopic images quality.

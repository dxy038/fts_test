Background: Various approaches have been used in the attempts to improve the quality
of frozenâ€“thawed mouse sperms. According to literatures, it seems that hyaluronic acid
(HA) has an important role on the permeability and motility of sperms and their
interaction with gametes.
Objective: For evaluation of HA supplementation on sperm characteristics and
fertilization capability, we investigated the effect of different doses of HA on mouse
sperm morphology, motility, vitality and fertilization capability after freezing and
thawing.
Materials and Methods: The cauda epididymes was removed from 6 male mice with
aseptic method. The sperm samples were frozen in 1.8 ml cryotubes with 18% raffinose
and 3% skimmed milk containing cryo-protectant solution. HA at the concentration of
750, 1000 or 1250 ?g/ml was supplemented to frozen-thawed sperms. Sperm motility
was measured with microscope, and fertilization rate was evaluated after routine IVF by
counting the fertilized oocytes. For sperm morphology, papaniclau staining was used
while; Eosin B was used for the assessment of sperm viability rate.
Results: HA supplementation (750 ?g/ml) improved motility parameters (p  <  0.05) and
increased the fertility rate (p  <  0.05). The effect of 1,000 ?g/ml HA was also positive on
the sperms. But 1,250 ?g/ml HA had negative effect on above mentioned characteristic.
On the other hand, none of these doses had any effect on sperm morphology.
Conclusion: The dose of 750 ?g/ml of HA has the greatest effect on the motility,
vitality and fertility rate of sperms after cryopreservation.

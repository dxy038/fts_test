Objective: To determine the demographic pattern and types of glaucomas and to evaluate the different types of operations performed in terms of efficacy and safety.Materia! and Methods: Hospital based retrospective case study. 2 years, from October 1999 to September 2001.Results: Out of 6382 patients requiring admission, glaucoma accounted for 331 (5.18%). The number of male patients was more than females. The mean age at the time of presentation was 40 years. The most common type of glaucoma requiring admission was primary glaucoma (63.86%), primary angle closure glaucoma being more common (28.91%) than primary open angle glaucoma (22.40%) and primary congenital glaucoma (9.63%). Secondary glaucoma constituted (36.14%) of the total glaucomas. Trabeculectomy was the most common type of operation (65%) performed for the control of glaucoma. Shallow anterior chamber was the most common complication (22.96%), followed by hyphema (11.48%) and choroidal detachment (5.55%). Trabeculectomy was successful in controlling intra-ocular pressure in 83.70% of cases. Cyclocryopexy was successful in controlling intraocular pressure in neovascular glaucoma in 66.66% cases. Cataract extraction was required for lens induced glaucoma and paracentesis for traumatic hyphema.Conclusion: Primary glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma requiring admission to hospital. Primary close angle glaucoma is a more common cause of admission to hospital than primary open angle glaucoma. Secondary glaucoma is an important cause of glaucoma in this part of the world. Trabeculectomy is an effective and relatively safe procedure for management of glaucoma in Pakistan.

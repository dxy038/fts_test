Electrospinning is a method of nanofiber filter media production. By this method, it is possible
to produce media with nanofiber in the range of nanometer to micrometer. Nanofibrous media provide a large
specific surface area in a finite volume thus they are suitable for filtration applications. In this study, nanofiber
non-woven membranes production of Nylon-6 by electrospinning method is investigated. It is demonstrated
that the total filter efficiency and pressure drop increases by increasing the thickness of filer media. The
objective of this experimental study was to find out the effect nylon concentration and thickness of nanofilter
media.Samples by different Nylon-6 concentrations and time of electrospinning were made. The filtration
characterizations of these media were investigated in different laboratory conditions. The SEM micrographs of
specimens treated by ImageJ software reveal that the porosity passes by a minimum at 10% concentration.
The diameter of nanofiber varied in the range of 47 to 89 nm when the nylon concentration varied from 7.5%
to 15% respectively. The efficiency was improved more than three times by electrospinning operation for all
three concentration samples. Our results showed that the highest efficiency obtained in this study was 99.96%
belonging to 10% Nylon-6 concentration for 45 minutes electrospinning time.

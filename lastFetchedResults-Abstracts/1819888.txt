Objective
 cervical vertical groove (LCVG), a dental anomaly found at the cervical region of upper permanent incisors, can be of esthetic, periodontal and prosthetic concern. The aim of this study was to define the prevalence and characteristics of LCVG.

 1250 examined subjects, 66 exhibited an LCVG. This group (age 19.7 ± 11.4 years) was then compared with a matched No-LCVG (control) group of 49 subjects (age 17.9 ± 5.7 years). Six LCVG characteristics were examined: distribution, severity and location of LCVG in central (I1) and lateral (I2) permanent maxillary incisors, Angle's classification, gender and presence of LCVG in siblings.
s
LCVG prevalence was 5.3% (single 3.76%; multiple 1.53%), found predominantly in I1 (93.9%) compared with I2 (p = 0.001). The anomaly presented mostly as a single configuration (71.21%); double configuration was predominantly homological bilateral, i.e., I1 + I1, or I2 + I2 (88%). LCVG in I2 was mainly associated with multi-configuration (75%). The severe form occurred only in I1. A mid-crown LCVG allocation was distinctive in I1 (62.2%, p = 0.001) and mesial-crown in I2 (66.7%, p = 0.038). LCVG was found mostly in males (p = 0.045). In the LCVG group 16.7% were siblings.
sions
rimarily involved I1 in single configuration as the target assaulted tooth and secondarily I2 mostly as a multi-configuration. The genetic impact on LCVG formation was primarily supported by the high prevalence in siblings and secondarily by the favourable occurrence in males, exclusive pattern of allocation within the crown and high occurrence of bilateral double-configuration LCVG.

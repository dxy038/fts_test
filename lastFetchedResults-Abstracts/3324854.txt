In the power system an unexpected increment of load demand has leads to the system to experience stressed condition. This phenomenon has led to voltage profile detract below the permissible limit. These Voltage profile in a stressed power system could be enhanced by having commensurate reactive power compensation. And this reactive power requirement is furnish through fast acting and self-commutated FACTS devices. This work presents an application of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) in optimizing the rating of Static VAR compensator (SVC) for voltage stability augmentation in power system. The reactive power provided by SVC is randomly distributed and it is the control variable in ABC algorithm and produces near optimal solutions. The proposed approach has been evaluated with three different objective functions namely, loss minimization, voltage profile and stability enhancement. The IEEE 14-Bus test system is used as test systems to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method. All the above analysis is carried out in MATLAB software environment. Results for the proposed method are presented and interpreted.

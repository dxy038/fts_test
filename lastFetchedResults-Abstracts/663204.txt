In the present work we performed a comparative study on the adsorption of the surfactants sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) (anionic), and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-100) (non-ionic) to 18 soils with organic matter (OM) and clay fraction contents varying over a broad range. The objective of the study was to gain further insight into the influence of the physicochemical and mineralogical properties of soils on the adsorption of surfactants by soils. Adsorption isotherms were obtained using concentrations below the critical micellar concentration (cmc) of the surfactants. The adsorption coefficients, Kf, determined from the Freundlich equation were lower for SDS (range 1.77–82.1, mean value 36.3) than for Triton X-100 (range 0.01–913, mean value 257). Simple and multiple correlation coefficients were obtained between Kf values and soil characteristics. The results obtained indicate the influence of the OM content on the adsorption of SDS (r = 0.64, p < 0.01) and of the clay fraction content on that of Triton X-100 (r = 0.83, p < 0.001). Additionally, we observed a preferential adsorption of SDS by the 1:1 mineral kaolinite (r = 0.54, p < 0.05), while Triton X-100 was adsorbed mainly by the 2:1 minerals, montmorillonite (r = 0.66, p < 0.01) and illite (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). According to the influence of different soil parameters on adsorption, different mechanisms of adsorption are proposed for each surfactant. Our findings point to the interest of considering the physicochemical properties of soils and also the mineralogy of the soil clay fraction when selecting a surfactant in technologies involving enhanced solubilization and removal of contaminants from soils and sediments.

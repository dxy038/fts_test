Underwater robots can record data that is difficult for humans to gather. In recent years, robotic underwater vehicles have become useful for variety of industrial and civil sectors in exploring the water bodies. They are used extensively by the scientific community to study the ocean, fresh water &amp; underwater environment. ZigBee is an efficient &amp; effective wireless network standard for wireless control and monitoring applications. It is an alternate technology that has changed connectivity between the communicating systems. The objective of this model is to design a wireless underwater robot for security purpose and better understand water and its environment with electronics, motion control and sensor system. This paper will present an implemented model of Embedded Wireless Data Acquisition system using zigbee which will be controlled using the PIC microcontroller which will be programmed using embedded C language. The wireless rotating camera will capture the images &amp; video. Sonar, depth, temperature sensors will acquire data and transmit to the user computer using zigbee. The DC motor is used for the movement of the robot &amp; controlled wirelessly by user. In our implementation the PIC acts as the Central Data Acquisition System which is controlling system and acquires the data from different subsystems of an unmanned underwater vehicle. This new method of implementation of zigbee as a medium for data acquisition system will be useful for cleaning, monitoring, understanding the clean and unclean underwater environment.

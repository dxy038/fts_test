The objective of this study is to explore the residential and agricultural use of small wind power systems in rural western New York, and to develop a sense of efficacy and efficiency of such systems. The study deals mainly with hybrid systems, that is, systems with wind as the primary source of power along with a variety of backup sources. The study also attempts to identify the technical and economic difficulties associated with small-scale applications of these systems. Numerous case studies revealed common misconceptions regarding wind turbines and the barriers these ideas create in the progress of a rural wind program. Lack of incentive programs makes it even more difficult for wind-based energy share to grow in Western New York.

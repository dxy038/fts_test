A novel spiropyran nanofiber was developed an applied to the extraction of heavy metal ions from drinking water. The objective of this work was to capitalize on the high surface area achievable via nanotechnology to develop a high efficiency, cost effective system to enable analysis for a range of applications including ground, lake and river water monitoring. Assessment and remediation of heavy metal contamination is of utmost importance in industrial, environmental, and human water consumption applications. We have developed technology for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions without the need for ancillary reagents in the metal binding-and-release process, as are common in more conventional methods. As an alternative, we have employed photoactivable compounds, triggered by illumination with light of appropriate wavelengths, to control binding and release events. This technology has the potential to reduce the high consumption of ancillary reagents and decrease waste stream volume, not to mention the capacity to reduce the high recurring costs borne by users.

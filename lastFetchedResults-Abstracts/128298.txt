Background & Aims: Acute promyelocytic leukemia is one of the severe leukemia which commonly occurres through a chromosomal translocation between retinoic acid receptor gene (RAR) on chromosome 17 and promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) on chromosome 15. Chemotherapy drugs and ATRA are the most important therapies for this kind of leukemia. Drugs of chemotherapy, seems mainly to kill the leukemia cells through induction of apoptosis in those cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of apoptosis and cytotoxic effect of Cytarabine, Daunorubicin, Doxorubicin and ATRA on HL60 cell line.
Materials & Methods: HL60 cell line cultured in RPMI-1640 media consists of FCS 10%, CO2 5% at 37Â°C of temperature. The certain numbers of HL60 cell line were treated by the drugs Cytarabine, Daunorubicin, Doxorubicin and ATRA. The resulting apoptosis was studied by DNA ladder, fluorescent staining and flowcytometry methods. Also, the cytotoxic effects of above mentioned drugs studied by MTT method.
Results: Finding from DNA ladder , florescent staining and Flowcytometry methods showed that the drugs Cytarabine , Daunorubicin , Doxorubicin and ATRA induced apoptosis in HL60 cell line(p<0.01).As well as, MTT method showed the cytotoxic effects of aforementioned drugs.
Discussion: Our results indicated that the cytotoxic effects of these drugs are very weaker than their apoptosis effect. These drugs significantly killed the cells by inducing the mechanism of apoptosis.

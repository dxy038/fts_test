Background and Objective: Arsenic accumulation in rice has become a major disaster in the recent decade. A number of studies indicated that rice is a major source of arsenic pollution in human diets. This study assessed the arsenic (As) accumulation in rice grain in Meydavood where rice is the main agricultural crop of the region. This research studied the probable presence of arsenic in the rice grains of Maydavood region in Khozestan province and evaluated the arsenic intake through daily rice consumption.

Materials and Methods: Ten rice samples were taken from Meydavood farms during cropping time. Samples were analyzed for arsenic using ICP-MS.

Results: Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software and then compared with the World Health Organization standards. The mean concentrations of arsenic in rice samples were 0.079 ppm based on dry weight. The results showed that in 30% of the samples, arsenic concentration exceeded the WHO standards. Due to the high concentration of arsenic in rice samples, the arsenic intake by human was calculated using a regimen of safety and considering a consumption rate of 110 g of rice per day and an average body weight of 70 kg.

Conclusion: The total daily intake of As (TDI-iAs) for adults (70 kg body weight and 110 g rice consumption) was in the range of WHO recommended provisional tolerable daily intake value. Since the source of arsenic in Meydavoud is a natural source, thus, comprehensive studies are recommended on its water resources. Additionally, a solution should be found to prevent probable health effects on the residents.

The objective of the Baikal Project is the creation of a kilometer-scale high-energy neutrino observatory: the Gigaton Volume Detector (GVD) in Lake Baikal. Basic elements of the GVD – new optical modules, FADC readout units, and underwater communication systems – were investigated and tested in Lake Baikal with prototype strings in 2008–2010. We describe the results of prototype strings operation and review the preliminary design and expected sensitivity of the GVD telescope.

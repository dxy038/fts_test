It is highly desirable to reduce the need for medical services by maintaining the health of the population, and intensive monitoring of health parameters is likely to become necessary to attain this goal. A new concept of health monitoring is described, in which an individualÂ´s health parameters are automatically monitored at home without disturbing their daily activities. We review and show attempts at developing such monitoring techniques, which include monitoring during sleep, via the bathtub or toilet seat, daily activities and daily behaviors. These studies show that home health monitoring can be achieved with developed sensors and instruments. Also we show that monitoring daily behavior can be realized with only simple sensors and systems. To realize this concept, fully automated objective evaluations and/or analysis of data must be developed and large scale computational analysis is essential for those evaluations.

Abstract

Objective

Treatment of intractable seizures other than spasms is difficult and controversial.

There are few studies on efficacy of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in treatment of patients with intractable seizure.

Materials & Methods

Twenty-five patients with intractable seizure other than spasm including 14 boys and 11 girls with median age of 58 months referred to university clinics of Pediatric Neurology in Isfahan, Iran, during 2014-2015 were prospectively investigated. ACTH was administrated according to our protocol. All cases were followed regularly and assessed for response to treatment and probable side effects, 3 wk after beginning of ACTH therapy and three months after the ACTH therapy. EEG finding were recorded before and three months after the end of ACTH therapy. Statistical analysis using Freidman test and Wilcoxon signed – rank test were performed in order to compare seizure frequency and EEG changes, respectively.

Results

Mean A significant reduction ( > 80%) in seizure frequency in 11 cases (44%) and moderate reduction (50%-80%) in 7 (28%) after 3 wk of ACTH therapy.

Despite initial positive response, recurrence of seizure was observed in 7 out of 18 cases with favorable initial response within 3 months after ACTH therapy cessation. The comparison of EEG finding before and 3 months after ACTH therapy using Wilcoxon signed – rank test showed  significant differences.

Conclusion

ACTH therapy may be useful in treatment of children with intractable seizures who are resistant to usual antiepileptic drugs. However further studies should be performed to determine the long-term efficacy of ACTH in treatment of intractable seizure.

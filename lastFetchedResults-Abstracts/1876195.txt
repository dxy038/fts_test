Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine whether a nurse-monitored structured care program resulted in a more effective use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in elderly patients compared with standard care in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Methods: Hospitalized patients were screened to identify individuals with CHF, age more than 65 years, New York Heart Association classification III to IV, and no contraindications to ACE inhibitor treatment. One hundred forty-five patients were randomized to a nurse-monitored structured care program that included uptitration of enalapril to a target dose of 10 mg twice a day or to standard care. Six-month follow-up data were collected. Results: The mean age of the randomized patients was 81 years. Although the proportion of patients treated with an ACE inhibitor did not differ between structured care (70%) and standard care (64%), the number of patients with the target ACE inhibitor dose was significantly higher in the structured care group (26% versus 11% in the standard care group; P &lt;.018). Treatment had to be discontinued in 26% of the patients because of adverse effects. Conclusion: The patients in this study were older than in previous intervention studies and had considerable comorbidity and reduced tolerance for ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitor treatment was underused but improved with the structured care program, although achieved treatment levels were below those in the large intervention trials in patients with CHF.

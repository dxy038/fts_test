A technique for automatically positioning a reference system in radiographic images is presented. A number of tantalum markers are inserted into femurs of patients during prosthetic joint implant operations. X-ray images are taken immediately and afterwards at time intervals. By identifying the tantalum markers a reference system can be established, which is essential to subsequent image measurement for the detection of implant migration. The technique can automatically detect the tantalum markers and precisely localise the reference system. It has been shown to be more objective and reproducible than manual recognition

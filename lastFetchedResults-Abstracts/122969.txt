Introduction: Electrolyte imbalance usually happens in I.C.U patients. Magnesium is one of the most important ions disturbance of this ion, causes hemodynamic instability, Cardiovascular dysfunction, Seizure, muscle weakness, Failure of weaning and influence other ions concentration. Objective: The onset time of magnesium imbalance after trauma and how does trauma mechanism interfere it, is the aim of this observational study. The aim of our study was survey the influence of kind of injury on magnesiume imbalance.
Materials and Methods: In this Analytical study serum Magnesium (Mg) in patients with head trauma compared with patients with extremities trauma at admission time in ICU.
We studied 30 head injury and 30 patients with extremities trauma during 1380. Two groups were same in age and sex and had no medical history. (PS I, II)
24 hour after trauma patients was admitted in I.C.U and blood sample was taken for evaluating serum Mg. [with calorimetric spectrophotometry (Reagent: Xylidylblue)]. Our Statistical Analysis was Chi- square.
Results: Results showed that mean serum Mg of head trauma patients was 1.84± 0.19 meq / L which was significantly lower than extremities trauma (2.23 ±0.29meq/ L, P < 0.02).
Conclusion: This study showed that serum Mg in patients with head trauma decreases sooner and more sever than extremities trauma and concerning this on the first course of treatment in ICU and proper correction should be in mind.

The study of photovoltaic systems in an
efficient manner requires a precise knowledge of the IV
and PV characteristic curves of photovoltaic modules.
Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop two
different computer models to simulate the behavior of a
photovoltaic cell, to be able to represent these IV and PV
curves. Both models are implemented in Matlab-
Simulink. These two models are part of a larger study of
different ways to simulate a cell or photovoltaic panel
presented in section two. To demonstrate the validity of
the models graphs IV and PV curves resulting with those
provided by the manufacturer have been compared. To
analyze the operation and the suitability of the model it is
necessary to have precise knowledge of these curves.
With experimental and technical data of the commercial
panel Mitsubishi PV-TD185MF5 will be validated these
models.

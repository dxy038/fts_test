A risk-based strategy for Listeria monocytogenes has been developed by New Zealand Food Safety Authority. Incidents of L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods reported to the regulatory authority were analysed to identify common factors that contributed to the contamination. In addition, the current regulatory framework and available food industry guidance were reviewed to prepare a strategy that will provide a consistent and informed approach to managing the risk of L. monocytogenes. Also recognised is the future impact of an aging population and an increase in the availability and range of chilled ready-to-eat foods that should be integrated into the strategy if an objective of ‘no increase in the reported incidence of foodborne listeriosis after five years’ is to be achieved.

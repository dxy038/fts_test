SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data is an important tool for the study of reservoirs. An important variable for reservoir management is precise definition of the land/water boundary. The double bounce reflection present in SAR data allow one to recognize those areas present in the Amazon basin. The objective of this research is to define a methodology to determine the flooding variables (area and volume) of a hydroelectric reservoir. The flooded area by the Serra da Mesa reservoir is located over the Central Brazilian Shield covered by cerrado vegetation. This study used topographic maps at a scale of 1:25000, and SAR/JERS-1 images, from which information about the dam boundary was extracted. Several classification strategies were tested for the classification of SAR/JERS-1 images. The Serra da Mesa reservoir is located in Goias State, Central Brazil. A V-shaped valley characterizes the topography. This type of topography produces a flooded area of dentritic shape, which produces a large number of aquatic environments within the reservoir. The L band SAR image provides a good separability between the flooded forest and that not flooded. A large variation in water level is determined by the hydrologic cycle of the region. This change in water level affects the water volume and reservoir flow during the dry season

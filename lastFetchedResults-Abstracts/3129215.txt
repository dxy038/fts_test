Concerning the virtual working situation of a steel mill, an arithmetic theory based on fuzzy self-adaptation is proposed to the computer-aided pass design (CARD) system, which transforms the multi-objective functions under the identical constraints to a single target function, and uses the variable step-size dynamic programming algorithm to carry out the optimization of the pass rolls. The results of the actual application indicated that the quality of various rolling regulations designed by this CARD system is higher than the original site regulations obviously, the total energy consumption of rolling various wire rods production has been reduced from 1% to 5%, and the tensility between rolls reduced by 10%, which implements continuous rolling with micro tensility under the load balance.

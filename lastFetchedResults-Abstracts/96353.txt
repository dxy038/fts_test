We present a model for quantum-well (QW) semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) that considers bidirectional field propagation and the carrier densities in the barrier and QW regions. Carrier capture from the barriers into the QWs and carrier escape from the QWs to the barriers are included by means of effective capture and escape times. The model incorporates the wavelength dependence of the optical response of the active region and the effects of spectral hole burning via an analytical approximation to the susceptibility of the active material, which allows one to very effectively include the wavelength dependence of the output properties of the SOA. The model is used to analyze the experimental results obtained for a multiquantum-well SOA. The simulations results show a good agreement with the experimental data when a carrier-density dependent escape time from the QW to the barrier regions is considered.

Mandarin objective assessment plays a very important role in the speech assessment. It still has a long way to go before it reaches the level of success. In this paper, the novel mandarin objective assessment based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed. The mandarin pronunciation is divided into consonant, vowel and tone. And the feature parameters of pronunciation are surveyed. The experimental results show that the SVM method has good classification ability and robust performances.

This paper introduces the developed hardware platforms of the smart antenna transmitter system and its implementation details and presents the novel concept of smart antenna system which requires digital beamforming based on Taguchi Method. This paper investigates how the implementation on STM8 of the signal processing in hardware affects the performance of the adaptive array antenna. This system shows excellent performance for the radiation pattern and capable to steering by adjusting the relative phases of the signal received or transmitted by each antenna. The objective of the design is to construct smart antenna beamforming systems with hardware-software implemented Taguchi Method.

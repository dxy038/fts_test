Expert judgments enter several aspects of many scientific endeavors.
They are typically employed to interpret data, predict systems' behaviour and
assess uncertainties. In particular, expert judgments are expected to be a relevant
source of data for use in performance assessments of high-level radioactive
waste repositories. In this paper we consider the task of aggregating the
judgments provided by experts with the objective of emphasizing a potential
source of bias that might affect the results of the analysis. Typically, the analysts
combine mathematical and behavioral schemes to obtain the aggregate
measures desired for decision-making purposes. Within this approach to data
aggregation, mathematical models are used as tools for sensitivity analysis
and they should account for between-expert (expert-to-expert) as well as
within-expert variability. A practical example regarding a formal expert judgment
elicitation exercise for the future climate at Yucca Mountain vicinity is
presented

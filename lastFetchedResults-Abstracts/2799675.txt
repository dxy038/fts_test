The major challenge in future mobile networks is how to improve throughput to support the increase demand in traffic. Software Defined Networks is the new technology proposed but so far it has been proposed to be integrated in the current 4G architecture without major changes. However, we present the mobile networks beyond 4G where Software Defined Network should be used in a more disruptive approach to redesign the current architecture. This proposal includes the proper migration path to ensure reasonable transition phase. The objective is not to meet short term needs but to fulfill the future throughput requirements by revamping the transport network in the mobile backhaul, and moving most of the current LTE network elements to the cloud. In this approach we remove completely the core mobile network as it is known today. Instead, the mobile architecture beyond 4G consists of a simplified access network formed by base stations i.e. eNodeBs, interconnected through a backhaul network composed by SDN switches managed from the cloud together with the rest of LTE network elements.

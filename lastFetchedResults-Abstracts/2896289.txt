The main objective of this paper is develop techniques to maximize the throughput of all cores so that both power and temperature constraints met for a multicore processor. The key levers that we have used for this optimization are the clock frequency as well as throttling of cores. The latter shuts off cores during inactive periods. We propose multiple heuristics for maximizing the data parallel throughput on multi-core processors with different frequency scaling schemes.

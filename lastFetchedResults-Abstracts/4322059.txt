In this paper, a hierarchical evaluating model (HEM) is proposed for water environment. Different from most of current methods, HEM absorbs the advantages of subjective weight determining evaluation and objective weight determining evaluation, attribute hierarchical model (AHM) is used to determine subjective weight; rough set method is used to determine objective weight. The subjective and objective weights are integrated by proposed related attribute-weight; from which the synthetic attribute-weight is constructed. Then evaluation formula of objects is formed based on synthetic attribute-weight. Finally, a comprehensive model is acquired to evaluate water environment. An example is studied to illustrate the detailed implementation process of the proposed approach. The encouraging results show the effectiveness of the presented method.

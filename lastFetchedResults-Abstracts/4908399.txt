In space, microwave bend filters applications are often encountered. Our researches are in keeping with the general pattern of straight and curved waveguide filter structures. More particularly, evanescent modes raise a tremendous interest. An efficient VisualC++ CAD tool has been already developed on CNES behalf for these filtering straight structures at X-band. A genetic algorithm (GA) optimization completed it to carry out the filter synthesis. The accuracy of this computed mode-matching technique applied to an evanescent mode straight waveguide was confirmed by many prototypes. We proceed with the analysis of waveguide bends in order to replace dielectric insert terms. Thus, the objective of this paper is to describe an efficient and simple method to model waveguides with bends, applied to the synthesis of high power filtering structures. In this paper, we are focusing on the bend study and on the critical problem of the straight/curved waveguide discontinuity too, before the plotted results.

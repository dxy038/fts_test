In the beginning of 1996 the Drossel collaboration was established between the FZR and the BINP Novosibirsk for the development of a new electron injector. The injector combines the principle of a photocathode RF gun with the use of superconducting (sc) accelerating cavities. The objective of this development is a sc RF gun, which delivers a bunched electron beam in continuous wave (cw) mode. The beam parameters should fulfil the requirements of the ELBE project, a superconducting accelerator currently under construction at Forschungszentrum Rossendorf. The applications of this accelerator are an infrared FEL user facility and nuclear physics, radiation physics experiments, which demand a high flexibility for the beam parameters of the injector

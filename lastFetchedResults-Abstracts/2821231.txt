In this paper we propose an optimized broadcasting mechanism which uses very limited signaling overhead. The main objective is to select the most appropriate relay nodes according to a given cost function. Basically, after receiving a broadcast packet each potential relay node computes a binary code according to a given cost function. Then, each node starts a sequence of transmit/listen intervals following this code. In other words, each 0 corresponds to a listening interval and each 1 to a transmit interval. During this active acknowledgment signaling period, each receiver applies the following rule: if it detects a signal during any of its listening intervals, it quits the selection process, since a better relay has also captured the packet. Finally, we split the transmission range into several sectors and we propose that all the nodes within the same sector use the same CDMA orthogonal spreading codes to transmit their signals. The CDMA codes used in two different sectors are orthogonal, which guarantees that the packet is broadcast in all possible directions.

This work presents a study on frequency tunable ability based on varactor-loaded quarter wavelength uniform-impedance resonator (UIR). The quantitative analysis of the tunable range of the fundamental resonant frequency (&#8594;<sub>1</sub>) versus capacitance under different varactor-located position along the proposed quarter wavelength UIR is given. The methods of realizing the bidirectional tuning of &#8594;<sub>1</sub> and independent tuning of &#8594;<sub>1</sub> without affecting the third harmonic are presented. Accordingly, the analysis and calculated results are provided in detail.

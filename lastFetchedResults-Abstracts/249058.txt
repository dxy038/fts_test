Several modelling methods have recently been developed for the dynamic analysis of low-speed tracked
vehicles. These methods were used to demonstrate the signi cant e ect of the force of the interaction be-
tween the track links and vehicle components, even when low speeds are considered. It is the objective of
this investigation to develop compliant track link models and investigate the use of these models in the dy-
namic analysis of high-speed, high-mobility tracked vehicles. There are two major di culties encountered in
developing the compliant track models discussed in this paper. The  rst is due to the fact that the integration
step size must be kept small in order to maintain the numerical stability of the solution. This solution includes
high oscillatory signals resulting from the impulsive contact forces and the use of sti  compliant elements
to represent the joints between the track links. The characteristics of the compliant elements used in this
investigation to describe the track joints are measured experimentally. A numerical integration method having
a relatively large stability region is employed in order to maintain the solution accuracy, and a variable step
size integration algorithm is used in order to improve the e ciency. The second di culty encountered in this
investigation is due to the large number of the system equations of motion of the three-dimensional multibody
tracked vehicle model. The dimensionality problem is solved by decoupling the equations of motion of the
chassis subsystem and the track subsystems. Recursive methods are used to obtain a minimum set of equations
for the chassis subsystem. Several simulations scenarios including an accelerated motion, high-speed motion,
braking, and turning motion of the high-mobility vehicle are tested in order to demonstrate the e ectiveness
and validity of the methods proposed in this investigation

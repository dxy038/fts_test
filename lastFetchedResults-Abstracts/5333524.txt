Control applications of switched mode power supplies have been widely explored. The main objective of research and development (R&amp;D) in this field has always been to find the simplest method to analyze and model the DC/DC converter and the most suitable control method to be implemented in various DC/DC converter topologies. This paper presents a simple and systematic approach to the design of a practical digital signal processing (DSP) based proportional-integral-derivative (PID) voltage controller for buck converters. A simple and easy-to-follow design procedure is demonstrated. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the design procedure.

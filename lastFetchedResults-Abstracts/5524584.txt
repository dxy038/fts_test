In this paper, we study the delay-constrained information coverage problem in mobile wireless networks. Motivated by real application needs, our formulation takes advantage of the node mobility for information collection, which takes place when a node moves into the proximity of stationary base stations. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first formulation for the delay-constrained information coverage problem, which targets at optimal base stations placement with the objective of maximizing information collection within a constrained time. We prove that this problem is NP- hard and we develop theoretical analysis to derive its upper and lower performance bounds. We then develop approximation techniques and use simulations to verify their effectiveness.

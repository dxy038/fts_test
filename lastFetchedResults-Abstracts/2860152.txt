Distributed inductive power transfer (IPT) systems address the range restrictions of electric vehicles (EVs), charging the battery on-road through a loosely coupled transformer. Comparing different primary and secondary coil topologies is the main objective of this paper. Variations including single and multiphase layouts are analyzed by laboratory experimentation and finite element simulations. A system parameter optimization algorithm is introduced, utilizing sensitivity analysis techniques and equivalent circuit representation. Interphase power circulation in multiphase system primaries is addressed by a terminal correction setup, minimizing the interphase mutual inductance. The optimized designs are compared in terms of power and efficiency under alignment variations.

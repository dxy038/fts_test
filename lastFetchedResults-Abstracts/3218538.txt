Two optimal algorithms, MTA* and MT-RBA*, are presented to find the optimal yard crane (YC) job sequence for serving a fleet of vehicles for delivery and pickup jobs with scheduled deadlines and predicted vehicle arrival times. The objective is to minimize the total tardiness of incoming vehicle jobs. This is important for minimizing vessel turnaround time. In the search for an optimal job sequence, the evaluation of the total tardiness of (partial) job sequences requires sequence dependent job service times. Simulation is embedded in our optimization algorithms to help provide accurate YC service times. This results in a more accurate evaluation of job tardiness but incurs costs. Experimental results show that this is feasible despite the simulation costs. MTA* and MT-RBA* significantly outperform the Earliest Due Date First and the Smallest Completion time Job First heuristics in minimizing job tardiness. MT-RBA* is computationally more efficient.

Background & Objective: The aim of faculty evaluation is to improve teaching quality. One of the most common methods of faculty evaluation is student evaluation of teaching (SET). The original purpose of SET was to provide feedback that can be used by faculties to improve their teaching (formative evaluation).  In time, this function was replaced by summative evaluation (for administrative purposes). Using the SET results to guide improvements in the teaching process is viewed generally as an acceptable practice, but utilization of the SET results for administrative purposes is a matter of hot debate. Regarding the pivotal role of the SET results in promotion of an individual faculty this narrative review was carried out to gain an overview of critiques that have been voiced on SET. In-country studies reveal that a high percentage of faculties have criticisms towards SET so that its validity becomes questionable. According to some international studies not only the SET is an invalid measure for assessing teaching effectiveness but also it may lead to decrement in teaching quality.  Nationwide studies enrolling a representative sample of Medical Universities are warranted to reply to the question that “Does administrative use of the SET results lead to improvement in teaching quality?”

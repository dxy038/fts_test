Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are one of the most important components of electronic equipment
and encompass a variety of metals, including the majority of the valuable metals, and also most of the toxic
components in e-waste. The objective of the present work proposes an integrated (hybrid) method for the
recovery of copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) from waste PCBs using a combination of biometallurgical
(biological) and hydrometallurgical (chemical) processes. The recovery was effected using the combination of
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and 2 M HNO3. The leaching of metals was experimented using inorganic acid,
bacteria and the integration of both acid and bacteria. From the initial experiments, it was observed that the
percentage of nickel, copper and zinc solubilised into leaching solution from the actual PCB basically decreased
with the increase in the concentration of e-waste from 10g/L to 100g/L. The hybrid method was compared
against the individual chemical and biological methods and proved to be a better method than the other two,
being rapid, efficient, economical and eco-friendly.

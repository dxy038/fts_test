This paper introduces a multi-objective fault indicator (FI) placement method in electric distribution systems. The prevalent FI placement problem formulation is extended by considering effects of existing protection and control devices on customers´ restoration time. Moreover, the customers´ average restoration time index (CARTI) is proposed, as a new technical objective function with respect to uncertainties of automatic switching. Furthermore, a multi-objective solution approach is developed to simultaneously minimize indispensable economic and technical objectives. The resultant optimization problem is solved through a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) based algorithm, accompanied by a fuzzy decision making method to select the best result among the obtained Pareto optimal set of solutions. Assuming SAIDI and CARTI as technical objectives, the proposed method is applied to bus number four of the Roy Billinton test system (RBTS4), as well as a real-life distribution network with about 5500 customers, followed by a discussion on results.

Objective. To evaluate the impact of TRAM flap delayed breast reconstruction on health related quality of life in patients who had undergone mastectomy.
Methods. Twenty-five patients following mastectomy were selected consecutively from the Plastic Surgery/Mastology Units of two university hospitals. All subjects underwent breast reconstruction with the use of pedicled TRAM flap. The patients' health related quality of life was assessed by a validated instrument, the SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire. This was applied preoperatively and postoperatively at 3, 6 and 12-months follow-up. A group of 20 women with mastectomies who have not undergone breast reconstruction was used as a control. To assess patients' satisfaction with breast reconstruction we used Alderman's modified general satisfaction subscale.
Results. There was a progressive improvement in all dimensions of the SF-36, and this was statistically significant for seven of the eight dimensions. The scores were significantly higher on ‘role emotional’ and ‘mental health’ at 3 months postoperatively, on ‘health perception’ and ‘role physical’ at month 6 and on ‘physical function’, ‘pain’, health perception and ‘social function’ at postoperative month 12. Despite the increase in scores, no significant changes in ‘vitality’ were found. There was no significant preoperative difference between the control group and studied patients, and the control group's scores were significantly lower in all dimensions when compared to postoperative month 12, except on ‘physical function’. The level of patients' satisfaction with the TRAM flap breast reconstruction was high.
Conclusion. The data of this study suggest that delayed breast reconstruction with the use of the pedicled TRAM flap provides an improvement in health related quality of life of patients who have undergone mastectomy.

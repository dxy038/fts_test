This paper will report on the development of a side scan sonar data storing system for use on the autonomous submersible EAVE. The design of the system will be covered from the mechanical and electrical standpoints. Special attention will be paid to test procedures and results. Future improvements will also be considered. The project´s objective was to mate a side scan sonar unit donated by Klein Associates to MSEL´s unmanned, untethered vehicle. The design of this sonar data storing system eliminated the need for communication to the sea surface. An autonomous recording system enables the unit to gather information in areas otherwise inaccessible. Future goals of autonomous recording systems will be the eventual coupling of the sonar readings directly to the submersible´s control computer.

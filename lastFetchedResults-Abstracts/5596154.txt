Experience with accessibility and controllability suggests that the latter is much more difficult to characterize. The authorÂ´s objective is to make this relative difficulty precise in a formal sense. In the spirit of computational complexity, he picks a class of systems (bilinear subsystems) and shows that for this class the accessibility property can be decided in polynomial time while controllability is NP-hard

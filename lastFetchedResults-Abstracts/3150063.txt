The objective was to study changes in EEG time-domain Kolmogorov entropy and cortical lateralization of brain function areas during the mental task of geometric figure rotation in healthy human subjects. EEG data for healthy subjects were acquired during mental task using a net of 6 electrodes. The signals were recorded for 10s during the task. Kolmogorov entropy values during the task were calculated. It was found that the lateralization determined by Kolmogorov entropy of EEG proposed in this paper is consistent with previous known studies and the dominant hemisphere may change from one lateral to the contralateral sometime during the mental task of geometric figure rotation. The results shows that this method may become an important tool on lateralization and receives increasing attention for clinical applications.

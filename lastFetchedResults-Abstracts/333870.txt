The purpose of this study was to show the qualitative and quantitative MRI characteristics of soft-tissue masses in differentiation of benign and malignant lesions. A total of 90 soft-tissue lesions were reviewed in this study. The scoring system presents a more objective diagnostic performance in the prediction of benign or malignant masses. With the use of this scoring system, unnecessary biopsy can be precluded in benign lesions.

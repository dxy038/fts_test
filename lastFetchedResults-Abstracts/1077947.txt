Tajura seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant with a capacity of 10,000 m3/d is the biggest RO plant in Libya. The plant is designed to produce high quality drinking and industrial water. The plant consists of a seawater intake, pretreatment, two stages of reverse osmosis membranes in two lines, post-treatment and product water storage tank. The plant has been working successfully with a capacity of 50% for over 18 years. Improvements of the plant will be made to work with the 100% capacity to minimize the operation cost and to eliminate the water problems of the area of Tajura. The objective of this paper is to present the design features of the RO plant and the improvements to be made. The design parameters, operational processes and operational data are described.

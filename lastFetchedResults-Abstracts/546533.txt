Background and Aim: Given the increasing prevalence of obesity in Iran and worldwide and its related complications and diseases, identification of effective methods reducing its risk factors and complications in obese persons, could have important clinical applications. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of three month progressive resistance training on serum levels of leptin and interleukin-6 in obese men.
Materials and Methods: In a Quazi experimental trial, 20 obese men (BMI?30, 18-32 years) were selected from volunteer subjects and randomly assigned into two groups, resistance training (n=10) and control (n=10) groups. The experimental subjects performed a progressive resistance training program included eight resistance exercises, three times a week for three month. At baseline and after last training session, 5 mL blood samples were taken from antecubital vein of all subjects after 12-14 hours fasting state. Serum levels of leptin and interleukin-6 were assayed pre-training and 48 hours after the last training session. Statistical analysis was performed using paired and independent t-test, at p < 0.05 significance level.
Results: After three month resistance training, the serum leptin levels (from 21.23±4.86 ng/dl to 16.21±5.36 ng/dl; p=0.007) and interleukin-6 levels (from 8.53 ± 0.29 to 5.32± 0.81 pg/ml, p=0.0004) significantly decreased in the training group, while leptin (from 19.91±6.91 ng/dl to 20.31±7.39 ng/dl; p=0.463) and interleukin-6 (from 9.51±0.62 pg/dl to 9.61±0.67 pg/dl; p=0.641) remained unchanged in control subjects at the same time.
‍Conclusion: The results of the study showed that long-term resistance training significantly reduces the serum levels of leptin and interlukine-6. Therefore, it is suggested that these trainings could be an effective and low-cost therapeutic method to control the percentage of fat and body composition in obese young men. According to this view, obese men are recommended to perform regular resistance training.

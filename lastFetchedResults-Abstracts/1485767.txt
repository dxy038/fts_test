Listeriosis concerns have led to increased antimicrobial use; reformulation may affect quality. The objective was to determine the effects of potential antimicrobials on quality of natural casing frankfurters. Eleven treatments were used: no antimicrobials (control); 3.0% sodium lactate and sodium diacetate blend (SL + SD); 1.0%, 2.5%, and 3.5% buffered sodium citrate (SC); 1.0%, 2.5%, and 3.5% buffered sodium citrate and sodium diacetate blend (SC + SD); and 1.0%, 2.5%, and 5.0% whey protein peptides (WP). Trained and consumer panelists analyzed sensory characteristics. Cooking yield was unaffected by treatment (P &gt; 0.05). Addition of SC and SC + SD decreased pH (P &lt; 0.05). Texture profile analysis was conducted. Hunter color values and growth of aerobic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria were monitored over 15 weeks of storage. No samples reached spoilage. SL + SD 3% caused few changes; WP caused changes perceived as negative; and SC and SC + SD caused changes often perceived as positive.

Objective.
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of polyethylene fiber ribbon on the transverse strength of denture base polymer.
Methods.

One or two layers of ultra-high-modulus or ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene (UHMP) ribbon were placed into rhombic test specimens of denture base polymer. The specimens were tested with three-point-loading, and the ribbons were positioned on the tension side of the specimen. Fractured test specimens were examined with SEM.
Results.

The transverse strength of the specimens increased slightly from the incorporation of UHMP fiber ribbons (unreinforced polymer: 91 MPa; with one ribbon layer: 118 MPa; with two ribbon layers: 125 MPa). Adherence of the UHMP fibers to the denture base polymer was poor.
Significance.

Improvement in transverse strength of the specimens was modest although the fibers were placed into an ideal position of the specimens. This lack of improvement was due to poor adhesion of the UHMP fibers to the polymer and inadequate impregnation of the fibers with denture base resin.

A novel centroid based pulse width modulation (PWM) switching strategy is proposed for full bridge inverter application. The objective of new switching strategy is to minimize both the THD and lower order harmonics. The proposed approach provides better performance in terms of improved THD and lower order harmonics when compared to other conventional PWM techniques. The centroid based technique (CBT) described here in is to give a high quality inverter output waveform without leading to significant switching losses. In the proposed centroid based switching strategy, the width of each switching pulse is proportional to the corresponding area of the sampled reference waveform while the position of each pulse in the time domain is aligned with the centroid of the corresponding area of the sampled reference waveform

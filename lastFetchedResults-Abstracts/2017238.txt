The objective of the present study was to evaluate the distribution, sources, origins, and environmental risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (16 US EPA priority pollutants) pollution in 23 surface sediments from Cyprus coast. The mean total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations in the sediments from Gemi Konagi, Girne and Gazi Magusa areas were found 47, 52 and 50 ng/g, respectively. Molecular ratios and principle component analysis indicated that PAH pollution originated mainly from fossil sources, with higher pyrolytic contributions. The 2â€“3 ring PAHs were dominant in Cyprus sediments. Concentrations of PAHs observed in this study were compared with available soil quality guidelines and the concentrations were lower than the guideline values. The guideline values suggested that the Cyprus sediments were likely to be not contaminated by toxic PAH compounds.

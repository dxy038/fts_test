In this work, we have investigated the optical fiber master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) array by using numerical solutions of rate equations, in co, counter and bidirectional pumping modes. Moreover, the small signal gain (gamma<sub>0</sub>) and saturation power (P<sub>sat</sub>) are predicted theoretically by fitting the steady state amplification relation on numerical data for the optimum length.

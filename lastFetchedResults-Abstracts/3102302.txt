The hybrid reconfigurable computing system that couples the traditional processor with the reconfigurable hardware is becoming a mainstream today. A new hybrid reconfigurable computing system MPRS (Multi-Pipeline Reconfigurable System) is presented, which has multiple linear arrays for pipelined applications. MPRSpsila architecture and the mapping method are discussed. Firstly, a complete system including the MPRS simulator at behavior level and its programming environment is built. Secondly, a systematic approach to MPRS arrays based on the DGRV (Dependency Graph with Reconfigurable Variable) is discussed, and the objective functions and design constraint are analyzed. Finally, this paper tests several typical applications.

Background
We sought to investigate the role of the bidirectional Glenn with antegrade pulmonary blood flow in the surgical history of children with univentricular hearts.
Methods

A series of 246 patients, from three joint institutions, having univentricular heart with restricted but not critical pulmonary blood flow received a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt with additional forward pulmonary blood flow. All patients have been studied according to their progression, or not, to Fontan operation. Two hundred and eight (84.5%) patients underwent bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis as primary palliation. Twenty patients (8.1%) with previous pulmonary artery banding were also enrolled in the study. Patients who had received additional pulmonary blood flow through a previous systemic to pulmonary artery shunt for the critical pulmonary blood flow were excluded.
Results

No in-hospital death occurred. Follow-up was complete at 100%. Mean follow-up was 4.2 Â± 2.8 years (range, 6 months to 7 years). During the observational period 73 (29.7%) patients, considered optimal candidates, underwent Fontan completion for increasing cyanosis and (or) hematocrit and (or) fatigue with exertion. Three patients expired after total cavopulmonary connection (3 of 73; 4.1% mortality rate). The remaining 173 (70.3%) patients are alive with initial palliation. All patients were still well palliated with an arterial oxygen saturation at rest about 90%.
Conclusions

According to our experience and results, bidirectional Glenn with antegrade pulmonary blood flow may be an excellent temporary palliation prior to a Fontan operation, which can be performed at the onset of symptoms. Bidirectional Glenn may also be the best possible palliation for a suboptimal candidate for Fontan.

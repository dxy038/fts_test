The objective of the present study was to determine if endothelin-1 played a role in the elevated peripheral resistance in deoxycorticosterone-acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension. Radioimmunoassay showed that the concentration of endothelin-1 was higher in thoracic aorta of the DOCA-salt group than that of the control normotensive (CN) group. Responses of arterioles in the rat cremaster to endothelin-1 were also observed using in vivo closed circuit television microscopy. Microvascular sensitivity to endothelin-1 was decreased in the DOCA-salt group. In the presence of an endothelin type A (ET-A) receptor antagonist, low concentrations of endothelin-1 induced a significant vasoconstriction in the DOCA-salt group. In the presence of endothelin type B (ET-B) receptor antagonist, microvascular responses to endothelin-1 were attenuated in the DOCA-salt group. These results indicated that the increased tissue level of endothelin-1 may decrease the ET-A receptor-mediated vascular response to endothelin-1. However, the ET-B receptor-mediated vasoconstriction is potentiated during DOCA-salt hypertension

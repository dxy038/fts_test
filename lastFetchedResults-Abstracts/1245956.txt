The concept of identity has, in recent years, been increasingly influenced by information technology and communications, with virtual space having a strong role in shaping or altering the users’ identity, specially the youths. Identity has its roots in the common history of people, objects and places.  Historically important events such as wars, festivals, ceremonies, markets, life styles, language (like Persian), a famous mount (like Damavand), a tree (like cypress), a color (like red or blue), and…are the most important building blocks of national and ethnical identity. In virtual space, no geography exists, for this is a place where all of these objects are defined differently which would cause them to be devoid of value-based and meaningful content. So, the virtual identity is distinguished from the objective identity in a serious and deep form.  The present research is the result of a study of the relation between the virtual space and religious and national identity among the students of Yasuj university. In so doing, a sample volume of 340 people were determined using survey method and Cochran formula, and the relation between these two variables was measured. The research findings showed that the students who are more exposed to virtual space, have less strong national and religious identity than their peers who make lesser use of the virtual space. In other words, there is a reverse relation between virtual space and the students’ national and religious identity.

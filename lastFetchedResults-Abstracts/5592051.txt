Main-stream automatic speech recognition systems are based on modelling acoustic sub-word units such as phonemes. Phonemisation dictionaries and language model based decoding techniques are applied to transform the phoneme hypothesis into orthographic transcriptions. Direct modelling of graphemes as sub-word units using HMM has not been successful. We investigate a novel ASR approach using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks and Connectionist Temporal Classification, which is capable of transcribing graphemes directly and yields results highly competitive with phoneme transcription. In design of such a grapheme based speech recognition system phonemisation dictionaries are no longer required. All that is needed is text transcribed on the sentence level, which greatly simplifies the training procedure. The novel approach is evaluated extensively on the Wall Street Journal 1 corpus.

The Power System Analytical Data Task Force has been meeting since the early nineties with the objective of developing a data dictionary containing definitions of power system analytical data. A dictionary template has been adopted and work on an initial dictionary is underway. A description of the template and the proposed draft dictionary is the subject of this paper. This paper also proposes a protocol for exchanging information contained in a database that has a defined dictionary. Using a typical power system example, a dictionary is defined, and the use of the proposed protocol is demonstrated.

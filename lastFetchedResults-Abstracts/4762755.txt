In this abstract, we have presented our research efforts toward the integration of physical synthesis with high level synthesis. By incorporating physical considerations into high level specification, we restrict computations and communications to geographic proximities while reserve the quality of the final result to a large extent within limited resources of FPGAs. We believe that the proposed methodology provides possible directions for synthesis unification of high level abstraction and lower level implementation, and is on the right track towards achieving a well-balanced (or even a globally optimum mapping, this is the long-run objective of PAHLS) synthesis result.

Ikonomou (see Ph.D. Dissertation, UCL, Belgium, June 2002) and Ikonomou and Vandendorpe (see European Transactions on Telecommunications (ETT) Journal, vol.10, no.4, p.407-415, July/August 1999) proposed two fractionally spaced (FS) decision feedback equalising (DFE) receivers performing single user detection (SUD) or joint detection (JD) used in non-cyclic prefixed (NCP) multicarrier-CDMA (MC-CDMA) schemes. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of the above two equalising schemes, against a simpler receiver structure consisting by a single-tap filter bank used in a cyclic prefixed (CP) MC-CDMA scheme. In the context of the latter, two different banks of single-tap filters are presented: one designed to perform classical zero forcing (ZF) detection and one designed for the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. A comparison is finally made in terms of the bit error rate (BER) between NCP MC-CDMA schemes that use equalising receivers and schemes that use the CP extension technique.

Networked manufacturing alliance is a virtual cooperation organization which consists of some core competence enterprises. Alliance member selection is the primary step to implement networked manufacturing. Through selection process analysis, alliance member selection is a multi-objective decision problem. The improved fuzzy genetic algorithm was used to design and analyze the member selection model. Then the combined optimization strategy can be obtained based on the quantitative evaluation factors: time T, quality Q, cost C and qualitative evaluation factors: service S, design ability D. In the process of solution, the conception of "life" was employed to control the population size. The crossover operator and mutation operator were controlled by fuzzy controller and fuzzy logic reasoning. In order to verify the presented model and algorithm, the improved fuzzy genetic algorithm was use to evaluate the real case. The simulation results showed that the algorithm had fast convergence and accorded with the real condition.

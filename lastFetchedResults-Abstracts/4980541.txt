This paper presents a security scheme for a medium access control protocol in a new wireless local area network TUTWLAN (Tampere University of Technology WLAN). The design objective has been to develop a security scheme that will be scalable for various needs and offer high security for demanding applications. The designed security scheme provides both privacy of wireless data communications and the authenticity of communicating parties. Our authentication scheme allows also the communicating entities to establish a shared secret key for secure communication session. Data security schemes have also been introduced. There are three optional data security modes that offer flexible ciphering and data security level

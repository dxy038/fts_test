This paper investigates two control strategies for application in single-phase induction motor drives. The objective is to implement a low-cost solution for low-power applications. The first method to be used is the direct torque and flux control (DTC). A switching table was derived based on the voltage vectors generated by the three-leg two-phase inverter topology. The second method uses SVPWM-DTC technique. The basic operating principle of SVPWM is described. Simulations were carried out and performance analysis is presented.

Implementing advanced control for a large-scale power plant targeting multiple objectives can be computationally intensive as well as difficult when attempted in a centralized control configuration. In order for this control to be more flexible, adaptive and robust, it needs to be coordinated in distributed environments, specifically among agents. The method presented in this paper involves using Multi-Agent System (MAS), which addresses the challenges of computing optimal multi-objective control using Java Agent Development Framework (JADE), a much more communication-efficient, network-oriented environment.

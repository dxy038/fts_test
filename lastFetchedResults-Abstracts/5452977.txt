The focus of this paper is directed towards the problem of characterizing the information flow structures of all classes of LTI structurally constrained controllers with respect to which a given interconnected system has no fixed modes. Any class of structurally constrained controllers can be described by a set of communication links, which delineates how the local controllers of any controller in that class interact with each other. To achieve the objective, a cost is first attributed for establishing any communication link in the control structure. These costs are part of design specifications and represent the expenditure of data transmission between different subsystems. A simple graph-theoretic method is then proposed to characterize all the relevant classes of controllers systematically. As a by-product of this approach, all classes of LTI stabilizing structurally constrained controllers with the minimum implementation cost are attained using a novel algorithm. The primary advantages of this approach are its simplicity and computational efficiency. The efficacy and importance of this work are thoroughly illustrated in a numerical example. This paper integrates the ideas proposed in a recently published work and some original techniques to develop its main results.

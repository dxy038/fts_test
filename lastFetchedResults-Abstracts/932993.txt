The objective of this study was to examine the effects of added xanthan gum on the formation and properties of emulsions (4 wt% corn oil) formed with a highly hydrolysed commercial whey protein (WPH) product under a range of conditions. Stable oil-in-water emulsions could be formed using 4 wt% WPH and hydroxylated lecithin as emulsifiers. Addition of xanthan to these emulsions above a certain critical concentration caused flocculation of the oil droplets, by depletion mechanisms, which resulted in a marked increase in the creaming rate. Interestingly, this depletion flocculation also promoted the coalescence of droplets during storage of the emulsions for up to 1 week at room temperature. The rate of coalescence was enhanced considerably with increasing concentration of xanthan in the emulsion up to 0.12%. At higher levels of xanthan addition, the rate of coalescence decreased gradually, apparently because of the high viscosity of the aqueous phase.

Our objective is to demonstrate advantages of using spring-loaded contacting solutions for high-volume testing of RF PCBs and modules. The test point can be either a pad on the surface of the board or a coaxial interface. The frequency range can be up to and even more than 12 GHz, provided that the test setup is properly calibrated, that the pad-shape or the interface is fully specified up to this frequency and that sophisticated probe fixturing methods are used.

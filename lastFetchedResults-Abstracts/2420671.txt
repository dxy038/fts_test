The design of a thermoelectric generator sandwiched in the wall of a crossflow heat exchanger was optimized. A numerical model has been developed and validated. The objective function was the total power output. The design variables were the number of modules and the current in each control volume of the mesh. We also optimize directly the electrical topology of the system. A genetic algorithm was used to perform the optimizations. Complex optimal electrical topologies were achieved due to the non-uniform temperatures distributions in the heat exchanger.

We have prepared porous silicon by etching
p-type crystalline silicon in different conditions such
as: varying electrolyte concentration, current density,
and etching time. The primary objective of this
research is to develop a scientifically based technique
for the measurement of photosensitivity. One such
technique involves measuring the photoconductivity
of the porous silicon under halogen lamp irradiation.
Our photoconductivity measurements agree with photoluminescence
measurements in previous work, and
demonstrate the direct transition of porous silicon.
Varied etching conditions change the peak of photoconductivity
from 600 to 520 nm (from 2.13 eV to
2.4 eV) as the porosity of the layer gradually
increases, and the photoconductivity band also becomes
slightly more intense. The photoconductivity
peak shift toward shorter wavelength was interpreted
to be the result of band gap widening. We observe two
distinct regimes in the time decay of photoconductivity,
fast decay and steady state, that arise from the
recombination process and electronâ€“hole asymmetry
near the Fermi surface. Experimental measurements
of photoconductivity give useful information about the
band gap, band structure, and variation of transport
properties due to the micro-structural porosity created
during the etching process.

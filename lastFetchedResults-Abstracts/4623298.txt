This paper discusses an integration of an intelligent controlled system and teleoperation-controlled system by using mobile robot. We develop the teleoperation-controlled mobile robot system. The robot system consists of a mobile robot, tablet device and control computer. The tablet device has various sensors such as gyro sensor, acceleration sensor and touch display to estimate human intention. We propose the multi-objective behavior coordination to integrate the autonomous control and remote control.

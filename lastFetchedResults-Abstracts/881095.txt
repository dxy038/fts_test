Introduction: Using stem cells for in vitro tissue regeneration is one of the most interesting fields of research. Liver regeneration is not an exceptional area. The main objective of this study was the production of hepatocyte- like cells from the umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). 
Methods: Cells were isolated from UCB, upon a written informed consent obtained from donor mothers. The stem cells immunophenotype was analyzed using flow cytometry and multi-lineage differentiation potential was evaluated by means of in vitro differentiation assays. Finally, the expression of hepatocyte-specific markers was verified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Results: The isolated UCB-MSCs had mesodermal differentiation capacity. If UCB-MSCs are cultured in appropriate conditions, they are able to induce hepatic-associated genes, such as albumin (Alb),?-fetoprotein (AFP), cytokeratins 18, 19 (CK18, CK19) and ?-1 antitrypsin (AA). Moreover, UCB- MSCs produced albumin and ?-fetoprotein upon in vitro induction of hepatocyte differentiation.
Conclusion: Mesenchymal stem cells from human umbilical cord blood are capable of tissue-specific commitment along hepatogenic lineage, proposing these cells as suitable tool for cell-based applications aimed at liver regeneration.

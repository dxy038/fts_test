In transcendent theosophy, soul are in the lowest stages of his existential perfection when it is created. Then its completion course begins in the stages of perfection from the material to intellectual world. A conceptual and existential analysis is needed to truly understand this completion. Conceptual analysis indicates the process of soul perfection which has three main elements: (1) substantial motion, (2) gradation, and (3) the necessity of completion in relation to consciousness and purpose. Existential analysis of soul indicates the pivotal position of latent reality in the soul completion. Soul completion is the objective appearance of the latent reality and the intellectual existence of the soul in the creation and the objective appearance of the divine names. So the voluntary actions of soul in the course of its completion are the cause of the appearance of perfections hidden in the latent reality of each soul.

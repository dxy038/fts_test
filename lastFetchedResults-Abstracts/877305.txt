This paper considers the bilinear minimax control problem of an important class of parabolic systems
with Robin boundary conditions. Such systems are linear on state variables when the control and disturbance
are fixed, and linear on the control or disturbance when the state variables are fixed. The objective is to
maintain target state variables by taking account the influence of noises in data, while a desired power level
and adjustment costs are taken into consideration. Firstly we introduce some classes of bilinear systems
and obtain the existence and the uniqueness of the solution, as well as stability under mild assumptions.
Afterwards the minimax control problem is formulated. We show the existence of an optimal solution,
and we also find necessary optimality conditions. Finally, to illustrate the abstract results, we present two
examples of neutron fission systems.

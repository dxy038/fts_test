BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The genus Prangos is among plants with numerous species. The positive medicinal effects of this herb have been demonstrated in multiple studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of methanolic extracts from Prangos uloptera and crossoptera on the growth and proliferation of human lymphocytes and determine their mutagenic potentials.
METHODS: In this experimental study, the plants were dried and milled after determining their species. The methanolic extracts of Prangos uloptera and crossoptera were prepared by immersion and were diluted to final concentrations of 10, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 mg/ml, using sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The effects of the extracts on the growth and proliferation of human-extracted lymphocytes were evaluated by lymphodex. The samples cultured in RPMI medium were evaluated by MTT assay, and the mutagenic potential was measured by Ames test.
FINDINGS: The results showed that the extracts from both Prangos species increased the growth and proliferation of lymphocytes (by 5-300 %) and exhibited no mutagenic potentials. The seed and leaf extracts from both species had the least and most significant impacts on the growth and proliferation of lymphocytes (5-7% and 2.1-3.1 % times, respectively), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The obtained results showed that the two evaluated species of Prangos are safe and lack any mutagenic potentials. They also enhanced the growth and proliferation of human lymphocytes.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) have long been introduced in the control area in the latest decade. However, realization of a controller based on the multi-layer feedforward neural network is pretty difficult due to the lack of the hardware supporting for practical application. In this paper, a novel control approach based on the single neuron algorithm is employed to realize an adaptive controller for the SMES unit connected to a power system. Motivation of designing such controller is to improve both the stability and the voltage regulation quality in a relatively wide operation range. The design procedure takes the advantage of multi-objective features and the simple computing configuration so as to be apt to the practical use. Simulation is carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed controller in a high order nonlinear power system model under the MATLAB environment. The results show the ideal effects and the good robustness of the controller.

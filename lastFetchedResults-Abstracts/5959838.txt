This article argues the objective of knowledge management and indicates its core as reinforcing knowledge flow and application. Based on the documented Knowledge management system weaknesses and feature of Web2.0, we have developed the infrastructure of Knowledge flow based KMS in Web2.0 environment and an innovative approach to design, realize and strengthen it. The new system infrastructure offers a paradigm shift by putting emphasis on integration of Web2.0 and KMS by knowledge flow. Open source tools are used as development tools and four key modules known as system integration module, knowledge processing module, flow integration module and knowledge service module are illustrated. Ultimately, the knowledge flow based KMS in Web2.0 environment, in spite of its challenges and limits, proposes a new agenda for promoting tacit knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer among members of different levels within an organization.

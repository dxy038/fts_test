In this paper, the DMA transfer tactics is used to optimize a packed/planar video format conversion program. The program method to employ the DMA transfer in the video processing algorithms will be present in this paper. The objective is to develop the efficiency of the DSP on loading the large image data, which are stored in the external memory. The synchronous problem of the DMA transfer data flow and the processing data flow need to be tackled. The software is executed on multimedia DSP TMS320DM6437 which is based on the TIÂ´s new Davinci multimedia technology. All the optimization has been fitted to the resource included in the DSP chip. The optimized packed/planar video format conversion program is tested on the DM6437EVM board with a 594 MHz system clock. The performance of the method is also compared with ordinary algorithm without DMA transfer. Experimental results show that the optimized method is stable, and the performance is better.

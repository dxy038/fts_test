A discrete optimization model is proposed to allocate redundancy to critical IT functions for disaster recovery planning. The objective is to maximize the overall survivability of an organizationÂ´s IT functions by selecting their appropriate redundancy levels. A solution procedure based on probabilistic dynamic programming is presented along with two examples.

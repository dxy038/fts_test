An improved mode of operation for low magnification off-axis electron holography is presented which permits a significant increase of the field of view over that obtained by the standard low magnification technique in a standard field emission transmission electron microscope. This improvement is achieved by a weak excitation of the objective lens. Ray diagrams for the different low magnification modes are discussed and verified on a Hitachi HF-2000 transmission electron microscope operated in free lens control mode.

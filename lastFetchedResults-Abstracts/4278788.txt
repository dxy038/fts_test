We study the information theoretic capacity of pulse position modulation (PPM) ultra-wideband (UWB) communications for single user channels. The capacity is studied with a link impulse response with delay spread and inter pulse interference (IPI). The objective is to consider the effect of IPI on capacity and quantify the capacity with IPI. An expression for the signal-to-noise ratio is developed for UWB as a function of the decay rate of the link impulse response. The information theoretic capacity of the UWB system is studied as a function of the number of quantized PPM resolution intervals.

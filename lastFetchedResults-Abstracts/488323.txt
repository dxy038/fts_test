Background and Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical and reproductive outcomes after Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling (LOD) performance in infertile women with Clomiphene resistant Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Regular menstrual cycles, ovulation and pregnancy rates have been considered as three main outcomes being evaluated in this study.
Materials and Methods: 72 Clomiphene-resistant anovulatory women with PCOS in Karaj Hospital were taken into account in this study from 2002-2005. Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling (LOD) using a needle cautery was performed. Each ovary was punctured at 6 points. Patients were followed for 24 months for evaluating the outcome.
Result: After laparoscopy, regular menstruation occurred spontaneously in 82.6% and maintained regular at least for 6 months. The incidence of conception at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery was % 14.7, %36.8, %58.5, %67.6 respectively.
Conclusion: Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is an effective treatment in Clomiphene-resistant anovulatory women with PCOS.

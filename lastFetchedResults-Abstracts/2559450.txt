The increasing use of Internet technology in corporate world is undeniable. Corporate
Internet Reporting (CIR) is the communication process between the corporate sectors and
stakeholders via the medium of the Internet. CIR is a significant way for the corporate
sectors in presenting and disseminating business information. The study is conducted with
the objective to examine the practice of CIR by the Malaysian listed corporations. Sample
of the study consisted of 380 listed corporations. In measuring the level of CIR practice by
companies, a CIR index was used. Data for CIR practice were collected by observing the
presence of CIR attributes in the websites of companies being investigated and analysed by
using descriptive statistics. The findings show that 82 percent of the companies examined
have websites and are practicing CIR. On average, Malaysian listed companies practiced
around 28.9% of the overall CIR attributes. The results based on industry type showed
that the plantation sector had the highest mean score for overall CIR, Investor Relations
category and User Support category, whereas the finance sector had the highest mean
score for the categories of Accounting and Finance and Technological Advantage, and the
construction sector revealed the highest mean score for forward looking data. Furthermore, a comparison between the Main Market and ACE market companies did not show any
significant difference in the mean score for the overall CIR attributes and specific CIR
attributes. Findings of the study might be useful to the Malaysian listed corporations in
better understanding the level of CIR they
practised so as to further increase the level
of CIR in the near future. Finally, the study
adds to the knowledge on the practice of
CIR in Malaysia as one of the worldâ€™s
emerging economic countries.

Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to measure the shear bond strength of composite resin to human dentin surface bonded with three different bonding systems.
Subjects and Methods: The crown surface of 66 extracted human third molar teeth were abraded with trimer in a wet environment until the dentin surface was exposed, and they were polished with silicon carbide paper 400 and 600 grit. Then, all the smooth smear layer samples were randomly classified into three equal groups. We used bonding according to the instruction of the manufacturer (the first group Single Bond, the second group BC Plus and third group Charm Bond). 
Then, the composite resin was bonded to the tooth surface by plastic tube (diameter: 1.8 mm, height: 5mm) .Finally, shear bond strength was determined by universal testing machine (LMT 100). 
Results: The variance analysis (ANOVA) P value= 0/000 revealed the mean of shear bond strength is different between three groups. The mean shear bond for first, second and third groups are 15.25 MP, 6.84 MP, 8.59 MP, respectively. The multiple comparison with THKEY test showed that there is different significance between group one and the other two groups which did not differ significantly.
Conclusion: All in all, we found out that greatest shear bond strength to dentin is the American Single Bond, which is better than Korean product (BC Plus and charm Bond).

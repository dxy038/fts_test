The new generation of 3D digitalisation provides us with additional possibilities for obtaining more complete information regarding physical environments faster (a shop or part of a factory, a mechanical system, etcâ€¦). Based on a general overview of a given environment, it is possible to extract some repository data from this basic information to structure the numerical model. Next some complementary scans can be taken, depending on the level of detail and the final valorisation objective for the numerical model. This approach can be applied to the redesigning or the reconstitution of an old mechanism and its simulation in virtual reality.

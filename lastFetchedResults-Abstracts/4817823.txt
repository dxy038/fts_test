Summary form only given. This panel summary addresses generation expansion and network upgrades in distribution systems. Specifically, as load levels increase and increased reliability is required for select customers, the installation of distributed generation may be used to address these challenges. The careful placement of distributed generators (DG) may allow for system capacity release within the distribution network and the deferral of equipment upgrades and new construction. In addition, distributed generators will directly affect load changes experienced by transmission systems and their subsequent expansion planning requirements. Another consideration in distribution systems is that, currently, the reliability of the distribution system is highly dependent on the transmission system. It is envisioned that allowing DGs to operate during distribution system outages, caused by both distribution and transmission system faults, would lessen this dependency. In order to achieve this, network enhancements, e.g. switch placements, must be made. Specifically, we present a cost-based problem formulation which may be readily used by intelligent system methods to quantify the effects of DG placements on distribution systems under load increases and distribution faults. We formulate the distributed generator placement problem as a non-differentiable optimization problem subject to electrical, operational and network constraints. In the objective function, we consider the following factors: wheeling costs, DG operating costs, DG installation costs, network upgrade costs and outage costs. Here, we consider the possibility of allowing a DG to support an isolated area during system outages and the network switch upgrades required to enable loads to be supported.

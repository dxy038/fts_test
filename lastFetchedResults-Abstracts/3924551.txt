Multichannel blind deconvolution has been receiving increasing attention. Shalvi and Weinstein proposed an attractive approach to single-channel blind deconvolution called the super-exponential methods. The objective of this correspondence is to extend the Shalvi and Weinstein (1993, 1994) approach to the multichannel case and present super-exponential algorithms for multichannel blind deconvolution. We propose three approaches to multichannel blind deconvolution. In the first one, we present a multichannel super-exponential algorithm. In the second one, we present a super-exponential deflation algorithm. In the third one, we present a two-stage super-exponential algorithm

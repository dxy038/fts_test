Radial artery pulse wave is a very important biological signal in the Traditional Chinese Medical (TCM) theory. It also plays an important role in the field of health informatics. In this paper, we proposed a new shiatsu three-part pulse collection method based on TCM to collect three-part pulses objectively. We established a feasible method for three-part pulse collection, and provided an objective process for radial artery pulse collection. The result of this research can be applied to disease diagnosis and health informatics.

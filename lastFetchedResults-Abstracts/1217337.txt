The main objective of this research is to rank the critical success factors of knowledge management using fuzzy quality function deployment (QFD) approach in MECO Company. The research has utilized a three-step qualitative-quantitative-qualitative strategy. At the first step (1st qualitative phase), the critical success factors of knowledge management and knowledge management outcomes were characterized in MECO. Then, the critical success factors of knowledge management which were identified by the first step were ranked using fuzzy quality function deployment in the second step (quantitative phase). Afterwards, some solutions were provided to realize and improve the critical success factors of knowledge management in the selected company within the third step of research (2nd qualitative phase). 
11 critical success factors of knowledge management were introduced in addition to 4 knowledge management outcomes by the first qualitative phase. The result from the quantitative phase were indicative of the fact that “human resource management”, “support and leadership of management”, “organizational infrastructure”, “organizational culture” and “activities and processes” are known as five critical success factors of knowledge management in the chosen company. Furthermore, 23 solutions provided by this research in order to realize and improve the critical success factors of knowledge management in this company are achieved as a result of implementing the second qualitative phase.
Based on the information accessible for the researchers, this is one of the first works which evaluates the key factors of successful knowledge management through fuzzy quality function deployment approach. It is expected that the proposed method would represent appropriate tools for enterprises which have decided to implement knowledge management because it prioritizes the critical success factors based on the knowledge management outcomes.

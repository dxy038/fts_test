The objective of this paper is to present the estimated performance for TCH codes, in channels where errors can occur independently and in burst. Since this family of block codes is nonlinear, its performance must be determined by simulation. The chosen technique is the interval simulation technique (IST) that is used with a two-state Markov model for the bursty channel. This technique is presented and its results are validated. The article finishes with the presentation of some results for the performance of TCH codes, both for independent and bursty channels, and the corresponding trade-offs for the simulation time

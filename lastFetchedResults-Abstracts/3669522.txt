A bidirectional dc-dc converter typically consists of a buck and a boost converters. In order to have high-power density, the converter can be designed to operate in discontinuous conducting mode (DCM) such that the passive inductor can be minimized. The DCM operation associated current ripple can be alleviated by interleaving multiphase currents. However, DCM operation tends to increase turnoff loss because of a high peak current and its associated parasitic ringing due to the oscillation between the inductor and the device output capacitance. Thus, the efficiency is suffered with the conventional DCM operation. Although to reduce the turnoff loss a lossless capacitor snubber can be added across the switch, the energy stored in the capacitor needs to be discharged before device is turned on. This paper adopts a gate signal complimentary control scheme to turn on the nonactive switch and to divert the current into the antiparalleled diode of the active switch so that the main switch can be turned on under zero-voltage condition. This diverted current also eliminates the parasitic ringing in inductor current. For capacitor value selection, there is a tradeoff between turnon and turnoff losses. This paper suggests the optimization of capacitance selection through a series of hardware experiments to ensure the overall power loss minimization under complimentary DCM operating condition. According to the suggested design optimization, a 100-kW hardware prototype is constructed and tested. The experimental results are provided to verify the proposed design approach.

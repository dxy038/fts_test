Construction eco-campus is required for building economy society activity in which university should lead the way to play the role beacon of society. Construction eco-campus is a system project which need informatics support for enhance the efficiency in designing plan, monitoring implement, evaluating construction effect, and putting forward improving suggestion. In this paper, SD-MOP-MAE integrated planning approach for eco-campus construction was presented as well as an intelligent information system (IIS) was set up which included all functions mentioned above and applied in Tianjin polytechnic University. In the approach, system dynamics model (SD) was used to analysis the campus matter circulation to differentiate the important parameter and variable (IPV), multi objective program (MOP) was used to get optimal value of IPV to assistant plan design. Then a multi aspect evaluation (MAE) model was applied to manage campus construction information and give evaluation result. Furthermore, the SD-MOP-MAE is not only used in eco-campus construction but also in eco-community building through propriety modification.

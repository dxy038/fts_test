A multiplexed bioanalytical assay is produced by incorporating two types of gold nanorods (GNRs). Besides retaining the desirable features of common GNRs LSPR sensors, this sensor is easy to fabricate and requires only a visible–NIR spectrometer for detection. This assay can simultaneously detect different acceptor–ligand pairs by choosing the proper GNRs possessing various LPWs in a wide detection wavelength range and can be developed into a high-throughput detection method. This bioanalytical assay allows easy detection of human serum specimens infected by S. japonicum and tuberculosis (TB) from human serum specimens (human serum/Tris–HCl buffer ratio = 1:104) without the need for sample pretreatment. The technique is very sensitive compared to other standard methods such as indirect hemagglutination assays (IHA) that require a serum concentration ratio of larger than 1:20 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) requiring a ratio larger than 1:100. This methodology can be readily extended to other immunoassays to realize wider diagnostic applications.

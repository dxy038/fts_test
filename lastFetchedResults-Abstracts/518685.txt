Background & Objectives: One of the first steps in diagnosis of pleural effusion is distinction between exudative and transudative types. The aim of this study was to assess C - reactive protein (CRP) level as one of the diagnostic marker for differentiation of exudative from transudative pleural effusions.

Methods: In this descriptive and sectional study, 80 patients with confirmed pleural effusion were assessed. These patients were divided into two groups based on Light's criteria. Serum and pleural CRP were measured with Latex Agglutination Test.

Results: Out of 80 patients with pleural effusion 26 were transudative (32.5%) and 54 were exudative (67.5%). In exudative group, 72.2% of cases were CRP positive (1+ to 3+), and in transudative group, only 38.5% of cases were CRP positive (p < 0.05). There was no significant differences between different exudative pleural effusion etiologies (infectious and non infectious, malignant and non malignant and tuberculosis) and the number of CRP positive cases (p > 0.05). The rate of CRP positivity in exudative pleural effusion group was more than transudative group (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: According to our study it seems that CRP criterion could help in distinction between exudative and transudative types of pleural effusion.

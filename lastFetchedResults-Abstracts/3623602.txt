Switch-level modeling is a recently developed design and analysis methodology for MOS VLSI circuits. At the switch level, important features of MOS circuits can be directly modeled using a moderate number of discrete parameters, including switch states, resistance, capacitance, and bidirectional signals. Switch-level models, provide more accurate behavioral and structural information than gate-level logical models, while avoiding the high computational cost associated with analog electrical models.

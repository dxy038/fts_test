A partitioning approach for object-oriented software development in parallel processing systems is presented. The objective of the partitioning approach is to improve the overall performance of a software system by minimizing communication cost among objects. The software system is modeled by a graph, and a bottom-up clustering technique is presented to partition the objects into a set of clusters to achieve this objective

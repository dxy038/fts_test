In the background of the current supply and demand of land and water resources has become increasingly acute contradictions, this paper conducted a study of coupling effects of land and water resources, making the region of the use for system land and water resources to optimize the rational allocation. The paper established the coupling effect model, and discussed the process of the genetic algorithm to solve multi-objective in detail, calculated the model which established on the papers, maximize mining the inherent potential of the resources systems, achieved the development goals of the sustainable utilization of resources. Finally, take XiÂ´an Chanba ecological zone for example to make empirical solving, obtained the optimal results of the water and land resources coupling, provided the basis for land and water resource allocation research of system coupling.

The aim of this study was to assess surface functionalization of industrial ceramic tiles through the addition of soluble salts to improve mechanical properties (scratch and wear resistance) and conductivity, while preserving the aesthetic aspects of the finished product. This objective was pursued through the application of different solutions of titanium and silver with a potential for transformation into titania and silver nanoparticles during the sintering of the material. The solutions, in different concentrations, were applied (300 g/m2) to unglazed green tiles by air brushing. The resulting products were polished and characterized in terms of microstructural, surface micromechanical, and technological properties based on the UNI EN ISO reference standards. The electrical conductivity deriving from the presence of titania and silver was also established with specific tests. The results were found to correlate with the results obtained from the addition of zirconium solutions as reported in part I of the paper.

Background
The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a validated suturing curriculum as a free-standing continuing medical education (CME) course.
Methods

Eighteen participants (9 practicing surgeons, 9 surgery residents) attended a 4-hour laparoscopic suturing CME course. After viewing an instructional videotape all participants had their baseline performance measured on a fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery–type videotrainer suture model. Participants then practiced on the model with active instruction from 6 proctors until a previously reported proficiency level was achieved or until the course ended. Performance was scored objectively based on time and errors. Precourse and postcourse questionnaires were collected.
Results

Participants trained for 2.6 ± .8 hours and performed 37 ± 11 repetitions. Although no participant was proficient at baseline, 72% achieved the proficiency level by the end of the course. Participants showed 44% improvement in objective scores and 34% improvement according to subjective self-rating.
Conclusions

Although 4 hours may be insufficient for some trainees, an intensive half-day CME course is feasible and effective in significantly improving performance and allowing the majority of participants to achieve proficiency

The objective of this work is to study the interaction of alprazolam with hman
serum albumin (HSA) in physiologyical buffer (pH 7.4) making use of UV
spectroscopy. Absorbance spectra of drug , protein and drug-protein show
complex conformation between alprazolam and HSA. The Hill equation was
employed to analyze data and determine binding constant (K),binding capacity (g)
and Hill constant (nH). The results reveal that the Hill constant is less than 1
(nH<1) which indicates that the system is negative cooperative in binding process
and this result coincide with scatchard plot

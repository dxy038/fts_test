Summary form only given. Institutional planning, in its broader conceptualization, is the strongest tool to guarantee an enhanced influence by objective factors on management. Planning, nevertheless, is the application of knowledge, based on systematized information. To organize information for decision making implies, therefore, the structuring of information on management information systems (MIS). This paper focuses the development, validation and implementation of such a MIS at Embrapa (Brazilian Corporation for Agricultural Research). The MIS described here (named SIGER) is linked to the conceptual framework for planning, monitoring and evaluation adopted by the EmbrapaÂ´s R&amp;D Planning System (SEP). SIGER implementation as well as its problems sources, identification and solution are discussed. Critical factors affecting implementation success are indicated. Lessons learned throughout the whole process of design, automatization, validation and implementation are described

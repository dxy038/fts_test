Deregulation is a new paradigm in the electric power industry. In deregulated environment, the transmission Congestion Management (CM) is one of the critical and important tasks of the System Operator (SO). This paper examines the congestion relief procedure and compares the results of two different objectives i.e. rescheduling cost minimization and real power loss minimization. The above two objectives are combined as a single objective using weighted sum method and the results are tabulated. The number of generators participating in congestion management has been selected based on Cluster/Zone based approach utilizing Transmission Congestion Distribution Factors (TCDFs). It is formulated as an optimization problem and Generalized Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) tool is used for solving the above problems. The proposed idea is carried out on IEEE 30 bus system and the results are compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique.

Objective: Although there are some reports of reduction of obsessivecompulsive symptoms in manic episodes or its exacerbation during depressive episodes, this relationship has not been proved. Method: Clinical observations of six cases with co-morbidity of bipolar-I-disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder or symptoms. Results: The cases presented here show heterogeneity and variety of the relationships between the obsessions and bipolar-I-disorder. Limitations: Low sample size and non-random sampling. Conclusions: This variety of clinical presentations may indicate the presence of different clinical groups that their validity should be assessed through more systematized studies.

In many areas, the use of electronic devices simultaneously results in overloads, voltage fluctuations, and decreases in voltage quality. To protect the sensitive electronic equipments from these voltage fluctuations and enable to gain maximum efficiency from these devices, different types of electronic and electromechanical voltage regulators are used in industry. This paper presents a new type single-phase voltage regulator which has an isolated transformer connected in series to the line and a special switching strategy. The proposed voltage regulator has the capability of delivering sinusoidal input and output current, good voltage regulation, and bidirectional power flow. For these purposes, two full bridge converters are used in the topology. The switching principle and the operation modes of the proposed system are described in this study. The experimental results of a 5kVA voltage regulator are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed system.

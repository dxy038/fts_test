A high power THz radiation source is needed to analyze the structures of complex proteins by DNP-NMR spectroscopy. For this objective, we have been developing gyrotrons having boardband frequency tunability using a long cavity. Prototype gyrotron was achieved with a tuning range of 1.6 GHz and exceeded output power of 10 W.

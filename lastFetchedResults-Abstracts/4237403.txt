We propose an effective virtual view synthesis approach, which utilizes the technology of depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). In our scheme, two reference color images and their associated depth maps are used to generate the arbitrary virtual viewpoint. Firstly, the main and auxiliary viewpoint images are warped to the virtual viewpoint. After that, the cracks and error points are removed to enhance the image quality. Then, we complement the disocclusions of the virtual viewpoint image warped from the main viewpoint with the help of the auxiliary viewpoint. In order to reduce the color incontinuity of the virtual view, the brightness of the two reference viewpoint images are adjusted. Finally, the holes are filled by the depth-assistance asymmetric dilation inpainting method. Simulations show that the view synthesis approach is effective and reliable in both of subjective and objective evaluations.

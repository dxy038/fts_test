In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio (CR) multicast network sharing spectrum with a primary network. To protect the primary transmission, interference power constraint is applied to restrict the transmit power of the cognitive base station (CBS). The objective is to minimize the weighted aggregate outage probability for given target rates for the CR multicast network. Specifically, two types of outage probability are concerned, that is, group outage probability and individual outage probability. For each type of outage probability, the optimal power/rate control scheme is derived. The simulation results are illustrated to validate the proposed power/rate control schemes.

Effects of Handedness and Gender on Auditory Attention in Bergen Dichotic Listening
Objective: The effects of handedness and gender were studied in this research by using Bergen Dichotic listening test, which measures both divided and selective attentions.
Methods: The Persian version of Bergen dichotic listening test was used to evaluate non-forced attention, attention to right and attention to left ears on 75 young adults, including 54 right-handed and 21 left-handed individuals, with normal hearing in ages ranging from 18 to 30 years old. 
Results: Right ear advantage (REA) with the mean score of 78.4% and 94.7% in the two conditions of non-forced attention and attention to the right ear, and left ear advantage (LEA) with the mean score of 81.3% in attention to the left ear were obtained. Sex had no effect on the results, but significant difference was found between right and left hand people in non-forced attention and attention to the right (p < 0.029). 
Conclusion: Top-down processing of brain cortex in selective attention modulated bottom-up processing in divided attention task by changing right ear advantage. Our results demonstrated the application of Bergen dichotic listening test to evaluate auditory attention, language laterality and handedness.

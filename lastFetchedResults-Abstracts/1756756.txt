Objective
sive symptoms following myocardial infarction (MI) are often assessed using self-report questionnaires, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). No studies have examined whether depressive symptom scores assessed by self-report questionnaires during hospitalization post-MI are influenced by factors related to the acute event or hospitalization compared to subsequent outpatient assessments of the same patients. The objective of this study was to compare BDI total scores, somatic scores, and cognitive/affective scores among post-MI patients in-hospital versus at post-discharge follow-up.
s
ary analysis of data from two existing cohorts of post-MI patients (Groningen, The Netherlands and Toronto, Canada). In-hospital BDI scores and follow-up scores were compared using paired samples t-tests.
s
were 1556 patients from the Groningen sample with BDI data in-hospital and at 3-months post-MI and 229 patients from Toronto with data in-hospital and at 6-months post-MI. BDI total, somatic, and cognitive/affective scores did not differ significantly between in-hospital and follow-up assessments in either sample. Similarly, there were no substantive differences in symptom composition in either sample. Somatic symptoms accounted for 66.3% of total BDI scores in-hospital versus 64.9% at 3-months post-MI for Groningen patients and for 62.1% of total scores in-hospital versus 64.3% at 6-months post-MI for Toronto patients.
sion
l BDI total scores, somatic scores, and cognitive/affective scores did not differ between in-hospital and subsequent outpatient assessments. The timing of when depressive symptoms are assessed post-MI does not appear to influence the overall level of BDI scores or the composition of symptoms that are reported.

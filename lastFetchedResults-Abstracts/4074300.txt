When an adaptive filter is used for echo cancellation, it is essential to prevent the filter from diverging in situations when the echo signal is contaminated with near-end disturbance, i.e., during double-talk. This paper presents an extension of a previously proposed double-talk detector for improved performance. It is shown that the computational complexity of the proposed detector is lower than that of the well-used normalized cross correlation (NCC) double-talk detector, at the cost of performance. Further, it is shown that there can be a significant performance difference, in terms of detecting double-talk, between having a fixed echo cancellation filter, which is a common strategy in objective evaluation techniques, and an adaptive filter, which is more close to realistic conditions.

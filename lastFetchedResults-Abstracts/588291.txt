Machining operation is one of the most applicable processes for the manufacturing of industrial parts. Usually, the quality of finished part in turning operation is measured in terms of surface roughness. In turn, surface quality is determined by machining parameters and tool geometry specifications. The main objective of this study is to model and optimize machining parameters and tool geometry in order to improve the surface roughness in turning operation of AISI1045 steel. Simultaneous optimization of machining parameters and tool geometry was performed using experimental data and statistical methods. A Taguchi approach is employed in order to gather experimental data and then, based on signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, the best sets of cutting parameters and tool geometry specifications have been determined. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

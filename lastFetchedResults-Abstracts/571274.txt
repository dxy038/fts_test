Introduction & Objective: Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for about 1% of all cancers. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) is a cytoplasmic enzyme. Oncogene, and growth factor induce over expression of COX2. COX2 is apoptotic inhibitor. Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene represents the most common genetic alternation in human tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of COX2 and p53 in subtypes of Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Materials & Methods: In this cross- sectional study,62 Hodgkin's lymphomas were studied in admitted samples of pathology departments of Hamadan hospitals before 2005.Age,sex and type of HL were recorded in each case. p53 and COX2 expression was investigated immunohistochemically and expression intensity. The comparison of p53 and COX2 between subtypes of HL was evaluated with SPSS v13 soft ware and chi-square test.
Results: The mean age of the patients of HL was 41Â±16 and 79% if HL  immunoreactive for p53. In this study the mean age of the patients of HL who died was more than the mean age of the patients of HL who survived which is statistically considered significant (P < 0.003). 24% of the patients of HL were immunoreactive for COX2.
Conclusion: Regarding to p53 and COX2 in subtypes of HL and insignificant difference in p53 and COX2 expression between subtypes of HL. We concluded that p53 and COX2 have not an important role in the prognosis of HL, but it is recommended to do more universal studies in the immunohistochemical level of P53 and COX2 to attain perfect results.

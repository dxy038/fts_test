Ship encounters with abnormal waves are increasingly well documented and it is therefore important to be able to model such encounters in order to assess the risks involved and whether there is a requirement for more stringent design rules.

aper presents the results of an experimental investigation into the influence of abnormal waves on a vessel travelling with forward speed in irregular seas. The vessel studied in this case is a naval frigate travelling at a range of speeds. To put the motions measured in abnormal waves into context comparisons are made to those in random seas with a variety of significant wave heights, both non-severe and severe. A further objective is to compare experimental measurements with motion predictions from both a two-dimensional linear strip theory and a three-dimensional partly nonlinear seakeeping model.

s demonstrate that abnormal waves may not necessarily be the worst conditions that a ship can encounter. However, accelerations derived from the rigid body motions appear to be in excess of rules values. This has implications for design due to the unexpected nature of abnormal wave occurrence and the consequent likelihood of encountering such a wave at a higher speed (hence in a more severe operating condition) than a random sea of an equivalent height.

ree-dimensional partly nonlinear model demonstrates improved agreement with experimental measurements of rigid body motions, compared to the two-dimensional strip theory. It is therefore considered to have greater potential as a design tool for abnormal wave encounters. Further validation with a wide range of sea states and vessel types is required.

Due to an anticipated increase in air traffic during the next decade, air traffic control in busy
airports is one of the main challenges confronting the controllers in the near future. Since the runway
is often a bottleneck in an airport system, there is a great interest in optimizing the use of the
runway. The most important factors in aircraft landing modeling are time and cost. For this reason,
Aircraft Landing Scheduling Problem (ASLP) is a typical hard multi-constraint optimization
problem and finding its efficient solution would be very difficult. So in real applications finding
the best solution is not the most important issue and providing a feasible landing schedule in an
acceptable time would be the preferred requirement. In this study a three objectives formulation of
the problem proposed as a mathematical programming model on a runway in static mode. Problem
is solved by multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective Particle Swarm
Optimization Algorithm (MOPSO). Considering a group of 20 aircrafts, this problem is solved and
landing sequence determined and we are shown the obtained sequence does not follow First Come
First Serve law for sequencing as well. Finally by comparing results, conclusion and suggestions
are proposed.

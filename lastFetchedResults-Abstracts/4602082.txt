The task of a capacity allocation policy is to determine the optimal quantity of capacity that has to be shared among the transmitting entities. In this work the allocation problem is modelled by the Multi Objective Programming (MOP) theory. In particular, an allocation criterion based on the L<sub>p</sub>-problem is proposed to find out a capacity allocation, among Earth Stations, representative of a compromise if Packet Loss Probability and Transmitted Power are taken into account as performance metrics. The paper also discusses the existence of a capacity allocation, called Capacity Bound, on which the performance converges independently of the overall capacity available C<sub>TOT</sub>. A performance analysis, carried out through simulations and under different satellite channel conditions, is finally proposed to investigate the allocation criterion performance and to show the Capacity Bound existence.

The objective of this study was to identify echocardiographic and clinical predictors of survival after mitral valve surgery when mitral repair is an option. In 132 patients undergoing mitral valve repair or replacement for the diagnosis of mitral regurgitation, preoperative echocardiograms were analyzed quantitatively and reviewed by two independent observers for structural abnormalities of the mitral valve. In Cox regression analysis, clinical factors such as age (mortality rate ratio [MMR] 1.7/decade, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.1, 2.4), and New York Heart Association class IV (MRR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4, 6.7) and echocardiographic factors including morphologic evidence of endocarditis or myxomatous disease (MRR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1, 0.7) were significant predictors of overall survival, although valve repair itself was not. End-systolic dimensions and volumes were not, likely related to the small number of patients with markedly increased end-systolic dimensions or volumes (5 patients [4%] with end-systolic dimension>5.5 cm, 12 patients [9%] with end-systolic volume index>60 ml/m2). New York Heart Association class IV (MRR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3, 6.4), age (MRR 1.7/decade, 95% CI 1.2, 2.6), and the presence of calcification (MRR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3, 16.2) were independent predictors of survival in multivariate analysis. In this contemporary cohort of patients undergoing repair or replacement for mitral regurgitation, factors such as echocardiographically determined cause of disease and presence of calcification predicted survival; traditional measurements such as end-systolic dimensions and volumes were less predictive, most likely because patients underwent surgery before their ventricles became markedly enlarged. Clinical factors such as age and functional status remained the most potent predictors of survival after surgery for mitral regurgitation.

The objective of this investigation was to study (1) the numbers of leukocytes, (2) the proportions of lymphocytes expressing CD4, CD8, WC1, B or IL2R and (3) neutrophil phagocytosis and oxidative burst activity in blood around parturition in three groups of dairy cows fed different levels of a total mixed ration during the last eight weeks before calving. All cows were fed ad libitum during the first eight weeks of lactation. Serum concentration of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA), the milk somatic cell count (SCC) and disease incidence were also recorded. Special emphasis was given to the weeks just before and just after calving as dairy cows are known to be immune suppressed during this period.

riod diet had only minor effects on leukocyte numbers, and did not influence neutrophil phagocytosis and oxidative burst. In addition, no effect was observed on disease incidence or SAA concentrations. However, an increase in the proportion of B-lymphocytes and a decrease in the proportion of WC1+ T lymphocytes were observed after calving in cows fed high or low energy rations during the dry period, but not in cows fed a medium energy ration. The weeks just before and after parturition were characterised by neutrophilia, eosinopenia, lymphopenia and monocytosis, but time had no effect on neutrophil phagocytosis and oxidative burst. The proportions of CD4+, CD8+, B+ and IL-2R+ lymphocytes increased in early lactation relative to the mid dry period. In addition, the concentration of SAA increased dramatically at calving. The results emphasise the need for more studies to clarify the complex interactions between nutrition and immunity during the peripartum period in dairy cattle.

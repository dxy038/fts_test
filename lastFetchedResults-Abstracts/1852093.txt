Objective knowledge of tissue density distribution in CT/MRI brain datasets can be related to anatomical or neuro-functional regions for assessing pathologic conditions characterised by slight differences. The process of monitoring illness and its treatment could be then improved by a suitable detection of these variations. In this paper, we present an approach for three-dimensional (3D) classification of brain tissue densities based on a hierarchical artificial neural network (ANN) able to classify the single voxels of the examined datasets. The method developed was tested on case studies selected by an expert neuro-radiologist and consisting of both normal and pathological conditions. The results obtained were submitted for validation to a group of physicians and they judged the system to be really effective in practical applications.

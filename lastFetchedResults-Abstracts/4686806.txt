In conventional H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimal output feedback control design, the order of the controller is higher than that of the plant. Thus it is not easy to implement H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimal control in real world engineering problems. The paper tries to bridge the gap between the theoretical H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control and practical applications. It proposes a simple genetic algorithm (GA), blended with multi objective characteristics, for the design of a structure specified H<sub>&#8734;</sub> sub-optimal controller. Therefore, two examples involving a SISO phase-locked motor speed system with a lead/lag type controller and a MIMO super maneuverable F18/HARV fighter aircraft with a PI-type controller are given to illustrate the applicability of the design. Also in accordance with these examples a comparison study with an existing GA procedure, outlines the effectiveness of the proposed evolutionary scheme

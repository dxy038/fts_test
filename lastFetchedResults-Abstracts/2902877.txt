This paper presented congestion management scheme based on generation rescheduling without and with generic load model. The results obtained with constant impedance, constant current, and constant power load (ZIP model) has also been compared with the results obtained with constant power (P, Q) load at all the buses. An objective function minimizing congestion cost based on bid function is submitted by each generator company (Gencos) to the Independent System Operator (ISO). The analysis has also been carried out with FACTS devices viz. IPFC and GUPFC with out and with ZIP load for pool market models and comparison of results have been presented. The generator rescheduling with the cases of transmission line viz. SL and 3L congestion cases has been obtained and congestion cost comparison has been obtained for all cases without and with ZIP load. The results are obtained for IEEE-24 bus reliability test system (RTS).

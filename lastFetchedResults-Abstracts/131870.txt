BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In using IUD as an intrauterine device, an important problem is earlier extraction which reduces the rate of its efficacy. The objective of this study was to explain the determinants of earlier extraction of IUD.
METHODS: This study was done depending on existing data of 385 files of women who were inserted IUD at 11 rural health care centers in Babol from 1991 to 1997; all studied subjects were followed until the end of 1999. The data about causes of IUD extraction were gathered from the file of family planning and then analysed statistically by SPSS soft ware.
FINDINGS: The results showed that the Mean + SD of duration of IUD using was 36 Â± 24 months. Out of 385 women, IUD were extracted earlier than regular time in 263 (62%) subjects. The most common causes of extraction were vaginal bleeding (28.9%), propensity to be pregnant (19.8%) and infection (10.6%). The most discontinuation (26%) and expulsion rates were occurred in the first year of insertion of IUD.
CONCLUSION: According to the results, the rate of discontinuation of IUD was relatively high. Although, the vaginal bleeding and PID are the most causes of its discontinuation, a numerous IUD discontinuation had not any indication of IUD extraction. It indicated that the IUD using candidates should be carefully selected. Thus, it is necessary to provide more educational program for health exprerts of family planning.

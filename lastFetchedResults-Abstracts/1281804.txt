Introduction & Objective: After periodontal surgery the surgical site is usually covered with periodontal pack. It is suggested that dressings can reduce the rate of infection, bleeding and granulation tissue formation after surgery. In addition, they may promote tissue healing. The aim of this study is to evaluate periodontal dressingâ€™s effect on wound healing, pain and bleeding after periodontal surgery.
Materials & Methods: In this clinical trial study 33 patients attending the Hamadan dental school were evaluated.  The patients need flap surgery on both sides of a jaw. Periodontal pack was used in one side of a jaw only. Inclusion criteria were: nearly similar disease distribution and planning modified Widman flap for both sides. Data were analyzed using SPSS16 software and chi-square and t-test.
Results: Average rate of pain in test and control groups was 1.73 and 2.79, respectively and the difference was statistically significant(P < 0.05) but the differences were not statistically significant regarding swelling, bleeding, gingival consistency, granulation tissue formation, gingival color and ease of eating, in the test and control group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: According the results of this study, periodontal pack may be beneficial in reducing pain after surgery.

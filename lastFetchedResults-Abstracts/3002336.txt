The number of problems induced by the variability and the unsettled nature of the industrial environment is increasing. So, we have developed an approach which aims at making the control system more reactive. Our approach deals with the informal aspects of the control systemÂ´s decision processes. We present a contribution to improving the reactive capacities of industrial systems. The objective consists in reducing the periods of functioning in a disturbed mode. We propose an analytical approach to manage disturbances and we describe the models and necessary tools. Finally, we show how our approach can be implemented in an industrial context.

Objective: This study aimed to explore the basis of a theoretical position which has major impact in the current literature on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) â€“ that the ratio of theta to beta power in the EEG (the theta/beta ratio) represents central nervous system (CNS) arousal.
Methods: Resting state topographic EEG activity was investigated as a function of CNS arousal in normal right-handed boys. Arousal was defined in terms of electrodermal activity, which has a long history in Psychology as a measure of CNS arousal.
Results: Relative delta, theta, and beta power, and the theta/beta ratio, failed to differ significantly between age-matched groups which differed markedly in skin conductance level and non-specific electrodermal fluctuations. The high-arousal group showed significantly lower levels of relative alpha power, particularly in posterior and hemispheric regions, with higher alpha frequencies in these areas.
Conclusions: These data fail to support the theoretical linkage between the theta/beta ratio and CNS arousal. Further work is needed to disentangle the different correlates of arousal and task-related activation, particularly in cognitive and attentional-processing terms.
Significance: The outcomes of this study, in addition to clarifying the nature of EEG markers of CNS arousal, have important implications for our understanding of AD/HD, as they require re-evaluation of current models of the disorder.

ECATNets are a kind of high-level net/data model, combining the strengths of Petri nets with those of abstract data types, used for modeling parallel and distributed systems. Their most distinctive feature is that their semantics is defined in terms of rewriting logics, thus allowing us to analyse the built models by prototyping. However a major drawback of this approach is that the achieved prototypes suffer from a lack of efficiency during their execution. The objective of this paper is to palliate this lack by introducing the concept of hidden sorted ECATNets, a combination of net/object model allowing to &#8220;hide&#8221; (object) internal states, and then to get more rapid prototypes

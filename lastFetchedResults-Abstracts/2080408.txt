Objective
ethods are used to detect vertical root fractures, but most are not adequate for identification of incomplete fractures or cracks. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of three detergents on detection of vertical root fractures by DIAGNOdent® with methylene blue (MB) solution.
s
al incomplete fractures were artificially created on the roots of extracted human teeth, the DIAGNOdent® values (D values) recorded in the presence or absence of MB solution, and the effects of detergents on D values examined. The effects of 20% ethanol on enhancing detergent action were also investigated. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann–Whitney U-test; a value of p &lt; 0.01 was considered significant.
s
es increased significantly when MB solution was used with 0.1% or 1.0% polyoxyethylene (10) octylphenyl ether compared to MB solution only.
sion
findings suggest that 0.1% or 1.0% polyoxyethylene (10) octylphenyl ether could be used as an enhancer for detection of vertical root fractures by DIAGNOdent® using MB solution.

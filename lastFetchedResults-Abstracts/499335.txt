The main objective of this study was to examine, the use of thermo set epoxy resin and wood powder for making wood polymer composites. Results showed that mechanical properties of wood polymer composites that are manufactured were better than wood specimen. Also the water uptake of samples was measured and the results showed the water absorption of wood polymer composite is too much less than wood sample. Images and infrared spectroscopy analysis support this fact that wood polymer composites are more stable than wood. Then the effects of adding wood powder to fiberglass composites were examined. The Results have clearly shown that adding appropriate amount of wood powder to fiber composites will considerably improve their physical and mechanical properties.

Introduction & Objective: Acarbose is an intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that delays absorption of carbohydrates. Findings of some studies show that it has been effective in better control of blood glucose in patients with diabetes type 1. The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of administration of acarbose on glycemic & lipid parameters and daily insulin requirements and tolerability in type 1 diabetic patient.
Materials & Methods: This was a clinical trial randomized double blind placebo controlled study. Performed on patients with history of at least 1 year diabetes type 1 and had HbA1c?7.5%. Patients with Cr?2, partial GI obstruction or IBD were excluded from the study. 45 patients were randomized to be administered acarbose or placebo for 12 weeks. Initial dose of acarbose was 25 mg T.D.S for 2 weeks, and then it was increased to 50 mg T.D.S for 10 weeks. BMI, FBS, 2hpp, HbA1c, Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, TG and Insulin dosage were investigated monthly.
Results: The values of BMI, FBS, 2hpp, HbA1c, Total cholesterol, and TG & Insulin requirements decreased significantly in the case group compared to the controls (P=0.003, P=0.005, P < 0.001, P=0.001, P=0.003, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively); but no significant changes were observed in HDL &LDL levels. 
Conclusion: Administration of acarbose together with insulin to type 1 diabetic patient can be  valuable in improving metabolic control (BMI, FBS, 2hpp, HbA1c, Total cholesterol and TG).

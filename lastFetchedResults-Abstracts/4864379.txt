In this paper, fuzzy cluster method is presented to solve traditional optimum location problem. We consider objects of users as some discrete points. Points are classified by using fuzzy clustering method on condition of large number of them, because the distance between points can be tested by the similarity of axis of the given points. We discuss the single-objective location problem, and construct a model according to realistic situation. The method can also be used in the multi-objective location problem.

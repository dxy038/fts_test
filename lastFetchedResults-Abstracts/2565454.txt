The objective of this study was assessing the frequency of FLT3-ITD mutations and its relation with complete remission in different FAB (French- American- British) and cytogenetic subgroups of AML patients who had been hospitalized at Tehran Imam Khomeini Hospital, hematology ward.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> The current study, was a cross sectional descriptive study which was performed during the years 2007-2008. Population frame were consecutive patients whose diseases were confirmed and who had been hospitalized<strong></strong>in Tehran Imam Khomeini Hospital, hematology ward. Contemporary, flowcytometry, cytogenetic and chromosomal studies were performed for the cytogenetic subgroup assessment and to investigate the presence of FLT3-ITD mutation. Finally, complete remission achievement after induction chemotherapy were assessed. The obtained data was entered onto the information forms and analyzed by statistical tests.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Out of 40 patients who participated in this study, 18 (45%) were female and 22 (55%) were male. The median age of the patients with mutation was 33 years of age, and the ones without mutation were 39.5. M1, M2and M<sub>4 </sub>FAB subgroups, with respectively 60, 37.5 and 35.7%, had the most occurrence of mutation. There was no significant relationship between mutation and the FAB subgroups (P=0.45). Favorable, intermediate and adverse cytogenetic risk groups had respectively 10, 37 and 66.7% mutations and 69.2% of the patients were in the normal karyotype group. Seventeen (42.5%) of the 40 patients achieved complete remission. 17.6% of them had mutations. There was no relationship between mutation and complete remission (P=0.085).<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>There was no relationship between thepresence ofFLT3-ITD mutation and complete remission achievement following chemotherapy.</span></span></p>

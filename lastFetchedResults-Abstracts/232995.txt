Background, prime influences upon present day methods and current trends in United Kingdom tendering practices are reviewed. Significant weaknesses are identified, confirming the need for some revision of existing contractor selection methods. The findings compliment recommendations of the recent government/industry review of the construction sector headed by Sir Michael Latham. Specifically, that tendering procedure should embrace investigation of contractors' potential to deliver a service of acceptable standard, on time, within budget. Present selection methods often fail in this objective, being inclined to discriminate predominantly on cost.

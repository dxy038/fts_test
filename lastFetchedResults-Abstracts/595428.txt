Objective: To find out the etiology of acute bloody diarrheas in patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital. Materials and methods: This descriptive study was conducted in the department of medicine, Lady Reading hospital from 2005 to 2008. A total of 50 patients were studied, comprising of 35 males and 15 females. Mean age of the sample was 32.66 + 15.4 years). Patients who presented with acute bloody diarrhea of between 3-30 days duration were studied. Patients who had history of recurrent bloody diarrhea were also included. Patients below 12 years, severely dehydrated and seriously ill were excluded. All patients underwent fibreoptic Proctosigmoidoscopy and Rectal biopsy. Amebic colitis was confirmed on stool examination for Trophozoites of Entameoba histolytica, typical proctosigmoidoscopic findings and response to anti-amebic drugs. Results: Thirty-two patients (64%) were having new onset bloody diarrhea, while 18 patients (36%) were giving history of recurrent bloody diarrhea. All patients had evidence of Procto-colitis on fibreoptic sigmoidoscopy. The most common conditions were Ulcerative colitis in 25(50%), Bacterial dysentery in 15(30%) and Amebic proctocolitis in 7(14%). Findings on Proctosigmoidoscopy were mucosal hyperemia (50%), bleeding points (38%), ulcers (44%), pus (20%), pseudo polyps (4%) and mass (4%). Conclusion: Fibreoptic Proctosigmoidoscopy is a simple and easier procedure to diagnose different causes of acute bloody diarrhea and should be considered in all cases except in seriously ill and dehydrated patients. The common causes of acute bloody diarrhea in our community are Bacterial proctocolitis, Amebiasis and Ulcerative colitis.

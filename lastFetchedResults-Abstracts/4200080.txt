The distribution network reconfiguration is a process that consists of changing the status of the network switches for re-routing the power after a fault occurrence, or to optimize some given criteria. Traditionally, feeder reconfiguration is a complex combinatorial and constrained optimization problem because of the numerous combinations of candidate switches. A multi-agent based system for distribution network reconfiguration is proposed. The system consists of load agents and switch agents located at the loads and switches in the network and a global agent located at the substation. The objective is to supply the critical loads while maintaining an acceptable system voltage profile. Simulation results are presented for a typical distribution system named Circuit of the Future (CoF), which is developed by Southern California Edison (SCE).

Objective: This study has been conducted to investigate the efficacy of short-term dynamic psychotherapy
on Love Trauma Syndrome (LTS) in female students. LTS includes a constellation of intensive signs and
symptoms which appear following the breakdown of a romantic relationship after a long time. It interrupts
person's function in many areas (academic, social or professional) and leads to maladaptive reactions.

who were selected based on purposeful sampling procedure. The intervention was conducted based on
McCullough's manual for short-term dynamic psychotherapy. In general, the study consisted of three stages
including the baseline evaluation, the intervention period, and follow-up. The instruments included the Love
Trauma Inventory (LTI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Global Assessment Function (GAF) of DSM-IV
and Millon Personality Inventory MCMI-II the data were analyzed using the clinical significance method and the
recovery percent formula.
Results: All subjects who completed the treatment showed significant improvement in their symptoms
including depression and general functioning.

LTS.

Real-world applications are bound to have certain level of uncertainty inherent in them. Among this noise is one of the most predominant factors affecting the optimization process whether it is conventional or evolutionary techniques. The evolutionary optimization techniques are found to be inherently stronger and robust to noisy environments but they are robust for lower noise levels, higher noise requires corrections to be made to the algorithm. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the different correction methods used for optimizing noisy objective functions or fitness functions that creates uncertain environment and also provide with an brief overview of the other issues involved while using evolutionary computational methods for optimizing applications in uncertain environment.

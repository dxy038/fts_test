The PWM rectifier is adopted to realize bidirectional flow in battery formation system. The topology and control strategy of PWM rectifier were analyzed and the transfer function was proposed. Fixed switching frequency PWM current control technology make the system work in rectifier and inverter. The current is sine wave with unity power factor. Simulation and experimental results show a good dynamic and stability performance of the system.

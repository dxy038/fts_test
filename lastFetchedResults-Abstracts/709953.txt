Background
Old people's life situation when receiving municipal help and care in their last period of life is sparsely investigated from their own perspective.
Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences of aspects that bring about a good life in the last phase of life among people (75+ years) receiving municipal care.
Participants
Older people living in a municipality in Southern Sweden being 75 years or older, receiving help and/or care from the municipality, and having a life-threatening disease and/or receiving palliative care were asked to participate. In all 17 people, 10 women and 7 men, aged 78–100 years were included.
Methods
Qualitative interviews, with the emphasis on their present life situation especially what brought about a good life, were performed. The interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis.
Results
The experience was interpreted to be Turning inwards to come to peace with the past, the present and approaching death while being trapped by health complaints. Six categories embraced the experience of aspects that constitute a good life in the last phase of life: Maintaining dignity, Enjoying small things, Feelings of “being at home”, Being in the hands of others, trying to adjust, Still being important for other people and Completing life while facing death.
Conclusion
This study confirm theories suggesting that the last phase of life in old age meant focusing inwards, reflecting on the entire life as a way of completing it as well as enjoying small things and also viewing oneself in the perspective of contributing to the future. It also indicated that this phase of life meant being trapped by health complaints and functional limitations. The struggle to maintaining dignity as opposed to being in the hands of others implies that the concept of palliative care may be useful as a framework for providing nursing care to very old people, especially at the end of life.

The objective of this research work is to develop an atmospheric plasma device that can be used in liquid. The work consists of three parts, namely the development of device, device characteristics and device testing on selected liquid. The specifications for the device are the power supply used is in the range of 7.5 to 8 V and the flow rate of gas used is 350 ml/min. The working gas used is 99.9 % pure Helium gas. Two liquid samples; drain and rain liquid were used for the preliminary test of the device. The samples were treated for 12 minutes. Changes in pH value, dissolved oxygen (DO) value and temperature were observed. The preliminary result showed that the device is able to increase pH value and DO value of the liquid to the range of 2.8 mg/l to 3.7 mg/l regardless of any DO value before the treatment with slight changes of temperature.

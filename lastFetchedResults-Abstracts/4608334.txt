Due to the condition that optimization testing work of power system stabilizer(PSS) parameters is highly man-relied, an intelligent optimization method of PSS parameters based on grid equivalence is proposed. The method improves working efficiency effectively, and guarantees that the optimized PSS parameters approach the global optimum. Using small disturbance data, system excluding the generator is equivalent to infinity bus voltage V<sub>s</sub> and system reactance X<sub>s</sub>. Linearized Heffron-Philips model of the equivalent system is employed to calculate uncompensated phase lagging characteristic generated by excitation system, then an objective curve of PSS parameters optimization can be obtained. Based on the objective curve, SAPSO is applied to optimize the value of PSS parameters. The example of EPRI-36 system indicates that PSS with optimized parameters can constrain low-frequency oscillations effectively.

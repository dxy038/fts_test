The introduction of new drugs that specifically antagonize tumor
                            necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) has provided an effective treatment
                            in a wide variety of autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, the possibility
                            of the reactivation of latent TB (Tuberculosis) infection (LTBI) among
                            these patients is a considerable challenge. The aim of this paper is to
                            evaluate LTBI diagnostic tools in patients who are candidates for
                            anti-TNF-α therapy emphasizing how to manage these patients. A
                            systematic web-based search was conducted in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library
                            Database, and UpToDate® resources using the key words “anti-TNF-α” and
                            “latent tuberculosis” up to March 2015. Two reviewers extracted and
                            summarized the data and suggested protocols for the diagnosis and
                            management of LTBI in patients receiving TNF-α inhibitors. There were
                            somewhat different approaches proposed by various researchers regarding
                            the subject. While no recommendation was found to be unique to include
                            all patients in all situations, the data emphasize the importance of
                            ruling out TB infection before deciding to start an anti-TNF-α drug.
                            Special high-risk groups, including patients with LTBI, should be
                            treated before receiving TNF-α inhibitors. The tuberculin skin test
                            (TST) is a somewhat cost-effective test for the diagnosis of LTBI.
                            However, its usefulness with respect to false results should be
                            re-evaluated in this situation.

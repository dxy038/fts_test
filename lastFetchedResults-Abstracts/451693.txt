Purpoe
To invetigate the concordance between ubjectively and objectively acquired viual field in patient with ubjectively determined hemianopia.
Deign

Retropective obervational tudy.
Method

Ten patient, ix men and four women, ranging in age from 28 to 68 year, were tudied. Goldmann or Humphrey perimeter were ued to obtain the ubjectively determined viual field for up to 25 degree of eccentricity, and the VERI cientific ytem (Electro-Diagnotic Imaging, an Francico, California, UA) wa ued to record multifocal viual evoked potential [VEP] (mfVEP) to obtain the objective viual field. Each of the 60 black-and-white egment of the checkerboard timulu wa alternated according to a binary m equence. The firt lice of the econd-order kernel were extracted and analyzed.
Reult

In five cae, the viual field loci where the mfVEP were within normal limit correponded to the cotomatou area obtained by conventional perimetry. In thee dicordant cae, the leion (e.g., arteriovenou malformation) were located in the occipital lobe. Two of thee cae had a complete recovery of the ubjective viual field. The leion of the concordant cae were located outide the occipital lobe (e.g., pituitary adenoma). In thee cae, no viual field improvement wa een. The temporal crecent yndrome wa ruled out in patient with poterior leion by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic reonance imaging (MRI) finding.
Concluion

In ome patient with occipital leion, the ubjective and objective viual field reult are dicordant, and ome of them will how a recovery of the viual field deficit.

Objective: Smoking bans reduce exposure to tobacco smoke. The aim of this study was to assess home smoking ban and associated factors among Iranian pregnant women.

A questionnaire was completed through a face-to-face interview.  Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses determined factors associated with home smoking ban.
Results: Prevalence of complete home smoking ban was 31.5%. A smoker family member (OR=1.96, 95%CI: 1.50-2.56) and the belief that secondhand smoke harm the fetus (cigarette, OR=0.24, 95%CI: 0.17-0.34), (waterpipe, OR=0.46, 95%CI: 0.33-0.63) were related to home smoking ban. 
Conclusions: More than half the pregnant women have no complete smoking ban in their home, and it is associated with smoker family members and the beliefs of pregnant women.

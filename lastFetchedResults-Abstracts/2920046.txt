Shows the advantage of CADCAM and outlines the development of software which is both easy to use and flexible, for applications in CADCAM of aircraft components in initial stages of parametric design. To limit the task to manageable proportions, it was decided to concentrate on wing components. The package which has been developed does not design all components of a wing, but it mainly concentrates upon the parametric integration of CAD and CAM with respect to wing riblet components, although the method could be used for other components. The objective was to develop a paperless parametric CADCAM link which would bridge the gap of conventional parametric CAD and CAM. Furthermore, the developed system shows benefits in linking design and manufacture of families of components. Thus, the objectives were limited to highlighting the parametric CADCAM advantages and disadvantages, and the benefits in the design and manufacture of aircraft wing components. The package was developed using parametric programming languages; GRIP and GRIP-Numerical Control (GRIP-NC)

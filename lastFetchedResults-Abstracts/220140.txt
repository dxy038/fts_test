This study is curried out with the objective or forecasting nominal and
real prices or some L1gricultural products such as onions. potatoes and
tomatoes. Alter the analysis or stationarity or the associated limeseries.
the randomness of the variables is studied using the nonparametric
Wald-Wullowirz and the parametric Durbin-Watson tests,
lhe results show thaL all the nominal price series or the said products
and the rCJI price series 01" potatoes were identified as non-random
and forccastable time-series. The time-horizon for this study is 135013X4.
Models used lor the I(JlcGlSting in this analysis were AR, M/\,
ARIMA. Single l-xponcntia] Smoothing, Double Exponential
Smoothing, l larrnonic Analysis. ARelI and the Artificial Ncuronetwork.
Amongst the four forecasting series based on the minimumerror
criterion, the AR and MA models forecasted the normnal price
series or onions and potatoes much better. The Harmonic model
forecasted the !10111 Ina I pncc or tomatoes with minimal error. The
forecasted values Ior the real price of potatoes using the ARCH
model produced the nunimum errors. Forecasting error for the
nominal price series of potatoes \\ a:-. less than its real price series. The
forecasting values (or the year 13X5 and 13X6 were shown to he mere
than the similar values for 1384, with the exception of the price for
potatoes.

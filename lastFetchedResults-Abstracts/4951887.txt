We consider immersive rendering of a set of sound sources, apparently positioned at different locations in three-dimensional (3-D) space around a listener. Each sound source is associated with a subband-coded audio stream. A low-complexity rendering approach, based on reduced-rank models of subband-domain head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), is proposed in this paper. HRTFs are approximated using a set of basis vectors in subband-domain. Immersive rendering of partially decoded audio stream is performed in subband-domain using the basis vectors. Perceptual objective error measurements and subjective test results indicate, despite low computational complexity, this technique is effective in rendering of coded audio streams in 3-D space

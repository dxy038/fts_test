Objective: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-axis genes plays a critical role in cancer development and progression via their impact on the RAS/MAPK/ERK and PI3 K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. We hypothesized that IGF-axis genetic variants modify individual susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. Methods: We retrospectively genotyped 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 10 IGF-axis genes (IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IGF2R, IGFBP1, IGFBP3, IGFBP5, IRS1, IRS2, and IRS4) in 706 pancreatic cancer patients and 706 cancer-free controls using Sequenom and TaqMan technology. The association between genotype and pancreatic cancer risk was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. A P value ≤.007 at a false discovery rate of 10% was set as the significance level. Results: We observed that the IGF1 *10212C&gt;A and Ex4+2776G&gt;A and IGF1R IVS2−70184A&gt;G and IVS2+46329T&gt;C variant genotypes were significantly associated with decreased pancreatic cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] range, 0.60–0.75) and that IGFBP1 Ex4+111A&gt;G (I253M) was significantly associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk (OR = 1.46) after adjusted for other risk factors and multiple comparisons (P ≤ .007). IGF2R and IGFBP3 variant haplotypes were associated with increased and decreased pancreatic cancer risk, respectively (P &lt; .001). We also observed a weak interaction of the IGF1R IVS2+46329T&gt;C and IGF2R Ex45+11C&gt;T (L2222L) genotypes with diabetes (Pinteraction = .05) and interaction of IGF2R and IRS1 genotypes with alcohol consumption (Pinteraction = .03 and .019, respectively) on increased pancreatic cancer risk. Conclusion: These findings support our hypothesis that polymorphic variants of IGF-axis genes act alone or jointly with other risk factors to affect susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.

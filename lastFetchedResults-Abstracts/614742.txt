Background & Objective: Drinking water should be free of any chemical and microbial contaminants. One of the important aspects of drinking water pollution is presence of heavy metals that can be hazardous for consumers’ health. Since, heavy metals can enter to water sources through environmental pollutants as well as the corrosion of pipe materials; this study was carried out to control heavy metals in Kashan drinking water network.
Methods: This study was done in five zones of Kashan distribution network in 2010. In total 105 samples were taken in spring, summer, and autumn (35 samples for each season) using clean poly ethylene containers. Concentrations of heavy metals were analyzed by ICP.
Results: Results show that average concentration of Cr, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ag, Co, Ni and Cd are 3.66, 76.5, 167.8, 2.87, 1.37, 3.34, 5.1, and 0.45 µg.l-1, respectively.
Conclusion: Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that concentrations of above mentioned heavy metals in distribution network of Kashan are not higher than national and international standards for drinking water and that would not cause any hazard to consumers.

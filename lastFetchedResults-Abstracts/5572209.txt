A method of multiple objective optimization is proposed in an attempt to determine the optimal job-assignment and conveyor systems for a digital picking/conveyance system. A system is considered which consists of operators, conveyor lines, and tracks containing items to be picked. Four particular types of conveyor systems are analyzed to examine their performance under various picking conditions. In addition, a multiple objective optimization problem is formulated in terms of goal programming by using a simulation technique. A procedure for obtaining the solution for multiple objective systems is presented with a numerical example

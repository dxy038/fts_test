The focus of this paper is the application of the NASPI [1] generated PMU placement process to locate thirty-nine (39) Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) within the NYCA (NYCA Study). The material for this panel paper is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy under Award Number(s) DE-OE0000368 and is a collaborative effort between the New York ISO (NYISO) and the Transmission Owners (TOs) in the NYCA. The placement of PMUs discussed in the paper follows multiple criteria with the overall objective to locate PMUs to maximize system benefits, beyond those provided by conventional metering, and the existing energy management system (EMS) functions. The new capabilities enabled by the PMUs are Phasor enhanced visualization and situational awareness aided by various analytical functions. The functionalities for all of the 345/230 kV substations in NYCA are considered. A contribution of each substation to each of the functions of interest was assessed and a separate weight was assigned expressing how important a certain station is to each of the PMU functions. By tallying the cumulative weight of a station in support of all the functions, the stationÂ´s rank was developed, which was then used to propose preferred substations for each of the TOs.

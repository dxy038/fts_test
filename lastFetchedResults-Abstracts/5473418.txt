A receding horizon steering controller is presented, capable of pushing an oversteering nonlinear vehicle model to its handling limit while travelling at constant forward speed. The controller is able to optimise the vehicle path, using a computationally efficient and robust technique, so that the vehicle progression along a track is maximised as a function of time. The resultant method forms part of the solution to the motor racing objective of minimising lap time.

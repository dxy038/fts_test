Since buildings have considerable impacts on the environment, it has become necessary to pay more attention to environmental performance in building design. However, it is a difficult task to find better design alternatives satisfying several conflicting criteria, especially, economical and environmental performance. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model that could assist designers in green building design. Variables in the model include those parameters that are usually determined at the conceptual design stage and that have critical influence on building performance. Life cycle analysis methodology is employed to evaluate design alternatives for both economical and environmental criteria. Life cycle environmental impacts are evaluated in terms of expanded cumulative exergy consumption, which is the sum of exergy consumption due to resource inputs and abatement exergy required to recover the negative impacts due to waste emissions. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to find optimal solutions. A case study is presented and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for identifying a number of Pareto optimal solutions for green building design.

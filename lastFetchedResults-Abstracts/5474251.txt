An objective of delay fault diagnosis is to enable characterization of the source and nature of timing failure in an integrated circuit. However, the most commonly studied defect models (the gate-delay and path-delay fault models) do not adequately capture the complex timing characteristics that a delay fault can exhibit. In this work, we present a novel diagnostic technique that is used to extract an accurate delay fault model we call a segment network fault without the need for any timing information. In our simulation-based experiments, we successfully diagnose delay faults of varying complexity demonstrating the usefulness of the new delay fault model for the purposes of delay defect characterization.

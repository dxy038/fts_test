Dual motor drives fed by a single inverter are designed to reduce size and cost with respect to single motor drives fed by a single inverter. However, classical dual motor drives using single inverter has its limitation in the case of different speed commands are applied. Recent research has shown that, dual motor drives can independently control by using Five-Leg inverter (FLI). The objective of this paper is to investigate the behavior of the Dual PMSM Drives fed by FLI using sensorless technique under wide range of speed and variation of load disturbance. The purpose of using sensorless technique is to eliminate the use of speed sensor and this will reduce the system cost, size and complexity. The investigation is done using MATLAB/Simulink tools. Simulation results prove that this topology able to control independently dual motors for different operating conditions.

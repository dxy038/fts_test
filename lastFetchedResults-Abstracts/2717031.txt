A high-efficiency isolated bidirectional ac&#8211;dc converter is proposed for a 380-V dc power distribution system to control bidirectional power flows and to improve its power conversion efficiency. To reduce the switches&#8217; losses of the proposed nonisolated full-bridge ac&#8211;dc rectifier using an unipolar switching method, switching devices employ insulated-gate bipolar transistors, MOSFETs, and silicon carbide diodes. Using the analysis of the rectifier&#8217;s operating modes, each switching device can be selected by considering switch stresses. A simple and intuitive frequency detection method for a single-phase synchronous reference frame-phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) is also proposed using a filter compensator, a fast period detector, and a finite impulse response filter to improve the robustness and accuracy of PLL performance under fundamental frequency variations. In addition, design and control methodology of the bidirectional full-bridge CLLC resonant converter is suggested for the galvanic isolation of the dc distribution system. A dead-band control algorithm for the bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converter is developed to smoothly change power conversion directions only using output voltage information. Experimental results will verify the performance of the proposed methods using a 5-kW prototype converter.

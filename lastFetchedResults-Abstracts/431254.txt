Psychological and psychiatric disorders independently increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and worsen the prognosis in patients with established cardiovascular lesions. The objective of this literature review is to discuss recent data concerning the relationships between depression and anxiety and the outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting. Pathophysiological hypotheses are put forward to explain observed links. We suggest recommendations aimed at improving the psychological evaluation and management of heart surgery candidates, as well as postbypass patients, in the hope of improving quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes in these patients.

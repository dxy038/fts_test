OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown that treatment with mifepristone, 50 to 100 mg daily, results in amenorrhea, anovulation, and symptomatic improvement in women with endometriosis. In this study we lowered the dose to 5 mg daily to determine whether clinical efficacy is altered without other adverse actions. STUDY DESIGN: After a baseline cycle, seven women with endometriosis were given mifepristone, 5 mg daily, for 6 months. Daily symptom inventories were recorded. Laparoscopy was performed during the sixth month of therapy. RESULTS: Pelvic pain improved in six of seven patients. Cyclic bleeding ceased in all patients, but four of the seven patients complained of irregular bleeding. Surgical staging at the conclusion of the study (five of seven patients) did not detect a change in endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS: Mifepristone, 5 mg daily, resulted in symptomatic improvement, but did not stabilize the endometrium. From our experience with three doses of mifepristone, we would recommend a dose of 50 mg be used for continued investigations. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:1151-6.)

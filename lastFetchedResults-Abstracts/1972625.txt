The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dry and hydrothermal treatment on FB1 level in polished, parboiled and whole grain rice collected in Brazilian market. The effect of thermal treatment on FB1 level was carry out by applying conventional cooking, autoclaving and dry heat treatment. Conventional hydrothermal treatment (cooking) reduced the initial natural contamination by 80%. However, no significant reduction was obtained by autoclaving. Dry heat treatment produced the reduction (70%), at temperatures range from 150 to 200 °C.

In this paper a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing power-line (PLC) bidirectional communication system is proposed for narrowband PLC applications in medium-voltage networks. The direct- and cross-channel transfer functions are computed for several test cases using a coupled multi-conductor transmission line model. Simulation results show that high data rates up to several hundreds of kbps are achievable at a low error rate of 10<sup>-7</sup>.

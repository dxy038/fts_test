Introduction: About one percent of all deliveries are abnormal; and 4% are "difficult" deliveries and since a long time ago vaginal delivery is considered as preferred method or delivery.
Objective: The goal of this study was to provide a relatively complete picture of early neonatal injuries in vaginal and cesarean deliveries.
Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study and the sample consisted of all women who delivered in Al-Zahra Maternity Hospital (Rasht) between 1998 June 20th to 1999 October 20t' whose neonate had some sort of injury. Their appropriate data was collected in a census sampling procedure.
Results: There were 5289 (40%) cesarean section and 7828 (60%) normal vaginal deliveries with 24 (4.5perl000) early neonatal injuries in cesarean and 117 (1.5perl000) in vaginal deliveries. Most injuries in cesarean deliveries were ulcerations located on faces and skulls; and in vaginal deliveries were clavicle fractures; 19(3.6per1000) and 40 (5.3per1000) respectively.
Conclusion: It appears that early neonatal injuries are more in vaginal deliveries than cesareans; and elective cesarean may be a preferred procedure for some pregnant women. Although for thorough assessment a randomized clinical trial may be needed.

The main objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of multiple machines connected to a common bus terminal with that of an equalized generator typically, considered in a power system. A detailed analysis of small signal and transient stability has been carried out to study the effectiveness of the systems in the presence of a non-linear controller and a conventional PSS. The performance of the controllers has been evaluated by carrying out the simulation on a five-machine test system for small and large disturbances. Case study shows that intensity of oscillations has reduced much in the case of multiple machines equipped with the non-linear controllers.

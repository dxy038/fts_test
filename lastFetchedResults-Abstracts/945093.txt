Background & Objective: Pre-identification of practical educational objectives and provision of equal learning opportunities, corresponding to the objectives, for students are among the needs of the educational system that should be fulfilled using the clinical handbook (Logbook). The current research tried to assess the effect of using this handbook on the learning of the students of the department of obstetrics and gynecology. 

Methods: This quasi-experimental study was carried out on 117 medical students composed of trainees and interns in the academic year 2010-2011. The students were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group participants were trained with the help of the logbook while the control group's training followed the normal established method. The skills of the two groups were evaluated at the end of the term through direct observation based on a checklist. 

Results: The average of the total scores of the trainees and the interns of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P  <  0.05). However, with regard to a number of skills, there was no difference between the scores of the trainees of the two groups. 

Conclusion: The Logbook is efficient but not sufficient for teaching clinical skills, and therefore, there should be an appropriate ground for a more efficient usage of the book.

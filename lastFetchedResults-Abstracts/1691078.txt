Inroduction & Objective: The aqueous extract of Winter cherry fruits (Physalis-alkekengi; solanacea) has long been recommended as a traditional contraceptive drug by herbalists in Iran. For this purpose we decided to study the biological effects of the aqueous extract of it on the histogenesis and organogenesis of developing Balb/C mouse embryos. 
Materials and Methods: Intra peritoneal injections of aqueous extract were applied in all experiments. LD50 standard was determined 20.6 g/kg of body weight in vivo conditions.
Results: Results of day 4 gestation showed exohepatic, exohepatic together with spinabifida, 1.58% exencephal, 27% limb malformation and 1.58 fused placenta. Results of day 5 gestation revealed 13.6% with polyps in hand.
Results of day 6 gestation produced 9.72% polyps in the hands and 16.7% some embryos with hemorrhage in chest, back, face and skull. Also one of the experimental placenta showed a circle of hemorrhage around umbilical cord (1.62%). 
Conclusion: We conclude that probably physalin F is the main teratogenic agent in this species of plant, but there remain more to be done in this respect.
Key word: Physalis alkekengi, Teratogene, Physalin

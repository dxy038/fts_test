The aim of this paper is to address the maintenance optimization problem when the maintenance models encode stochastic processes, which rely on parameters that are imprecisely known, and when these parameters are only determined through information elicited from experts. A genetic algorithms (GA)-based technique is proposed to deal with such uncertainty setting; this approach requires addressing three main issues: i) the representation of the uncertainty in the parameters and its propagation onto the fitness values; ii) the development of a ranking method to sort the obtained uncertain fitness values, in case of single-objective optimization; and iii) the definition of Pareto dominance, for multi-objective optimization problems. A known hybrid Monte Carlo-Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence method is used to address the first issue, whereas two novel approaches are developed for the second and third issues. For verification, a practical case study is considered concerning the optimization of maintenance for the nozzle system of a turbine in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.

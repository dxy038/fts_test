This part aims at designing a fuzzy inverse controller for fuzzy linear interval systems. The controller is designed from the fuzzy interval ranges of the system parameters. Indeed, for a given degree of confidence on the fuzzy system parameters, the control objective can be viewed as maintaining the system output within a tolerance envelope, around the exact trajectory, specified by a degree of preference on the fuzzy trajectory. The validity of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation examples.

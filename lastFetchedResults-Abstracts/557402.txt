Background and Objective: One of the most prominent disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD) is bradykinesia. The presnt study sought to examine the effect of 1-week motor skill practice, hand to mouth movement on bradykinesia and the impact of motor learning on PD patients.
Materials and Methods: In a clinical trial, the performance of 9 right-handed PD patients in reaction time was compared to nine demographically matched healthy control subjects. Participants practiced reaching the hand to mouth movement in response to visual stimulus 120 times each day for 1-week. Using Kinemetrix 3D Motion Analysis system, the effect of motor skill practice on bradykinesia and the influence of motor learning were investigated. The pretest performance was compared to performances the post test, seventh and fourteenth days of the study.
Results: Mean RT decreased significantly after 1-week practice in the healthy control group. Patients' mean RT decreased after 1-week practice, but this reduction was significant only between the first and the second test sessions (P <  0.01). However, between the second and the third test sessions only close to the significant level (P= 0.06). Evaluation of the fourth test session, i.e., 1-week after the end of practices, was indicative of a non-significant difference between the third and fourth test sessions.
Conclusion: Short-term practice can improve bradykinesia in patients with PD but the benefit of practice in the long-term is reduced. Practice is a useful method with sustained effects after 1-week in the mild to moderate PD patients. Further follow up studies on the advantages of longer term of practice and loner retention periods are warranted.

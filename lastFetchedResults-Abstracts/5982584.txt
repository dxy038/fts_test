This paper is concerned with organizing knowledge management in complex R&amp;D projects where time is the prime factor. We argue that specific portals developed using groupware technology and products should be augmented by agents in order to increase the overall system reactivity and to achieve the global objective, namely to save time. We describe a portal we have developed using a groupware approach, we give the structure of a system of cognitive agents, and discuss the possibility of bringing the two technologies together

This paper reports on our experience in modeling and employing ontology-inferred knowledge to support and improve data mining tasks of yeast protein interactions for knowledge discovery. This objective has been accomplished by providing simplified access to units of intersecting proteome data and information from different biological databases and bio-ontologies, and utilizing a logical framework to answer questions from biologists.

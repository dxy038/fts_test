This paper presents a new mathematical model for a hybrid flow shop scheduling  problem with multiprocessor tasks in which sequence dependent set up times and preemption are considered. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of makespan and maximum tardiness. Three meta-heuristic methods based on genetic algorithm (GA), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and a hybrid approach of GA and ICA are proposed to solve the generated problems. The performances of algorithms are evaluated by computational time and Relative Percentage Deviation (RPD) factors. The results indicate that ICA solves the problems faster than other algorithms and the hybrid algorithm produced best solution based on RPD.

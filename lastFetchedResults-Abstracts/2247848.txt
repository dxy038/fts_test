Background and objective: People's judgment about quality of educational services is often poor and vague and it is not easy for them to express their perceptions and expectations using an exact numerical value. It is more realistic to use linguistic terms to describe the expectations and perceptions. In this paper, a combination of SERVQUAL and fuzzy logic approaches were used to evaluate the quality of educational services provided at Islamic Azad University of Qom.
Materials and Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted in 2013. A sample of 365 students was selected randomly through stratified sampling. Data was collected through standard SERVQUAL questionnaire. Validity of questionnaire was confirmed by experts and its reliability was estimated through Cronbach's alpha (0.84). Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were used to analyze the data.
Results: Comparison of students' perceptions and expectations indicated that there were significant differences in all aspects of educational service quality (P < 0.05). The average gap of educational services was 79.0, which represented a negative gap in service quality. The greatest and lowest gap in tangible factors was (-0.90) and responsibility and reliability was (-0.74). The gap between the quality of education in terms of gender, college and field of study, was significant (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Based on the findings of the study the largest gap was in the tangible factors. It is suggested to improve library resources and increase computer workshops.

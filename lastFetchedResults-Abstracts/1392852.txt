A pneumatic suspension that can adapt itself to the incoming vibration is presented in this paper. A switching control strategy between two different configurations is proposed and studied. The objective is to avoid undesirable resonant frequencies. The control procedure is based on the pre-knowledge of the incoming vibration frequency, and when this frequency is unknown, a very efficient prediction technique is used. The results show that the adaptable suspension has improved performance as compared to any of its passive counterparts. The transient response when switching typically takes less than three cycles and does not hinder the suspension performance.

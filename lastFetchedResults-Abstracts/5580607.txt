First order sliding mode control is an important robust control approach. For the class of systems to which it applies, first order sliding mode controller provides a systematic approach to the problem of maintaining stability and consistent performance in the face of modeling imprecision. On the other hand, the chattering phenomenon is one of the major problems in first order sliding mode control. This paper introduces a second order sliding mode control approach in the context of position control of an electropneumatic system. The main objective is to demonstrated through this approach the undesired chattering phenomenon can he avoided while retaining the same robustness of first order sliding mode control.

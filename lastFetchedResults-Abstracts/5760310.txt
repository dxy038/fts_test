The goal of the data model is to certify that all data objects required by the database are completely and accurately represented. Because the data model uses easily understood notations and natural language, it can be examined and confirmed as correct by the end-users. There are two major methodologies used to create a data model: the Entity-Relationship (ER) approach and the object model. Ontologies are objects of interest (universal of discourse). The objective of this paper is to simplify object models compare with ontology model. There are some similarities between objects in object models and concepts or classes in ontologies. The object model is the center of data modeling; on the other hand ontology itself has the concept which is the basis of knowledge base. Some issues mentioned in this paper are related with their connection; some are addressed directly into the similarities or differences point of view of both. This paper also presents the available tools, methods, procedures which show the corporation with object modeling and ontologies.

In this paper, a vision system for controlling an autonomous biped robot is presented. Robots need sensors to understand circumstances. There are several types of sensors. Recently, a camera is rapidly becoming the sensor of choice due to the remarkable improvement in computer technology especially in processing power. However, there is the blurred image problem because of camera shake due to robot´s walking. Our method focuses on the use of image processing to control a humanoid robot´s walking. We fix a camera on a biped robot, and input the images from the camera to PC for processing. The results of the image processing are sent to the robot for control immediately. These real-time image processing and control systems give us an efficient application on future robots. In the initial experiment the objective is to control robot walking upstairs.

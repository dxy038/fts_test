Objective: This study was carried out to compare two methods of clinical evaluation (OSCE and traditional) on nursing students' satisfaction.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive comparative study, all the nursing students of Rasht nursing faculty who were trained in pediatric wards were randomly divided into two groups, one group evaluated by OSCE, and other group by traditional method. Then, in order to determine the effect of evaluation methods, students' satisfaction was checked through a satisfaction form. Data were gathered by checklists for nine stations, satisfactory rating scale on 6 domains and traditional evaluation form.
Results: The highest rate of students' satisfaction in all domains belonged to OSCE group (P<0005). Conclusion: OSCE can evaluate nursing students' clinical skills more than the other methods and can trigger more satisfaction among them.

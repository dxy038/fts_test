In this paper, the electric charger with single phase PWM converter and a bidirectional half-bridge converter is proposed. A transformer leakage inductance is used for making resonance at the resonant converter, which can make switched current to be sinusoidal without extra inductive component. Both operating principle and design guideline are described in detail. The feasibility for the proposed design is verified through hardware implementation and the experimental results. Detailed results have been obtained to show several advantages such as the compact design and reduced switching losses for different values and conditions of leakage inductance and resonance cases.

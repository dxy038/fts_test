In order to determine the optimal planting model, the multi objective programming was
used in Sari Dashte Naz agriculture Company. Also the current model has been compared
with two optimal models that one of them is consistent with consumption values and the
other is estimated according to the amount of critical consumption of fertilizer and
pesticides. The results showed that the current model is different with optimal pattern and
it is more appropriate with the environmental and sustainable development objectives.
This model not only would increase the gross output to 1230 million Rials but, it is
considered as the most appropriate planting model for this region. Therefore, the cropping
pattern should be changed and consistence with the self sufficiency objectives of
government in production of seeds, the areas under cultivation of canola should be
increase and the amount of pesticides and fertilizers usages should be reduced.

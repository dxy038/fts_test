This research is intended to be an opening contribution to the analytical study of real time information sharing based on "Cloud Computing", then uses a simulation model to calculate the expected benefits of a "Cloud Computing"-based information sharing in a multi-echelon complex supply chain. The main objective of supply chain management is to optimize the entire system. The results of this study have the important implications for practitioners. Our results could also form the basis for empirical investigations into estimating the impact and value of information sharing in the supply chain.

In this paper, reliable design, production, and maintenance planning for multipurpose process plant is formulated as a multi-objective mathematical optimization problem. In this work, five objectives: the total cost of utilities, preventive and corrective maintenance costs, design costs as a function of equipment initial failure rate, and the profit generated by the delivered products are considered in the optimization. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional mathematical optimization method in arriving at local optimum and dimension disasters, etc., we introduce the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique into reliable design, production, and maintenance planning for multipurpose process plants for the first time, from which the supreme scheme is generated A example on reliable design, production, and maintenance planning for multipurpose process plant is presented to show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methodology, compared with the existing optimal planning methods, the search time of the particle swarm optimization method is shorter and the result is close to the ideal solution, simultaneously.

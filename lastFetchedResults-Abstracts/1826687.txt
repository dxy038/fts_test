The objective of this study was to understand the possible mechanisms of activation of receptor EphA2 by its ligand ephrinA1 in malignant mesothelioma cell (MMC) growth. Activation of receptor EphA2 by its ligand ephrinA1 triggered the phosphorylation of EphA2. Ligand activation of EphA2 also induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and significantly decreased MMC proliferation. Ligand activated and ephrinA1 vector (pcDNA/EFNA1) transfected MMC demonstrated decreased clonal growth in 3-D matrigels when compared to resting MMC. These studies suggest that EphA2 activation by its ligand ephrinA1 transmits intracellular signals from cell membrane to nucleus via ERK1/2 signaling cascade and inhibits MM growth.

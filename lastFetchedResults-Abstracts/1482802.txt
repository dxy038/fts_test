Tenderness is an important meat quality parameters and the use of high power ultrasound to disrupt muscle structure may prove effective for reducing both myofibrillar and collagenous toughness. The experiment was carried out with Longissimus lumborum et thoracis and Semitendinosus muscles from 3 to 4 year old steers. Uncooked beef samples (60 × 40 × 20 mm) were treated with high power ultrasound (24 kHz, 12 W/cm2) for up to 240 s, and aged for up to 8.5 days before evaluation of pH, drip loss, cook losses Warner–Bratzler shear (WBS), compression hardness, and colour. Ultrasound treatment significantly reduced WBS force and hardness, but significantly increased pH. Ageing significantly reduced hardness and WBS force, but there was no significant interaction between ultrasound treatment and ageing time. Ultrasound treatment did not affect any of the colour parameters (L∗a∗b∗, chroma and hue) but the ageing time significantly increased the lightness, chroma and hue. There was no significant effect of ultrasound treatment on drip loss, but it did significantly reduce the cook and total loss. During ageing, cook loss and total losses significantly increased. The results suggest that high power ultrasound is capable of reducing objective texture measurements of beef without compromising the other quality parameters investigated.

The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is currently pursuing key technologies for the integration of a low-cost communications and radar system that will allow performing multiple functionalities with a single system and an antenna. These radar and communication functions include active/passive target acquisition, combat identification, weapons guidance, secure point-to-point communications, active protection, networks for situational awareness, and signal intercept. Antennas capable of supporting multiple simultaneous beams that can be scanned over a wide range are desired as part of this objective. Furthermore, these objectives need to be satisfied over a broad band to support multiple functionalities. This work discusses some of the developments on the printed Rotman lens design in order to achieve these objectives.

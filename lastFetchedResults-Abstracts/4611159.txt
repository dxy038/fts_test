This paper describes the use of an AC-AC matrix converter, as an alternative to back-to-back converters, to inter- face a high-speed micro-turbine generator to a utility load as distributed generation unit. Principals of spatial modulation and IGBT bidirectional switch commutation in matrix converters are reviewed. The two-stage matrix converter presented is controlled by means of a feedback linearization technique and evaluated considering ideal and non-ideal IGBT Models. The assessment considers the input power factor expectations in each configuration, filter parameters accuracy and numerical issues in simulation results.

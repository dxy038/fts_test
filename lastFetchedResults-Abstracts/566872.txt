Nowadays new models have developed that provide us more with evaluating
water resource systems omplications moreover; they are used extensively in
quantitative operation of water resources. Therefor extensive studies have been
done about optimized operation of single reservoir systems.With attention to the
desirable results from optimized operation of single reservoir systems, nowadays
extensive researches about multireservoir systems have been done with more
complexities. So a multireservoir system was studied. One of the modern methods
of optimization is Ga used in this study for optimal operation of a double reservoir
system consisting Golestan and Voshmgir reservoir located in Gorganrood river
basin. Both reservoirs are used to supply agriculture demands of the area,
considering many floods occurred in the understudy area, Golestan reservoir plays
a key role in yearly flood control in the region. So exact calculation of control
volume in this reservoir is very important. To continue the research consists
of:stages of Ga method, study of Gorganrood basin and reservoirs built on this
river, becoming familiar with the goals for building of each reservoir and
calculating control volume in Golestan reservoir through flood routing using hec-5,
introducing continuing equations of doubleb reservoirs system, objective and
penalty functions. Finally analysis of results through charts and graphs and
comparing to real demands was demonstrated that with mutation probability 0.1
and crossover probability 0.8 after 600 generations will have reliability coefficient
of 100% for Golestan reservoir and 85.74% for Voshmgir reservoir.

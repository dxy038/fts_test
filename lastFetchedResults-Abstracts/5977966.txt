Networked sensor systems of large scale are becoming available in the foreseeable future and provide economical and practical solutions for data collection and environment monitoring. Modeling techniques play a crucial role in the creation as well as evaluation of processing and networking algorithms for wireless sensor networks. Unrealistic data and environment models usually lead to inefficient algorithms of poor performance in terms of power consumption and data accuracy. This paper studies advanced modeling techniques for sensor networks, including the modeling of applications and tasks, reality data and sensor measurements, nodes and system composition, communication, environment and deployment, and mobility. The objective is to feature out the architecture and main issues for building more realistic models, in order to improve those commonly used simplified ones in current research

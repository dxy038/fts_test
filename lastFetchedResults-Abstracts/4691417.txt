Control of an inverted pendulum has been a benchmark example in demonstrating and motivating various controller design techniques. This paper makes a study of application of &#956; synthesis with regional pole assignment for stabilizing a double inverted pendulum system with some parametric uncertainties and designs state-feedback controller by solving a multi-objective controller synthesis problem. The researching results of this paper are applied to the inverted pendulum experiment equipment produced by Googol Technology LTD. Simulation results show that the controller has favorable performance in robustness and disturbance rejection.

This paper introduces a reliability optimization model based on the variation of quality. This model is established on the basis of the principle of variation of quality character and multi-objective programming, employing reliability and satisfaction degree of customers as the objective function, cost and schedule as the constraint conditions. So as a whole, this model not only presents a new perspective, but also serves as a strong support for the adjustment and analysis of some parameters during the production as well as for the increase of reliability outside the factory.

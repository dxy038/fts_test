This study was aimed to determine the autobiographical memory problems in obsessive compulsive disorder in comparison to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and healthy people. Method: Three groups of OCD, GAD and healthy people, each group comprising 22 people selected and matched in age, sex, level of education, and marital status were assessed for diagnostic interview by a psychiatrist according to DSM-IV-TR, Yale-brown obsessive compulsive scale, Beck depression Inventory (II), Beck anxiety Inventory, Autobiographical memory interview. Results: The finding indicated that OCD people did worse than the GAD and healthy people. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that some cognitive deficits related to neuropsychological dysfunction seem to be common in OCD rather than GAD and healthy subjects

In developing automatic platooning of trucks as an energy-saving technology, the reliable driving of the platooned trucks is a primary objective for public implementation and future applications. At the same time, there is also an emergency requirement to ensure the safety of the driving experiment in the automatic platooning of trucks, including the conditions of a system failure. This paper presents a detailed experimental study on emergency avoidance braking for the automatic platooning of trucks using a driving simulator (DS) and an actual-vehicle experiment. In addition, a modification on the braking capability of the trucks of a platoon was applied for safety control. Therefore, human drivers can brake without risking a rear-end collision, in the case of an emergency for a failure in automatic platooning. Initially, an experimental platform was built to reproduce the automatic platooning of trucks in an advanced DS system. Assuming system failure and the emergency deceleration of the preceding truck without warning, the behavior of the driver in the following truck was studied in terms of emergency avoidance of a collision. In particular, with different settings for the mean maximum decelerations of the brake system of the following truck, the stopping gap distances and driver reaction times were analyzed in the driving experiment using the advanced DS and an actual vehicle. The experimental results indicated that emergency braking is an effective method for avoiding a rear-end collision when there is a system failure in the automatic platooning, resulting in the mean maximum deceleration for the following truck being higher than that for the preceding truck.

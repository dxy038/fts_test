These days it is necessary to expand a non-barrier transportation environment, but the managerial state of transportation companies is getting worse and worse. Therefore, it is important to measure citizens\Â´ objective "Willingness to Pay (WTP)" for removing barriers. It can be measured objectively through the adoption of the "Contingent Valuation Method" (CVM) in environmental economics. In addition to the typical method of using questionnaires, citizens have wanted "group interview", "senior simulator" and "watching videos which make them understand the effectiveness of improvements" in the process of judgment. We surveyed how these methods affect the objective "Willingness to Pay". From the survey, we found that including "group interview" and "senior simulator" in the process is more effective for recognizing more objective "Willingness to Pay".

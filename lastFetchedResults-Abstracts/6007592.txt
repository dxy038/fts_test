Aiming at the congestion control problems in the TCP networks, this paper presents a responsive active queue management (AQM) algorithm based on the terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). The objective of TSMC is to provide fast response and good stability of the TCP/AQM system. By using the terminal sliding surface and an effective reaching law, the TSMC algorithm performs responsively and robustly in the nonlinear and dynamic TCP networks. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through extensive simulations. The results demonstrate that TSMC is superior to many peer AQM algorithms, and achieves high convergence speed, stable queue length, small queuing jitter and low packet loss.

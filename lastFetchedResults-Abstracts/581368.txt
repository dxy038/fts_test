In spite of humanâ€™s wondrous advances in technology, the earthquake is  still an unpredictable phenomenon that any negligence to how to deal with it may lead to catastrophic damages to the human habitations. Due to the diversity of its topics, urbanism knowledge can play an effective role in decreasing damages of the earthquake. The main objective of this article is to recognize the current problems and difficulties in the common patterns of urban fabric and to find a solution for earthquake-related problems. The methodology of this research is descriptive- inductive and library surveys and includes inductive-modeling. Additionally, modern knowledge of GIS (Geographic Information System) and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) is used along with urbanism criteria to assess the vulnerability of two common patterns of urban fabric including chess and organic fabrics. Results demonstrate that the chess fabric provides better conditions in decreasing earthquake-based damages rather than organic fabric.

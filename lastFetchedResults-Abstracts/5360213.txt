To extend the compensation ability of unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) and suppress the grid current fluctuation at the time of power regulation, a kind of improved UPQC topological structure is proposed. With advantages of high power density, large electrostatic capacity and long cycle life, super capacitors are combined with bidirectional DC/DC converter to compose the energy storage system in parallel with DC-link to keep DC voltage constant and to be used also as a spare UPS. Low frequency mathematical model of the conditioner under dq coordinates based on state-space method is built and non-PLL compensation detecting method is applied. In addition, both the control strategy of voltage and current compensation and energy management schemes of super capacitors are given. This structure provides a new fitting way for UPQC and simulation results show clearly the feasibility.

To meet several power objectives, the idea of organizing DGs into several clusters in a microgrid is proposed in this paper. Power objectives include maintaining active power flow to the main grid at a predetermined level, minimizing the reactive power flow to the main grid and maintaining a unified voltage profile across the microgrid. DGs are organized differently for active and reactive power control. All DGs realize active power objective in one group. As reactive power is used to maintain the unified voltage, DGs are grouped in several clusters to regulate multiple critical point voltages. The closest cluster to the point of common coupling, minimizes the reactive power flow and others manage their reactive power to regulate their critical points. Each cluster has a virtual leader which other DGs follow, utilizing the cooperative control. The cooperative law is also derived, based on the dynamics of the inverters.

Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding regulatory RNAs that
control mRNAs post-transcriptionally. Several mouse stem cells miRNAs are cloned differentially
regulated in different hematopoietic lineages, suggesting their possible role in
hematopoietic lineage differentiation. Recent studies have shown that specific miRNAs
such as Mir-451 have key roles in erythropoiesis.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs)
were infected with lentiviruses containing pCDH-Mir-451. Erythroid differentiation was assessed
based on the expression level of transcriptional factors (Gata-1, Klf-1, Epor) and
hemoglobin chains (?, B, ? , ? and ?) genes using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and presence of erythroid surface antigens (TER-119
and CD235a) using flow cytometery. Colony-forming unit (CFU) assay was also on days
14th and 21th after transduction.
Results: Mature Mir-451 expression level increased by 3.434-fold relative to the untreated
mESCs on day 4 after transduction (P < 0.001). Mir-451 up-regulation correlated with the induction
of transcriptional factor (Gata-1, Klf-1, Epor) and hemoglobin chain (?, B, ?, ? and ?) genes
in mESCs (P < 0.001) and also showed a strong correlation with presence of CD235a and Ter-
119 markers in these cells (13.084- and 13.327-fold increse, respectively) (P < 0.05). Moreover,
mESCs treated with pCDH-Mir-451 showed a significant raise in CFU-erythroid (CFU-E) colonies
(5.2-fold) compared with untreated control group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Our results showed that Mir-451 up-regulation strongly induces erythroid differentiation
and maturation of mESCs. Overexpression of Mir-451 may have the potential to produce
artificial red blood cells (RBCs) without the presence of any stimulatory cytokines.

New residential scale Clean Power Generation (CPG) systems, with DC output (like PhotoVoltaic(PV) or Fuel Cell(FC)) are commonly used to feed loads by converters. This paper presents a multi-input bidirectional DC-AC converter for use in low power applications. The proposed topology is based on boost half-bridges on the primary and a three phase cycloconverter on the secondary side of a high frequency isolation transformer. The boost converter on the primary can increase the dc input voltage that results in a turn ratio reduction of High-Frequency Isolating Link (HFIL) transformer and its inductor reduces the input current ripple too.

Grey correlation analysis enables us to understand the internal changing tendency, mutual relationship and other mechanisms of the system at a higher level through mathematical treatment of the observational data at one level of the system. An easy and simple assessment system for power grid operation security is provided with a calculation method based on grey correlation analysis algorithm. First, assess the quality and rank the power grids and newly-established projects, then analyze the sensitivity relationship of relevant factors influencing the security of power grid operation, based on which the objective weights of indexes are determined. Next, calculate the security index of each section of power grid and their relevance, then calculate the influence of each influencing factor to the security index of each section of power grid, and finally complete the security assessment of interconnected power grid operation.

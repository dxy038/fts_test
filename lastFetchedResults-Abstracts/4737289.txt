Objective quality assessment has been widely used in image processing for decades and many researchers have been studying the objective quality assessment method based on human visual system (HVS). This paper presents a new measure which denotes the perceptual degradation produced in an image using certain subjectively evaluated weighing functions. Experimental analysis when carried out on different sets of images for different levels of data hiding and under different attacks shows that this new measure shows a high degree of acceptance with the subjective analysis measure.

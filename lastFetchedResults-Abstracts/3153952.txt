The objective of this work is the detection and localization of breast cancer by means of microwave imaging using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) techniques. The proposed method consists in detecting the time-of-flight signal backscattered by the tumor using continuous wavelet transform. The feasibility of this method is investigated from several simulated and experimental results using a phantom with a UWB pulsed radar.

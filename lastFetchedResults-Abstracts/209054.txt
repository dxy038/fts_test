Background & Objective: The pathogenesis of appendicitis remains poorly understood.
However there is increasing evidence of involvement of the enteric nervous system in immune
regulation and in inflammatory responses.This study was setup to characterize the status of the
enteric nervous system and mast cells in acute appendicitis with normal and non inflamed
appendix with clinical symptoms
Materials & Methods: In this descriptive study, staining in surgically resected appendixes from
15 patients with histologically proven acute appendicitis (Histologically appendicitis, HA), 15
histologically normal appendix (Histologically norrnal, HN) from patients with a clinical
diagnosis of appendicitis and normal histology,and 15 normal appendixes from patients
undergoing elective abdominal surgery were studied in Shaid Mostafa Khomeyni medical center,
Iran during 2000-01. SIOO-Positive schwann cells and synaptophisin-positive nerve fibers were
evaluated with immunohistochemical staining and mast cells were evaluated with histochemical
staining with Toloiden -blue.The number of nerve fibres, schwann cells and mast cells in each
tissue compartment was measured quantitively with light microscope in 20 microscopic high
power fields. Then the mean number of cells was calculated in each field (x400).
Results: Increased numbers of fibers and schwann cells widely distributed in the Muscularis and
submucosa were seen in the all HA appendixes. Increased numbers of mast cells distributed in
submucosa were seen in the all HA appendixes. A significantly increased number of individually
stained nerve fibers, schwann cells and mast cells were present in HA appendixes compared with
control appendixes (P<0.05).
Conclusion: In this study showed that significant increase in neural components and mast cells
in acute appendicitis indicates the interaction between the nervous system and mast cells in
pathogenesis ofacute appendicitis.

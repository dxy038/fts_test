A great success in semiconductor lasers has been brought by developments in epitaxial growth technology to realize high quality quantum-well structures of precisely controlled thickness and compositions. Further high-performance characteristics, such as low-threshold current and high-efficiency operations, can be attained by adopting quantum-wire and quantum-box structures. To meet this objective, very low-damage fabrication technology of ultra-fine structures with high accuracy is required, and various fabrication methods have been investigated. Latest results on the fabrication processes and lasing properties of quantum-wire and quantum-box lasers are reviewed

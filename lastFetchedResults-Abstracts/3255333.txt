This paper presents a new multi-objective model for distributed generation planning in distribution networks. The proposed model minimizes three objective functions, namely, voltage dissatisfaction, costs and environmental emissions. The short-circuit level of network is considered as a constraint which should not be exceeded by the integration of DG units. Pareto optimal solutions of multi-objective DG planning are found using a particle swarm optimization and a fuzzy method is applied to select the final solution. The proposed method is tested on a 33-bus network and results show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

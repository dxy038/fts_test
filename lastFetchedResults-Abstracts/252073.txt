Surface modifications have a great potential for selective emission and
absorption for applications in photonics, energy conversion, and biosensing.
Pattern-induced radiative property changes can be an important issue
in the manufacturing and diagnostics of microelectronic devices. This work
investigates the polarized diffraction of micromachined silicon wafers. Both
one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) periodic microstructures
are manufactured by plasma-assisted anisotropic etching. The rotating mask
method is used to produce 2.25 × 106 2-D structures in a single sample
(7.5×7.5mm2). Surface topography is characterized by using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM). A bidirectional scatterometer with high accuracy and
angular resolution measures the diffraction patterns from the microstructured
silicon surfaces at a wavelength of 635 nm. The diffraction patterns follow
the grating equation, which are caused by microstructures and their orientations.
Predicted diffraction angles are in excellent agreement with the experimental
results.

The paper presents a multi-objective optimization method for analysing the best mix of renewable and nonrenewable distributed generations (DG) in a distribution network. The method aims at minimising the total cost of the real power generation, line losses and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and maximising the benefits from DG installations over a planning horizon of 20 years. The paper proposes new objective functions that take into account the longevity of DG operations as one of its selection criteria. The analysis utilises the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) for optimization and MATPOWER for solving the optimal power flow problems.

According to the conception of unascertained measure and indices establishment for assessing the expansive soil based on the practical of identification of expansive soil, a new qualitative and quantitative solution method which the synthetic weights of indexes that include both subjective favoritism and objective information was produced to research the assessment of the identification of expansive soil. The indexes functions of unascertained measure of sample sets of expansive soil were established, and a prediction for the classification of expansive soils was carried out using the rules of credible recognition. The result shows that this method is more reasonable, reliable and effective. Therefore, the classification model, reflecting the complexity situation of expansive soil objectively, is effective and available to the classification of the grade of shrink and expansion for the expansive soils.

In this paper, we consider a shared data center (or Web server) with requests from multiple companies: each company with two classes of request: 1) streaming requests and 2) elastic requests. The processing capacity of the Web server is shared by the companies´ requests of the two classes. An analytical model is developed and matrix geometric method is used to derive the system performance measures. A cost model is developed to obtain a request admission control policy that utilizes the Web server´s processing capacity efficiently. The objective is to maximize the revenue of the data center, which is a function of the multiclass request characteristics and the quality of service measures. It is well known that the request characteristics like arrival rates vary dynamically over time. As a consequence, autonomic computing is the only practical way for determining on the fly how to partition the Web server processing capacity over time among the companies.

It is recognized that fracture and wrinkling in sheet metal forming can be eliminated via an appropriate drawbead design. Although deterministic multiobjective optimization algorithms and finite element analysis (FEA) have been applied in this respect to improve formability and shorten design cycle, the design could become less meaningful or even unacceptable when considering practical variation in design variables and noises of system parameters. To tackle this problem, we present a multiobjective robust optimization methodology to address the effects of parametric uncertainties on drawbead design, where the six sigma principle is adopted to measure the variations, a dual response surface method is used to construct surrogate model and a multiobjective particle swarm optimization is developed to generate robust Pareto solutions. In this paper, the procedure of drawbead design is divided into two stages: firstly, equivalent drawbead restraining forces (DBRF) are obtained by developing a multiobjective robust particle swarm optimization, and secondly the DBRF model is integrated into a single-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize geometric parameters of drawbead. The optimal design showed a good agreement with the physical drawbead geometry and remarkably improve the formability and robust. Thus, the presented method provides an effective solution to geometric design of drawbead for improving product quality.

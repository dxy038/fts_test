Power system stabilizer (PSS) is used to damp out local mode oscillations of synchronous generators. PSS are usually designed to provide a proper phase lead which is load dependent. Thus, PSS parameters have to be adjusted at each operating condition. A novel robust PSS design based on Taguchi principle is presented in this paper that can properly function over a wide range of operating conditions and extend the machine loadability. In this approach, signal to noise ratio concept of Taguchi robust design is used to represent the optimization objective and the PSS parameters are searched by genetic algorithm (GA). The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed stabilizer as it is applied to the single machine-infinite bus power system under wide range of loading conditions.

In this paper, we consider delayed bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks (NNs) with Lipschitz continuous activation functions. By applying Young´s inequality and Holder´s inequality techniques together with the properties of monotonic continuous functions, global exponential stability criteria are established for BAM NNs with time delays. This is done through the use of a new Lyapunov functional and an M-matrix. The results obtained in this paper extend and improve previous results.

Pointing at optimization of the distribution transformerÂ´s maintenance based on risk, firstly this paper proposed an equipment failure rate model based on Multi-state Markov process that is suitable for Condition Based Maintenance. And then an age reduction factor is used to modify the failure rate model. A Distribution Transformer Maintenance Optimization Model whose objective function is the minimum of the risk of grid operation is established basically. The model is established from the perspective of maintenance accounting the maintenance risk and failure risk. And a hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the optimized problem. Finally using a case validates the effectiveness of this proposed method.

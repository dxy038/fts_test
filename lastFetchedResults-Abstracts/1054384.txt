The overall objective of the study is to improve our current understanding regarding to the influence of microstructural properties on wear behavior of ceramic–metal composites.

In this study the effect of microstructure variables on wear of multiphase materials is analyzed with reference to WC-, TiC-, and Cr3C2-based ceramic–metal composites (so called cermets). These variables are not limited to matrix grain size and porosity. The grain boundary microstructure and composition plays an important role in wears of heterogeneous materials. Further, the stresses generated by boundary crystallization may determine the tribological behavior of composites. Thermomechanical effects on erosive wear are discussed. Microstructure of each material was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The ways in which composition and microstructure influence the erosive wear are examined. Results indicate that microstructural parameters play an important role in determining wear resistance of composite materials whereas the measured bulk properties seem to be of minor importance.

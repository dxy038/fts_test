The wireless sensor networks are designed to install the smart network applications or network for emergency solutions, where human interaction is not possible. The nodes in wireless sensor networks have to self organize as per the users requirements through monitoring environments. As the sensor nodes are deployed in an inaccessible location for particular mission, it is difficult to exchange or recharge the nodes battery. Hence the important issues to design the sensor network for maximum time duration of network and also for low power operation of the nodes. The proposal is to select the cluster head intelligently using auction data of node i.e. its local battery power, topology strength and external battery support. The network lifetime is the centre focus of the research paper which explores intelligently selection of cluster head using auction based approach. The multi-objective parameters are considered to solve the problem using genetic algorithm of evolutionary approach.

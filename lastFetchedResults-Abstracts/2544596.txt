Background: Opium is an oldest recreational abuse substance with dependency. Small airway diseases (SAD) were established within opium user’s population. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) reflects airway reactivity and inflammation. Opium can induce airway inflammation and following airway reactivity.The objective of the study assessed status of BHR among SAD with regular inhaled opium users. It performed with hypertonic normal saline provocation challenge test.
Methods: Target population enrolled among SAD with inhaled regular opium users. In the next step, standard hypertonic normal saline provocation test carried out on the sample study.
Results: A total of 46 subjects followed the study. The mean age±SD was 50.1±1.2 years, with median 48 years. 91% of those were male. A positive result of BHR was distributed more frequently in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with the asthma phenotype. In addition, it was more market in the youngest and advanced age classes equally.
Conclusion: hypertonic normal saline provocation test result was quite noticeable between regular inhaled opium users. BHR was detected more frequently in COPD with asthma phenotype, COPD, chronic bronchitis, and bronchial asthma disease, respectively. The outcome indirectly revealedthat there was a relation between airway inflammation and opium inhalation in population. It may be reflected an added effect on the predisposing risk factors of induced airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity of airway in target populations.

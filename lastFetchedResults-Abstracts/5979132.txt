We study the multi-objective problem of mapping independent tasks onto a set of computational grid machines that simultaneously minimizes the energy consumption and response time (makespan) subject to the constraints of deadlines and architectural requirements. We propose an algorithm based on goal programming that effectively converges to the compromised Pareto optimal solution. Compared to other traditional multi-objective optimization techniques that require identification of the Pareto frontier, goal programming directly converges to the compromised solution. Such a property makes goal programming a very efficient multi-objective optimization technique. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed technique achieves superior performance compared to the greedy and linear relaxation heuristics, and competitive performance relative to the optimal solution implemented in LINDO for small-scale problems.

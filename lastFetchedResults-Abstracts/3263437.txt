This paper describes an application that was developed for the semantic alarm correlation with the objective of making inferences about alarm correlation. In order to do that we structured the knowledge about industrial processes through the development of a domain ontology, allowing better development of advanced functionality linked to its operation, alarm management, and anomaly diagnosis. The application of semantic alarm correlation was used with a diethanolamine (DEA) treatment unity plant, which is a very important process in the petrochemical processes industry.

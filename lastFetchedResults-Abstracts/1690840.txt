With the objective of reducing the hairiness of short staple spun yarns an air-jet nozzle suitable for an air vortex ring spinning system were designed and fabricated. The performance of the JetRing spinning system on short staple fiber materials and the effects of the different material and machine parameters on the hairiness of JetRing spun yarns, such as nozzle pressure of compressed air, distance between front roller nip and inlet of nozzle, traveller weight, yarn twist and material type were investigated.
In order to estimate the optimum process conditions and to examine the individual effects of each of the controllable factors on a particular response, Taguchiâ€™s experimental design was used. The controllable factors which were considered in this research are blending ratio, nozzle pressure of compressed air, distance between front roller nip and inlet of nozzle and traveller weight. According to the signal to noise ratio analysis, it can be seen that material type and distance between front roller nip and inlet of nozzle have the largest and smallest effect on yarn hairiness, respectively. Factors nozzle pressure of compressed air is second and is followed by factors yarn twist and yarn count. 
The results reveal that the minimum hairiness number will be achieved, when the polyester percent ratio of feeding material increases. 
This result implies too that as air pressure increases, yarn hairiness increases. It may be due to higher disturbance of the fibers in higher air pressure. Also, the distance between front roller nip and nozzle inlet has the weakest effect on yarn hairiness. The results revealed that yarn hairiness increase is minimal for a distance between front roller nip and nozzle inlet (5 cm) and the hairiness increases at short and long distances. Also, an increase in yarn twist and weight causes to minimize the yarn hairiness. 
In addition, the optimum spinning conditions were determined.

Introduction & Objective: The management of mutilated primary incisors in early childhood caries is a clinical challenge. This study's purpose was to compare the resistance strength of 3 different types of posts in restoring broken primary incisors: (1) composite posts, (2) ortho-dontic wire posts and (3) quartz fiber posts.
Materials & Methods: This semi experimental in vitro study was performed on 27 extracted human primary maxillary incisors. The coronal portion of specimens was sectioned 1-mm above the cementoenamel junction. Complete pulpectomy was performed for all specimens. The post space was created using a straight fissure bur approximately 3 mm. Samples were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group 1(composite posts and composite core), group 2(quartz fiber posts and composite core) and group 3 (orthodontic ? wire posts and composite core). Mounted specimens were subjected for    fracture strength on an instron testing ma-chine at 45 angles.
Results: Mean fracture strength value for group 1 was 248.9± 72.36 N, group 2 was 446.7±116.4 N and group 3 was 365.6± 31.3. This result showed significant differences 
among the three groups.
Conclusion: Quartz fiber posts showed greater fracture strength for extensively damaged primary incisors than composite posts and orthodontic wire posts.

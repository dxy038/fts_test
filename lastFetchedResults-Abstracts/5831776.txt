A centroid-based binary weight multiplier (CBWM) switching technique was proposed, which is suitable for full-bridge inverter applications of single-phase induction motor (SPIM) speed control by using 8 bit CBWM to modulate a square single-phase waveform and produce a control signal pattern. This technique was evaluated, and its performance was compared with th existing binary rate multiplier switching technique. The performance evaluation and comparison examined the total harmonic distortion (THD), number of pulses per cycle of the inverter output waveform, and both apparent and reactive power. The objective of the new switching technique is to minimize the THD

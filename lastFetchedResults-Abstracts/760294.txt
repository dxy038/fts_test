The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between the multiple intelligence (verbal, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, physical kinetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, naturalistic), and personality characteristics (extraversion, compatibility, conscientiousness, neuroticism, flexibility) in prediction of the students’ strategic surface and deep learning procedures. The statistical population included 413 human sciences students from Tabriz Payam Noor University. The sampling method was multistage random sampling. The sample size was (283 female and 130 male): to gather the data two questionnaires, namely five main personality factors, the study skills and procedures were used. To analyses the data, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and multiple regression were used. The result showed that there was not significant difference between, verbal, logical- mathematical, spatial, intrapersonal, naturalistic and surface strategic learning procedures. There was significant difference between multiple intelligence components and seep strategic learning procedures. The results of regression analysis showed that the conscientiousness, verbal, and interpersonal (with negative Beta value) were the meaningful predictors of strategic learning procedures. The best predicting factor for surface learning was interpersonal intelligence and openness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, verbal and musical ranked thereafter the predicting for deep learning, variables such as verbal, naturalistic, and conscientiousness (with positive Beta value) were statistically meaningful.

In order to effectively solve the location problem in wireless sensor networks (WSN), a back propagation learning algorithm (BPLA) is presented by exploiting a negative gradient descent method that makes the objective function recognized the parameters in the steepest descent. By this proposed algorithm, the location accuracy of nodes is greatly improved; simulation results show that the BPLA is feasible and effective.

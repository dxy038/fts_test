The authors present the concept and study results of adding fuel cells to provide operational support to photovoltaic (PV) systems. The objective is to determine the capacity credit of PV systems when these are included in the utility generation mix. A capacity expansion study is presented which determines the upper limit of the penetration level of PV energy systems in an electric utility. The applicability of this concept in the short-term operational time frame has been tested using economic dispatch models. This concept has been tested using the observed performance data of a PV facility, and the system data of a typical southeastern US utility. Fuel-cell power plants have been added to the generation mix, and their effect on increasing the penetration level of PV generation is observed, it is seen that after certain penetration level, the net capacity credit for PV systems starts to decrease.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

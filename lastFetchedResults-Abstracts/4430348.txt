The prediction of transmission phenomenon through the building walls is one of the fundamental parts of the ultra wideband (UWB) channel modeling in the indoor propagation environments. Considering the broad variety of the wall materials and the equivalent electric parameters, the need to an accurate method for modeling UWB signal transmission is increased. The objective of this work is to propose an efficient analytical approach for obtaining the transmitted pulse. This method is able to take into account frequency variation of the wall electrical parameters. The accuracy of the proposed method is validated in comparison with some reported results.

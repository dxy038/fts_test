Achieving high Quality of Service (QoS) in routing is one of the major issues to be tackled in VANET. This is primarily due to the interference among vehicles and the objects present within the transmission environment. This also causes rapid degradation in transmitted signal and affects the overall system throughput. As a result, the system performance parameters such as delay, packet drop ratio and efficiency are highly effected. This paper proposes a Cross-Layer Decision Based (CLDB) routing protocol that necessitates to choose the best path for routing the packets to meet promised QoS requirements. The protocol considers the parameters from both PHY and MAC layers to optimise the routing objective. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using extensive computer simulations.

One of the challenges for software development organizations that try to apply software reuse programs is to make the specification, persistence and easy access to the component repository feasible, mainly considering the elaboration phase, but also addressing the construction phase of the software product. This paper uses some component documentation initiatives based on analysis and design patterns, and proposes a component specification structure, presenting a tool to support this process. The general purpose of patterns is to document, retrieve and, mainly, capture composition and functionalities of the components in order to achieve software reuse. The objective of integrating patterns and components approaches is to leverage the software reuse process by creating a documentation structure and applying a component repository able of supporting the software developers.

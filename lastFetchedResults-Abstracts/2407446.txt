Introduction: Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) potentially leads to blindness and low vision in small but significant percentage of infants. Timely referral of the high risk infants is critical to diagnose and treat advanced stages of the disease.
Objective: Evaluation of practice of Guilan province pediatricians about screening criteria for ROP. 
Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, Guilan province pediatricians practice about screening criteria for ROP have been evaluated by face to face method (using a questionnaire).
Results: 78 Cases (78.8%)of the pediatricians participated in this study. 40 Cases (51.3%) considered prematurity alone as the sufficient criterion to refer infant for ROP screening. 38 pediatricians (48.7%) declared one or more risk factors to refer infant for ROP screening. About the appropriate time for screening,7 pediatricians (9%) voted for immediately after birth ,15(19.2%) immediately after hospital discharge, 34 (44.6%) end of 4 weeks of birth,7 (9%) at the end of second months of age, and 8 (10.3%) after 2 months of age. only 21 (26.9%) pediatricians referred infants to the pediatric ophthalmologists or fellow of retina. 69 (88.5%) pediatricians requested for written reports of eye examination of which 47 cases (68.1%) recorded the written reports in medical records of the patients.

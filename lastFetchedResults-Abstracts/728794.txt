We report on a target-based approach to identify possible Mycobacterium tuberculosis DXS inhibitors from the structure of a known transketolase inhibitor. A small focused library of analogs was assembled in order to begin elucidating some meaningful structure–activity relationships of 3-(4-chloro-phenyl)-5-benzyl-4H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-one. Ultimately we found that 2-methyl-3- (4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-4H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-one, although still weak, was able to inhibit M. tuberculosis DXS with an IC50  of 10.6 μM.

Objective
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive CNS disorder due to an insult to
the growing brain, usually occurring in the first two years of life. During the
recent years, its etiology has been changed; perinatal and postnatal insults are
not considered as its main causes in developed countries any more. The aim of
this study was to evaluate the causes of CP in children in southern Iran.
Materials & Methods
Overall, 200 children with CP aged 1-12 yr old referring to Pediatric Neurology
Clinic affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran between
2012 and 2013 were enrolled. In addition, 200 healthy age and sex-matched
children were considered as the control group. Exclusion criteria were isolated
movement disorders with no other evidence of CP, progressive neurologic
disorders, metabolic disorders, and incomplete or uncertain past history. After
collecting the data on pregnancy period, prenatal history and past medical
problems, they were analyzed with appropriate statistical methods.
Results
Maternal age, medical problems during pregnancy period, route of delivery,
head circumference at birth, neonatal admission, neonatal jaundice, and
prematurity were the main risk factors for CP.
Discussion
The distribution of risk factors of CP is different from that of developed
countries in our region. Pre- and peri-natal etiologies are still among the
common causes of CP in Iran.

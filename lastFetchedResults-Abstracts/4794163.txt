This paper presents a new method which generates the uncovered region memory using motion estimation and shows the application of this algorithm for very low bit rate video coding in order to solve the problems of uncovered background region due to the region-based backward motion estimation. The proposed algorithm can be briefly described as this; it detects the changed region by using the information of FD (frame difference) and segmentation, and then as for only this region the backward motion estimation without transmission of shape information is carried out. Therefore, from only motion information the uncovered region background region memory is generated and updated. The contents stored in the uncovered background region memory are referred to whenever the uncovered region comes into existence. The regions with large prediction error are transformed and coded by using DCT. As a result of simulation, the proposed algorithm shows a superior improvement in the subjective and objective image quality as well as a remarkable reduction of transmission error bits

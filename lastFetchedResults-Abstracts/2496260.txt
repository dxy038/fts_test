Objective
Kleineâ€“Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare disorder with an unknown etiology.
Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by various degrees of impairment
in social communication, repetitive behavior and restricted interests. Only four
patients of KLS with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) have been reported so
far. This report presents an 8-year-old girl with history of autistic disorder and
epilepsy that superimposed KLS. Because of the rarity of KLS and related
studies did not address whether autism accounts for a primary or secondary
cause, the area required attention further studies.

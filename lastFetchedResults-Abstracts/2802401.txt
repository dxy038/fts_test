LTE (Long Term Evolution) is a broadband wireless communication specified by the 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) on the way towards fourth-generation mobile. User traffic can be classified into two main classes which are RT (Real Time) and NRT traffic. To respond to RT´s QoS requirements, resource allocation steps must be as optimal as possible. In this paper, we propose a new concept of estimation of reception time to avoid scheduling packets that may eventually be dropped inside their destination. The main objective of this proposition is to reduce radio blocks´ wasting. The behavior of the scheduler has been simulated to check its performance. Simulations prove that the proposed scheme overcome existed schedulers.

Objective: I reviewed my experience with the diagnosis and hysteroscopic treatment of uterine septa. Study Design: This article is a retrospective review of cases from 1992-1999. A septate uterus was diagnosed in a total of 40 patients, and all were treated by hysteroscopic resection. Results: The rate of preoperative pregnancy loss was 77.4%, and the uncomplicated delivery rate was 6.5%. After hysteroscopic septum resection 21 patients reported a total of 22 pregnancies with an 18.2% miscarriage rate and a 77.3% uncomplicated delivery rate. Conclusion: Hysteroscopic treatment of uterine septa is a safe, simple, and effective procedure. It can be used for all types of uterine septa, it attains optimal obstetric outcomes, and it should be undertaken whenever a uterine septum is diagnosed. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:1414-20.)

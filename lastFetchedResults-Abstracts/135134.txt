Methods: This cross-sectional study has been carried out in Qazvin during 2000 - 2001 (academic year). A questionnaire ( including demographic questions and Kolb learning style inventory) was used to gather the data. 195 persons participated in the study by completing the questionnaires data were analyzed by descriptive and chi-square statistical tests.
Findings: Results indicated that most of the students were as assimilator (53.8 %) and the others were converger (28.9 %), diverger (11.2 %), and accomodator (6.1 %). No significant relation was seen between learning styles and academic marks.

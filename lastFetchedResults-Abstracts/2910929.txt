A fully integrated power amplifier using a power cell switching technique, implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology is presented. The main objective of the proposed architecture is to significantly improve the efficiency at high power back-off. To do so, distributed active transformers are used as the splitter, the combiner and the DC bias feed to partition the power requirements among the parallelised power cells. An individual cell can be dynamically turned ON/OFF according to the desired output power. At 2.5 GHz, the measured maximum output power is 28.2 dBm and the power-added efficiency is improved for low level, +3.2 and +4.9% for 18 and 23.7 dBm, respectively.

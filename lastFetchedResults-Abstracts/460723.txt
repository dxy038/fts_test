Background
Silicone has been the standard material for indwelling devices to date. Polyurethane II exhibits properties that makes it suitable as a component of long-indwelling vascular access, with the added advantage of low cost.
Objective

To describe the experience of an intravenous therapy team with 206 polyurethane II catheters used as long-indwelling vascular access in patients with cancer.
Materials and methods

All polyurethane II single- and double-lumen catheters implanted between January 1, 1994, and March 15, 1995, were analyzed, including time of stay and type and rate of infectious and noninfectious complications.
Results

A total of 206 catheters were placed—164 single-lumen and 42 double-lumen catheters—in 190 patients; average stay was 101 days (range, 1-445 days). The infection incidence rate was 0.66 per 1000 catheter-days for single-lumen catheters and 1.6 per 1000 catheter-days for double-lumen catheters. Noninfectious complications included 1 thrombosis (incidence rate, 0.06 per 1000 catheter-days for single-lumen and none for double-lumen catheters), 5 catheter ruptures (2.4%), and 1 pneumothorax (0.48%). Twelve catheters (8.3%) were removed because of complications; only 1 was infectious. The remaining 17 infectious episodes (94.4%) were resolved without catheter removal. Our complication rate with single-lumen catheters in this series was similar to our previous experience with a nontunneled silicone catheter.
Conclusions

Our findings indicate that polyurethane II catheters have proven useful and safe as long-indwelling vascular access in patients with cancer at our hospital at a considerably lower cost

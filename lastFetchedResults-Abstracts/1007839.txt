During a long process of change and evolution , Persian painting has been able to achieve codified aesthetic principles( in representation of both space and architecture ) including:
1. The conceptual and symbolic depiction of architectural elements.
2. The presence of all the recognition components of a building together.
3. The role of architecture as the painting background.
4. The use of Iranian architecture arrays and design.
5. The use of multi-scene tradition.
Such innovative principles fully emerge in sani-ol molks illustrated version of one thousand and one nights. Based on the accomplished analyses , the book is the most voluminous Iranian decorated one and then it could be referred to as the reglection of the latest efforts made to maintain the Persian painting traditions.
The recent approach can be taken into consideration as the result of a change in the painters objective attitudes to rather subjective ones which are highly influenced by the western painters views and artistic methods, sani-ol molk could become familiar with during his travels to Europe.
It seems
1. The concrete or realistic representation of architectural elements.
2. No representation of whole architecture structures and elements
3. Considering the architectural space as an objective place. 
4. Changing the architectural arrays and designs.

The research result have been based on the case study analyses and then one hundred cases have been taken among all sani-ol molks  paintings in the illustrated version of one thousand and one nights. Data collection is librarical , along with referring to case studies.

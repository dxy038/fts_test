In this paper, we propose an effective upgrading algorithm in incremental planning for optical networks. This algorithm integrates making full use of existent available resource with upgrading capacity. Our objective is to minimize the newly added resource in the network. The Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is presented. Since the ILP formulation is not adapted for large-scale network, a novel fast heuristic algorithm called Minimal Upgrading Resource (MUR) is proposed and evaluated. Computer simulation results show the MUR can achieve the performance near to the ILP results, and performs better than other two proposed approaches.

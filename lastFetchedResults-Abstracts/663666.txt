Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used extensively as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in textiles, upholstery and electronics. They are ubiquitous contaminants in wildlife and humans. A low concentration of nonabrominated diphenyl ethers (nonaBDEs) is present in commercial DecaBDE and they are also abiotic and biotic debromination products of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209). The objective of the present work was to develop methods for synthesis of the three nonaBDEs, 2,2′,3,3′,4,4′,5,5′,6-nonabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-206), 2,2′,3,3′,4,4′,5,6,6′-nonabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-207) and 2,2′,3,3′,4,5,5′,6,6′-nonabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-208), with the intention of making them available as authentic standards for analytical, toxicological and stability studies, as well as studies regarding physical–chemical properties. Two methods were developed, one based on perbromination of phenoxyanilines and the other via reductive debromination of BDE-209 by sodium borohydride followed by chromatographic separation of the three nonaBDE isomers formed. An additional nonabrominated compound, 4′-chloro-2,2′,3,3′,4,5,5′,6,6′-nonabromodiphenyl ether (Cl-BDE-208), was also synthesized in the present work. Cl-BDE-208, prepared by the perbromination of 4-chlorodiphenyl ether, may be used as an internal standard in analysis of highly brominated diphenyl ethers. BDE-206, BDE-207, BDE-208 and Cl-BDE-208 were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, electron ionization mass spectra and by their melting points. The structures of all three nonaBDEs have been characterized previously by X-ray crystallography.

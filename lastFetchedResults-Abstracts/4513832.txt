The acquisition of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) at spatial resolutions higher than those of the present methods relying on inversion of coarse-scale passive microwave observations is a possible application for space-borne SAR imagery. The presented experimental campaign NoSREx (Nordic Snow Radar Experiment) was initiated to contribute to the knowledge of snowpack backscattering and emission properties, in particular, to help develop methods to retrieve SWE from high-resolution two-frequency SAR observations (at X and Ku band). Another objective was to provide data for studies exploring the synergistic use of active and passive microwave observations for monitoring of snow properties. The NoSREx campaign began in November 2009, and has recently concluded a second winter period of observations.

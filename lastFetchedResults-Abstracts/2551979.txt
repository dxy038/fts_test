Background and Objective: Different morphologies are factors for the effectiveness of training programs on subjects. The aim of this study was the effect of 8-week Tai Chi exercise on static and dynamic balance in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) with emphasis on mesomorph and endomorph's morphology.

Materials and Methods: In a clinical trial, 48 patients with MS were purposefully selected. Then, patients were randomly divided into two groups of 24 patients (Tai Chi and control groups) with two sub-groups (12 subjects) mesomorph and endomorph's morphology. Biodex balance system meter was used to measure the subjects' balance. Then, the experimental groups did Tai exercises for 8 weeks. To analyze the results, multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) at a significant level of P < 0.05 was used.

Results: The outcome showed that static balance and dynamic balance between the experimental and control groups was significant different. Effectiveness of Tai Chi exercise on the static balance in patients with endomorph's morphology was better than patients with mesomorph's morphology, which means the effectiveness of these exercise on static balance endomorph's morphology. However, endomorph's morphology as compared to mesomorph's morphology had more improvement regarding dynamic balance, but there was no significant difference for dynamic balance in the mesomorph and endomorph's morphology. 

Conclusion: According to the results of this study, Tai Chi exercises are effective intervention for improving the static and dynamic balance in patients with MS with mesomorph and endomorph's morphology and the effect of this practice on balance endomorph's morphology is more than balance mesomorph's morphology.

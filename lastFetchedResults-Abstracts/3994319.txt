The traditional goals of the floorplanning process for a new integrated circuit have been minimizing the total chip area and reducing the routing cost, i.e., the total length of the interconnecting wires. Recently, it has been shown that, for certain types of chips, the floorplan can affect the yield of the chip as well. Consequently, it becomes desirable to consider the expected yield, in addition to the cost of routing, when selecting a floorplan. The goal of this paper is to investigate the two seemingly unrelated, and often conflicting, objectives of yield enhancement and routing complexity minimization. We analyze the possible trade-offs between the two and then present a constructive algorithm for incorporating yield enhancement as a secondary objective into the floorplanning process, with the main objective still being the minimization of the overall routing costs

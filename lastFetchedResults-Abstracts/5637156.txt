Community detection in complex networks has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Community detection can be viewed as an optimization problem, in which an objective function that captures the intuition of a community as a group of nodes with better internal connectivity than external connectivity is chosen to be optimized. Many single-objective optimization techniques have been used to solve the problem however those approaches have its drawbacks since they try optimizing one objective function and this results to a solution with a particular community structure property. More recently researchers viewed the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and many approaches have been proposed to solve it. However which objective functions could be used with each other is still under debated since many objective functions have been proposed over the past years and in somehow most of them are similar in definition. In this paper we use Genetic Algorithm (GA) as an effective optimization technique to solve the community detection problem as a single-objective and multi-objective problem, we use the most popular objectives proposed over the past years, and we show how those objective correlate with each other, and their performances when they are used in the single-objective Genetic Algorithm and the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm and the community structure properties they tend to produce.

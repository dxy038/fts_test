The compulsory acquisition of land is a process by which the government acquires from
private landowners their lands which are needed for any public purpose or for a purpose
beneficial to the economic development of Malaysia. It is a form of governmental
interference as it results in the deprivation and removal of landowners from their properties.
Many of the waqf lands donated by an individual or a group for the purpose of charity
have been acquired by the government for this purpose. The objective of this paper is
to compare two methods of rectifying damages for the loss namely ‘compensation’ and
‘substitution’. The study adopts qualitative methodology where data is collected through
library research and semi-structured interviews with key informants. The paper employs
descriptive analysis and concludes that the waqf or donated land will not be taken by
the authority without reasonable grounds, but only in critical situations and during
emergency.

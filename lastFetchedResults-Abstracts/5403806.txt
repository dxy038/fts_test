LORAMbis is the experimental part of a joint research program between Sweden and France. The objective is to evaluate the performance of low frequency bistatic SAR for clutter suppression in various applications, e.g. under-foliage target detection or mapping of urban scenes. The airborne bistatic SAR data are acquired using the VHF/UHF component of the ONERA SAR system SETHI and the VHF/UHF LORA system operated by FOI. The first data collection campaign was conducted in December 2009. Focused bistatic SAR images have been formed and indicate that the implemented synchronization method is sufficient. It is based on a GPS disciplined 10 MHz reference signal that is generated in both systems.

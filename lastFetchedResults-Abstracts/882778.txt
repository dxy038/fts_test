In this research work, Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is studied how to participate in the energy market, reactive power market and coupled energy and reactive power market. The PHEV capability curve is identified which have been recently presented in the related work in the area. The concept Lost Opportunity Cost (LOC) is explained based on the capability of PHEV and its application is fully taken into consideration. Then PHEV is included in energy, reactive and coupled market. This require to determine objective functions in each market. Finally a 17-node microgrid is taken as case study in which some of PHEVs are placed to take part in these markets.

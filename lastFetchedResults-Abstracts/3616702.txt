A novel approach to the development of a software application package for solving partial differential equation (PDE) problems is described. The approach is based on the observation that the fundamental parts of most of the authors´ current application packages have common features. The objective is to develop a PDE package generator that automates the systematic part of the package creation process, reducing the time and effort involved in creating new PDE packages. The structure of the package generator, MAMMY, and a package that has been generated using it are presented. The package generator input language, called the Package Designer Language (PDL), is described, and a summary of its concepts is provided. An example of parts of the package designer´s input for dealing with an eddy current problem is given

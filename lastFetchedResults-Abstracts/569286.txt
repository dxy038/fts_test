Abstract
Background and objective: According to high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in societies and public attention to using complementary medicine in disease treatment, this survey be accomplished with the purpose validating effects of Tribulus terrestris Extract , Allium schoenoprasum extract and Walnut leaves aqueous extract on serum glucose of diabetic rates in comparison of Glibenclamide.   
Methods: In this exprimental study, 72 male wistar Rats (250-300 g) were divided into 6 groups equally and at the same maintenance condition. strptozotosin (60mg/kg) was used for diabetes induction 2-6 groups and then feed all of groups with usual food and water freely and we give them the Tribulus terrestris Extract, Allium schoenoprasum and Walnut leaves aqueous extract, mixture of 3 extracts and Glibenclamide orderly and daily after 72 hour in 2-6 groups additional food and water. serum glucose were determined before the study, and at 1th and 4th weeks after the study. 
Results: serum glucose was significantly lower in diabetic Rats of 2-6 groups(P < 0.001) but Walnut leaves aqueous extract had maximum effects (P=0.002). Also the results show that using mixture of 3 extract wont have more effects on decreasing serum glucose.
Conclusion: In spite of better effects of Walnut leaves aqueous extract on serum glucose rather than Tribulus terrestris Extract and Allium schoenoprasum, we can use them just as complemented common Diabetic medicine . Also not only consume more than one medicine can have better effect on control of serum glucose but also due to medicinal mixed and inconsistent effects

Gas turbine aerodynamic shape optimization has been the subject of several
numerical studies in the past decades. In this research, numerical optimization of a one
stage axial turbine is considered. A practical and eective optimization method to improve
eciency and/or pressure ratio of the axial turbine is presented. Particular modications
are accomplished with a limited number of optimization parameters, by stator and rotor
blades re-staggering. A three-dimensional numerical model has been prepared and veried
through experimental data, which are obtained from the reference gas turbine engine test
rig. Coupling the veried numerical simulation solver and genetic algorithm, the eects of
stator and rotor stagger angle distributions on the turbine performance are investigated.
The optimization is carried out at the turbine design operating condition. To accelerate
the GA convergence rate, the numerical mesh sizes are rened in each generation. As a
result, the overall computational time decreases by 20%. Dening two objective functions,
this optimization approach resulted in the turbine stage isentropic eciency improvement
of 0.85% and 0.86%, in the rst and second objective functions, respectively.

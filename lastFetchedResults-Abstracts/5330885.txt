The emerging paradigm of grid computing provides a powerful platform for the optimisation of complex computer models, such as those used to simulate real-world logistics and supply chain operations. This paper introduces a grid-based optimisation framework that provides a powerful tool for the optimisation of such computationally intensive objective functions. This framework is then used in the optimisation of maintenance scheduling strategies for fleets of aero-engines, a computationally intensive problem with a high-degree of stochastic noise

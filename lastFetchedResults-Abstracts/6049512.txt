Three modifications to the normal-mesh-based image coder of Jansen, Baraniuk, and Lavu are proposed, namely, the use of a data-dependent base mesh, an alternative representation for normal/vertical offsets, and a different scan-conversion scheme based on bicubic interpolation. Experimental results show that our proposed changes lead to improved coding performance in terms of both objective and subjective image quality measures.

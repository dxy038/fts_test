The main objective of this project is to construct a phased array antenna with a steerable beam (manually if need be) having a center frequency of 2.45 GHz and a bandwidth in the range of 100 MHz. The phase shifting of the elements is accomplished using time-delayed feeds to the individual antennas via coaxial cables. This documentation depicts the design, simulation, fabrication and analysis of a two-dimensional planar phased array antenna using the quadrifilar helical antenna (QHA) as the element of choice.

Background
Undergraduate medical education in the United States is changing. Many medical schools have developed a set of basic clinical skills (BCS) that all students are required to have mastered; however, very few have acquired objective information regarding specific student experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the BCS encounters for junior medical students at a large midwestern university utilizing a handheld personal digital assistant (PDA).
Methods

A core curriculum of BCS was proposed and involved 52 procedures/skills. An electronic BCS database was developed utilizing HanDBase software and then placed on a PDA (Palm) and distributed to 25 third-year medical students randomly as they entered their clinical year. Students logged their skill encounters for 9 months and then electronically transferred the database by e-mail.
Results

Students participated in 1,115 procedural/skill encounters (range 17 to 90; median 41; average 44.6). Of the 52 core BCS, all students performed 10. Fewer than 50% of students had any exposure to very common skills. Thirty-four percent of skill encounters occurred at a county hospital, 19% at a clinic, 10% at a university hospital, 10% at a private hospital, 7% at a VA hospital, 4% at a childrenâ€™s hospital, and 16% at miscellaneous locations.
Conclusions

The PDA devices were simple and convenient to use, while allowing for easy transfer and tabulation of database information by electronic mail. Significant gaps in BCS exposure were noted across the curriculum. Mentor sign-off on the PDA permitted early feedback opportunities. We can now begin to reward educators for skills mentoring and perform formal assessment of BCS within specific clerkships to enhance future educational objectives.

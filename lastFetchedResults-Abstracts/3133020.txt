A simple technique for measuring fiber parameter distribution of the pure silica core fiber using a conventional OTDR is proposed. This technique is based on the relationships among fiber parameters and the bidirectional OTDR technique. The fiber parameter distributions are successfully evaluated for a silica core fiber link.

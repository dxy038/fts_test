Objective
estigate the relationship between concentration of fluoride in milk and its re-mineralizing efficacy, and to test whether increasing the volume of fluoridated milk has any effect on its re-mineralizing efficacy.
s
molars were painted leaving a 1 mm window on the buccal and/or lingual surfaces. Artificial carious lesions were induced using a de-mineralizing solution. The teeth were then sectioned longitudinally. Specimens were randomly assigned to 15 groups according to different concentrations and volume; i.e. 2.5 ppm, 5 ppm, 7.5 ppm, 10 ppm, 15 ppm, 20 ppm, and 250 ppm of fluoride with 25 ml/section and 50 ml/section. De-ionized water and plain milk were used as controls. Sections were subjected to pH cycling for 20 days. Polarized light microscopy and micro-radiography were utilized to record the lesion characteristics before and after pH cycling.
s
esion depths decreased significantly in all the fluoride groups, and increased significantly in the control groups. There were no differences in percentage of lesion depth decrease when the volume was doubled for the same fluoride concentration. There were also no statistically significant differences between percentages of decrease in lesion depth when the concentration of fluoride in milk was increased.
sion
dated milk demonstrated a remineralization efficacy on early enamel carious lesions. A 2.5 ppm fluoride milk concentration provided similar remineralization potential to that of higher fluoride concentration in milk.

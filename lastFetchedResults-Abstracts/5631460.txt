The objective of this paper is to present a basic consideration to synthesize complex wave digital filters (CWDF´s) for a spectral density given by a one-dimentional, stationary, time discrete, complex process that can be represented by a rational positive function with complex coefficients defined by Belevitch. CWDF´s are composed of complex multipliers, complex adders and delay units. This paper describes (I) the relationship among incident waves and reflect waves for a circuit with complex impedances, (II) complex commensurate transmission line networks (CCTL networks), which are composed of complex unit elements, complex gyrators, complex ideal transformers and resistors, and (III) the correspondence between CWDF´s and CCTL networks.

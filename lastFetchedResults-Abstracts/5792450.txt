The objective of this paper is to provide an appraisal of the recent advances in MOSFET compact modeling using the surface potential based approach. MOSFET technology has been at the forefront of the digital and analog circuits for very large scale integration. As a result, development of accurate and efficient MOSFET models becomes critical. The surface potential based models not only lead to a more clear understanding of MOSFET device physics but also provide a better platform to develop an advanced model for circuit simulation. These core models can in general be categorized into either iterative or closed form approximate solutions, but some basic similarities do exist among some of the models developed from the two different approaches. Core compact surface potential based models are discussed and a comparison in terms of accuracy and complexity is presented.

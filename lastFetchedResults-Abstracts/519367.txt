Identifying drought tolerant maize hybrids to produce higher yields under water deficit conditions is of special importance. To achieve this objective, several promising single cross maize hybrids were evaluated in a split plot experiment arranged in RCBD under three levels of water deficit. Plants were imposed to water stress at vegetative stage (6-8 leaf stage) and, thus, irrigated after 50, 100, and 150 millimeters of water evaporated from a class A evaporation pan. Irrigation levels were assigned to main plots and hybrids to subplots. Analysis of variance of data collected indicated significant differences among hybrids for the traits studied. Using drought tolerance indices like GMP, MP and STI it was found that hybrid number 400 was the most drought tolerant one and produced highest seed yield , both under water stress and non - stress conditions .

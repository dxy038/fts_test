The Remote Experiment Monitoring and Control (REMOT) project objective is to develop a system architecture to allow remote control of scientific experiments and facilities that require real time operation and multimedia information feedback, using available or deploying communications infrastructure. Representatives from two user communities participate in the project: the astronomical community, which usually has telescopes located at far places-such as islands and/or mountains- and the plasma physics community, that is concentrating the experimental facilities in a few places in order to save costs. In this paper we review the underlying networking technologies considered, and summarize the results on the ATM based pilot studies we have carried out in the last two years. Particularly we present results from experiments on Switched Virtual Circuits (SNC) tunneling and video on ATM

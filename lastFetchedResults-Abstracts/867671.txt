This paper presents the fuzzy job shop scheduling problem with availability constraints. The objective is to
find a schedule that maximizes the minimum agreement index subject to periodic maintenance, nonresumable
jobs and fuzzy due-date. A random key genetic algorithm (RKGA) is proposed for the problem,
in which a novel random key representation, a new decoding strategy incorporating maintenance operation
and discrete crossover (DX) are used. RKGA is applied to some fuzzy scheduling problem with availability
constraints and compared with other algorithms. Computational results show that RKGA performs
better than other algorithms.

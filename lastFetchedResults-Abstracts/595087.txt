Objective: To compare the conventional method of tonsillectomy, the dissection snare method with that of the newer procedure, bipolar electrodissection method.Material and Methods: We studied 200 cases in two groups, hundred in each. In the first group the patients underwent tonsillectomy by dissection-snare method and in the second by electrodissection method. The results of the two groups were studied regarding the time taken in the procedure, blood loss during the procedure, postoperative analgesia required, reactionary hemorrhage, postoperative diet toleration and secondary hemorrhage.Results: The average operation time was 14.2 minutes for diathermy group and 35 minutes for the dissection-snare group. Regarding the postoperative diet taken and reactionary heamorrhage the bipolar diathermy method is better, but there is no significant difference regarding the postoperative analgesia, postoperative pain and secondary hemorrhage.Conclusion: We concluded that bipolar electrodissection (diathermy) method is the superior method regarding the time taken during the procedure, the intra operative blood loss was lower and there was no need of ties (ligating the bleeding vessels) in the diathermy method.

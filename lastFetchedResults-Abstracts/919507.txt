There is an increased interest in the extraction of nucleic acids from various environmental samples, since molecular techniques allow less biased access to a greater portion of uncultivable microorganisms. Two strategies have been developed to improve DNA recovery in terms of yield, purity and unbiased representation of the microbial diversity. The first approach consists of the direct extraction of nucleic acids from soil through in situ cell lysis followed by DNA purification. The alternative approach is based on the separation of bacteria from the soil particles followed by cell lysis and then DNA purification. Several published methods describe the recovery of highly purified nucleic acids that are well-suited for molecular purposes even though a new challenge concerns the recovery of large bacterial DNAs essential for functional investigation of gene clusters and biosynthetic pathways. This review presents an overview of the available methods to achieve this challenging objective.

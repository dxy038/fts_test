This work presents a low-complexity post-processing deblocking filter to reduce the blocking effects. The proposed algorithm can be applied to current block-based video standards without modifications. The proposed algorithm automatically detects blocking effects at 4&#215;4 or 8&#215;8 block boundaries. In the filtering stage, the proposed algorithm provides four filter modes to eliminate the effects of blocking in various frequency regions based on region activity analysis. To improve both subjective and objective qualities, the proposed algorithm also considers the chrominance filter. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides higher-quality MPEG-4 and H.264/AVC reconstructed video sequences with a lower processing time, than many approaches.

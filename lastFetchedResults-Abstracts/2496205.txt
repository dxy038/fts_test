<p><strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of study was to develop a rapid assay, dye labelled monoclonal antibody assay (DLMAA), using non-radioactive organic synthetic dyes for identification of Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 (TSST-1) producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> The assay protocol required only two simple steps; addition of TSST-1 antigen to a nitrocellulose membrane and then adding a colloidal dye labelled antibody (D/A) suspension detection reagent.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: The sensitivity and specificity of the assay was determined relative to positive and negative strains compared to an ELISA assay. Overall 100% agreement was found between both assays. The sensitivity for detection of TSST-1 was 30 ng.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The DLMAA did not require handling and disposal of radioactive materials. It is a rapid qualitative technique for detection of TSST-1 toxin at room temperature within a short time.</p>

In the process of elicitation of requirements appear two kinds of problems, the essential and the accidental, and to confront them have been proposed several elicitation techniques. In this revision work is analyze and evaluate these techniques, is presents a comparative review study of techniques, and is assumed to elicitation as the first phase in requirements engineering. The objective to point differences, similarities, advantages and disadvantages, also it presents a matrix that offers to the requirements engineers a context through which they can select a method to elicit requirements for each particular problem.

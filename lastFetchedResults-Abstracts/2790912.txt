Wireless Mesh Networks(WMNs) are evolving as an avenue for low-cost broadband wireless access networks. In WMN routers that are generally equipped with multiple radios. There are several challenges posed by WMN, here we look at Channel Assignment(CA) which influences capacity of WMN network. A solution to Channel Assignment problem must aim to improve network capacity by minimizing interference and retaining connectivity. In this paper we propose a novel CA algorithm named Topology-aware Contributory Load based CA (TCLCA). TCLCA addresses the objective of minimizing aggregate contributory load in the network yet preserving topology. The TCLCA uses `Contributory LoadÂ´ to efficiently prioritize links based on expected load and interference. The performance evaluation of TCLCA is carried over ns-2 and is compared with an existing load aware CA algorithm and a load unaware CA algorithm. The TCLCA demonstrates improvement in terms of performance metrics throughput, delay and packet delivery ratio.

ABSTRACT: To clarify the meaning of Wittgenstein's realism, we will express the theories of Phillips and Winch who were strongly influenced by Wittgensteinâ€™s beliefs in this paper and will show that reality is not something beyond the language by providing evidences of Wittgenstein's speech. What is the real and what is not real get their forms in the language; and religious and theological statements for which evidences of any reference to objective reality does not apply. These statements provide the religious and theological images which indicate their importance is not because of caring about anything or saying something, but their importance lies in their role to play in the religious life.

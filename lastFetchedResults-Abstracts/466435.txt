Objective: We characterized new infertility patients on the basis of race and economic factors. Study Design: A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients seeking infertility evaluation from 1998 to 1999 at two infertility centers in Cincinnati, Ohio. Patients were categorized by race (white, black, or other). Statistics were analyzed by Ï‡2 and logistic regression. Results: Of 756 patients, 85.2% were white, 10.2% were black, and 4.4% were other. Infertility diagnoses were placed into the following 7 categories: ovarian, salpingitis, surgical sterilization, male factor, endometriosis, unexplained, and other. Black women had significantly more salpingitis than did nonblack women (P< .001) regardless of insurance status. However, surgical sterilization was more prevalent in patients without insurance regardless of race (P< .001). Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that black women have more risk factors for salpingitis. Surgical sterilization risk factors were concordant with those of the National Center for Health Statistics. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:1080-2.)

In this correspondence, the objective is to segment vector
images, which are modeled as multivariate finite mixtures. The underlying
images are characterized by Markov random fields (MRFâ€™s), and the
applied segmentation procedure is based on the expectation-maximization
(EM) technique. We propose an initialization procedure that does not
require any prior information and yet provides excellent initial estimates
for the EM method. The performance of the overall segmentation is
demonstrated by segmentation of simulated one-dimensional (1-D) and
multidimensional magnetic resonance (MR) brain images.

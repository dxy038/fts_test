Optimal quality control of drying process of baker's yeast in large scale batch fluidized bed dryer is presented using neural network based models and modified genetic algorithm (GA). The objective of this study is to determine optimal conditions to maximize product quality while minimizing energy consumption. For this purpose, the drying process and quality models based on neural network with delay units are combined for predicting the dry matter, product temperature, change in dry matter and the quality loss while minimizing energy consumption and this model is then used for optimal quality control. A stochastic method based optimization structure is designed in order to solve the optimization problem whose the objective function is discontinuous, non-differentiable, complex and highly non-linear. The results obtained by optimal quality control based on modified GA showed that the performance of the existing industrial scale drying process was improved. The constructed optimal quality control structure is very convenient for the production process applications and may be applied without too much modification.

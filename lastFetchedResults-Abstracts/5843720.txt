Security issues are become more and more important in network application. This paper proposed an application of distance learning which integrated with citizen digital certificate (CDC) public key infrastructure (PKI), including the grade uploading, student information inquiring, and electronic documentation flow control. We integrated a tracking and persistent agent-based mobility management system in the case of distance learning. The main purpose of this system is addressed to achieve the universal access objective. We addressed to solve the problems in case of the data transferring in the network, such as eavesdropping, snooping, modification, masquerading and repudiation. And this would improve the efficiency of entire computerize procedure of electronic campus policy totally which in the following projects: Grade Processing System And Governmental Autographing System, etc. Especially, the Grade Uploading System was the first time to integrate with CDC. This experience was very important to integrate/generate the most secured application system in the Distance Learning.

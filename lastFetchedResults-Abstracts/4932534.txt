This paper proposes a new method based on multiple attribute decision making to search for the optimal parking space in a parking lot. The advantages and limits of different kinds of property weights are investigated in this paper. By improving the limits of subjective weight and combining subjective weight with objective weight, we get an integrated weight. Using this hybrid weight, we introduce how to apply multiple attribute decision making to search for the optimal parking space. Experiments show that this method has a satisfying performance and can find the real-time optimal parking space. The proposed method can be applied to city parking guidance and information system.

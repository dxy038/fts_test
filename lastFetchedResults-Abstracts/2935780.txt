Multiway Decision Graphs (MDGs) have been recently proposed as an efficient representation of Extended Finite State Machines (EFSMs), suitable for automatic hardware verification of Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs. We report here on the results of our research into automatic partitioning of state transition relations described using MDGs. The objective is to achieve the maximum possible performance during an abstract implicit state enumeration procedure that is at the basis of our automatic verification method

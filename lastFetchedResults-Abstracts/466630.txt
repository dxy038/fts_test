Objective: Our purpose was to investigate the contribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion-deletion polymorphism in the development of obstetric complications. Study Design: In a retrospective case-control study, angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion-deletion polymorphism was investigated in a control group of healthy women (n = 115) and in a group of women diagnosed with preeclampsia (n = 133) and obstetric cholestasis (n = 57). Polymerase chain reaction detection of insertion-deletion polymorphism was used to determine the presence of the two angiotensin-converting enzyme alleles in the groups; the frequencies in the general population in our area are presented for comparison. Results: The frequency of the D allele was 43.9% among women with obstetric cholestasis and 27% among healthy fertile women, which is close to the rate in the general population in our area (28%). The odds ratio for obstetric cholestasis associated with the DD genotype was 2.12 (95% CI, 1.08-4.12) compared with the pooled II and ID genotypes (P = .03). Neither the ID genotype distributions nor the allele frequencies differed significantly between preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies (P = .36). Conclusion: The present data indicate that the DD genotype is a genetic marker associated with an elevated risk of obstetric cholestasis, but this polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene is unlikely to play any significant role in preeclampsia.

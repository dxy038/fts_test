E-field probes used for measurement of worker exposure are usually calibrated in continuous wave (CW) conditions. For many types of probe, the response in realistic environments (modulated signals, multi-frequency and pulsed signals) differs from the response to CW conditions. However, to fully characterize a field probe in all possible environments would be an infinite task. In this paper we consider the effect of multiple CW signals and of several common communications formats on the indication given by a field probe with the objective of identifying simple tests which could act as a predictor of the performance alteration in non-CW environments.

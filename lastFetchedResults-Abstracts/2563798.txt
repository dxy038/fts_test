Objective(s): The present study aims to evaluate the protective effect of the compounds isolated from Echinophora cinerea (E. cinerea) against oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by cisplatin (CIS) in PC12 cells. Materials and Methods: Six compounds were isolated as quercetrin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (QUE), osthol (OST), verbenone-5-O-β-D-glycopyranoside (VER), Isoimperatorin (ISO), kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (KAM), and echinophorin B (ECH). For this study, we used MTT reduction assay for detection of protective effects of isolated compounds on CIS-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. The effects of isolated compounds against apoptosis induced by CIS were investigated through the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), Bax and Bcl2 mRNA expression, and caspase-3 activation. We also assessed oxidative stress by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation with 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Results: Treatment of cells with QUE and OST before exposure to the CIS increased cell viability, i.e., these compounds protected the cells against CIS -induced cytotoxicity. In addition, pre-treatment with QUE and OST decreased CIS-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of Bcl-2, inhibition of caspase-3 activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) increase. OST decreased ROS generation induced by CIS, as well. Conclusion: Our in vitro experiment showed that QUE and OST are apoptotic inhibitors that effectively block CIS-induced neurotoxicity predicting their therapeutic potential in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.

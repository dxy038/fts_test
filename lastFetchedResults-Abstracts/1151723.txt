The objective of this study is to develop a rigid-thermoviscoplastic finite element program for the analysis of orthogonal cutting process. Deformation of the workpiece is considered as rigid-viscoplastic and the numerical solution is obtained from the coupled analysis between plastic deformation and temperature fields. The chip and burr formation are simulated for the non-steady-state orthogonal cutting using the developed program. To validate the program the predicted results at the chip and burr formation stage are compared with the published ones. The results of this study are in close agreement with the published ones. The case of isothermal cutting process is also considered to study the thermal effect on the machining process.

Introduction: Contamination of the ecosystems by entrance of industrial and agricultural pollutants in to the rivers has been of major recent concern. Heavy metals accumulate in the beds of rivers, lakes and seas, food chain and ultimately in human body. Their bloaccumulation in reproductive organs could exert delterious effects on spermatogenesis and sperm morphology.
Objective: This study was conducted to examine the motility parameters disturbances due to zinc and cadmium exposure.
Materials and Methods: Sperm exposed with different concentrations of zinc, cadmium and Combiration zinc and cadmium and sperm motility parameters were checked by computer assisted sperm analysis.
Results: Cadmium, even at 50 ppm concentration affected sperm motility while zinc had toxic effect on sperm in 1000 ppm and more concentration. The interestiry Points that in Sperm incubation with zinc and cadmium simul taneaovsly, zinc has protective effect against cadmium which compensates toxic effects of cadmium against Sperm.
Conclusion: The results confirmed that part of heavy metals toxicities on sperm could be due to changes in motility parameters and so the sperm cannot swim, find and fertilize ovum.

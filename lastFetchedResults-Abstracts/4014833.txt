Different coding schemes introduce different artifacts to the decoded pictures, making it difficult to design an objective quality model capable of measuring all of them. A feasible approach is to design a picture-quality model for each kind of known distortion, and combine the results from the models according to the perceptual impact of each type of impairment. In this letter, a multi-metric model comprising of a perceptual model and a blockiness detector is proposed, designed for MPEG video. Very high correlation between the objective scores from the model and the subjective assessment results has been achieved

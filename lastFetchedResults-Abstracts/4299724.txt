The paper presents the current state of research on developing a computer-assisted surgical trainer to be used in a minimally-invasive surgery training program. Along with wide adoption of laparoscopic surgery a strong need for systematic training in the field of minimally-invasive surgery has developed. The goal of the described system is to provide surgeons specialising in minimally-invasive operating techniques an objective performance evaluation method and a safe setting for practicing elementary laparoscopic skills.

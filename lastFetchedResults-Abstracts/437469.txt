We report the successful closure of a complicated bronchocutaneous fistula using a pedicled jejunal flap. The fistula, secondary to tuberculosis and irradiation, previously had been closed with a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap. This initial repair failed. The recurrent fistulas were closed again using a jejunal seromuscular flap, and the chest wall defect was reconstructed with a rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap.

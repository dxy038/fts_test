The primary objective for modeling of machining processes is to develop a predictive capability of machining performance in order to facilitate effective planning of machining operations. This capability leads to faster implementation, higher performance, quality at a lower cost. This comes about due to improved selection of machining parameters, optimal fixture design and the avoidance of tool failure. The simulation system presented simultaneously considers the effect of cutter geometry, the cutter's initial position errors, workpiece geometry, machine tool dynamics, and workpiece/fixture system dynamics on the machining process.

tegration of all of the above in one model provides an off-line tool to simulate and optimize the machining parameters and the fixture configuration cutting both lead and production time. The modular nature of the simulation system presented allows for the study of many different machining processes. The cutting forces in this system are modeled using a mechanistic approach. NURBS curves and surfaces are utilized for the geometric modeling and simulation of the machining process. While a finite element method is used to model and analyze the workpiece/fixture dynamics. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the practical application of the presented simulation. The first case presents the optimization of the fixture configuration of a generic automotive component. While the second case presents the results of simulations performed on a novel mill/grind machining process. This process is a combination of face milling and grinding in one operation. Some simulated results are presented along with experimental validation.

A packet reservation multiple access (PRMA) assisted microcellular cordless telecommunications (CT) system is investigated for office type environments in absence of cochannel interference. The objective speech quality is found as a function of channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for transmissions over narrowband Rayleigh fading channels, parameterized with the number of PRA users. A moderate complexity 16-ary CT scheme constituted by a 4-bit/symbol 32-kbps adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) speech codec, Reed-Solomon forward error correction (FEC) codec, and diversity-assisted 16-level star quadrature amplitude modulation (16-StQAM) modem is proposed. The 264-kBd 20-slot PRMA scheme supports 36 users while maintaining virtually imperceptible speech degradation for channel SNRs in excess of about 25 dB, and for a mobile speed of 2 mi/h if the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is above 30 dB

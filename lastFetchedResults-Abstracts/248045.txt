Interlaminar stress plays an important role in the delamination failure of laminated composites. A recently
presented theory, the Interlaminar Shear Stress Continuity Theory (ISSCT), can directly and accurately
predict interlaminar shear stresses in laminated composites by the constitutive equations. The present study
further generalizes the derivation to a complete form from which many displacement-based laminate
theories can be derived. Most of all, both the single-layer and multiple-layer approaches are incorporated
into the analysis in the thickness direction. The laminate is discretized into several sublaminates and, then,
a layerwise theory is applied in the analysis of this reduced laminate. This reduction in the number of layers
used in the analysis makes the calculation of interlaminar shear stresses on the interested interface in a thick
laminate more efficient. In addition, numerical solutions in closed-form and finite element form for laminates
under cylindrical bending and bidirectional bending are examined. It is found that in the thickness direction
the cubic order of the interpolation function and the discretization with four to six sublaminates can reduce
the computational efforts dramatically and retain the accuracy of the predicted stresses within f 8 per cent

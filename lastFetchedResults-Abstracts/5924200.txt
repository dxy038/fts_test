In recent years, more and more metropolitan young-old retirees (from 55 to 70) choose to live out their lives in rural areas as seasonal migrants. The objective of this study was to identify characteristics of seasonal migration, modes of formation and development of rural retirement destinations and impacts of such migration on the rural communities. Data were collected from seasonal migrants, local residents and village officials in two rural retirement destinations located in Zhejiang Province, China via questionnaires and interview. The results of this study showed that better natural environment and lower living cost at rural destinations are two important reasons for the migration; There were two modes: self-organizing mode and Lianzhong mode in forming the rural retirement destinations; Most local residents benefit from serving the seasonal migrants. However, there are still some issues to be addressed, and suggestions as well as arena for future research are discussed at the end of this paper.

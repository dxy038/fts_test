A new jumping genes evolutionary algorithm is proposed for searching the agreeable solution for retaining the voltage profile. On the basis of optimal coordinated voltage control structure, this scheme was testified using the New England 39-bus power system. The main feature of this optimization method is its ability to find the extreme non-dominated solutions that could fulfill the voltage control requirement even when the objective function are contradicted with each other.

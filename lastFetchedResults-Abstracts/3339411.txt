Selective fascicle stimulation is a requirement for the neuroprosthetic treatment of peripheral nerve injuries in order to achieve a proper functional recovery. Here we show that multi-contact polyimide-based flexible split-ring electrodes can provide selective motor stimulation of the rat sciatic nerve. Considering the results, these kinds of electrodes appear suitable for bidirectional nerve interfaces in chronic neuroprosthetic applications.

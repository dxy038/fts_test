Robust multi-objective state feedback controller for the longitudinal dynamics of an aircraft is designed in this paper. The controller satisfies the constrains of pole placement and mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> conditions so that the aircraft can meet the transient response requirement as well as the robustness requirement. Simulation results show the aircraft has high resistance to the disturbance. Simultaneously, the time it takes to reaches the steady state is short enough.

We assume production cost is a function of fixed cost and variable cost which is affected by the order lead time. Centralized decision-making and decentralized decision-making models are present. The supplier´s objective is to maximize his profit by designing an order lead time discount policy. Theoretical results and numerical examples show that supplier and retailer can be coordinated under order lead time discount policy, and the maximal supply chain´s profit under the centralized decision-making scenario can be obtained.

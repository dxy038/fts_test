The single objective redundant drive control cooperation with restriction was studied in this paper by utilizing nonlinear optimization algorithm. Firstly, the general mathematic form of redundant drive control cooperation with position and velocity restriction was described. Secondly, the gradient concept was used to uniformize the position and velocity restriction (named velocity-position restriction uniform expression means), and the selected algorithm-gradient projection algorithm (GPA) was introduced briefly. At last, a computation example was given to test the effective of the velocity-position restriction uniform expression means and the GPA. The results show that, in terms of accuracy and real-time, the method proposed has good performance in resolving the problem of single objective redundant drive control cooperation.

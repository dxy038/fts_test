Objective: The purpose of this prospective, randomized, controlled study was to determine the effects of kinesio taping in the treatment of patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Methods: Thirty-one women with PFPS (mean age: 44.88 years; range: 17 to 50 years) were ran¬domly assigned to either a kinesio taping (KT) (n=15) or control (n=16) group. Both groups received the same muscle strengthening and soft tissue stretching exercises for six weeks and the KT group additionally received kinesio taping at four day intervals for six weeks. Visual analog scale was used to measure pain intensity. Tension of the iliotibial band/tensor fascia lata and hamstring muscles and the mediolateral location of the patella were measured before the treat¬ment and at the end of the third and sixth week. The Anterior Knee Pain Scale / Kujala Scale was used for the analysis of functional performance. Results: Comparing pretreatment and 6th week values, significant improvements were found in pain, soft tissue flexibility and functional performance of both groups (p<0.05). However, patel¬lar shift was unchanged (p>0.05). The KT group had significantly better hamstring flexibility than the control group at the end of three weeks (p<0.05). Conclusion: The addition of kinesio taping to the conventional exercise program does not improve the results in patients with PFPS, other than a faster improvement in hamstring muscle flexibility.

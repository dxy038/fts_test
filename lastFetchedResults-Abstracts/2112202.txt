This study presents a conceptual model that was designed by Bill and colleagues, and at the same
time evaluates the creation of brand equity (perceived quality, brand awareness / brand
associations, brand loyalty) and the effects on consumer responses (purchase intent, brand
extension, willingness to pay a higher price, brand preference). Data collection was conducted
using simple randomized method, data was collected from the stores and customers of Sony.
Sampling was conducted using convenient method, with sample size being 384. Standardized
questionnaire was used, whose validity was tested using content and construct validity test, and it
reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha method. This was an applied research in terms of
objective, a survey one in terms of data collected, and a correlation one in terms of relationship
between variables. The results from test of hypotheses using LISREL (linear structural relations)
and SPSS suggested that perceived quality had an effect of creation of brand equity, and brand
equity had the highest effect on purchase intent.

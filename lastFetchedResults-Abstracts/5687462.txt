Among MODIS products (freely available to the scientific community from 2001), albedo data (MCD43B3) are 16 days composites at 1km spatial resolution, widely used for various applications in climate models, but which still remains difficult to validate. The objective of this study is to propose a method to validate these products with high spatial and temporal resolution data. 31 FORMOSAT-2 images acquired over a small region in the South-Eastern France at 8m for spatial resolution were aggregated at MODIS resolution using a Point Spread Function. The correlation coefficient resulting from comparisons between albedo MODIS and the 1-km FORMOSAT-2 albedos varied from 0.93 to 0.98, which show reasonably accurate results for this study area.

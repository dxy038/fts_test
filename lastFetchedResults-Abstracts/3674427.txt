Directional generation and detection of Scholte waves and other guided modes in liquids and microfluidic channels by capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (cMUTs) is reported. An interdigital transducer structure along with a phased-excitation scheme is used to enhance the directionality of Scholte interface waves in microfluidic environments. Finite element models are developed to predict the performance of the devices in both fluid half-spaces and microchannels. Experiments on the interdigital cMUTs show that a five-finger-pair device in a water half-space has 12 dB of directionality in generating Scholte waves at the design frequency of 10 MHz. A 10-finger device operating at 10 MHz in a water-filled microchannel has 13.4 dB of directionality. These directionality figures agree well with the modeling results. Using the results of the finite element model of a cMUT in a fluid half-space, it was determined that 41% of the acoustic power radiated into the fluid is contained in the Scholte wave propagating in the desired lateral direction. Transducers are demonstrated to perform bidirectional pumping in fluid channels with input power levels in the milliwatt range. Interdigital cMUTs fabricated using low temperature processes can be used as compact ultrasonic transducers with integrated electronics for sensing and actuation in fluidic environments.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether parameters of ovarian blood flow distinguish between women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who ovulate and those who are anovulatory.
Study design
This was a prospectively enrolled trial, carried out as a cross-sectional comparison of 12 ovulatory patients with PCOS and 20 matched subjects with classic PCOS and 10 healthy control subjects. Hormonal parameters and ovarian blood flow by color flow Doppler imaging were obtained in the early follicular phase.
Results
Characteristic elevations in luteinizing hormone (LH) and androgens were found in both groups with PCOS compared with control groups. Women with anovulatory PCOS had high insulin levels and lower Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) values compared with women with ovulatory PCOS, although both groups had values that were different from healthy control subjects (P<.01). Ovarian volume was similar in the two groups with PCOS, but pulsatility and resistance indices were lower in anovulatory PCOS (P<.01) compared with ovulatory PCOS and control subjects, who had similar findings. Insulin correlated negatively with the resistance index and QUICKI correlated positively (r = 0.653, P<.01). There was a negative correlation between the resistance index and unbound testosterone (r = âˆ’0.5, P<.05).
Conclusion
These data suggest that differences in ovarian blood flow in anovulatory versus ovulatory women with PCOS and that hormonal factors, including insulin resistance, may influence this relationship. The alterations in blood flow in anovulatory PCOS may contribute toward or result from anovulation.

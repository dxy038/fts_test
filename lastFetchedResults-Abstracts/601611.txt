Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) have been widely used in many
industrial applications. In This paper a new method for multi objective optimal design of a permanent
magnet synchronous motor (PMSMs) with surface mounted permanent magnet rotor is presented to
achieve maximum efficiency and power density using a Bees algorithm for industrial applications. The
objective function is a combination of power density and efficiency to be maximized simultaneously.
A particular optimal machine is chosen and its performances are validated with FE analysis. The
design optimization results in a motor with great improvement regarding the original motor.

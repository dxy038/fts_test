Considering the uncertainty of emergency item demand in emergency logistics, the transportation paths from item supply spots to disaster spots and emergency item allocation to the selected paths are simultaneously determined by introducing a fuzzy multiple objective mixed integer programming model. The model aims to achieve the minimization of both transportation cost and transportation time. Furthermore, the solution procedure for this model is illustrated. At last, a numerical example is given to verify the availability of above model and perform the sensitivity analysis. It is shown from the sensitivity analysis that the transportation cost and transportation time are increasing in the degree of uncertainty in disaster spotsÂ´ item demand.

Modern sonar systems require the use of highly sophisticated analysis techniques. Modeling tools must be developed to aid in the evaluation of these complex processes. The Coherent Acoustic Guidance Simulation, also known as CAGSIM, has been developed to investigate the performance of conventional and innovative sonar processing techniques. Its use as an analysis tool offers insight to the cause and effect relationships that govern system performance. The objective of this presentation is to discuss the structure and computational flow of CAGSIM and to direct attention to the various procedures used within to model the dynamics and acoustic properties of signal sources, environmental characteristics and sonar processing. Factors that determine the simulation of vehicle trajectories and acoustic signals processed by a moving sonar are identified. Simulation outputs are presented to illustrate CAGSIMÂ´s versatility.

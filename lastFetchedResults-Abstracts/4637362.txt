A critical issue encountered in implementing a bus signal priority system is to ensure a trade-off between the delay of a bus and the surrounding traffic. Traditional BSP methods treat buses uniformly so that an empty bus may have the same priority to the full loaded bus, and lead to an excessive delay for private traffic. However, with RFID technique, a control model can realize delicate control mode by identifying and acquiring more detailed, real-time and dynamic data on the bus. Hence, An intelligent method for determing bus priority based on RFID is proposed, assuming two-objective optimization of both on-bus passengers´ total delay and private vehicles total delay. The result is a considerable reduction in private traffic delay with higher traffic volume when using bus signal priority. What´s more, the proposed control method could also be applied to the coordination of similar complex cyber-physical systems.

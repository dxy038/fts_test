The objective of study is to explore customer awareness and perception towards the Islamic Banking products and how this perception and awareness can be raised for the greater success of Islamic banking products. Based on the Interpretive Phenomenological Approach (IPA), this study explores Islamic principles related to interest and profit, current banking products and services, awareness of customers about Islamic banking products and services, understanding of customers on Islamic banking system and operations, perception of customers about Shariah compliant service. This is qualitative study and semi-structured interviews are conducted of Islamic banksâ€™ customers. Customers are selected through snowball sampling technique as samples. Generally, customers use only the current and saving accounts, they do not use different modes of financing because of less awareness about the products and financing modes of Islamic banks. Even bankers by themselves not have full awareness of Islamic banking products and services. Awareness and perceptions of Islamic banking products can be improved by publishing the books or broachers, different paid organizations should be used to spread awareness, public at large can be invited for general awareness. Basically this is the time of developing right strategy. The strategy should be implemented with proper follow-up and no question should be left unanswered in the procedure of follow-up.

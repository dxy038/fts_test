A variety of different remanufacturing methods have been successfully developed and tested during the last decades of the 20th century, but it has also been proven that none of them has perfectly produced final reliable joint throughputs from the remanufacturing line. Now, the new objective is to develop alternative methods instead of utilizing manual, semi-automated or automated remanufacturing systems. The new technology, which has been under investigation for less than two years, focuses on eliminating the causes of these remanufacturing problems since the old technologies practiced in remanufacturing are costly, complicated, and require skilled operators. The solution suggested in this paper is to develop a new knowledge based system that can be used by operators in their electronics remanufacturing and manufacturing assembly lines to reduce and eventually eliminate the number of the defects and problems with a zero percent defect rate goal

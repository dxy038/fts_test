The objective of the study was to achieve balanced load among processors, reduce the communication overhead of the load balancing algorithm, and improve respource utilization, which results in better average resonse time. A communication protocol and a fully distributed algorithm for dynamic load balancing through task migration in a connected <e1>N</e1>-processor network are presented. Each processor communicates its load directly with only a subset (of the size &#8730; <e1>N</e1>) of processors, reducing communication traffic and average response time. It is proved that the given algorithm will perform task migration even if there is only one light load processor and one heavy load processor in the system. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can save up to 60% of the protocol messages used by the broadcast algorithms and can reduce the average response time

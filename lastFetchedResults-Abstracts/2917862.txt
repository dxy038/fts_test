Optical Multiple Access (OMA) is an optical intersatellite link (ISL) system for bidirectional low data rate communications between multiple low Earth orbiting (LEO) `usersÂ´ and a single geostationary (GEO) data relay satellite. A summary of the communication system parameters is shown. The status of this project is phase A with a current program to demonstrate the pointing, acquisition, and tracking capability of OMA. The paper describes the work performed on the critical area of the link acquisition. The function of the acquisition phase of an ISL is to reduce the initial mispointing of both partner telescopes to the extent that closed loop tracking of the communication beams can commence

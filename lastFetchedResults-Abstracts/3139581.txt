Some existing blind bandwidth extension algorithms are restricted to linear extrapolation, such as linear spectrum replication. In this paper, we propose an improved blind bandwidth extension method using a non-linear extrapolation to reconstruct the missing high-frequency components. By training weights of the neural network in real time, the high-band signal can be reconstructed dynamically. Objective and subjective listening tests are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and the results show that it obtains higher quality signals.

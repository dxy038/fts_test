Study Objective:
To understand the communication process involved in the patient-self referral method among adolescent females with chlamydia and gonococcal infection.
Design:
A cross-sectional descriptive study using a convenience sample was conducted in 54 predominantly African-American females, 13 to 20 years-old, with gonococcal and/or chlamydia cervicitis at an urban hospital based reproductive health clinic. Subjects interviewed at their treatment visit were asked what method of notification they used to tell their partner(s). Subjects who had not notified their partner were asked about their intended communication method and what they envisioned they would say to their partner. Coding methodology was used to analyze the information. In addition to qualitative information, outcome measures were the proportion of subjects who notified their partner(s), their communication method, style, and barriers to communication.
Results:
According to the treatment visit, 57% (31/54) of subjects reported notifying their partner. Most had notified their partner by phone or face-to-face, stated basic facts about the infection, and used a “direct” and “sensitive” communication style. Of the subjects who had not notified their partner (23/54), several barriers to notification were reported, but 82% said they intend to notify their partner(s).
Conclusions:
Strategies to promote the patient-self referral method among young women who do not notify their partner(s) need further assessment.

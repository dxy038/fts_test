There is a wide range of telecommunications services that transmit voice, video and data through complex transmission networks and in some cases, the service has not an acceptable quality level for the end user. In this sense the study of methods for assessing video quality and voice have a very important role. This paper presents a classification scheme, based on different criteria, of the methods and metrics that are being studied in recent years. This paper presents how the video quality is affected by degradation in the transmission channel in two kinds of services: Digital TV (ISDB-TB) due the fading in the air interface and video streaming service on an IP network due packet loss. For Digital TV tests was set up a scenario where the digital TV transmitter is connected to an RF channel emulator, where are inserted different fading models and at the end, the videos are saved in a mobile device. The tests of streaming video were performed in an isolated scenario of IP network, which are scheduled several network conditions, resulting in different qualities of video reception. The video quality assessment is performed using objective assessment methods: PSNR, SSIM and VQM. The results show how the losses in the transmission channel affects the quality of end-user experience on both services studied.

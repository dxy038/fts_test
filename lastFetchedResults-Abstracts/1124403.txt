Lanthana- and magnesia-supported nickel catalysts with Ni-loading ranging from 10 to 30 wt.% and calcined at temperatures 1073–1273 K are prepared and tested in the catalytic partial oxidation of methane. These catalysts are characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption–desorption measurements, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The main objective of this work is the development of more efficient catalysts to produce syngas (H2 + CO) from methane. For the catalysts developed the influence of the nickel content and the support on the activity are studied in a series of nickel catalysts.

Elise is an electrostatically focused heavy-ion accelerator being designed and constructed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The machine is intended to be the first half of the four-beam Induction Linear Accelerator (LINAC) Systems Experiment (ILSE), which will ultimately test the principal beam dynamics issues and manipulations of induction heavy-ion drivers for inertial fusion. Elise will use an existing 2 MeV injector and will accelerate space-charge-dominated pulses to greater than 5 MeV. The design objective of Elise is to maximize the output beam ‘rules of thumb’ used for choosing the beam and lattice parameters for heavy-ion induction accelerators, and we discuss incorporating these relations in a spreadsheet program that generates internally consistent lattice layouts and acceleration schedules. These designs have been tested using a one-dimensional particle simulation code (SLIDE), a three-dimensional fluid/envelope code (CIRCE) and a three-dimensional particle-in-cell code (WARP3d). Sample results from these calculations are presented. Results from these dynamics codes are also shown, illustrating sensitivities to beam and lattice errors, and testing various strategies for longitudinal confinement of the beam ends.

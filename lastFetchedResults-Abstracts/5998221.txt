The objective of the paper is to describe a new structure which is being used for the development of a simulation modeling environment (SME) for industrialized housing. The structure is centered around a commercial manufacturing simulator which is closely coupled with a relational data base management System (RDBMS). The paper presents an overview of previous SME research, describes the new SME structure and, finally, presents findings from on-going SME development efforts.

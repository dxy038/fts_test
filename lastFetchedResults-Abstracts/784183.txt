Objective This study aims to investigate whether there
are differences in the prevalence of common mental disorders
and social capital between migrant and non-migrant
groups in Peru.
Methodology The PERU MIGRANT study is a crosssectional
study comprising three groups: an urban group
from a shanty town in Lima; a rural group from a community
in Ayacucho-Peru; and a migrant group originally
from Ayacucho currently living in the same urban shanty
town. Common mental disorders were assessed using the
General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and social capital
was assessed using the Short Social Capital Assessment
Tool (SASCAT). Poisson regression with robust standard
errors was used to estimate prevalence ratios.
Results The overall prevalence of common mental disorders
was 39.4%; the highest prevalence was observed in
the rural group. Similar patterns were observed for cognitive
social capital and structural social capital. However
after adjustment for sex, age, family income and education,
all but one of the significant relationships was attenuated,
suggesting that in this population migration per se does not
impact on common mental health disorders or social
capital.
Conclusions In the PERU MIGRANT study, we did not
observe a difference in the prevalence of common mental
disorders, cognitive and structural social capital between
migrant and urban groups. This pattern of associations was
also similar in rural and urban groups, except that a higher
prevalence ratio of structural social capital was observed in
the rural group.

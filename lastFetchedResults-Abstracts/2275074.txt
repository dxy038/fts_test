The objective was to work out a system of classification, description and numbering of feeds, suitable for a fully computerised feed value database. A 15-digit computerised feed number system was developed. The system allows full distinction of individual feeds according to their traits, including different varieties. The main characteristics of a tree-type description system are: feed category, origin, group, species, variety, part, physiological maturity (stage of growth), technological processing. The kinds and phases of processing are logically and coherently related to a specific type of treatment, such as drying, ensiling, pressing, oil extraction, etc. Numbers are allocated to feeds by a computer, based on their description. The system may ease management and interrogation, and allow a more efficient use of computerised feed value databases. It is designed to be used in the Polish Feed Information Centre instead of the structurally non-coherent international numbering system.

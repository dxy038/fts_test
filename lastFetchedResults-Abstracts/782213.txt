Sheep welfare is the combination of subjective and objective (qualitative and quantitative)
aspects of the conditions of life of animals, including health and disease, behaviour,
husbandry and management; thus, it is a complex and abstract construct. The scientific
approach to the problems of assessing suffering in sheep has to be evidence-based. Different
approaches contribute to an assessment of animal suffering, such as measurements
of physical damage to the animal, measurement of the animalsâ€™ preferences and considerations
of the conditions to which the animal is adapted in its normal social structure.
Selected literature on the behavioural alterations of sheep, which indicate internal or external
distressing procedures, is reviewed in this paper. There is a need for further research to
identify indicators of distress in sheep, but in the meantime it would be reasonable to make
the judgement that, in some circumstances, sheep observed vocalising, panting, showing
markedly increased locomotory activity and/or changes in feeding or social patterns could
be experiencing distress.

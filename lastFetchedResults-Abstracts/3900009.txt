In this paper, we propose joint relay selection and power allocation algorithms that can work robustly under imperfect channel knowledge for a decode-and-forward (DF) cellular relay network. The objective is to minimize the uplink transmit power of the network taking each userÂ´s target data rate as the quality of service (QoS) constraint in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). We consider the worst-case optimization approach, in which QoS constraint is satisfied for all users assuming both probabilistic and deterministic channel estimation error models. In this optimization framework, equivalent convex formulations are derived for the nonlinear optimization problems that are often combinatorially hard to solve in their original forms. After relay selection, efficient centralized as well as distributed power allocation algorithms scalable with respect to the size of the networks are developed. We also consider the case of power constrained networks where the objective is to provide QoS in the presence of limited power budgets on source and relays. The robust optimization problem is reformulated accordingly and efficient solution is provided. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate the implications of ignoring channel estimation errors while developing relay selection and power allocation algorithms.

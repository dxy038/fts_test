The objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid energy system using multiple input DC-DC converter (MIC) and Z-source inverter (ZSI) with maximum boost control strategy, which will reduce the system cost as well as the size of the entire converter system. The proposed system interfaces multiple input DC-DC converter and Z-source inverter together to obtain the required AC voltage. The output of MIC is given to a ZSI, which has the capability of single stage conversion to obtain a voltage level needed to feed an AC load. In the proposed system topology 120W three phase load requirement is satisfied by a PV panel of 120 W and a conventional DC source. In this paper a maximum boost control strategy has been used to control the devices on each inverter legs, which will increase the maximum voltage gain and reduces the current ripple and voltage stress.

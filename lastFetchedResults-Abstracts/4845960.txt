Research of robotics aims to realize some aspects of human functions into a mechanical system. It is interesting to observe from most human reaching movements that the desired targets are regions rather than points. In this paper, a region tracking controller is proposed for robot manipulator. In the proposed controller, the desired objective of the robot end effector can be specified as a moving region. Lyapunov-like function is presented for the convergence analysis. Simulation results are presented to verify the theory.

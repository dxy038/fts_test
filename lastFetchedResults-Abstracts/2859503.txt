One of the main barriers to the complete integration of the fully electric vehicle (FEV) in the energetic system is the expected impact on the electric infrastructure and particularly on the electric demand profile. In the scope Spanish electric system, the relationship between the fully electric vehicle total charging demand and the final price of electricity has been analyzed. To accomplish this objective, different scenarios have been defined attending to the level of use of FEV, the daily distribution of the vehicle charging processes and the season of the year. Feasible demand profiles have been created based on these scenarios, combining the described. From these demand profiles, the variation of the hourly price in the Spanish spot electricity market and the capability of the Spanish power system to manage the fully electric vehicle demand have been analyzed.

In manufacturing control, machine scheduling research has mostly dealt with problems either without maintenance or with deterministic maintenance when no failure can occur. This can be unrealistic in practical settings. In this work, an experimental model is developed to evaluate the effect of corrective and preventive maintenance schemes on scheduling performance in the presence of machine failure where the scheduling objective is to minimize schedule duration. We show that neither scheme is clearly superior, but that the applicability of each depends on several system parameters as well as the scheduling environment itself. Further, we show that parameter values can be chosen for which preventive maintenance does better than corrective maintenance. The results provided in this study can be useful to practitioners and to system or machine administrators in manufacturing and elsewhere.

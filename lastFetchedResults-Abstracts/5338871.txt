In this paper, a class of facility location problem based on risk bottleneck of the distribution network in public crisis management system is studied. We suppose that each edge in the network has two attributes: length and risk bottleneck. The security cost in network is a no-decreasing function about the maximum risk degree of all edges in the networks. Cost minimization is the system objective, including facilities setting up cost and transportation cost as well as an additional security cost. At the end of this paper, an algorithm is proposed to solve this model.

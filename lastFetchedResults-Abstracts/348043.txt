Objective: To evaluate motor cortex excitability changes by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) following repetitive muscle contractions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); to state whether a typical pattern of post-exercise motor evoked potentials (MEPs) is related to clinical fatigue in MS.
Methods: In 41 patients with definite MS (32 with fatigue and 9 without fatigue according to Fatigue Severity Scale) and 13 controls, MEPs were recorded at rest: at baseline condition, following repetitive contractions until fatigue, and after fatigue, to evaluate post-exercise MEP facilitation (PEF) and depression (PED).
Results: After exercise, MEP amplitude significantly increased both in patients and controls (PEF). When fatigue set in, MEP amplitude was significantly reduced in normal subjects (PED), but not in patients. Post-exercise MEP findings were similar both in patients with and without fatigue.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest an intracortical motor dysfunction following a voluntary contraction in MS patients, possibly due to failure of depression of facilitatory cortical circuits, or alternatively of inhibitory mechanisms.

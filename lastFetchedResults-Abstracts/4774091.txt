In todayÂ´s operational environment, utility transmission engineers are being challenged with a new set of design parameters. In addition to the traditional objective of system reliability, new issues of paramount importance have evolved. These include the reduction of construction costs, addressing transmission line aesthetics, and optimizing power delivery within restricted right of way. This document describes a design approach which enables the engineer to maximize these criteria without sacrificing system reliability. A laboratory test method for polymer post insulators is also presented which effectively simulates combined mechanical load conditions expected in application, thus allowing the utility engineer to optimize span lengths, conductor size, and insulator selection. Polymer history and benefits associated with compact line design are also reviewed

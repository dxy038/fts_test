We report a rare case of myasthenia gravis accompanied by multi-focal tuberculosis. A 47-year-old female suffering from myasthenia gravis underwent thymectomy, however, the incision of operation did not heal for many months. Eight months after surgery, she developed fever and gradual loss of consciousness. Laboratory evaluations were suggestive of tuberculous meningitis and multiple parenchymal tuberculomas. After starting anti-TB regimen, her condition gradually improved. Her wound completely healed up after 45 days which was indicative of sternal tuberculosis. This case highlights the importance of additional diagnostic assessment of resistant wounds particularly in immunocompromised patients and also careful consideration of existent paraclinical findings.

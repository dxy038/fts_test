In this paper we present a simplistic technique to reduce interference/coupling between antennae/equipment, in spaces having high density of these transmitter aerials. The objective therefore, is to modify the omni directional pattern of an antenna (e.g. monopole/dipole), to achieve directional transmission and reception, especially at sites where space is a constraint and installation of large directional antenna is not possible. Such type of problem of co-location is more pronounced and relevant on board ships and land based HF mobile platforms. The solution to this problem has been discussed by implementing the concepts of array beamforming, using the existing setup of antennae at the site.

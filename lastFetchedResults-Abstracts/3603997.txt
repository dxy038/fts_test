This paper discusses the bidirectional associative memory (BAM) model from the matched-filtering viewpoint and offers it a new interpretation. Our attention is focused on the problem of stability and attractivity of equilibrium states. Several sufficient and/or necessary conditions are presented. To improve the BAM performance, an exponential function is used to enhance the correlations between the binary vectors of the retrieval key and that of the stored pattern similar to the key. The modified model is shown to be asymptotically stable. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the modified model performs much better than the original BAM in terms of memory capacity and error correction capability

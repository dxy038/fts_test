Context and objective: Research or therapeutic human simulation is a kind
of simulation that does not seek to reproduce a person and simulates stem cells
to treat diseases and injuries. This paper deals with concept of therapeutic
simulation, scholars view on the subject and its relation with dignity.
Methodology: This research is descriptive- analytic and library based.
Findings: There are several objections to therapeutic simulation, such as,
lack of efficiency, its association with abortion and its contradiction with
human dignity.
The first of many criticisms that have been directed to simulation comes
from the fact that there is a lack of understanding of scientific aspects of
the subject which is caused by its complexity and novelty. With reference
to international legal reports and documents as well as clear religious rules,
such as, requiring wisdom and sharia and necessity and expedience, it seems
that there is no contradiction between therapeutic simulation and human
dignity and also to consider its benefits for medical school in some cases it has
juridical justification in some stages of fetus life.
Results: There is no contradiction between therapeutic human simulation
and human dignity and it has juridical justification in some stages of fetus life.

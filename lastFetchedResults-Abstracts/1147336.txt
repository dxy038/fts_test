A systematic study of the enantioselective resolution of ibuprofen by commercial Rhizomucor miehei lipase (LipozymeÂ® IM20) has been carried out using isooctane as solvent and butanol as esterificating agent. The main variables controlling the process (temperature, ibuprofen concentration, ratio butanol:ibuprofen) have been studied using an orthogonal full factorial experimental design, in which the selected objective function was enantioselectivity. This strategy has resulted in a polynomial function that describes the process. By optimizing this function, optimal conditions for carrying out the esterification of racemic ibuprofen have been determined. Under these conditions, enantiomeric excess and total conversion values were 93.8% and 49.9%, respectively, and the enantioselectivity was 113 after 112 h of reaction. These conditions have been considered in the design of a continuous reactor to scale up the process. The esterification of ibuprofen was properly described by pseudo first-order kinetics. Thus, a packed bed reactor operating as a plug-flow reactor (PFR) is the most appropriate in terms of minimizing the residence time compared with a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) to achieve the same final conversion. This reactor shows a similar behavior in terms of enantioselectivity, enantiomeric excess, and conversion when compared with batch reactors. A residence-time distribution (RTD) shows that the flow model is essentially a plug flow with a slight nonsymmetrical axial dispersion (Peclet number = 43), which was also corroborated by the model of CSTR in series. The stability of the system (up to 100 h) and the possibility of reutilization of the enzyme (up to four times) lead to consider this reactor as a suitable configuration for scale up of the process.

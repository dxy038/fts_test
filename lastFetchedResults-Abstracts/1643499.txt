Many authors have tried to find out how to control scouring around a pier standing in the way of the straight path flow in a direct stream. The objective followed in the present research is thus to study a scour pattern around such a pier, but installed in a curved rivers, due to the fact that there probably are differences between a flow pattern on a direct path vs. on a meander. Throughout the present study, it is tried to check whether the use of either cable or collar alone or in a combination would affect scouring around a bridge's pier group constructed in the path of a river's meander. Two thicknesses of cable 0.2D and 0.4D and three steps of 0.2D, 0.5D and D were employed. The results revealed that scouring decreases with increase in cable diameter and a decrease in the pitch of the helix. As regards the pier groups that stand in the direction of water flow, scour depth for the first pier is more than that for a standing single pier. This represents the increase in the reinforcing phenomenon. Also scouring depth for the middle and back piers is less than that for a single pier, due to the sheltering phenomenon. As regards piers perpendicular to the flow direction, the maximum scour depth is observed in the middle pier. Also, in this case the scour depth is reduced by an increase in the distance between piers. Use of collar is more effective than cable for small distances between piers.  Also it has been found that use of a combination of cable and collar results in the most reduction in scouring depth.

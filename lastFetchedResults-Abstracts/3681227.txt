The ATRAP collaboration (Antihydrogen Trapping) operates an experiment at the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) at CERN with the objective to create antihydrogen atoms and confine them at a very low temperature. The goal is to perform precise spectroscopy on antihydrogen in comparison to hydrogen as a high precision test of charge, parity and time invariance (CPT).

In this paper with the use of the B-spline parameterization, a new method based on the proposed modified hybrid genetic algorithm (MHGA), is introduced for solving a class of optimal control problems. In each iteration of the proposed algorithm, using uniform distribution of time interval, MHGA is run with a random initial population in which each individual item of the population is a matrix of control input values in time nodes of the partition. MHGA combines GA with SQP to be regarded as a local search. To decrease the computational time, in the beginning of the algorithm, a less number of integration for SQP is used, when the promising region of search space was found, we gradually increase the number of iterations of SQP. The optimal solution of MHGA is considered as the B-spline coefficients for the parameterization of the control. For better approximation of control curves in the next iteration, the number of time nodes are increased, and the above procedure is repeated. The algorithm is terminated when the norm of differences between two consecutive parameterized control curves or the differences of the objective function's value for two iteration is less than the prescribed numbers. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the numerical results are applied on more than ten optimal control problems.

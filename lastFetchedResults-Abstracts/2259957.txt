Abstract 
Context and objective: Mass killing is defined as murdering more than two people happening in the same place and time. This crime is not included in the Statute of International Criminal Court, international regulations and neither in I.R. Iran Penal Law. It is evaluated in the form of genocide by some jurists, and it is sometimes considered as crime against humanity. The objective of this paper is to study the legal status of genocide in Iran’s penal law and also in other international documents. 
Methodology: The paper has been written by document-based methods and the materials have been collected by library-based methods, including books, theses, papers, and other reliable documents. We have also used website documents based on our needs. 
Findings: Mass Killing is not included in the Statute of International Criminal Court, therefore this court has jurisdiction to the cases which are presented as war crime, crimes against humanity and genocide. It means that in the case of genocide the court has no jurisdiction over these cases. 
Results: Due to the significance of genocide it is incumbent to include this crime in the Statute of International Criminal Court not to leave such crimes without proper response in international courts.  
Keywords: Mass Killing, Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, Statute of International Criminal Court

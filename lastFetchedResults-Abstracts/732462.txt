Background. The objective was to assess psychosocial correlates of alternate tobacco product (chew/snuff, cigar, pipe, bidi, kretek) use.

Methods. Measures of alternate tobacco product use, cigarette smoking, environmental smoking exposure, and depression were included in a school-based self-report survey completed by 1,107 ninth graders.

Results. The current (past 30 days) use rate for one or more alternate tobacco products was 8.3% and the current use rate for cigarettes was 11%; 45% of current cigarette smokers also used alternate tobacco products. After controlling for demographic factors and current cigarette smoking, adolescents exposed to peers who smoke and those with greater depressive symptoms were two to three times more likely to currently use an alternate tobacco product than adolescents without exposure to peer smoking and those with lesser depressive symptoms.

Conclusions. Social and psychological associations with alternate tobacco product use should be further evaluated as this information could be helpful in developing anti-tobacco messages targeted to high-risk youth.

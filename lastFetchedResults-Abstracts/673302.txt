One of the key requirements of the European Union (EU) for accession of Central European countries (CEC) to the EU is the establishment of free market economies which parallel the economies in Western Europe based on the adoption of the Acquis Communautaire (Acquis) from the EU. Central to this objective is the privatisation of lands and the establishment of efficient land markets. To this end the EU and many other countries and international organisations have committed significant resources to support land administration, and particularly cadastral projects, in Central Europe since 1992.
This paper reviews the role that the establishment of land administration systems is playing in the accession of CEC to the EU. Other key requirements for accession to the EU are the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, the protection of human rights, environmental sustainability and institution building. The paper also considers the role that land administration plays in supporting these objectives and develops a generic framework for land administration projects in support of accession to the EU.
As background the paper uses examples to highlight the historical context of land, the evolution of land administration in Central Europe, the reconstruction of property rights and the justification of land administration projects in the context of AGENDA 2000 for a wider Europe. The paper provides an international context by examining land administration trends globally.
The paper concludes by highlighting the challenges facing the establishment of land administration systems in CEC.

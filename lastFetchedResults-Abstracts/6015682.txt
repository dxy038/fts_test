The voltage quality of distribution network can be advanced by reactive power optimization, and the active power loss also can be reduced effectively. In this paper, the reactive power optimization of power system and it´s objective function are both researched. An ant-genetic algorithm is given by using crossover and mutation operations of genetic algorithm into ant colony algorithm to generate new searching path which can not only remain genetic algorithm´s high quality of solution, but also have feature of parallel distribution of ant colony algorithm. An example is adopted to prove that the ant-genetic algorithm is effective, and it has fast convergence speed and fine global optimization ability.

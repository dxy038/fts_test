This report discusses the evaluation of 500 kV optical voltage and current transducers that are a part of the Advanced Substation Project. One objective of the project is to incorporate all substation control, protection and metering on one optical communication bus. Substation functions and equipment will be remotely accessed via telephone modems or dedicated communications. The overall project goal is to reduce the cost of substation equipment and design. Operation and maintenance schedules will be reduced with equipment that is self diagnostic, automatically signalling component failures as they occur

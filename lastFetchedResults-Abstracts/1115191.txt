The objective of the study is to understand the nanoscale near-surface deformation response of two polymer nanocomposite systems with significant differences in ductility during nanoscratching with a Berkovich indenter using a load of 1 mN and a scratch velocity of 1 μm s−1. An accompanying objective is to investigate the commonality in surface deformation behavior between nano- and microscale deformation to reinforce the underlying fundamental principles governing surface deformation. An understanding of surface deformation response is accomplished through determination of physical and mechanical properties, structural characterization and electron microscopy analysis of surface deformation tracks and residual plastically deformed structures. The study suggests for the first time that the understanding derived from microscale surface deformation studies can be extended to nanoscale surface deformation. The microscale response in a polypropylene-based system is characterized by periodic multiple ripple-type deformation tracks that form via a mechanism identical to the periodic single-ripple-type tracks during nanoscale deformation. Similarly, in a less ductile polyethylene-based system, the periodic parabolic tracks and ironing mode of deformation during microscale deformation tend to be significantly reduced in intensity, with ironing being the primary deformation mechanism at the nanoscale. The surface deformation topography suggests that both micro- and nanoscale response is material specific. Additionally, the study suggests that reinforcement of polymers with nanoclay is a viable route to significantly decrease the susceptibility of polymeric materials to micro- and nanoscale deformation and can be discussed in terms of physical and mechanical properties of materials notably percentage crystallinity and elastic recovery.

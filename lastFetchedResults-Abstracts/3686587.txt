We have experimentally demonstrated a full-duplex radio-over-fiber system using a single light source at central station (CS). Optical carrier suppression modulation scheme was employed to generate 40-GHz optical millimeter wave and up-convert the baseband signal simultaneously at CS for downlink transmission while the same optical carrier was reused at base station for uplink connection. The bidirectional full-duplex 2.5-Gb/s data was successfully transmitted over 40-km standard single-mode fiber (SMF-28) for both upstream and downstream channels with less than 2-dB power penalty. This system shows simple cost-efficient configuration and good performance over long-distance delivery

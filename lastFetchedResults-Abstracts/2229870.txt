Objective: we compared the use of intrathecal bupivacaine in combination with gen-eral anesthesia to general anesthesia alone in patients undergoing coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG) surgery for its impact on time to extubation.
Methodology: In this case control double blind study we compared 34 patients in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Ahwaz, Iran, from May 2011 to September 2011.The pa-tients were randomly assigned to receive general anesthesia with prior administration of intrathecal bupivacaine 0.5% at a dosage of 20 mg (bupivacaine or case group n = 17) or general anesthesia alone (control group n = 17) according to a simple comput-er-generated list.
Results: Mean extubation time in bupivacaine group was213.00 ± 3.06 (3h and 33m) and in control group was 257.12 ± 4.49 minutes (4h and 17m).the difference between two groups was significant(P  <  0.05).
Conclusion: Intrathecal bupivacaine offers promise as a useful adjunct in reducing postoperative time to extubation in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

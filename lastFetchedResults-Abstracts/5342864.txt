It is possible to produce a calibration certificate which does not necessarily contain calibration results, and is therefore considerably easier to generate, and which is still technically valid and complies with NAMAS requirements. The following points in particular have to be considered and addressed: (a) the equipment must be appropriate for this kind of certification; (b) all results must be kept on file and made available if requested; (c) there must be an accurate description of which points and ranges were checked; (d) the specification used must be unambiguously identified; (e) the specification limits must be narrowed by the estimated limits of uncertainty; (f) functional tests of an objective nature may be included under suitable headings; (g) all other requirements of M10 and M25 must be adhered to. It should also be noted that the agreement of the NAMAS Executive should be obtained before issuing short-form certificates. It is suggested that any laboratories who are interested in producing certificates of this kind should contact their Technical Officer and submit a sample of the short-form certificate they propose to use

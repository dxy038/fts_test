In this paper, a low complexity design for a DFT-based MP3 multi-channel audio decoding system is proposed. By utilizing the proposed decoding system, the advanced MP3 multi-channel decoder can play high-quality multi-channel audio with low processing power. The MP3 multi-channel system is composed of two components, a parametric multi-channel decoder, and an MP3 decoder. A novel convolution-synthesis method in the transform domain can replace the pseudo-quadrature mirror filter (PQMF) module in the MP3 decoder and several small size discrete Fourier transform (DFT) modules can be used instead of a large-size DFT module in the multi-channel decoder. This combination noticeably reduces computing power without significant loss in the decoded audio signal quality. The effect of the error in the decoded audio signal is analyzed by both objective and subjective methods.

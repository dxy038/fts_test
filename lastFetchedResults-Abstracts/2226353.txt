The objective of the study described here is to investigate the determining influence of impact modifier on the microstructure and physico-chemical and mechanical properties of polypropylene crystallized at elevated pressures. The impact modified polypropylene referred as thermoplastic olefin (TPO) is characterized by a small spherulite size in the range of ∼1–8 μm and the effect is retained when nanoclay is introduced into TPO. The impact strength of TPO and TPO–nanoclay system though similar, but is significantly higher than the polypropylene system, a behavior attributed to refinement of spherulite size. The study demonstrates that the nanoclay in TPO retains the impact strength of TPO and controls the dispersion of elastomer.

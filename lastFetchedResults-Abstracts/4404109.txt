A method for smooth transitions between voltage, current, and power regulation (multi-mode control) for bidirectional power converters is proposed. This method extends existing work on multi-mode control of power converters to bidirectional systems. Additionally it is shown how inherent power sharing can be achieved in systems with parallel or series connected converters. These improvements over previous methods make this approach a good candidate for the fast bidirectional systems composed of multiple converter modules increasingly found in emerging DC power grids. Experimental results are shown for two 1 kW, 500 V, 4 A parallel output, isolated, bidirectional series resonant converters (SRCs).

In this article a study is introduced that was carried out for the implementation of a temperature monitoring system in the mould of a slab continuous casting line in ACERALIAÂ´s LD3 steel factory in Aviles (Asturias). To achieve this, instrumentation has been proposed consisting on precision thermocouples placed along the vertical mid-line of both the broad face and the narrow face of the mould. Signals are converted and sent through an industrial bus to the acquisition station. Here, the data from the process computer (the conditions under which the casting develops) is also stored. The ultimate objective is the retrieval of actual data on temperatures at specific locations of the mould. These data can be used for the adjustment of models of mould operative behaviour.

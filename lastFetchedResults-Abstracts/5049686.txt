The purpose of this paper is to study a mathematical formulation of a water level and product liquid temperature control loop in a boiler drum and heat exchanger process control training system. Mathematical modeling was carried out to understand the dynamics of the liquid product temperature for different settings of PID controller mode. The modeling objective is to address the prediction of the plant performance with sufficient accuracy so that experimental data can be verified with the simulation results. The experimental data was obtained from the mini plant and the simulation results by model developed by using Simulink toolbox in Matlab software. The experimental and simulation results that were verified exhibited fair agreement.

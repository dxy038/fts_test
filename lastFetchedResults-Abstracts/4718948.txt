Bidirectional road is the basic and ordinary scenario of Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) which is an emerging and challenging research applying mobile ad hoc technology to transportation system. According to different forwarding mechanisms in routing protocol of such network, the connections are divided into end-to-end (E2E) type and Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) type. The packet reachability probabilities, the representative of network connectivity, of both connection types are calculated and compared quantitatively using our proposed probability model. The results are validated by simulations in our experiments. Our work provides important and useful reference basis for network and routing protocol designers.

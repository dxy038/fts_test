The collaborative simulation framework for hydraulic-driven erection system is constructed based on the interfaces of multi-domain software. The angular velocity of erecting process is designed by using sinusoid of acceleration, and the generalized predictive control is applied to the angular velocity tracking control of the erecting system. The method of the output increase item joined in the objective function of GPC is proposed, the improvement algorithm control law is given. This method has the features of simple structure and easy realization and furthermore, it can adjust to the system parameter change and external disturbance and improve the control precision. The simulation results indicated that the control performance of the improved GPC is more effective.

The objective of this investigation was to evaluate physical and mechanical properties of experimental cement type panels made from multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and bagasse fiber. Three levels of MWCNTs, namely 0.5 wt.%, 1 wt.% and 1.5 wt.% were mixed with 10 wt.% and 20 wt.% of bagasse fiber in rotary type mixer. Thickness swelling, water absorption, bending characteristics and impact strength of the samples were evaluated. Based on the findings in this work the water absorption and thickness swelling of the nanocomposites decreased with increasing amount of the multi-wall carbon nanotubes content in the panels from 0.5% to 1.5%. On the other hand flexural modulus and impact strength of the panels were enhanced with increased percentage of carbon nanotubes. Panels having 0.5% MWCNTs exhibited the highest impact strength. Overall dimensional stability and strength properties of the samples were adversely influenced with increased amount bagasse fiber in the samples. It appears that using lower percentage of bagasse fiber or application of heat or chemical treatment to the raw material should be considered to improve negative influence of bagasse fiber on properties of the panels.

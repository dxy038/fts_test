Sponsored by the Transportation Cooperative Research Program (TCRP), project TCRP G-4, Developing Standards for System and Subsystem Interfaces in Electric Rail Passenger Vehicles, was initiated in January, 1996. Its objective was to design a process for developing consensus standards for system and subsystem interfaces for light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail vehicles and use the process to produce one or more standards. The Rail Transit Vehicle Interface Standards Committee (RTVISC) was formed within the IEEE to serve as the sponsor and balloting group for rail transit vehicle interface standards. RTVISC identified eight key areas for interface standardization and formed working groups to begin drafting IEEE standards in these areas. In October of 1997, IEEE P1477, standard for passenger information system for rail transit vehicles, was successfully balloted. Seven other drafts are well on their way to completion. This paper summarizes the status of the eight standards presently being sponsored by the IEEE rail transit vehicle interface standards committee. The other seven are: IEEE P1473, Communication Protocols Aboard Trains; IEEE P1474, Communications Based Train Control; IEEE P1482, Rail Vehicle Monitoring and Diagnostic Systems; IEEE P1483, Safety Considerations for Software used in Rail Transit Systems; IEEE P1475, Functioning of and Interfaces among Propulsion, Friction Brake and Train-borne Master Control on Rail Rapid Transit Vehicles; IEEE P1476, Passenger Train Auxiliary Power Systems; and IEEE P1478, Environmental Conditions for Transit Rail Car Electronic Equipment

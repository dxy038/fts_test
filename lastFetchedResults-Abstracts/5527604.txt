This paper presents a new version of constriction particle swarm optimization (NCPSO) with mutation mechanism for solving the security-constrained optimal power flow (OPF) with both the steady-state security constraints and the transient stability constraints. The objective of SCOPF in considering the valve-point loading effect of the unit and the operating limits of FACTS devices is defined not only to minimize total generation cost but also to enhance transmission security, reduce transmission loss, and improve the bus voltage profile under normal or post-contingent states. The proposed NCPSO method involves a new cognitive behavior of particle. The particle can remember its previously visited best and worst positions, thus it can explore effectively the search space. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for the IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus systems.

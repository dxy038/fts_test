Uniformity of overall and longitudinal (U<sub>o</sub>, U<sub>L</sub>) are two important items to evaluate roadway lighting quality. The fitness function incorporates two adaptive parameters in order to take both U<sub>o</sub> and U<sub>L</sub> into consideration as multi-objective function for genetic algorithm. Installation geometry is specified to build up direct connection between I-table and r-table to result in an optimal I-table for R3 road surface. It proves that the application of GA to optimize I-table is feasible in this paper.

Tubular Permanent Magnet Linear Motor are involved in a lot of industrial application as alternative to pneumatic linear actuators. The design of these devices requires to take into account several constraints and specification. The use of finite element analysis allows to estimate several phenomena like end effects, force ripple and non linearity. At the same time the calculation time required is very large. For this reason the optimization procedure proposed is based on genetic algorithms (GA) coupled with Generalized Response Surface method which interpolates the objective function of the problem. In this way the calculation time is reduced and a good exploration of objective function is possible.

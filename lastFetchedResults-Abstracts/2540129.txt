Splash erosion is one of the most important water erosion types, causing initiation of other types of water erosion. The objective of this study is to model the splash erosion using fuzzy logic approach in part of northern Karoon basin. The major land usage in the area are irrigated farming, dry land farming, pasture and degraded pasture. For the purposes of this study, soil properties including organic matter; CaCO3; surface shear strength (SSS); particle size distribution; mean weight diameter (MWD) and soil splash erosion were measured under four different slope conditions (S:%) and rainfall intensity (RI:mm.h1): 550, 580, 1550, 1580, respectively, using multiple splash sets (MSS) at 80 different locations. Splash erosion was modeled based on combinational rule of inference under five conditions for selection of different operators. The efficiency of the models was evaluated using mean square error (MSE) between observed and estimated values. Results revealed that all models are capable of predicting splash erosion. Also slope, rainfall intensity, MWD, SSS, fine sand and coarse silt attributes were found to be appropriately and precisely using splash erosion.

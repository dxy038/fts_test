The main objective of this project is to design software that would properly process signals from two microphones of the same polar patterns, in order to realize the microphone with variable directivity characteristic. The software is implemented as a Matlab GUI application. Measurement and testing of the software have been carried out in real conditions, in the presence of chatter of speakers and the average level of ambient noise. The obtained results are satisfactory and confirm previous theoretical analysis of the microphone system.

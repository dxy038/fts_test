In a multiuser interference channel, solving the optimal power and channel allocation for a weighted sum-rate maximization is a well-known non-convex problem, and has NP complexity. In this paper, we apply the recently developed deterministic channel model, and obtain a new formulation for this classic problem. Although the non-convex nature remains unavoidable, we exploit novel insights and techniques to significantly reduce the algorithm´s complexity, while still guaranteeing its asymptotic optimality. For cellular structured networks with a fixed number of cells, our algorithm has a worst-case polynomial complexity. We provide simulation solutions of this non-convex optimization in a seven-cell network. The proposed algorithm also computes performance upper bounds in all simulation cases as a numerical verification of the solutions´ optimality. The upper bounds demonstrate very small gaps from the maximum achieved objective values of the simulation solutions.

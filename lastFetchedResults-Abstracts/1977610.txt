The objective of this study was to understand the effect of different coagulants in their ability to retain isoflavones in prepared firm tofu. Harovinton beans were processed to obtain soymilk and a specific amount of this soymilk was coagulated using different types of coagulants for the preparation of tofu. A reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic method was used for determining the concentration of isoflavones in tofu and whey. Quality parameters such as the texture, color and moisture of tofu, prepared from different coagulants were also determined in this study. Tofus coagulated with different coagulants were found to contain different amounts of isoflavones. Calcium sulfate was found to be the most suitable coagulant for tofu making in terms of its high yield, retention of maximum amount of isoflavones and in obtaining a firm, but not hard texture of tofu.

Nowadays, usage of optimization methods and techniques in various applications is the key factor of increasing the systems efficiency and performance. In this paper, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller optimization in greenhouse lighting control system is studied by tuning PID controller coefficients. The advantages and disadvantages of employing multi-objective optimization methods have been discussed in many cases by researchers and engineers. In this regard, we consider the optimizing problem with varying number of objectives which are 1, 2 and 3 objectives. The simulation results verify that the improvement of the system output responses would be achieved by increasing the number of separated and independent objective functions.

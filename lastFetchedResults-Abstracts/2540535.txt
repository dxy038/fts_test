Background and Objective: Patients undergoing coronary angiography suffer from anxiety and worry for various reasons. This leads to changes in hemodynamic indices. The current study aimed to compare the effect of peer education and orientation tour on the hemodynamic indices in patients candidate for coronary angiography.



Materials and Methods: In this quasiexperimental study, population was the patients candidate for coronary angiography who referred to selected hospital of AJA University of Medical Sciences in 20142015. 177 patients were selected through convenience sling and were randomly assigned into three groups of peer education, orientation tours and control.(each group of 59 persons). The patients were trained in angiography unit by peer in the peer education group, and by researcher in the orientation tour group. Hemodynamic indices of patients were measured and recorded 2 hours after admission and two hours before angiography. Data were analyzed through using SPSS21, Chisquare test, oneway ANOVA and Paired ttest..

. Results: After intervention in peer education method, the systolic blood pressure (p=0.01), diastolic blood pressure (p=0.05), respiratory rate (p=0.03) and heart rate (p=0.001) was significantly reduced. All of these indices was significantly reduced in orientation tour group (p=0.001), while in the control group, all of the hemodynamic indices increased (p=0.001). After the intervention, there was a significant difference between intervention and control groups (p=0.001).



Conclusion: The peer education and orientation tour can lead to reduction of hemodynamic indices of patients candidate for coronary angiography  therefore, the application of these training approaches is recommended.

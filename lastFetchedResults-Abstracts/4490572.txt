This paper reports a research and development of a rescue robot using a high-pressure hydraulic actuator. We developed a practical and simple rescue robot, which used a high-pressure hydraulic actuator which generates 100 kN force at 70 MPa to drive a mechanism of jack. The objective of the robot is to jack up debris to keep or to make space of moving courses for other rescue robots and rescue tools, and to rescue victims under debris. The robot jacks up to 33 kN load. We demonstrated that the robot can jack up over 20 kN to jack up a fallen tree of 20 kN.

This paper considers multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels, where the robust transceiver is designed under imperfect channel state information (CSI). Our objective is to minimize the sum mean-square-error (MSE) subject to per-transmitter power constraints. An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. The analysis shows that the optimal equalizer is equivalent to the minimum MSE (MMSE) receiver, while the optimal precoder is obtained distributively by exploiting the Lagrangian method. Simulation results verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under CSI mismatch.

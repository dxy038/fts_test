Introduction: Psychologists emphasise on the relationships between children and caregivers, and they assign this reciprocal reactions as a main base of affectional, cognitive and social development. Indeed developmental health in each period is caused by some factors such as secure attachment as a main one. 
Objective: Therefore the relationship between attachment style and social development in dyslexic and normal children was studied as the aim of current research.
Methods: So 30 dyslexic male students and 30 normal male students who studied in forth and fifth level of perimery school at the  academic year (1389-1390) were samples of this study. Dyslexic ones were selected from learning disorder center and normal ones were selected from Semnan primery school by random multi-phases cluster sampleing method. They compeleted Reyven’s intelligential test, Ronagi’s attachment style scale and Winelend social scale.
Results: Results showed that there is a positive relation between secure attachment style and social development in both groups. Meanwhile anexity attachment style and social development were associated negatively in both groups as well as avoidant attachment style and social development in normal children. In addition significant differences were found  between two groups in attachment style, social development and their relationship.
Conclusion: Consequently, attachment style could predict social development in both dyslexic and normal children. It means  more secure attachment can predict higher social developmant.

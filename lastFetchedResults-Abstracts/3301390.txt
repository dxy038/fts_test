Background Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is characterized by widespread pain and lowered pain threshold. FMS affects an estimated 2% of the population, but optimal management of FM is still unknown. Objective To compare the treatment effect between Tuina therapy plus Baduanjin exercise with Tuina therapy only for the management of patient with fibromyalgia syndrome. Methods Patients with fibromyalgia syndrome were randomly divided into 2 groups. Patients in the experimental group received the Tuina therapy and Baduanjin exercise. Patients in the control group received Tuina therapy only. The VAS, pain threshold and FIQ scores were assessed. Result and Conclusion Tuina therapy is efficacious in relieving pain in patients with FMS. In addition, when combined with baduanjin exercise we can resolve the other core symptoms of the syndrome including fatigue and sleep disturbance. Furthermore the treatment program was effective in improving quality of life for patients with FMS.

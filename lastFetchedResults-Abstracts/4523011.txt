The objective of this paper is to design a Load Frequency Control (LFC) mechanism using a Battery Storage System (BSS) and Diesel Generation (DG) units for an isolated microgrid system. The microgrid system under consideration is comprised from two DG units, a BSS unit, and two solar panels. They were tested under different scenarios; random load variations, and loss of one of the DG units. Results show that the proposed control systems were robust and successful to regulate the systemÂ´s frequency under all conditions. The microgrid model as well as the proposed control strategy is developed within the Simulink and SimPowerSystems environments.

Great effort is currently being invested in networks exercising dynamic spectrum allocations. Such networks demand certain revisions in how radio resource management functionalities are designed. Our objective in this paper is to discuss the elements of resource reservation in dynamic spectrum networks, including various interactions between the operator, users and spectrum exchange mechanisms. We also highlight new opportunities that can be exploited by resource reservation mechanisms in next generation wireless networks.

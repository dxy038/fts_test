An automatic method has been developed for segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT) images for virtual colonoscopy obtained after a bowel preparation of a low-residue diet with ingested contrast solutions to enhance the image intensities of residual colonic materials. Removal of the enhanced materials was performed electronically by a computer algorithm. The method is a multistage approach that employs a modified self-adaptive on-line, vector quantization technique for a low-level image classification and utilizes a region-growing strategy for a high-level feature extraction. The low-level classification labels each voxel based on statistical analysis of its three-dimensional intensity vectors consisting of nearby voxels. The high-level processing extracts the labeled stool, fluid and air voxels within the colon, and eliminates bone and lung voxels which have similar image intensities as the enhanced materials and air, but are physically separated from the colon. This method was evaluated by volunteer studies based on both objective and subjective criteria. The validation demonstrated that the method has a high reproducibility and repeatability and a small error due to partial volume effect. As a result of this electronic colon cleansing, routine physical bowel cleansing prior to virtual colonoscopy may not be necessary.

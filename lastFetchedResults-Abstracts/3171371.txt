In this paper, two optimization problems of a system composed of main unit and standby unit with repairs for common cause failure and critical human error is considered. The multi-objective of availability of the system and repair cost in infinite Banach space is discussed. Under certain condition, the existence of the optimal repair rate is established by transferring the optimal problem into steady-state reliability. In particular, the optimization solution are obviously given.

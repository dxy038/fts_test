Design and implementation of navigation algorithm for intelligent racing car. The paper describes the implementation of intelligent racing car that can recognize the track automatically to run on the specifically designed complex racing track. The objective is to recognize, understand and modify the actual performance of the movements of the car during its pathway by getting information in real time from IR sensors implemented in the system. The travel trajectory consists of continuous black line of about 25 millimeters in width, on a white background in order to have acceptable functioning. Analyzing of the sensor readings was done during the travel, capturing data at the fixed sampling rate and this data was used as inputs to the algorithm to achieve corrections on the decision speed and control movements. A microcontroller assigns the required movement turn and speeds to optimize the performance in order to get a closer behavior as humans could do it without a vision system to catch its environment. The task of this work was to develop an efficient navigation algorithm and it has been successfully implemented in a Motorola S12X 16-bit microcontroller.

This paper discusses how to dispatch mobile resources to provide services for users in wireless sensor networks. The sensor nodes are able to dispatch these mobile resources by themselves, when they detect events and need the special services of mobile resources. This paper presents four mobile resource dispatch mechanisms according to two objective functions, where one centralized mechanism and three distributed mechanisms. From the results of simulation, the distributed dispatch mechanisms reduce the more dispatch packet flows than the centralized dispatch mechanism.

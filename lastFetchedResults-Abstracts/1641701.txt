The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and the practical use of the sediment-amended bricks in a demonstrative building. The air quality inside the building and the thermal quality were studied. The experimental study of the air quality is focused on the presence of VOCs, formaldehyde, ultrafine particles, including PM10 and 2.5, and the measurement of climatic parameters.

sults obtained indicated that VOCs and metals concentrations in brick dust do not exceed the regulatory limit values, and this is not the case for the concentration of formaldehyde and the concentrations of PM10 fraction, which can be explained by the adjaction of this demonstrative building to an industrial site. On the other hand, the thermal test, in situ, demonstrates that the introduction of treated sediments does not have a significant impact on the thermal performance of construction.

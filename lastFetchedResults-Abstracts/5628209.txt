Management of technology concerns the processes of managing technology development through research and development, and managing the introduction and use of technology. Expert systems are computer programs that encode knowledge about a problem into a knowledge base, and then use this knowledge to reason and draw conclusions about a particular problem or situation. Currently, expert systems are being used in many areas, but we have found no examples of expert systems being applied in the field of technology management. The objective of the paper is to set out a methodology for technologies for implementation in a small business, using an expert system structure to automate the procedure. The expert system is intended to be used as a guide, providing a structured approach that will allow a consultant to provide consistent recommendations, as well as reducing repetition in evaluating the technologies for different situations. The expert system compares customer requirements to the attributes of available technologies, and suggests which technologies should be considered for implementation. The matrix structure of the Quality Functional Deployment (&#8220;House of Quality&#8221;) approach to quality control is the basis for the expert system methodology presented

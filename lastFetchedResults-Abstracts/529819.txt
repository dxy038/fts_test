The main focus of this article is a postmodern discussion on the roots of political ethics. According to the most of postmodern theories, no common rules govern on morality, and no objective base determines original ethical values. Based on the presuppositions, ethics in particular and political ethics in common, has no transcendent back in philosophy and can't be explained rationally. Instead, anti-subject philosophies have discursive approach to the ethical, negating any rational consensus on criterions of political ethics. In response to this destructive view, here we propose a synthesis of transcendental and biological approaches.

Mark Hauser, emphasizing internal nature of ethics, argues that reality of the ethical can be explained by biological backgrounds. Such a view would have similar results with regard to Kantian approaches to the roots of ethics. Indeed, biological approach to ethics can approve Kantian transcendental standpoint, and criticize postmodern view fundamentally.

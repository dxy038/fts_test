This paper uses an approach originally developed by Roger Schank, based on learning by doing in a computer-based environment. The objective of the paper is to show ways to organize the simulation in order to implement it in new developments. Six dimensions are suggested for the implementation, and a discussion of each is provided, together with examples. The specific application presented is in the field of investigation of structural engineering failures, and is associated to a graduate level course in civil engineering. Several simulations have been implemented, with differences in contents and also in complexity. Examples of scripts are provided about simple and complex simulations.

Dutch-roll limit-cycle oscillation control is an important objective for aircraft that need to fly and maneuver at a high angle of attack (AOA). A fuzzy sliding- mode control scheme is proposed to suppress Dutch-roll limit-cycle oscillations for a slender-wing aircraft at a high AOA. The proposed control scheme combines the advantages of fuzzy logic control and sliding mode control. Simulation results show that the fuzzy sliding-mode scheme can suppress the Dutch-roll limit-cycle oscillation with complete and fast control performance in big initial angles.

Blocking artifacts are major obstacles in block-based transform coding (BTC) for low bit-rate mobile video. In this paper, we present a locally adaptive deblocking technique based on block activities around block boundaries in order to improve the visual quality of mobile video. Preprocessing makes an appropriate filtering mode chosen by removing undesired signals. The proposed filter consists of four modes depending on the types of the artifacts. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared with conventional deblocking filters including the H.264/AVC post-filter with regard to objective and subjective performance. The proposed filter improves PSNR up to 0.8dB compared with the non post-processed video and outperforms conventional filters with reduced complexity compared with the MPEG-4 deblocking filter.

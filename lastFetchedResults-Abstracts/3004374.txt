For the nonstandard job-shop scheduling problem (NJSSP) in which some operations are processed on several identical machines, we built the objective function of machine load balancing of a nonstandard scheduling algorithm. Through complexity analysis of operation processes, the algorithm has lower complexity. Experiments indicated that the scheduling result of the algorithm compares with other methods.

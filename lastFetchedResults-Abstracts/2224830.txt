The objective of this paper is to experimentally study the tensile deformation behavior of the polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and PC/ABS alloys (with the blending ratio of PC to ABS being 80:20, 60:40, 50:50 and 40:60) at strain rates 6.0 × 102 s−1, 1.2 × 103 s−1 and 2.2 × 103 s−1, respectively. The Split Hopkinson Tension Bar (SHTB) tests are carried out at room temperature (300 K) to characterize the strain rate-dependent elastic, yielding and post-yielding deformation behavior. The curves of engineering stress and engineering strain and true stress and true strain are obtained for the PC, ABS and PC/ABS alloys at different strain rates. The effects of strain rate and the ABS fraction on the deformation behavior of PC, ABS and PC/ABS alloys are discussed in details, and then a strain rate-dependent phenomenological constitutive model for PC, ABS and PC/ABS alloys is developed.

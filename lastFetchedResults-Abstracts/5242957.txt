With the rapid development of mobile computing, distributed computing and Web Service, computing environments for software have become more and more open, complicated and multivariate. More attention has been focused on how to design an adaptive and dynamic software architecture to meet the changing software computing environment. First, this paper introduces the open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) which is a typical and Successful example of such software architecture. Then, based on user requirement for quality of service (QoS), this paper proposes an approach to the adaptive and dynamic software architecture by extending the service oriented OSGi framework, This approach emphasizes the user QoS and regards it as an objective drive to dynamically adjust the software structure to improve the expected userpsilas service quality, Experimental results confirm the validity of this dynamic software architecture.

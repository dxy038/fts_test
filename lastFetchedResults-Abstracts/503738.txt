BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Communication and educational approaches in health promotion of adolescents has been challenging. Peer education is a well-known approach that not only provides youths with knowledge; they also learn the related skills in communication to convey health messages to target groups. This paper describes the impact of peer education method on KAP of the mothers concerning the middle school girls' pubertal health.

METHODS: This experimental study was carried out on 100 mothers who divided into two groups (n=50). The participants were allocated in each group randomly. Traditional education was conducted by lecturing for one group and peer education was used for the second group. Self made questionnaire was employed for data collection at base and 1.5 month follow up. Scoring was ordered as: knowledge and practice scale; <50 means low, medium with 50-75 score and >75 was described as high. Attitude scaled up with "maximum and minimum" divided on 3 concepts: negative, positive and buffer (no idea) and then compared in two groups.

FINDINGS: Average attitude score after training in peer group was 86.25±0.49 and in lecture group was 48.25±0.78 (p=0.007). Average knowledge score in peer group was 89.33±2.15 and in lecture group was 43.73±5.67 (p<0.001). Also the average practice score was 80.8±21.36 in peer group and it was 56±38.86 in lecture group (p<0.001). Knowledge, attitude and practice in lecture group respectively in 16, 66 and 42 people and in peer group respectively in 78, 96 and 74 people were in good level (p<0.002).

CONCLUSION: The results showed that the girl peer education approach will increase the average of knowledge, attitude and practice of mothers to pubertal health topic. Puberty health education using active learning methods and the groups involved with subject is recommended.

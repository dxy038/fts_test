Change detection is the process of identifying differences that have occurred in the terrain situation at different times. The Earth Observation (EO) data contribute to obtain the rapid and reliable change detection information making them particular and important source of information for Land Border Monitoring. Objective of the analysis is to provide consistent change detection method based on image processing techniques applied to the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired over the same geographical area, but at two different time instances. The approach adopted in our work requires incorporation of results with the additional information derived from analysis based on mathematical morphology (MM) techniques and visual interpretation of multitemporal VHR optical satellite images.

Objective: To investigate the relationship between axial segmental myoclonus and propriospinal myoclonus.
Methods: A patient with a 3-year history of axial jerks evoked by physical effort and unexpected somesthetic and auditory stimulations was investigated. Polygraphy with multiple-channel axial and limb EMG recording was performed with off-line analysis.
Results: Spontaneous, somesthetic and acoustic evoked jerks always began in the left rectus abdominis muscle with a single or repetitive EMG burst that could spread to other rostral and caudal muscles without engagement of cranial nerve innervated muscles, consistent with propriospinal propagation. Spontaneous and evoked jerks could however also appear focally in abdominal muscles and remain localized without any diffusion to other muscle segments.
Conclusion: Focal axial myoclonus and propriospinal myoclonus may coexist. Conceivably the same spinal generator responsible for a monomeric segmental myoclonus may, under conditions of heightened excitability, cause a multimeric propriospinally propagated muscular activation.

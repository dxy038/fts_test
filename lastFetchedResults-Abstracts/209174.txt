The objective of this study was to develop a cost minimizing pattern for cube sugar and sugar
transportation from production centers to refinement and storage centers and finally to
distribution and consumption centers in Fars province. Producing centers are Marvdasht
(27.3%), Eghlid (27.9%), Fasa (11.3%), Kavar (7.3%) and Mamasani (20.2%). Some of the
province’s cube sugar and sugar is provided by import. The refinement and storage centers
receiving the production of the mentioned producing centers are Marvdasht, Yasuj, Boosher,
Eghlid, Abade, Lar, Abarghoo, Fasa, Tehran, Isfahan, Mamasani, Kazeroon, Istahban and
Sepidan. The consumption centers also include all of Fars province townships. The
transportation cost of the current transporting network amount to 56.55 billion Rials reducing by
23% in optimal solution. Of the figure, transportation network between producing and
refinement and storage centers accounts for 71.1% and 28.9% of the total cost rise from
transportation network between refinement and storage and distribution and consumption
centers. The main changes in network between producing and refinement and storage centers
relate to transporting paths of Marvdasht, Eqlid and Mamasani. In optimal pattern production of
Marvdasht is allocated to Yasuj, Boosher and Abarghoo in addition to Marvdasht and Shiraz. In
optimal pattern, Eqlid’s production instead of Shiraz’s refinement and storage centers is
transported to Tehran and Isfahan ones. A part of Mamasani’s production being transported to
Tehran and Isfahan in current network is allocated to Yasuj and Boosher. In the transportation
network between refinement and storage and distribution and consumption centers the main
difference of current and optimal solutions relates to refinement and storage of Shiraz, Eqlid and
Abade.

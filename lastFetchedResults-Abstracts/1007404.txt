Machining of composite materials is an important and current topic in modern researches on manufacturing processes. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization of the drilling process of a laminate composite material is proposed. Two mutually conflicting objectives are optimized: material removal rate, which represents the productivity; and delamination factor, which characterizes the superficial quality. A micro-genetic algorithm was implemented to carry out the optimization process. An a posteriori approach was used to obtain a set of optimal solutions. Finally, the obtained outcomes were arranged in graphical form (Paretoâ€™s front) and analyzed to make the proper decision for different process preferences.

We consider the application of multi-objective statistical game theory to a remote sensing satellite attitude control. Statistical game theory is a generalization of mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> control, where we have two objective functions and we optimize the higher order cumulants of these objective functions. We use previously developed satellite attitude model with thrusters, gravity torquers and a reaction wheel cluster. Then we control the satellite attitude using the statistical game (Minimal Cost Variance/H<sub>infin</sub>) control, H<sub>infin</sub> control, and mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> control. Throughout the simulations, statistical game control has an extra degree of freedom to improve the performance and reduce the overshoot and undershoot compared to either H<sub>infin</sub> control and H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> control. The simulations show that the performance of Minimal Cost Variance/H<sub>infin</sub> is 8.8% and 5.4% faster than H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> and H<sub>infin</sub> control, respectively. Moreover, the control actions of MCV/H<sub>infin</sub> is reduced by 67% compared to H<sub>infin</sub> control and 55% compared to H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> control. So, we achieve both performance improvement while saving the control energy. In the case of the stability margin, MCV/H<sub>infin</sub> control has the highest stability margin, H<sub>infin</sub> control has the lowest, and H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> control an intermediate value between those two.

The objective of this study was to assess intrasubject reliability and intersubject variability of a parallel-cascade system identification method for quantitative, objective measurement of ankle dynamic stiffness, and separation of intrinsic and reflex components. The test-retest experiments were carried out at different operating points. Very good intrasubject reliability (r&gt;0.8) was found, but a high intersubject variability. These findings suggest that this method can be applied for precise diagnosis and tracking the development of changes in joint stiffness

In this paper we present a coordination strategy for the supervision of networked control systems subject to coordination constraints. Such a system paradigm is characterized by a set of spatially distributed dynamic systems, connected via communication channels, with possibly dynamical coupling and constraints among them which need to be controlled and coordinated in order to accomplish their overall objective. It will be shown by examples in electrical power distribution problems that the strategy also enhances the fault tolerance of the system by exploiting the quite large physical and analytical redundancy that typically exists.

Objective
ation of hybrid layers (HLs) within resin-infiltrated dentine results from multiple degradation factors, including collagenolytic activity of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Inhibition of host-derived MMPs may, therefore, slow the degradation of HL. The null hypothesis tested is that the presence of MMP-2 is similar regardless of chlorhexidine (CHX) pre-treatment or the use of an adhesive.
s
ed dentine prepared from extracted human teeth was divided into 4 groups: (G1) mineralised powder (control group); (G2) dentine powder treated with 1% phosphoric acid for 1 min; (G3) 1% phosphoric acid-etched dentine treated with Adper Scotchbond 1 XT (SB1XT; 3M ESPE); (G4) 1% phosphoric acid-etched dentine treated with 0.2% CHX followed by SB1XT. The concentration of detectable pro-MMP-2 and MMP-2 was assayed using a colorimetric assay system (QuantiSir). In addition, the presence of MMP-2 in the HL was assessed in 1 year-aged adhesiveâ€“dentine interfaces using an immunohistochemical approach under FEI-SEM/TEM.
s
tine powder treated with 1% phosphoric acid (G2), MMP-2 level decreased compared to controls (G1); the application of SB1XT (G3) resulted in an increase of MMP-2, whilst 0.2% CHX before SB1XT application (G4), reduced MMP-2. The FEI-SEM/TEM analysis revealed MMP-2 distribution within the HL of aged interfaces showing increase MMP-2 patterns in the control group and minor labelling in the CHX-pretreated specimens.
sion
sults of this study support the use of non-toxic MMPs inhibitors, such as CHX, as an appropriate additional step in bonding procedures in order to increase the longevity of the adhesive restorations.

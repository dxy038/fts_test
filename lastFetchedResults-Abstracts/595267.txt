Objective: To find out the frequency of central obesity and risk factors for obesity based on waist circumference (WC) in healthy volunteers.Material and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study in terms of data collection and analysis was conducted at Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) and Welfare Clinics in Peshawar City, from November 2005 till April2006 (6months). A convenient sample ofl031 healthy volunteers accompanying their patient to Out Patient Department (OPD), Wkrd at HMC and at welfare clinics in the city were included in the study. A structured interview questionnaire was administered to all participants and their anthropometric measurements taken in standardized way. Results: Out of1031 individuals (778 males, 253 females) with mean age of35.75Â±13.45 years, the frequency ofhigh waist circumference was 57%0, significantly higher in females (89%) compared to males (47%). It increased with age peaking at 49-58year age group and declining thereafter. Married subjects (67%), illiterates (69%0), housewives (96%0), car-owners (61%) and hypertensive subjects had significantly higher frequencies ofincreased waist circumference. Ethnicity (p=0.45), smoking (p=0.36) and awareness ofrisks (p=0.91) did not show significant association with frequency ofincreased waist. Conclusion: There is a very high frequency ofincreased waist circumference particularly among females. here is progressive increase in waist with increasing age with a decline later in life. There is positive association ofincreased waist with occupation, educational status, use ofcars and married marital status. There is no association ofhigh waist with smoking, awareness or ethnicity.

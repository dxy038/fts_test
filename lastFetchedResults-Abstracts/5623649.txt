This paper presents the development of conceptual models that can be used in the creation of certain types of supply chain simulation projects. The supply chain considered is composed of four elements: suppliers, manufacturer, retailers, and the consumer market. The presented ideas can be used in supply chain simulation projects, which objective can be, for instance, to study the bullwhip effect or new collaboration practices. ARENA simulation models using the conceptual models presented are currently under development

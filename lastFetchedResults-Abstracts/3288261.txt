The Block Matching is a temporal compression technique used in the video encoding. The main purpose of this method is to determine the displacements of each block of pixels between two successive frames. This technique, performed in the step of motion estimation, occupies the majority of the total time of video coding. The aim of this work is to give a comparative study various search algorithms by Block Matching. This study does not focus only on the complexity and computation time of each algorithm, but it also gives objective and subjective quality assessment of decoded video frame by means of each search algorithm.

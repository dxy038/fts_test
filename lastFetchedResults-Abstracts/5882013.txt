Wireless topology control is the process of structuring the connectivity between network nodes to achieve some network-wide goal. This paper presents a cognitive network approach to achieving the objectives of power and spectrum management. We cast the problem as a two phased non-cooperative game and use the properties of potential game theory to ensure the existence of, and convergence to, a desirable Nash equilibrium. Although this is a multi-objective optimization and the spectrum management problem is NP-hard, this selfish cognitive network constructs a topology that minimizes the maximum transmission power while simultaneously using, on average, less than 12% extra spectrum, as compared to the ideal solution.

This paper proposes a new robust design of power system stabilizers (PSSs) in a multimachine power system using a heuristic optimization method. The structure of each PSS used is similar to that of a conventional lead/lag stabilizer. The proposed design regards a multimachine power system with PSSs as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) control system. Additionally, a multiplicative uncertainty model is taken into account in the power system representation. Accordingly, the robust stability margin can be guaranteed by a multiplicative stability margin (MSM). The presented method utilizes the MSM as the design specification for robust stability. To acquire the control parameters of PSSs, a control design in MIMO system is formulated as an optimization problem. In the selection of objective function, not only disturbance attenuation performance but also robust stability indices are considered. Subsequently, the hybrid tabu search and evolutionary programming (hybrid TS/EP) is employed to search for the optimal parameters. The significant effects of designed PSSs are investigated under several system operating conditions.

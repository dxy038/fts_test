This paper presents an objective evaluation of previously unexplored biometric techniques utilizing patterns identifiable in human eye movements to distinguish individuals. The distribution of primitive eye movement features are compared between eye movement recordings using algorithms based on the following statistical tests: the Ansari-Bradley test, the Mann-Whitney U-test, the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the two-sample t-test, and the two-sample Cramer-von Mises test. Score-level information fusion is applied and evaluated by: weighted mean, support vector machine, random forest, and likelihood ratio. The accuracy of each comparison/jusion algorithm is evaluated, with results suggesting that, on high resolution eye tracking equipment, it is possible to obtain equal error rates of 16.5% and rank-1 identification rates of 82.6% using the two-sample Crame&#769;r-von Mises test and score-level information fusion by random forest, the highest accuracy results on the considered dataset.

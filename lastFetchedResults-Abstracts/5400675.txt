In this contribution, we calculate the noise spectra as function of pump current and complex backscattering coefficients when the SRL is biased in the bidirectional-continuous wave regime. We consider a two mode rate equation model in the Langevin formulation. Within linear approximation, perturbations concerning the total intensity and carrier inversion dynamics decouple from the energy distribution processes between the two modes.

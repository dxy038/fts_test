Currently, the Internet provides researchers with the opportunity to conduct online surveys in a more efficient and effective way than was previously allowed by traditional means. While the popularity of online data collection methodology has increased, only a limited number of studies have been done related to the topic of using Web-based surveys specifically for academic research. The purpose of this research project-in-progress is twofold. The first objective is to explore potential differences in attitudes toward using Web-based surveys as a tool for academic research among information technology versus non-information technology researchers. The second goal is to investigate the relationship between participantsÂ´ degree of computer literacy and their acceptance of and trust in Web-based surveys.

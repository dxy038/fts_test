Electric vehicle (EV) are one solution for the next decades to face the greenhouse gases emission issue. The most important drawbacks about the EV concern the limited range depending of the battery performances and the charging time. The vehicle range is estimated with standard drive cycles and ideal conditions. The objective of this paper is to propose a simulation tool to calculate the energy distribution in the EV including the thermal exchange between the heating system and the cabin. Indeed, the heating system (using thermal resistance) is an important energy consumer in the vehicle. All models are organized using Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR).

Objectives: Current international guidelines recommend 6-9
months of Isoniazid (INH) preventive chemotherapy to prevent
the development of active tuberculosis in children exposed to
smear positive tuberculosis (TB) patients. The aim of the present
study was to evaluate the adherence to a six-month of supervised
INH prophylaxis program and outcome in children with household
exposure to an adult pulmonary tuberculosis index case in
Varamin city, Tehran, Iran.
Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted among household
contacts in Varamin city, between 1997- 1998. All children
 < 6 years old with a household contact with an adult pulmonary
tuberculosis index case were screened for tuberculosis and given
supervised INH preventive chemotherapy once active tuberculosis
was excluded as planned . Adherence and outcome were monitored.
Results: In total, 31 index cases and 128 household contact cases
were identified; 23 (18%) children  < 6 years old experienced
household exposure, who were fully evaluated. two children were
treated for active tuberculosis and 15 (12%) children received preventive
chemotherapy. All children completed 6 months of supervised
INH prophylaxis with normal clinical examination in 3 and
6 months after beginning INH prophylaxis. No side effects (peripheral
neuropathy or liver damage) were reported or observed
within this study.
Conclusions: Strategy of six months of supervised INH chemoprophylaxis
is successful, particularly in children who are at a high
risk to progress to disease following exposure.

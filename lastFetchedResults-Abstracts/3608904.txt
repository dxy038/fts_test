A large laboratory demonstration electro-magnetic launcher is currently under construction. The design objective is to launch a 0.3 kg projectile at muzzle velocities up to 3 km/s in a 4 m barrel using a peak accelerating current of 1.5 MA. The primary energy source is a 15 MJ pulsed homopolar generator. Compression of its output pulse is achieved using a 5 MJ toroidal storage coil and a 1.5 MA opening switch. The design of all components was completed in the period April to October 1979, and the detailed design and fabrication is at present underway. Completion is anticipated in mid-1981. This paper outlines the design effort and present fabrication status.

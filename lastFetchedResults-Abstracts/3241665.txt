With the gradual implementation of the "separation of power plant and grid, competitive bidding&#8221;, the needs of energy conservation, the continuous improvement of the pollution charge system and the increasing of the scale of new energy power combining to the grid make the grid put forward higher requirements. On the basis of the traditional single objective optimal load distribution, this paper build a multi-objective plant level load which based on ideal point method to optimize the allocation model to meet the economic, environmental, and fast needs. It uses adaptive immune vaccine algorithm to find the optimal solution for the model. Finally, an example is given to show that the model is correct and effective.

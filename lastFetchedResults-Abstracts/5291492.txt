This paper presents the study of stabilization with motion planning of a four rotors mini-flying machine (robot with four rotors rotorcraft). A particular design of this structure where two rotors are directional (X4 bidirectional rotors) is also presented. The dynamic of this last system involves five control inputs which are computed to stabilize the engine with predefined trajectories. Our aim is to obtain control algorithms using the backstepping approach in order to stabilize the engine in hovering and to generate its trajectory

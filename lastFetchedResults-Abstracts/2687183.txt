A dual-active-bridge-based single-stage ac/dc converter may find a wide range of emerging applications such as interfacing plug-in hybrid vehicles with the ac grid, interconnection of dc grid, etc. This type of converter can be used due to unique features such as 1) high-frequency isolation resulting in a) high power density and b) safety and voltage matching; 2) bidirectional power flow; 3) soft switching leading to higher efficiency. In this paper, a modulation strategy has been proposed that results in 1) open-loop power factor correction; 2) zero current switching in the ac-side converter for all load conditions; 3) linear power relationship for easy control implementation; and 4) Zero voltage switching in the load side converter. The converter with the proposed control has been analyzed. Simulation and experimental results on a 1-KW prototype confirm the advantages.

The objective of this paper is to perform simulations on a sliding-mode controller and a PWM-mode controller and evaluate their parameters such as current, acceleration, and speed in the time domain. The controllers are tested on a permanent magnet, brushed DC servomotor. The performance of each controller is analyzed with respect to a step input. Speed-torque and voltage-current characteristics are also presented

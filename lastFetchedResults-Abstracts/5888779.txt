Within an international research project, funded by the European Commission, the objective was to develop a real-time positioning system, suitable to get workers position on construction sites. In the paper the prerequisites and requirements for such a positioning system are given, which has to be applicable for indoor and outdoor environments. Based on this, adequate sensors are selected and first experimental results show their potential to fulfill the requirements. An important aspect is bidirectional data communication, for which an adequate solution was found. Finally a completely new software design for data management and processing is outlined, which will be the basis for the next development step.

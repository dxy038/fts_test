
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In Iranian folk medicine, Citrus aurantium flower extract is used to treat some neural diseases such as sleep disorder and anxiety. Tend to use medicinal herbs to treat diseases such as seizure, is growing. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the anticonvulsant effect of sour orange flowers of   Citrus aurantium.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 42 adult male Wistar rats (200-250g) were divided into 6 groups: control (PTZ), positive control (phenobarbital) and extract treated groups (75, 150, 300 and 600 mg/kg, i.p,). Fresh sour orange flowers were collected, methanolic extract (70%) was provided by percolator, after the evaporation of methanol, the extract was dried by oven at the 40°C. Pentylentetrazole (90 mg/kg) was used for induction of seizure. Changes in the onset time of seizure, duration of seizure, percent of mortality and percent of seizure protection were determined in different groups and compared with control (PTZ) and positive control (phenobarbital).
FINDINGS: The extract (300 mg/kg), significantly reduced the latency of onset of seizure (198±8%) as compared with control (78±3%) (p < 0.05), also duration of seizure significantly was reduced by the extract (300mg/kg) (430±46%) compared with control (1350±110%) (p < 0.05). Percent of seizure protection significantly was increased by extract in comparison with control group; the dose of 600 mg/kg (78±6%) was the most effective dose in compared to control (0%) (p <  0.05). Seizure related mortality was significantly decreased by extract (300 mg/kg) (0%) in compared to control (36%) (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, it seems that hydro-methanolic extract of Citrus aurantium can be used to prevent seizures.

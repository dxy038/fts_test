The objective of this paper is to investigate the non-linear performance of some of the most widely used GaAs MESFET models. DC, AC and intermodulation (IMD) measurements were carried out on 300 &#956;m devices, and equivalent circuit parameters were extracted and optimized. Model predictions of IMD were investigated through several figures of merit: gain, IMD3, IMD5, compression points and intercept points. No clear cut "winner" among the models was observed, but Statz and Advanced Materka have the best overall performance.

Grassland is very valuable natural resources of mankind. So the monitoring of grassland is very important to the protection of terrestrial ecosystems and national development. At present, remote sensing has become a very important tool for the grassland monitoring. In the field of remote sensing, the simulation and modeling of vegetation canopypsilas radiation transfer is a significant theoretical foundation of the quantified application on vegetation monitoring.In this paper, the first part is summarizing the application of Bidirectional Reflectance Model for vegetation in remote sensing, especially introducing two kinds of model: Radiation Transfer Model (RT Model) and Geometric Optics Model (GO Model). The second important part is the construction of a new model, which is bidirectional reflectance model for vegetation based on overlap function of isosceles triangle leaf. Amongst, the overlapping projection area can be calculated exactly with any inclination distribution illuminated by sun direction and observation direction. The third part is validating the accuracy of overlap function model with computer simulation method. Whatpsilas more, a sensitivity analysis of model results by comparing the simulation result is done in the paper to make some conclusions with reference value. In addition, the results show that the model built by author are suitable for grass vegetation and can resolve the hotspot problem. Also, the solution indicates that the built model fit preferably the exact phenomenon.

In this paper, a strategy based on Genetic algorithm for optimal allocation of reactive power resources in distribution system with microgrid is presented. In the proposed approach uncertainty in power generation of renewable based DG is considered. The main objective is to allocate fixed and switched capacitors as reactive power resources for voltage control within the desired limits on a distribution system with microgrid in both grid connected and islanded modes of operation in single stage. Case study was carried out in a local distribution system with DGs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

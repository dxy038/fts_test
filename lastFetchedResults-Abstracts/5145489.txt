A novel scalar control technique based on resistance emulation for harmonic elimination for a single phase shunt active filter (SAF) system is proposed in this paper. The control objective of the filter is to regulate the voltage source inverter using a closed loop PI controller so as to emulate a resistance across input sinusoidal source. In such a case, input voltage and current will have the same wave shape and will be in phase. This resistance emulation concept has been implemented using a scalar control technique without sensing the input voltage and load current. The simulation results for various kinds of nonlinear loads are presented in this paper.

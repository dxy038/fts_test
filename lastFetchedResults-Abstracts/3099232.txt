The evaluation of a sentry system is dependent both on the performance of the implemented sensors and on the disposition of these sensors. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the global evaluation of the sentry system, taking into account the disposition of the sensors. Our approach is to evaluate the performance of an intruder in terms of detection probability. In order to evaluate the vulnerability of each objective under sentry, it is necessary to compute the optimal intrusion, for many different objectives. We propose a method for a parallel computation of these intrusions. Our approach implements an optimal approximation of the intrusion by means of dynamical programming sub-problems. The global optimization is done by simulation algorithms.

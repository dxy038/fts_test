Background and Objective: Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is due to lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) involvement; if it is left either unattended miss treated it can be followed by significant disabilities. This study was done to compare the neurolysis and nerve resection in treatment refractory of Meralgia paresthetica.
Materials and Methods: This descriptive - comparative study was carried out on 14 patients (7 males and 7 females) afflicted with Meralgia paresthetica and resisted to theraputical regiment in Poorsina hospital in Rasht, North of Iran during 2001-08. The patients were selected non-randomly and neurolysis were gone under either neurolysis or nerve resection surgery with 18-month follow-up.
Results: All 5 patients with neurolysis operation were found to have the recurrent symptoms. Non of the patient operated with nerve resection demostrated the clinical manifestation of the recurment sympotms, following 18 month follow-up. The success rate of neurolysis and nerve resection were determined to be 3% and 98.8% respectively. Six women and three men are LFCN-resected; a woman and four men treated with neurolysis. The mean age and the disease onset length were 64.6%±9.8 year and 18±11 months, respectively.
Conclusion: Nerve resection method is suggested in patients with Meralgia paresthetica resisted to theraputical treatment.

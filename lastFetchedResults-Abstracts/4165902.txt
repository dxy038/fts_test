In linear predictive speech coding algorithms, transmission of linear predictive coding (LPC) parameters-often transformed to the line spectrum frequencies (LSF) representation-consumes a large part of the total bit rate of the coder. Typically, the LSF parameters are highly correlated from one frame to the next, and a considerable reduction in bit rate can be achieved by exploiting this interframe correlation. However, interframe coding leads to error propagation if the channel is noisy, which possibly cancels the achievable gain. In this paper, several algorithms for exploiting interframe correlation of LSF parameters are compared. Especially, performance for transmission over noisy channels is examined, and methods to improve noisy channel performance are proposed. By combining an interframe quantizer and a memoryless &#8220;safety-net&#8221; quantizer, we demonstrate that the advantages of both quantization strategies can be utilized, and the performance for both noiseless and noisy channels improves. The results indicate that the best interframe method performs as good as a memoryless quantizing scheme, with 4 bits less per frame. Subjective listening tests have been employed that verify the results from the objective measurements

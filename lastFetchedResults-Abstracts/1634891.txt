A cysteine was introduced into the FG-loop (P187C) of CYP51 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) for selective labeling with BODIPY and fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) analysis. Förster radius for the BODIPY–heme pair was calculated assuming that the distance between the heme and Cys187 in solution corresponds to that in the crystal structure of ligand free MTCYP51. Interaction of MTCYP51 with azole inhibitors ketoconazole and fluconazole or the substrate analog estriol did not influence the fluorescence, but titration with the substrate lanosterol quenched BODIPY emission, the effect being proportional to the portion of substrate bound MTCYP51. The detected changes correspond to ∼10 Å decrease in the calculated distance between BODIPY-Cys187 and the heme. The results confirm (1) functional importance of conformational motions in the MTCYP51 F/G segment and (2) applicability of FRET to monitor them in solution.

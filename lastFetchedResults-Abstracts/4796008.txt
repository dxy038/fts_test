As a new research scope, blind signal separation (BSS) is attracting more and more interests. Independent component analysis (ICA) is an important solution to the problem of BSS, under the assumption conditions of ICA, a BSS algorithm using oblique projection operators is proposed in this paper. The autocorrelation matrix of mixing matrix is used to construct the objective function while the principle of information maximization is adopted to iterate and extract the component, and the mixing matrix can be obtained in a direct way. The description of the problem is demonstrated, and the detailed flow of the proposed method is listed. Simulation results show the suggested scheme is valid even when the weakest signal is less than -80 dB to others.

Objective: To find out whether Rocuronium produces intubating conditions as good as Suxamethonium in rapid sequence induction (RSI) in elective caesarean section.
Design: Quasi Experimental Study.
Setting: Operative rooms of Hameed Latif Hospital Lahore.
Subjects: 50 ASA I and II parturients scheduled for elective caesarean section under general anaesthesia:
Interventions: Anaesthesia was induced with 5mg/kg Thiopentone and neuromuscular blocking agent using RSI. Group I (n=25) received Suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg and group II received Rocuronium 1.0 mg/kg. Intubation was done 60s after the administration of muscle relaxant. Main outcome: Intubating conditions using the scoring criteria described by Cooper et al. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in jaw relaxation, vocal cord relaxation and response to intubation in both groups. Overall intubating conditions in group I & II were excellent in 84 %and 76% patients while good in 16% and 24 % patients respectively with no statistically significant difference (p>0.05).
Conclusion: Our study showed that Rocuronium 1.0 mg/kg provides equally good intubating conditions when compared to Suxamethonium 1.5mg/kg in elective caesarean section using RSI at 60s.

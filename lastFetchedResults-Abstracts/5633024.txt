In the integrated next-generation wireless systems (NGWS), users are always connected to the best available networks and used to switch between different networks based on their service needs. It is an important and challenging issue to support seamless handoff management in NGWS. The objective of this paper is to develop a seamless handoff management protocol for NGWS. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based adaptive handoff (FLAH) management protocol is developed which is then integrated with an existing cross layer handoff protocol. Afterward, the handoff performance comparison of the existing protocol and our proposed protocol is carried out. The simulation results exhibit that, proposed fuzzy logic-based handoff management protocol has much better performance than conventional protocols for both intra and intersystem handoffs.

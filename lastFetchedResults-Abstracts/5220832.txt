In this paper, the design of a position sensor for VSI fed AC machines is presented. The objective of this system is to suppress undesirable voltage harmonics and hence to minimize electromagnetic torque ripple. The optimized pulse width modulation (PWM) is used as a basis for the design of this sensor. In the authorsÂ´ study, and in comparison with the classical system, harmonics are eliminated directly on the control output signal of the position sensor. Thus, the obtained inverter control circuit is of a very simple design. The obtained numerical simulation results are compared to practical data

A scheme for the proactive allocation of network resources to mobile users, based on a pricing framework, is proposed. The objective is the reduction of service discontinuation events attributed to handovers in the cellular infrastructure. The future base station, where network resources have to be reserved proactively, is determined by means of a path prediction algorithm. The network receives a fee for providing the advance reservation service to the user. The exact price is determined after a sequential bargaining procedure, modeled as a two-person non-cooperative game between the mobile user and the network The efficiency of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulations.

This paper presents the feasibility and optimization analysis of submersible water pumping system application in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The main objective of this study is to design the optimum sizing of system components through HOMER software (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) to fullfill the requirement of 2.2 kWh/d DC primary load with 1.9 kWp load. The simulation result show the optimal sizing of 1.5 kW photovoltaic system, 12 batteries of 220 Ah with 36 V system voltage and 300 W of converter. This configuration is the most technically feasible to lift a water of 30 liters/min at 70 meters depth.

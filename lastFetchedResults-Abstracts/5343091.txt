In this paper an innovative procedure for the synthesis of linear non periodic phased arrays for SAR applications is presented. The main objective consists in minimizing the number of elements while optimizing the efficiency of the amplifiers. The procedure is implemented in three steps. Preliminary results are presented demonstrating that a reduction in the number of elements in the order of 20-30% with respect to existing conventional antennas may be achieved without sacrificing the performances.

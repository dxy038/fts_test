An novel control strategy of the series loaded resonant converter is presented. The main objective of the control strategy is to minimize the switching losses in the main switching elements (IGBT). The results are experimentally verified on a 60 kW/25 kHz prototype converter. The IGBT losses obtained with the proposed control strategy are compared with those of the commonly used frequency control and phase-shift control strategies. With the proposed control strategy it is found that the losses are reduced in the entire operating range compared to phase-shift control. The same statement is valid also for frequency control, except for the highest output voltage

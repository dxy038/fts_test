This paper proposes a two-layer evolution strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm to integrate PHEVs into a residential distribution grid. A novel business model is developed for PHEVs to provide ancillary service and participate in peak load shaving. A virtual time-of-use rate is proposed to reflect the load deviation of the system. Then, an objective function is designed to aggregate the peak load shaving, power quality improving, charging cost, battery degradation cost and frequency regulation earnings into one cost function. The ESPSO approach can benefit the system in four aspects by: (1) improving the power quality; (2) reducing the peak load; (3) providing frequency regulation service; and (4) minimizing the total virtual cost. Finally, various simulations are carried out based on different control strategies, and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

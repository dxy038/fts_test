In this paper we propose a test methodology for testing broadband services which can be delivered in next generation networks (NGN). This methodology has different capabilities in order to precisely test diverse functionalities and specifications of broadband equipment while measuring their performance. This solution contains a master methodology according to which a testbed was created to be a physical as well as theoretical platform for testing and recognizing features of various devices. In this paper we introduce distinct testing areas and consider each area separately to investigate multifarious existed aspects of testing. Each area includes several topics each of which is going to test one or set of special characteristics related to each other. All tests in an area follow the same objective. This structure results in a systematic organism to accurately classify different tests which can be existed and executed on broadband equipment. The strategy has been designed and practically implemented in Iran Telecommunications Research Center (ITRC) where a lab named NGN Pilot exists.

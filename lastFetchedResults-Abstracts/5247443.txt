The objective of this project was to determine the electric current, voltage and power in the Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority (RTA) trolley bus system as a function of time and location. First, a computer based load flow study was performed using the &#8220;Transportation Systems Energy Management Model (EMM)&#8221; of the Rail Systems Center of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA. This program was developed to model railroad systems. Trolley bus system parameters such as the rolling resistance, number and spacing of stations (stops), or traction motor characteristics are quite different from railroad system parameters. Therefore, parameters were established for the RTA system and used as input files or, in some cases, modifications to the FORTRAN code of the EMM program. The validity of the computer study results was confirmed showing that computer studies can be used with confidence to study trolley bus systems, if the proper modifications are made in the input files and in the FORTRAN code of the EMM program

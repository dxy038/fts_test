Currently, there is interest in developing both real-time and offline computer models of the geo-temporal wideband (1 MHz instantaneous bandwidth) high frequency (HF) skywave channel. The HF wideband channel will allow the use of spread spectrum techniques to provide covert communications with low probability of intercept (LPI) and antijam protection. The objective of this paper is to determine the extent to which oblique narrowband channel measurements can be used to infer effects in the wideband skywave channel. If oblique narrowband channel measurements can be used as a basis for developing wideband channel models, a large number of existing narrowband measurements can be made available for this task.

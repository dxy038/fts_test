Security has two dimensions of objective and subjective which the former dimension is called feeling security. It is, therefore, necessary to have measurable criterion to manage properly and efficiently the feeling security and achieve the strategic targets. This article intends to introduce the criteria of feeling security measure as a strategic instrument for providing public security and establishing social order, enabling a strategic mapping field to observe the practice of strategies. So, responding to increasingly demands of citizens for security and feeling safe, this research is done to construct an IRAN Feeling security scale (IFSS) and by Factor Analysis, its validity and reliability measured. 2599 people throughout the provinces of the state filled the IFSS form, accomplishing the research target. The validity of scale is done by Factor Analysis.
On this base, Five Factors were extracted. The factors were named after theoretical basis and the contents of the questions as life security feeling, chastity security feeling, individual economy security, public economy security feeling and social security feeling. The reliability of the scale estimated through internal consistency and by using Cronbach Alpha coefficient.
The least reliability in public economy security feeling (<x. 85%) and the most reliability in social security feeling (<x. 97%) were obtained. In general, the coefficients obtained of validity and reliability for IFSS was very satisfactory. At the level of P<.0 001 was very meaningful. According to the results of IFSS research, it is qualified to be used for recognition of feeling security in IRAN.

Prophylactic gastropexy is a procedure that prevents the occurrence of a life threatening condition known as gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) in dogs. The objective of this study was to compare incisional, belt loop and minimally invasive endoscopically assisted gastropexy by evaluating different parameters such as surgical time, length of scar and score of pain in dogs. Twenty-one healthy, mixed-breed adult dogs weighting 14.3 Â± 2.6 kg were randomly divided into three groups. Three gastropexy techniques applied in the following order: incisional (group I), belt loop (group B), and endoscopically assisted gastropexy (group E). Surgical time, anesthetic time, length of surgical incision and score of pain 3 h after surgery were recorded for all dogs. Two weeks after the surgery, positive-contrast gastrography was used to evaluate stomach position and total gastric emptying time. Ultrasonography was also used to evaluate the gastropexy two months after the surgery. Adhesion was confirmed two months after the surgery between the stomach wall at the pyloric antrum and the right side of the body wall in all dogs by ultrasound. The mean surgical time, length of surgical incision and score of pain were significantly lower in group E compared to group I and B (P<0.05). No significant differences were found in total gastric emptying time and gastropexy thickness post-operatively (P>0.05). Due to advantages observed in the current study, the endoscopically assisted technique seems to be a suitable alternative to open incisional and belt loop gastropexies for performing prophylactic gastropexy, especially when performed by skilled surgeons.

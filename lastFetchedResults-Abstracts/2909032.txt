Electric equipments connected to the mains usually consist of a converter, a DC intermediate circuit and an inverter. The power from the mains should be consumed with unity power factor, the mains current should be harmonic, the power flow bidirectional, and also the equipment should be functional under distorted mains conditions. The dual-current control of the converter has been recently developed to meet the mentioned requirements. An overview and comparison of several different control methods are presented in the paper.

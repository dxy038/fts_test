Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with insulin analog Novomix30 in Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes using the results of the A1chieve study.
Methods: The A1chieve study was a 24 week, open-label, multicenter, observational study of people with type 2 diabetes. The study was conducted in 28 countries across four continents on 66,726 people with type 2 diabetes, both insulin users and non-insulin users, to assess the safety and efficacy of Novomix30. This article reports the results of 919 Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin Novomix30.
Results: After 24 weeks treatment with Novomix30, HbA1c reduced significantly (P < 0.001). Despite a significant reduction in fasting blood sugar and postprandial sugars, the incidence of severe and nocturnal hypoglycemia was significantly decreased in prior insulin users. The mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly and the quality of life improved in all patients.
Conclusion: Insulin Novomix30 was well tolerated despite good glycemic control and the incidence of hypoglycemia was not increased in Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes.

In this paper we investigate the uplink scheduling for secondary users (SUs) in multi-channel cognitive radio cellular networks with fading channels. In the problem under consideration, secondary networks are infrastructure-based with a cognitive base station. We consider the path loss, the lognormal shadowing, Rayleigh fading channels, and their effects on the transmission power constraint and uplink scheduling. We develop two uplink scheduling algorithms for maximum sum rate (MSR) and proportional fairness (PF). The objective of the MSR algorithm is to maximize the sum rates of all SUs, but this algorithm does not consider the fairness among SUs. In contrast, the PF algorithm considers the fairness among SUs. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show the tradeoff between maximizing the sum rates and achieving fairness.

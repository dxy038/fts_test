A neurodynamic optimization approach is proposed for robust pole assignment problem of second-order control systems via output feedback. With a suitable robustness measure serving as the objective function, the robust pole assignment problem is formulated as a quasi-convex optimization problem with linear constraints. Next, the problem further is reformulated as a convex feasibility problem. Two coupled recurrent neural networks are applied for solving the optimization problem with guaranteed optimality and exact pole assignment. Simulation results are included to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

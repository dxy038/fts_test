The objective of this research was to develop a laboratory test procedure to predict full-scaleprimary clarifier performance using Chemically Enhanced primary Treatment (CEPT).A method was developed that simulated actual primary clarifier performance, with chemical enhancements, based on simulating full-scale surface over flow rate (SOR) and flocculation time in the laboratory. The method used for this test was adapted from a procedure used for sizing of Lamella Separators.Validation of the developed method was done by comparison of laboratory data, with stress test data from two full-scale clarifiers, at the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant in Washington, DC, USA.The results indicated that the laboratory SOR test method could be calibrated to predict and optimize full-scale primary clarifier performance.

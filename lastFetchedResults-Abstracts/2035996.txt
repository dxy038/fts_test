This paper investigates the effect of Dolph-Chebyshev window frequency response Side lobe Attenuation on the improvement of Speech quality in terms of six objective quality measures. In Speech Enhancement process, signal corrupted by noise is segmented into frames and each segment is Windowed using Dolph-Chebyshev Window with variation in the side lobe attenuation parameter ?. The Windowed Speech segments are applied to the Weiner Filter Speech Enhancement algorithm and the Enhanced Speech signal is reconstructed in its time domain. The focus is to study the effect of Dolph-Chebyshev Window spectral side lobe attenuation on the Speech Enhancement process. For different side lobe attenuations of the Dolph-Chebyshev Window frequency response, speech quality objective measures have been computed. From this study, it is observed that the Side lobe Attenuation parameter ? plays an important role on the Speech enhancement process in terms of six objective quality measures. The results are compared with the measures of Hanning window and an optimum side lobe attenuation parameter in dB for the Dolph-Chebyshev Window is proposed for better speech quality.

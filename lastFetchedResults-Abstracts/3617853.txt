A novel optical circuit is presented which is suitable for bidirectional amplification based on the wavelength division multiplexing method using an Er<sup>3+</sup>-doped fibre amplifier and commercially available optical components. The optical gain characteristics for simultaneous bidirectional transmission have been experimentally clarified.

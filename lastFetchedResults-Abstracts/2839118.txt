This paper presents a new zero voltage switching (ZVS) bidirectional isolated dc-dc converter, The new topology uses the phase-shift PWM control technology and makes it possible for the switching devices to achieve zero voltage switching, It can reduce voltage and current stress of the switching device, thereby reducing its power consumption, improving efficiency and performance of bidirectional DC-DC converter greatly.

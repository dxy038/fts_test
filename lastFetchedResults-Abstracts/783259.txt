Objective: To examine patient and system
characteristics of first-time (‘‘incident’’) vs.
recurrent (‘‘recurrent’’) use of a psychiatric emergency
room (PER). Methods: Data on demographic
and clinical characteristics and health service utilization
were collected for incident and recurrent users
(n=3,719) who visited the PER of the university hospital
in Leuven, Belgium, between March 2000 and
March 2002. Results: About 64% (n=2,368) were
incident and 36% (n=1,351) were recurrent users. The
PER was the first treatment setting ever for 50% of the
incident users. Incident users were most likely over
69 years (OR=2.84, P<0.001), employed (OR=2.21,
P<0.001), or referred by a health care professional
(OR=1.72, P<0.001). They were less likely to have a
personality disorder (OR=0.40, P<0.001) or to have
used inpatient or outpatient services in the past (OR’s
0.11 and 0.65, respectively, P<0.001). About 44% were
admitted, 38% referred for outpatient treatment, 9%
referred to the outpatient crisis-intervention program,
and 9% refused any follow-up. Conclusions: The PER
was a first treatment setting ever for 1 in 3 patients.
Incident and recurrent users differed in sociodemographic
characteristics, pathways to care, service use,
and the presence of a personality disorder. They did
not differ in axis 1 disorders, comorbid mental disorders,
or pathways after care.

This paper describes a basic coverage issue, and proposes a scheme named Grid Scan which is applied to calculate the basic coverage rate with arbitrary sensing radius of each node. Based on Grid Scan, a re-deployment approach is suggested to meet any k-covered rate in some region according to application requirements. The objective of our re-deployment scheme is to get equivalent coverage rate using less number of sensor nodes or to achieve higher coverage rate with the same number of sensor nodes. The results of simulation experiments support that Grid Scan based re-deployment is more effective to cover monitored area than random spread.

In this paper a new approach using Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is presented for placing Distributed Generators (DGs) in radial distribution systems. The approach is making use of a multiple objective planning framework, named an Improved Multi-objective HS (IMOHS), to evaluate the impact of DG placement and sizing for an optimal development of the distribution system. In this study, the optimum sizes and locations of DG units are found by considering the power losses and voltage profile as objective functions. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated in two distribution networks, where the qualitative comparisons are made against a well-known technique, known as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). Furthermore, the results obtained are compared with those available in the literature.

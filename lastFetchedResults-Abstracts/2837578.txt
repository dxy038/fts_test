In the field of pattern recognition, the study of the gene expression profiles for different tissue samples over different experimental conditions has became feasible with the arrival of micro-array based technology. In cancer research, classification of tissue samples is necessary for cancer diagnosis, which can be done with the help of micro-array technology. In this article we have presented a multi-objective optimization ( MOO ) based clustering technique utilizing AMOSA ( Archived Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing ) as the underlying optimization strategy for classification of tissue samples from cancer data sets. As objective functions three cluster validity indices namely, XB, PBM, and FCM indices are optimized simultaneously to form more accurate clusters of tissue samples. The presented clustering technique is evaluated for two open source benchmark cancer data sets, which are Brain tumor data set and Adult Malignancy data set. In order to evaluate the quality or goodness of produced clusters two cluster quality measures viz, Adjusted Rand Index ( ARI ) and Classification Accuracy ( %CoA ) are calculated for each data set. Comparative results of the presented clustering algorithm with 10 state-of-the-art existing single-objective, multi-objective based clustering algorithms are shown for two benchmark data sets.

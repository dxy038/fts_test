The objective of the present study was to examine the validity of a physical water treatment concept using a pulsed-power system, which was based on an induced electric field via Faraday's law. Heat transfer fouling tests were conducted and fouling resistance was measured over 820 h while maintaining the electric conductivity of circulating water at 2000 μmho/cm. The fouling resistance for the baseline case, which included a 20-μm filter, increased well over the industry standard allowance level, whereas the fouling resistance was remained essentially zero throughout the test period when the PPS was used in conjunction with a 20-μm filter. The test was repeated with water having an electric conductivity of 4000 μmho/cm and similar results were observed.

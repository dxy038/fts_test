Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether serum and peritoneal fluid levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) differ between women with and without endometriosis and to examine the relationship between proliferative activity in the endometriotic lesions and the levels of FGF-2 in serum and peritoneal fluid.
Study design
Biopsy specimens of peritoneal endometriotic lesions (n = 25) were analyzed immunohistochemically regarding proliferative activity in stroma, glands, and blood vessels. The FGF-2 concentration was measured in peritoneal fluid and serum from 25 women with endometriosis and 14 healthy controls.
Results
Patients with endometriosis had higher serum concentrations of FGF-2 during both the proliferative and secretory menstrual phases than healthy women. Peritoneal fluid levels of FGF-2 differed significantly between women with high and low proliferative activity in their endometriotic lesions.
Conclusion
Women with endometriosis have a higher serum level of FGF-2 than healthy controls.

The problem of general block placement in VLSI is considered, using the constructive approach in which blocks are selected and located one at a time. Some well-known strategies are presented for the selection of the next block to be located, novel ones are proposed, and a methodology to evaluate them is established. It is then shown that the optimization problem arising in constructive placement can be reduced to several much simpler sub problems. Objective functions for locating the selected block to achieve a good layout are presented for three different metrics: the squared Euclidean, rectilinear, and Euclidean. Appropriate optimization problems are obtained and solved analytically, using efficient computation schemes. These solutions have been implemented and are used in a real VLSI chip design environment. It is shown that the squared Euclidean and the rectilinear metrics are preferable to the Euclidean one

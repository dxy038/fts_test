Reducing the scattering and enhancing the bandwidth (BW) are two desirable aspects in cloak applications. In this paper, we propose their optimization using a simplified objective function, which avoids a costly detailed frequency sweep to get the BW at each iteration. The multi-objective characteristic of our optimization permits us to obtain a set of possible solutions (the Pareto-Front), which represents different compromises between the two objectives. Two examples of dielectric cloaks are presented and discussed.

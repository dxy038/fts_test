Settling basin is one of the structures built for separation of suspended sediments at the beginning on intake canal. In these structures, flow velocity decreases by increasing cross section and sediments deposit owing to gravity force. Several factors affect settling basin design such as sediment attributes, flow discharge and trap efficiency. On the other hand, settling basin wall dimensions must be determined stable structurally. In this study a computer model was prepared for optimal design of Gannjafrooz settling basin in Mazandaran province considering hydraulic, sediment and structural attributes based on Ants colony optimization algorithm. Decision variables were consisted of length, width and height of settling basin, width and height of input canal and dimensions of various parts of settling basin wall. Objective function is a combination of trap efficiency and sliding and overturning safety factor. Mentioned model was applied in three trap efficiencies of 70, 80 and 90 percent. Results showed that optimal length, width and height in all three trap efficiencies were lower than existing condition. Optimal length, width and height obtained were, 38.89, 4.2 and 2.05 meter in trap efficiency of 70 percent respectively. Comparison of the results of this research with results of SCE algorithm showed that, ACS algorithm calculated length and height of basin, were 10.5 percent more and 10.73 percent less than SCE algorithm, respectively.

The unit-norm constraint optimization for joint shortening of channel and echo impulse response is presented in this paper. The optimization is performed in the mean-square sense (MSE) and compared to unit-tap constraint joint shortening optimization. The proposed method could serve in performing joint echo cancellation and equalization for data transmission over category cables for the next IEEE standard on short-range ultra high-speed copper interconnections used in data servers, high-performance computing centers, local area networks, etc. The main objective of the presented algorithm is to extensively reduce the power and implementation complexities of a 40GBASE-T system.

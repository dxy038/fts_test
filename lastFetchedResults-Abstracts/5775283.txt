The front bearing of the high-pressure rotor of a gas turbine is a high-speed bearing, according to the work of the bearing, the bearing structure was designed. On the basis of determining design variables, a multi-objective optimization function was established, constrainted design variables appropriately and obtained the optimal design result by solving the function. Based on the optimization result, the values of the bearing performance parameters were calculated, and showed that the bearing optimized can satisfy the design requirements and the actual working condition.

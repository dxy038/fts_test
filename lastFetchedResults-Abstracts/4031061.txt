The objective of this work is to investigate the issue of automatically detecting regions of interest (ROIÂ´s) in medical images. It is assumed that the regions to be detected can be roughly segmented by a threshold based on a likelihood measure of the ROI, First, an analysis of the global histogram is used to compute a preliminary threshold that is likely near the optimal one. The histogram analysis is motivated by the analytical result of a bell image intensity model proposed in this work. Then, the preliminary threshold is used to segment the input image, resulting in an attention map, which contains an attention region that approximates the ROI as well as many spurious ones. Due to the nonoptimality of the preliminary threshold, it can happen that the attention region contains a part of, or more regions than, the ROI. Learning takes place in two stages: (1) learning for automatic selection of the preliminary threshold value and (2) learning for automatically selecting the ROI from the attention map while dynamically tuning the threshold according to the learned-likelihood function. Experiments have been conducted to approximately locate the endocardium boundaries of the left and right ventricles from gradient-echo magnetic resonance (MR) images. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) images have also been used for testing. The boundary of the segmented region provided by this algorithm is not very accurate and is meant to be used for further fine tuning based on other application-specific measures.

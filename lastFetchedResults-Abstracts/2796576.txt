In New Worlds, New Horizons, Cosmic Dawn was singled out as one of the top astrophysics priorities for this decade. Specifically, the Astro2010 report asked &#8220;when and how did the first galaxies form out of cold clumps of hydrogen gas and start to shine-when was our cosmic dawn?&#8221; It proposed &#8220;astronomers must now search the sky for these infant galaxies and find out how they behaved and interacted with their surroundings.&#8221; This is the science objective of DARE - to search for the first stars, galaxies, and black holes via their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM) as measured by the highly redshifted 21-cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen. DARE will probe redshifts of 11-35 (Dark Ages to Cosmic Dawn) with observed HI frequencies of 40-120 MHz. DARE will observe expected spectral features in the global signal of HI that correspond to stellar ignition (Lyman-alpha from the first stars coupling with the HI hyperfine transition), X-ray heating/ionization of the IGM from the first accreting black holes, and the beginning of reionization (signal dominated by IGM ionization fraction). We propose to observe these spectral features with a broad-beam bi-conical dipole antenna along with a receiver and digital spectrometer that has high heritage from the ground-based EDGES experiment. We will place DARE in lunar orbit and take data only above the farside, a location known to be free of human-generated RFI and with a negligible ionosphere. In this talk, I will present the mission concept including initial results from engineering prototypes deployed in Green Bank and in Western Australian which are designed to perform end-to-end validation of the instrument and our calibration techniques, and to constrain systematic chromatic corruption produced by the ionosphere. I will also describe our signal extraction tool, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, which measures the parameterized spectral features in the presence of substantia- Galactic and solar system foregrounds.

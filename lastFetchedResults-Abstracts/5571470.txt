In applications there exist some production systems, where the specification of minimal and maximal speeds is required for continuous flow. It is extremely difficult to model, optimize and control this kind of production system by conventional mathematical models. Motivated by the need for effective optimization and control of this kind of production system, a general CPN´s called interval speed continuous Petri Nets (ICPN´s) was considered. Firstly, the enabling vector of ICPN´s was defined and an efficient way to determine the instantaneous firing speed of ICPN´s was presented. Secondly, the solution of the optimization and control in a regional state based on linear programming was proposed. Thirdly, a genetic algorithm to optimize an objective function within a specified time horizon was developed. Finally, these proposed ways are illustrated by case studies

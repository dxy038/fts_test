Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth rate is closely coupled to rRNA transcription which is regulated through CarD gene. The aim of this work was evaluation of conservation in CarD geneâ€™s sequence and its application in rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Materials and Methods: 38 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis with different types of drug resistance were selected. PCR conditions and annealing temperature were selected by calculating thermal denaturation. Electrophoreses confirmed the presence of the amplified gene. Purified PCR product was sequenced by sequencer. 
Results: The size of amplified fragment of CarD gene was similar in all samples. By translation of nucleotide mode to amino acids it was found that TRCF domain in N-terminal of protein CarD was e fully conserved.
Conclusion: This is the first study on the CarD gene in clinical isolates of MTB. This gene is recommended for use as a target for designing of suitable inhibitors as anti tuberculosis drug because of its importance in life of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and being a conservative gene.

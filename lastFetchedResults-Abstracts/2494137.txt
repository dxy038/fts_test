Because of the crucial role that suppliers have in achieving supply chain goals, the Problem of allocating orders to suppliers in a supply chain is one of the most important activities of Purchasing Managers. In this paper, by studying the theoretical literature, the influence indicators in select the supplier will be reconnaissance and refinement. Then, using linear allocation Method, these indicators are prioritized and by using the method of Asgharpour, Cardinal weights of these indicators have achieved.in Continue, the multi-objective programming model for determining the orders of suppliers according to constraints and objectives of the study has been designed And for solve it, the Weighted fuzzy multi-objective programming model has used. Assuming that the decision maker is not satisfied with the responses that obtained, Arikhan developed method by taking the weighted index and Preferences of the decision maker has used until finally, the decision maker will achieve the desired level in intended objectives and fuzzy constraints and specify the orders to the suppliers..

In this letter, a general approach is presented to synthesize the coupling matrix that matches to arbitrary frequency-invariant complex source and load. The approach converts the objective scattering matrix and reference impedances into an admittance matrix of multicoupled circuit based on the definition of power wave. The proposed method was verified by numerical and also simulated tests carried out with various complex reference impedances.

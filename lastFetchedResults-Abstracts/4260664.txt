We demonstrate a practical 2&#215;80 Gbit/s dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) bidirectional short-range optical wireless link. The measured power penalty for the bidirectional transmission is less than 0.8 dB compared to the back-to-back link and is only 0.2 dB compared to the unidirectional transmission system. This technology may find potential applications for building-to-building and/or indoor communications.

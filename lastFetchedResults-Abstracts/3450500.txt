Recent progress in semiconductor controlled rectifier components (the major type of thyristor) will be reviewed. As a result of advances in dynamic characteristics, SCRs are now applicable to equipments operating under severe transient conditions and at frequencies ranging into the ultrasonic spectrum. A number of other types of thyristors have been developed for special control and static power conversion applications. Among the devices described are the 4-layer diode, the light-activated SCR, the gate turn-off switch, the silicon controlled switch, and both the diode and the triode bidirectional thyristors. While lagging behind the SCR in acceptance, these newer types of thyristors can be expected to have an equally profound impact on the power conversion and control fields.

A successful 144.2-km transmission of a 622-Mb/s signal through standard single-mode fibers using a bidirectional fiber amplifier repeater is demonstrated. The bit-error-rate measurement showed neither sensitivity degradation nor BER floor in the bidirectional transmission, suggesting a great potential of system improvement and capacity increase of the existing system by the use of the repeater.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

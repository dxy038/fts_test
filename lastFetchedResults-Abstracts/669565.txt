The aim of the study presented here was to gain an understanding of business-driven innovations towards more sustainable chemical products and processes. A case study was undertaken to assess and analyse the experiences of five different companies. These companies varied in size from small to a multinational, and they also varied in their position in the production chain. Interviews were held with a number of key players in each firm. The objective of business-driven innovation is to place more sustainable products in upcoming markets. The acceptance of customers and the general public may complicate the innovation process. Commercial managers played an important role in the innovation processes, whereas environmental managers hardly played a role at all. Most innovations were indirectly triggered by (the expectation of) new regulations in frontrunner countries, which were regarded as indications of future market changes (market triggering regulation).

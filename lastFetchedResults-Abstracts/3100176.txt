When fatal forest disasters take place, only one retrieval depot usually can not provide enough supplies to resolve the emergency. So the problem about how to combine multi-depot-multi-resource has been put forward. The main objective of the multi-resource scheduling is how to achieve the least emergency time and the fewest retrieval depots. In this scheduling algorithm, there are mainly two factors that restrict the emergency time. One is path length, and the other is traffic road quality. Because the forest disaster usually takes place in remote mountain area, the factor of traffic road quality is very important. Therefore the least time (t<sub>ij</sub>) should be the optimal solution about the shortest path (d<sub>ij</sub>) and the road quality parameter (q<sub>ij</sub>). In this paper, taking a forest area as experiments region, we achieved some results mainly in the following aspects: (1) determined the value of qij through the experiment; (2) established the least emergency time model; (3) built the emergency resources scheduling optimal model in forest fatal disaster for meeting fewest rescue depots based on the fastest emergency time.

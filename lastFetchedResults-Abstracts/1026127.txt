In recent years the analysis of the constrained mechanical system by using singular models has been established. Singular models consist of both differential and algebraic equation so they are very useful for modeling constraint mechanical systems where the restrictions are usually introduced by algebraic equations. Due to the importance of singular systems, control approaches of such systems have attracted many interests. In this paper, we address an adaptive state feedback control approach for MIMO singular systems that makes the closed loop dynamics of this class of systems regular, impulse free and stable. The proposed controller has been implemented on a 3-link constrained robot manipulator which is modeled by singular systems. The control objective is that the Robot end-effector moves on a special surface with determined force applying to that. The wall surface limit the robot manipulator moves. The stability of proposed controller has been proved using Lyapunov theorem. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of presented controller

This paper reports the world-first system-level demonstration of dynamic wavelength allocation (DWA) on a wavelength-tunable (&#955;-tunable) wavelength division multiplexing/time division multiplexing-passive optical network (WDM/TDM-PON). To achieve DWA, a DWA calculation is necessary that determines new optical network unit assignments to the optical line terminal ports according to the bandwidth demand. In addition, a wavelength-tuning (&#955;-tuning) sequence that induces no data-frame loss, i.e., a hitless &#955;-tuning sequence, is essential. First, we propose a bidirectional hitless &#955;-tuning sequence and investigate its feasibility using media access control boards that we developed for symmetric 40-Gbit/s &#955;-tunable WDM/TDM-PONs, which are also the worldÂ´s first. Then, with a DWA calculation according to the downstream traffic loads, we show automatic dynamic load-balancing operation.

TMs paper proposes a novel single-stage three-phase to single-phase current-fed high step-up ac-dc matrix converter for high voltage dc applications. The proposed converter inserts a boost matrix converter, which is formed by three boost inductors and six bidirectional switches, between a three-phase ac source and a Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier (CW-VM) circuit. By using this topology associated with power factor correction technique, the proposed converter not only achieves almost unity power factor and sinusoidal input phase currents with low distortion but also obtains high voltage gain at the output end. Moreover, the matrix converter generates an adjustable-frequency and adjustable-amplitude current which injects into the CW-VM to regulate the dc output voltage and smooth its ripple. With this flexible injection current, the performance of the proposed converter is superior to the conventional CW-VM, which is usually energized by a single-phase ac source. Sourced by three-phase ac source, the proposed converter is quite suitable for high-power and high voltage applications. Both operation principle and control strategy of the proposed converter are detailed in this paper. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed converter and the experimental work will be conducted in the near future.

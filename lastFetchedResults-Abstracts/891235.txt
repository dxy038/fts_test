Background: Malassezia species as skin microflora of humans and other warm-blooded vertebrates are the lipophilic yeasts associated with various human diseases, especially pityriasis versicolor (PV).

Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the Malassezia species of scraped skin of PV patients in Yazd, Iran, using morphological, biochemical and physiological methods. We also compared the obtained results of PV patients with normal healthy volunteers.

Materials and Methods: A total of 200 persons, including 100 patients (with skin lesion) referred to Yazd Central Laboratory and 100 healthy volunteers as controls, were evaluated for Malassezia infection by morphological and biochemical methods.

Results: The most commonly isolated species from PV lesions, were M. globosa (38.3%), M. furfur (29.4%), M. sympodialis (14.9%), M. pachydermatis (9.6%) and M. slooffiae (5.3%). Also the most commonly isolated species from healthy skins were M. furfur (37.2%), M. globosa (25.6%), M. sympodialis (16.3%), M. pachydermatis (13.9%) and M. slooffiae (4.6%). Totally M. globosa and M. furfur were the most frequented isolated.

Conclusion: Highest prevalence of PV in our study was observed in the 20 – 39 years old group, suggesting that the peak of the infection is coincided with ages and increasing sebum production in the highest level. M. globosa was the most commonly isolated Malassezia species of the patients group and M. furfur is the most common isolated species obtained from normal individuals skin samples. We couldn’t find any significant differences between groups. The rate of isolated Malassezia species from patients was higher than normal individuals.

Summary form only given, as follows. The objective of this work is to develop a 2d3/spl nu/ computer program to simulate the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma source. This computer code incorporates a static magnetic field solver for the magnetic field produced by permanent magnets, particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations, and Monte Carlo collisions. The collisional model includes not only collisions of plasma electrons with neutrals, but also electron-electron collisions. The simulation parameters of the ECR plasma source are: a plasma chamber with radius 7.7 cm and height 8.57 cm, 2.45-GHz axisymmetric TM or TE waves of different power levels, and helium or argon gas of a range of pressures. When the electron-neutral collision frequency is less than the wave frequency, simulation results show that the electron cyclotron resonance discharges will be set up. Simulations verify that the wave absorption occurs within the resonance layer and plasma is dominantly produced around the ECR zone. The dependence of some plasma parameters (e.g., average electron and ion energy, plasma density) on pressure, microwave power, mode structure, and magnetic field configuration for helium and argon discharges will be presented.

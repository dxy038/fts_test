Summary
rceptions of stakeholders towards objectives and zoning of marine-protected areas (MPAs) in southern Europe were studied through face-to-face interviews to identify areas of agreement and disagreement. Views were sought about the main objectives of marine protection, ideal zonation of MPAs and the ways to manage stakeholdersâ€™ competing interests in MPAs. There was good agreement on the objectives of marine protection; conservation and fisheries management scored highly, while research, education and tourism had lower scores. However, there was disagreement on which objective was most important, with most stakeholders listing conservation, while fishers listed fisheries management. Most stakeholders considered MPAs that had been established for longer periods of time to offer more conservation than fisheries benefits. Analysis of the perceptions shows strong preference for having MPAs with different use zonations, including designated areas for recreational fishing, diving and the full protection of species and ecosystems. The results point to a need for increased dialogue between scientists, managers and fishers to improve the disparity in understanding the fisheries benefits of marine protection between these groups.

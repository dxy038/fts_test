In this work, Nyquist pulse-shaping technology is exploited for future implementations of optical access networks. The paper first presents technical issues regarding digital implementation of Nyquist spectral shaping for low-symbol-rate systems. Second, the potential benefits regarding mitigation of cross talk (linear and nonlinear) of Nyquist pulse shaping in symmetric and bidirectional wavelength-division multiplexing passive optical networks (WDM-PONs) are presented. Lastly, the paper proposes a WDM-PON solution employing self-coherent detection at the optical network unit and heterodyne coherent detection at the optical line terminal. In this proposed architecture, a multi-objective optimization strategy is developed to enhance the transmission performance of the Nyquist-shaped bands in full-duplex mode.

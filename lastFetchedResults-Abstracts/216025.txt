Recent investigations of the underlying pathophysiology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has resulted in the identification of involved molecular pathways, including the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene in
most sporadic cases of RCC.(1) They are characterized by one specific histological type. In contrast, kidney tumors in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) consist of a variety of histological types.(2) We report a patient with multiple renal cell tumors in one kidney with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax, but without skin lesions which are typical signs of BHD syndrome.

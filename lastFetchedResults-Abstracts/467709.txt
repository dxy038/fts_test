OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the effect of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Staphylococcus aureus on cytokine and prostaglandin production by amnion cells in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Amnion cells were obtained from women undergoing elective cesarean section before the onset of labor and cultured in a primary cell culture. Confluent amnion cells were incubated with heat-inactivated bacteria in different concentrations (101 to 106 colony-forming units/ml) for 48 hours. Samples for quantification of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, and prostaglandin E2 were collected at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. RESULTS: Under basal conditions, minor amounts of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were detectable. Incubation of amnion cells with E. coli enhanced the secretion of interleukin-8 and also induced an transient increase of prostaglandin E2 in a dose-dependent manner. B. fragilis produced an increase in the secretion of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. M. hominis and S. aureus did not cause an increase in either interleukin-6, interleukin-8, or prostaglandin E2. CONCLUSIONS: The gram-negative bacteria E. coli and B. fragilis stimulated interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 to a greater degree than the other bacteria investigated in this study. This finding may be of clinical interest in the onset of preterm birth. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:50-3.)

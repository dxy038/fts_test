Objective (s): Data collection is one of the important stages of research process and requires valid and reliable instruments.  The aim of this article was to introduce important steps of translation and construction process of a questionnaire. Furthermore, the present study considers two psychometric properties evaluation including face and content validity.
Methods: This is a documentary that accounts for instructions and methods in tanslating and validating a health-related questionnaire.
Results: The most known procedure to translate a standard questionnaire from original language into a different language is forward-backward procedure. This includes several steps including forward translation, review and reconciliation of forward translation, back translation, back translation review, pre-testing and cognitive interviewing and providing the provisional version. Main steps for instrument development include definition of concept and its domain, explication of objectives for the measure, development of a blueprint; and construction of the measure, including administration procedures, item set, and scoring rules and procedures. Then content and face validity could be performed to provide the final version.
Conclusion: Translation or development of a health-related measure and its psychometric properties should methodologically be robust and follow standard procedures.

Objective: An exploratory data analysis framework, based on minimal spanning tree, is proposed as a means to support the analysis of single trial (ST) electrophysiological signals. The core of this framework is the compact description of the input ST sample in a form of content-dependent ordered lists. Based on the established hierarchies, efficient ways to increase the SNR, extract prototypical responses, visualize possible self-organization trends in the sample and track the course of evoked response along the trial-to-trial dimension, are proposed.
Method: Magnetoencephalographic auditory evoked responses were used for demonstrating and validating the introduced framework.
Results and conclusion: The results demonstrate the benefits, from this intelligent manipulation of STs, in understanding and enhancing the actual evoked signal. Specifically we find support for stimulus-induced phase-resetting hypothesis in the 3â€“20 Hz band, the existence of trials void of the prototypical evoked response, and an order across the single trial set hinting at an underlying process with long time scale.

This paper provides a systematic guidance for linear switched reluctance machine design. By classifying the feasible polygons for desired machine operations, the physical size limits of either longitudinal or transverse flux linear machine poles and pole pitches can be determined. Also, with appropriate objective function selections, the constraints for associated machine optimization studies can be defined from the polygon boundaries. Comparison verifications are provided to show the adequacies and capabilities of the proposed algorithms

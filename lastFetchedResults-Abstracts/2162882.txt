Salmonella infection is the second most prevalent cause of foodborne illness in most developing countries. Meat, poultry, and dairy products are frequently implicated in outbreaks. The objective of this study was to apply a novel immunomagnetic separation (IMS)–bacteriophage assay to the detection of Salmonella enteritidis in artificially inoculated skimmed milk powder, chicken rinses, and ground beef. In all food types tested, the IMS–bacteriophage assay was able to detect an average of 3 CFU of S. enteritidis in 25 g or ml of food sample. Total assay time including pre-enrichment is about 20 h. The results indicate that the IMS–bacteriophage assay is a rapid and sensitive means of detecting S. enteritidis in these foods. The assay was successfully adapted to the detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and was able to detect E. coli in ground beef at the lowest inoculation level tested, 2 CFU/g. The assay was also adapted to the simultaneous detection of S. enteritidis and E. coli. The results indicate that the IMS–bacteriophage assay shows promise for the simultaneous detection of these pathogens, but further development work would be necessary to improve sensitivity and produce reliable results at low inoculation levels.

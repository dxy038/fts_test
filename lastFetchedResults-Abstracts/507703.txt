OBJECTIVE: Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) leads to some problems in the eye surgery specially cataract surgery. As the prevalence of eye problems is high in diabetic patients, we meant to assess the prevalence of PEX in diabetic patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 400 type 2 diabetic patients aged 50 or above who referred to Yazd Diabetes Research Center were selected consecutively in a year. Ophthalmologic examinations were performed with slit-lamp, 3-mirror lens, indirect Ophtalmoscopy and Applanation Goldman Tonometer. The criterion used to diagnose PEX was the presence of pseudoexfoliation material on one or more anterior segment structures.
RESULTS: Four hundred diabetic patients aged 50 years or above were recruited for the study.  Of whom 24 patients were found to have PEX with an overall prevalence of 6%. The results of this study showed that the prevalence of PEX had a direct relationship with the age of participants until the age of 70. 
CONCLUSION: In our study the prevalence of PEX was 6%. Comparing our results with similar studies in the same region in non-diabetic patients at the same age, the prevalence of PEX in diabetic patients was shown to be less than non-diabetic patients

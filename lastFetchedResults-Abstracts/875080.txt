
The objective of this study was to investigate utilization of pomegranate pruning  residues as the core layer of the three layer particleboard. The percentage of the pomegranate residues varied as 100, 65 and 35% in the core layer of the eucalypt  particleboard and three resin levels of 8, 10 and 12 % (based on the weight of the wood particles) were applied in the core layer. Resin dosage in the surface layer was kept at 12 %. The strength and physical properties were measured and analyzed applying factorial model based on completely randomized design. The results revealed that if 65% pomegranate residues are used in the core layer, the modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity were the highest and the combined effect of both variables on the properties were statistically significant. The highest value of the modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity obtained in the case of 10% resin in the core layer and 100% pomegranate residues followed by 8% resin in the core layer and 65% pomegranate residues. The combined effect of both variables on internal bonding of the boards was statistically significant and the highest internal bonding was reached if 8% resin and 65% pomegranate residues were used in the core layer.  The effect of resin dosage on thickness swelling after 24 hours immersion in water was statistically significant. The results indicated that pomegranate tree pruning could be used for the particleboard manufacturing.

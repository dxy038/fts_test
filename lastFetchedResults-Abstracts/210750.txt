OBJECTIVE: To see the outcome of single layer extramucosal interrupted suture gut anastomosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective analytical.
SETTING AND METHODS: This study was carried out in the Department of Surgery Unit-I Muhammad Medical College Mirpurkhas, from August 2004 to July 2007. A total of 72 patients were included in this study in which gut anastomosis was performed with single layer extramucosal interrupted suture. Patients of all ages and sex groups were included in whom end-to-end anastomosis was required in small and large intestine. Polyglactin (Vicryl 2/0 and 3/0) material was chosen on round body needle.
RESULTS: End-to-end anstomosis in 72 patients was done in cases of ileal perforation 37 / 72 (51.38%) and right hemicolectomy 09/72 (12.50%). Intussusception was the cause in 11/72 (15.27%) cases, mass at recto-sigmoid junction was found in 02/72 (02.77%) strangulated inguinal hernia in 07/72 (09.72%) patients, jejunal diverticulosis in 01/72 (01.38%), caecal volvulous in 02/72 (02.77%) and sigmoid volvulous in 02/72 (02.77%) cases. Anastomosis leakage occurred in only 02/72 cases. Mortality remained 1/72 (01.38%).
CONCLUSION: Single-layer extramucosal interrupted suture gut anastomosis is safe method of hand sewing technique. It is suitable for all anastomosis in the gastrointestinal tract.

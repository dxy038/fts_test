Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the efficiency of HA-binding test and sperm gradient processing method for the selection of sperm with normal protamine,
intact DNA and normal morphology.
Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 29 patients undergoing ICSI. Semen analysis was carried out according to WHO criteria. Semen samples were divided into three equal portions. One portion was left untreated (control), the second
portion was used for HA-binding (HA: Hyaluronic acid) and the third portion underwent PureSperm gradient processing. Then, the three portions were evaluated
to examine protamine deficiency (Chromomycin A3 staining), sperm morphology
(Papanicolaou staining) and DNA integrity (Sperm Chromatin Dispersion Test). Coefficients of correlation and student t-test were carried out using SPSS 11.5 and P-value lower than 0.05 was considered as significant.
Results: The mean number of sperm abnormality, protamin deficiency, and DNA fragmentation in HA binding and sperm gradient processing groups were significantly
decreased as compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, sperm gradient processing was superior to HA-binding method in the selection of sperm with normal protamine, intact DNA and normal morphology.
Conclusion: Both HA-binding and sperm gradient processing methods were effective
in the selection of sperm with better quality in terms of normal morphology, normal
protamine content and DNA integrity. However, sperm gradient processing was superior to HA-binding method in the selection of normal sperm.

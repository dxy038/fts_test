Background and Objective: Inhibition, even reduction, of acrylamide formation during processing of foods, can help produce more healthy food and, consequently, promote food safety. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of rosemary extract (RE) and vitamins niacin (B3) and pyridoxine (B6) on acrylamide formation in potato chips.                                                                                          
Materials and Methods: Samples of potatoes, to which RE, vitamin B3 or vitamin B6  had been added at 3 levels, namely, 0.2, 1.0 and 2.5 g/kg, in a deeping system for 15, 30, and 60 minutes, were fried for 4 minutes, the frying temperature being 180 ?C. The acrylamide level in potato chips was determined by gas chromatography (GC/MS).  
Results:  Addition of RE and the vitamins at a level of 1 and 2.5 g/kg potatoes, respectively, resulted in acrylamide reduction by 82.7% and 50.9%. The antioxidant effect of RE and the vitamins at these levels preventing acrylamide formation was considerable. The magnitudes of acrylamide reduction in the fried potato samples with any given content of reducing sugars, asparagine and acrylamide were significantly different.                                                                                                 
Conclusion: The findings indicate that both rosemary extract and the vitamins  B 3 and B 6  could significantly reduce the acrylamide content produced in potato chips, with no change in  flavor and crispness. The use of these 3 additives to reduce acryamide formation is recommended for potato chips, fried and other potato products, as well as for otherv high-carbohydrate foods, such as  bread and biscuits.

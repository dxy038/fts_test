As the research of dynamic optimization arising, memory-based strategy has gained public attention recently. However, few studies on developing dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithms and even fewer studies on multi-objective memory-based strategy were reported previously. In this paper, we try to address such an issue by proposing several memory-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and experimentally investigating different multi-objective dynamic optimization schemes, which include restart, explicit memory, local search memory and hybrid memory schemes. This study is to provide pre-trial research of how to appropriately organize and effectively reuse the changed Pareto-optimal decision values (i.e., Pareto-optimal solutions: POS) information.

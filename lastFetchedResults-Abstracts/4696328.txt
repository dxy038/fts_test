Current clinical methods of Parkinson´s disease assessment are known to be subjective and potentially error prone. This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the development of a novel approach for the assessment of Parkinsonian tremor. The approach is based on a computer vision technique with the aim of providing a more objective, frequent, yet unobtrusive means of assessment. A method of tremor amplitude quantification is proposed, and 3D visualization techniques are exploited to provide an intuitive tool for the monitoring and assessment of Parkinson´s disease. The approach developed has the potential to address the limitations and patient privacy concerns associated with video-based monitoring technology. Initial results following evaluation have demonstrated the viability and benefits of the approach, including objectiveness, repeatability and clarity of activity performance results.

Fracturing is an important stimulation treatment to guarantee high effective way to enhance oil recovery and production of oil well and sustainable development of oilfield. A good fracturing result relies on proper selection of target well and target layer. Traditionally, the method of selecting target wells and target layers is always done artificially and imprecisely. As a result, fracturing does not perform as well as it can. This paper determined and analyzed the factors influencing the effect of oil well fracturing. Altogether twelve factors in three types, which are reservoir property parameter, oil related property parameter and productivity parameter respectively, have significant influence on the result of fracturing. Based on this, we developed a optimizing method to select of target wells and target layers for fracturing. This method is based on fuzzy mathematics and can, by means of integrated judgment, give a score to every candidate stratum and thus optimize the selection of objective strata for fracturing treatment. The results of practical applications suggest that the reliability of this method is high, and the effect is perfect. This study successfully applies the fuzzy theory to the job to fracturing. It is an important technique of fracturing.

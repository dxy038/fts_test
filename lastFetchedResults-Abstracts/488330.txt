Background and Objective: Preterm delivery has considerable social, economical and mental effects on neonate and related family. Factors predisposing to, and preventing preterm delivery are still not clearly recognized. However some studies have shown psychological factors to play some role. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of anxiety in inducing preterm delivery.
Materials and Methods: In this cohort study conducted in sari (1384-85) a consecutive series of 282 pregnant women with singleton pregnancies reffered for routine prenatal care were included. Anxiety was assessed using self-administered Spielberger's state-trait anxiety questionnaire. The 75th percentile was used for anxiety scores.
Results: Mean score of state and trait anxiety of cases was 38.5±9.9 (20-74) and 41.2±9.2 (20-77) respectively. There was a meaningful statistical relationship between state anxiety and preterm delivery (P=0.02, RR=2.71) and trait anxiety and preterm delivery (P=0.009, RR= 1.59).
Conclusion: Further studies incorporating multiple psychosocial domains, gaining information about women's social environment, life circumstances and possible biologic pathways through which anxiety and stress operates may reinforce our understanding of the role of stress in pregnancy.

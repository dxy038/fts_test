The internal and external environment of the company operate in a dynamic flow of information, these information can change the decision in company, however a lot of systems of decision based on a static state of company, it concerns with the information in internal environment of static state, the changes of information have not included in these studies. The aim of this paper is to propose mobile approach based on mobile strategic environmental scanning, the objective of this approach improves to perform Business Company in different levels, and helps the system decision. Currently the mobile devices networks is the source of information most used (68%) of population in the world, this approach offer to actor of system to use the mobile devices in order to communicate, cooperate, and access to information. We have modeled the strategic environmental scanning process into three layers; global strategic environmental scanning layerÂ´s, strategic environmental scanning domain activity layer and Information layer, each layer responsible for specific actions. Our approach adopted agent mobile as model with mobile devices for developing the system strategic environmental scanning. Our approach proposed an operational process for modeling strategic environmental scanning because of the lack of the model proposed by LESCA group and AFNOR normalization. Our implementation used android system and JADE-LEAP system, android system to implement the mobile devices program and JADE-LEAP to implement agents.

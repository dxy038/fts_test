The study objective was to evaluate the effects of mutations in two genes, PRKAG3 and CAST, on fresh and dry-cured processing characteristics. Processing and curing followed normal commercial procedures. A 100 g sample of the semimembranosus was excised and frozen for later DNA harvest. Genotypes for CAST, and PRKAG3 were determined after DNA extraction from the frozen samples. The PRKAG3 marker had no affect on dry-cured ham processing characteristics. The CAST gene marker was a significant source (P &lt; 0.05) of variation for cured ham moisture content and tended to be a significant source (P &lt; 0.10) for yield, ham weight loss, salt content and Minolta color change. The data demonstrate that the CAST 11 genotype is associated with greater processing yields. Alternatively, selection or sorting for the CAST 22 genotype should produce cured hams that exhibit more efficient moisture loss and, as a result, require less processing time and contain greater salt content.

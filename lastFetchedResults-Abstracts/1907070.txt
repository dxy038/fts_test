Chemical analysis of an East China Sea marine-derived fungus, Aspergillus sydowii (MF357) returned three new tris-pyrogallol ethers, sydowiols A–C (1–3), and two known bis-pyrogallol ethers, violaceols I (4) and II (5). Structures were assigned on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis and by consideration of symmetry. Sydowiols A (1) and C (3) were responsible for the inhibitory activity detected in the crude fungal extract against Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase A (PtpA).

The Sludge Drying Plant (SDP) is the final processing facility of Effluent Treatment System (ETS) that produces bio-sludge cake before it is sent out for final disposal. Due to the process disturbances the amount of dry solid is reduced tremendously. The principal objective of this study is to perform a parameter optimization for the SDP through identification on the current performance through actual process data analysis and identification of the subsystems for optimization. On disposal, Kualiti Alam will charge the dried cake sludge based on the weight, not on the content; therefore it is only sensible to export the dried cake at maximum dryness. Optimized controls for the SDP ensures that a maximum weight percent solution (wt%) is squeezed out through complex computing from available process parameters, which in return would incur a potential cost avoidance for this oil and gas processing plant more than RM1million annually.

Objective
This study aimed to evaluate gross motor function and hand function in children
with cerebral palsy to explore their association with epilepsy and mental capacity.
Material & Methods
The research investigating the association between gross and fine motor
function and the presence of epilepsy and/or mental impairment was conducted
on a group of 83 children (45 girls, 38 boys). Among them, 41 were diagnosed
with quadriplegia, 14 hemiplegia, 18 diplegia, 7 mixed form, and 3 athetosis.
A neurologist assessed each child in terms of possible epilepsy and confirmed
diagnosis in 35 children. A psychologist assessed the mental level (according to
Wechsler) and found 13 children within intellectual norm, 3 children with mild
mental impairment, 18 with moderate, 27 with severe, and 22 with profound.
Children were then classified based on Gross Motor Function Classification
System and Manual Ability Classification Scale.
Results
The gross motor function and manual performance were analysed in relation to
mental impairment and the presence of epilepsy. Epilepsy was found to disturb
conscious motor functions, but also higher degree of mental impairment was
observed in children with epilepsy.
Conclusion
The occurrence of epilepsy in children with cerebral palsy is associated
with worse manual function. The occurrence of epilepsy is associated with
limitations in conscious motor functions. There is an association between
epilepsy in children with cerebral palsy and the degree of mental impairment.
The occurrence of epilepsy, mainly in children with hemiplegia and diplegia is
associated with worse mental capacities.

The role-based access control model, often related to the permissions of hierarchical role. The encryption mechanism was introduced to this article, put forward a hierarchical management program of the role master key which based on the elliptic curve, to carry out the key management of the objective resources by the role master key, to realize the mechanism of hierarchical role character in the RBAC model by the hierarchical key management. Compared with the hierarchical key management program that has been put forward, in this program, the calculating efficiency of the key and the safety performance have been optimized, and the program can adapt to the dynamic diversification of the role better.

In this paper we propose a two-level MOEA to help on the sugarcane harvest decision support. This problem is multi-objective in nature, as it contains agronomical and logistic objectives considered simultaneously. Two different sets of heuristics were used during harvest decisions, namely crisp and fuzzy prioritization schema. They are both tested and compared here with regards to effective help to decision makers - via traditional metrics and attainment to decision scenarios. Simulations show that the productivity was increased in all hypothetical scenarios investigated because of the two-level MOEA.

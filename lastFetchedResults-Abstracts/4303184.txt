This paper describes the design, construction and testing of a 150 kVA closed loop vector controlled matrix converter induction motor drive. The primary objective of this research effort is to evaluate the utility of the matrix converter in electric vehicle applications, primarily for motor control. A prototype converter has been built using 600 Amp, 1400 Volt IGBTs. Closed loop vector controlled has been implemented and tested using a 150 HP induction motor load. This work presents the design of this converter along with practical test results, representing the largest matrix converter built to date.

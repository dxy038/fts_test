    A review of the literature on auditing educational systems based on international standard of ISO 10015 reveals that inefficiency of in-service trainings is due to not employing precise approaches and techniques of needs assessments. This paper sought to apply educational needs assessments for financial staff in Mehr Finance and Credit Union. The specific objective of the paper was to explain job-based needs assessment technique as an instrument in order to pass over the quasi-needs assessment to a real educational needs assessment.  The population of this applied research included 61 financial managers and senior staff of the head quarters of Mehr Union. 30 managers and staff were selected as the study sample drawing on stage cluster sampling method. Two researcher-developed questionnaires were used to collect the data, one tapped into task duties with 30 items and the other was concerned with education standards with 27 items. The study revealed that from among the educational needs the least priority belonged to principles of supervision with 29.5% distance from standards and the highest priority belonged to knowledge of electronic banking with 60% distance from the standards. The study recommends that before undertaking job-related education needs assessment job expertsâ€™ views and job network results need to be scrutinized in such research areas.

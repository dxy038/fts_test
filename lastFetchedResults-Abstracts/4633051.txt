The article presents a solution for remote control of Local Operating Networks with Java. The main objective is easy access to such networks via a Java enabled Web Browser. It is shown how to implement a Java applet that connects to a Java servlet which in turn activates a Win32 program that has access to LonWorks. The task of this applet is to provide the user with a comfortable and flexible interface. This solution shows that, on one hand, the methods for an interaction between Java and LonWorks are easy to learn and, on the other hand, they are very powerful for future developments of remote control and visualization software

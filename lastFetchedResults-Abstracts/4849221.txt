In this paper an objective No Reference metric for assessing the quality degradations introduced by transmission over a heterogeneous IP network is presented. The proposed approach is based on the analysis of the interframe correlation measured at the output of the rendering application. It does not require information about the kind of errors, delays and latencies that affected the link and countermeasures introduced by decoders in order to face the potential quality loss. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in approximating the assessments obtained with full reference metrics.

A new reduced reference objective quality metric for stereoscopic video is proposed that incorporates spatial neighbouring information from grey-level co-occurrence matrices and edge properties. Extracted colour and depth features are combined unequally to maximise the performance of the proposed metric. The performance of this metric is validated through a series of subjective tests and the average correlation 0.82 is achieved when colour to depth importance ratio is near 0.80.

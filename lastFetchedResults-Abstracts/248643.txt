A new enhanced strain element, based on the deÞnition of extra compatibles modes of deformation added to
the standard four-node Þnite element, is initially presented. The element is built with the objective of
addressing incompressible problems and avoiding locking e¤ects. By analysing at the element level the
deformation modes which form a basis for the incompressible subspace the extra modes of deformation are
proposed in order to provide the maximum possible dimension to that subspace. Subsequently another new
element with more degrees of freedom is formulated using a mixed method. This is done by including an
extra Þeld of variables related to the derivatives of the displacement Þeld of the extra compatible modes
deÞned previously. The performance of the elements proposed is assessed in linear and non-linear situations.

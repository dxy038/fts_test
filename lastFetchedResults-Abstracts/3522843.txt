The SBP9989NJ (16 bit) microprocessor is a candidate device for use in synchronous-orbit satellite systems. It has recently been evaluated for its susceptibility to electron radiation and found to be vulnerable to dose levels significantly below the objective of 1 MRad (Si). Based on this evaluation, a decision has been made to use the functionally similar SBP9900ANJ devices instead.

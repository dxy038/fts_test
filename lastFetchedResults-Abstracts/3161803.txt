Considering the complex influencing factors exerting on main bearing (MB) lubrication for diesel engine, according to elastohydrodynamic lubrication model of dynamically loaded bearing, coupling simulations between multi-body dynamics and elastohydrodynamics were conducted to diesel engine main bearing by employing AVL Excite software. Bearing width, oil supply pressure, oil temperature, oil type, radial clearance, groove direction in shell and bore position in journal were chosen precisely as key influencing factors under rated working condition, and minimum oil film thickness (MOFT) was chosen as optimization objective. Based on orthogonal design method, the optimal parameters combination was determined. Simulation was conducted to verify the combination, and the results show that minimum oil film thickness in one working cycle increased by 9.1%~32.1% and tended to smooth fluctuations.

Background: Health-related quality of life is affected by electromagnetic field exposure in each person everyday life. However, this is extremely controversial issue.
Objective: Investigation of the associations between electromagnetic field exposure and miscarriage among women of Tehran.
Materials and Methods: In this longitudinal study, 462 pregnant women with gestational age <12 wks from seven main regions of Tehran city in Iran with similar social and cultural status were participated. Women were interviewed face-to face to collect data. Reproductive information was collected using medical file recorded in those hospitals the subjects had delivery. The measuring device measured electromagnetic waves, Narda safety test solutions with valid calibration date at the entrance door of their houses.
Results: A significant likelihood of miscarriage in women who exposed to significant level of electromagnetic wave. However, this association was not confirmed by Wald test.
Conclusion: This study may not provide strong or consistent evidence that
electromagnetic field exposure is associated or cause miscarriage. This issue may be
due to small sample size in this study.

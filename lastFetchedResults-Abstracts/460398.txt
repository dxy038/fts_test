Objectives: The tuberculin skin test conversion rate over 12 months in dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants was assessed in 3 US-Mexico border counties of Texas in which reported tuberculosis rates were high compared with the rates for Texas and the United States. Methods: Tuberculin skin tests were administered to 284 subjects and repeated on nonreactors 12 months later. Participants also completed self-administered questionnaires. Results: The baseline positive tuberculin skin test prevalence was 4.6%. Nonreactors were more likely to have been born in the United States (P< .001). The tuberculin skin test conversion rate over 12 months was 1.7%. Conclusion: Results indicate a need for heightened awareness of tuberculosis transmission and annual surveillance by dental health care workers, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

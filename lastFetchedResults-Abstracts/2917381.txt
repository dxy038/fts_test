The paper raises a number of issues about the problem of evaluating a (decision) support system used for supporting unstructured and semi-structured problem-solving. The paper proposes a conceptual framework for the evaluation of support systems. This framework is based on an analysis of the evaluation realms, considered in terms of the whole decision-making process. The framework consists of two dimensions: the evaluation criteria and the evaluation object. The evaluation criteria are on a continuum from objective to subjective. The evaluation object consists of three components: the DSS design; the decision-making process; and the decision outcomes. The framework is then utilized to describe a systematic method for evaluating support systems. In addition to the above, a discussion about the implications of the framework and a comparison of predictive (a priori) versus a posteriori evaluation approaches is also included

In this paper, conventional lead-lag power system stabilizer (CPSS) is designed to damp electromechanical oscillations. CPSS parameters settings are computed using linear control theory. A new technique based on particle swarm optimization PSO is proposed to optimize the parameters settings of CPSS. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem, the objective is to compute the optimal parameters settings such that damping ratio maximized as much as possible. The performance and robustness of optimized CPSS (OPSS) is then, tested on 9-bus multi-machine system under normal operating conditions, heavy loadings and response to three phase short circuit. Eigenvalues results and nonlinear time domain simulation show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed OPSS over CPSS under different proposed cases.

The paper discusses the use of the ´micro-grid´ concept to integrate renewable energy generation into the distribution network. In essence, a micro-grid consists of bundled renewable micro sources and loads connected together by fast acting power electronics. Energy storage and low-bandwidth supervisory control is often added. The combined unit on aggregate can appear to the main network as a ´model citizen´. A low-voltage distribution network is a four-wire system and single phase loads and sources can conceivably be connected. The objective of this paper is to show how current balancing control can be achieved in addition to real and reactive power control. Means to perform current sharing are discussed and a solution to achieve balanced currents is presented and simulated.

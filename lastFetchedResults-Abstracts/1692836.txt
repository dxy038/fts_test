The good mechanical characteristics of bimaterials and in particular those of the ceramic-metal couple would make them, industrially, an interesting alternative if their fracture behaviour was better understood. The difference of the mechanical properties of the bonded materials leads to a stress concentration at the vicinity of the interface. This study concerns the analysis of the interfacial fracture in Brazilian disk test, subjected to compressive load. The finite element method is used to carry out this objective. The study is limited to the case of an elastic behaviour of the two components of the assembly and to a pure junction. The behaviour of a crack located at the interface is analyzed by global approach based on the strain energy release rate. The difference of the mechanical properties of the two bonded materials leads to a mixed mode (mode I + II).

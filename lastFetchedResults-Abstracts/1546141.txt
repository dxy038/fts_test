The objective of this work is the development of an automatic and mobile X-ray robot that is becoming necessary in a changing environment (aging society, growth of the developing countries, etc.). Specifically, there are three sides to such a project. First, there is the mechanical side, i.e. the design and implementation of motors on every mobile part of an X-ray unit allowing it to move around a standing patient. Then, comes the electronic side, i.e. the use of potentiometers and limit switches as feedback combined with microcontrollers. And last, the algorithm that computes three-dimensional models from two-dimensional X-rays.

This panel position paper addresses issues and challenges of resource management (facilitating adaptive and automatic information fusion) and identifies the necessary interaction with levels 2 and 3 components of "information fusion". Starting with the definitions of fusion levels, implicit and explicit interactions among the levels are examined from several perspectives: identifying commensurate measures to model interactions; selection of objective functions at each level or globally; representation of optimum decision making under uncertainty; effects of local optimization at each fusion level vs. joint optimization; representation of interactions among fusion levels by the perceptual reasoning machine paradigm-based adaptive anticipatory planning and control model; and identifying research directions

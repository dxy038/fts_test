The objective of this work is to develop an easy-to-build and robust setup for measuring the nonlinearity parameter B/A in fluids using ultrasound. The method is based on the pulse echo technique, using a single element broadband acoustic transducer, and requires electrical signal measurements. Results obtained in water and denatured alcohol validate the proposed procedure. The choice of a suitable primary wave frequency is discussed with regard to the transducer sensitivity. Further, the influence of the perturbations introduced by the experimental device nonlinearities, and the role of the reflector on the measured second harmonic field amplitude are investigated.

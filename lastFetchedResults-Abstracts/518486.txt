Background and objective: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV appears to be the most common cause of HCC in Iran. This study was undertaken to determine the HBV genotype in Iranian patients with HCC.

Materials and methods: Paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 40 patients (31 males and 9 females) with HBV-associated HCC were collected from different pathology centers. Genotyping of HBV was performed by direct sequencing and phylogenetic tree was constructed.

Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of the HBV isolates were clustered in the genotype D.

Conclusion: Our results showed that genotype D is the only detectable genotype in Iranian HCC patients.

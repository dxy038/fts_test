This paper describes an active gate drive circuit for series-connected insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) with voltage balancing in high-voltage applications. The gate drive circuit not only amplifies the gate signal, but also actively limits the overvoltage during switching transients, while minimizing the switching transients and losses. In order to achieve the control objective, an analog closed-loop control scheme is adopted. The closed-loop control injects current to an IGBT gate as required to limit the IGBT collector-emitter voltage to a predefined level. The performance of the gate drive circuit is examined experimentally by the series connection of three IGBTs with conventional snubber circuits. The experimental results show the voltage balancing by an active control with wide variations in loads and imbalance conditions

Background and objective: HCV is now the most important cause of end stage liver disease There are 6 known genotypes and more than 50 sub types, that severity of disease, duration of therapy and outcome different from one genotype to others, in order to WHO recommended that determination of HCV genotypes are done in any part of the world in this study we determined HCV genotypes at kermanshah city.

Material and methods: The population of this cross-sectional study was HCV patients with positive PCR, who after completing questionnaire were referred to labratory for determination of genotypes based on direct sequencing information from 5utR and NS5B regions.

Results: in this study there were 122 patients with positive HCV Ab and PCR. Predominant genotype was 1(53.4%) and subtype Ia(27.81%) followed by Ilia (18%)/ I~I (17.2%), mix(8.1%) and IV(3.2%) in all groups predominant genotype was the same excepted in Hemodialysis that was more common than la and in women and the patients older than 50 years old were the predominant genotype.

Conclusion: Predominant genotype and subtype were I and la as the same as the others studies that were done in Iran and differs from neighboring east and west countries that III and IV were more common than others, and are the same as turkey and Russia. The source of infection was not dependent factor significantly associated with predominant genotype that in most groups I was the predominant, statistic analysis didn't showed defined association between Hemodialysis and II genotype. The predominant genotype in woman was II and statistic Analysis showed a defined association between female and II genotype (p<0.003) and between IV genotype and Hemodialysis (p<0.016). At age older than 50 years old predominant genotype was II that probably was due to modification of HCV genotype pattern through the years.

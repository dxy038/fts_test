Computer games follow a scheme of continuous simulation, coupling the rendering phase and the simulation phase. That way of operation has disadvantages that can be avoided using a discrete event simulator as a game kernel. This paper proposes to integrate a discrete event simulator (DESK) to manage the videogames events. The videogame kernel used is Fly3D. The new kernel is called DFlySD. It allows a discrete event simulation scheme and the rendering and simulation phase independence. The integration objective has been to maintain the FlySD main structure and functionality, changing only the events management. The videogames objects behavior and interconnection is modeled by message passing. Maintaining the videogame quality, the videogames created using DFlySD allow reducing the computer power used to execute it. That allows to execute the videogame in computers with less computing power or to improve the game quality

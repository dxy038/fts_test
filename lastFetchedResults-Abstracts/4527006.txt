In this work we consider routing and sink location problems in sensor networks and propose two new mixed integer programming formulations to determine optimal sink locations and data flow routes. The models basically differ in the formulations of their objective functions. We assume that the sensor field consists of a finite set of points, and sensors, which are located on a subset, cover the points of the field completely. Experimental results indicate that these new formulations are very efficient and optimal solutions can be computed easily even for large networks. We also propose Lagrangean relaxation methods to solve the formulations approximately.

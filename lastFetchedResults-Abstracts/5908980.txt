In process planning setup planning and operation sequencing are the major issues. In setup planning feature having same approach direction &amp; tool commonality are grouped into setup. After making different setups operation sequencing in each setup is done for setup planning neural network is efficient. Operation sequencing problem is converted into the traveling salesman problem in which objective function is to reduce total cost. To solve these issues in an efficient manner Genetic Algorithm technique is more suitable because it is a viable means for searching the solution space of operation sequence providing a computational time on the order of a few seconds. The present work generates the results for the prismatic parts. The presented algorithm for setup planning and operation sequencing is efficient enough for its use as a module within the development of a CAPP system.

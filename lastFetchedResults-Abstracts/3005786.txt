We perform a system-level evaluation of conventional and decoupled space-time processing strategies for the enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE) system. The main idea of decoupled space-time (D-ST) processing is to enhance the performance of the temporal equalizer by separating cochannel interference (CCI) reduction from inter-symbol interference (ISI) suppression in two stages. Here, we employ a DDFSE as the temporal equalizer, which is a promising reduced-complexity equalization scheme for EDGE. In this contribution, the bit error rate (BER) performance of D-ST-DDFSE is accessed at both link- and system-levels. Concerning the system-level evaluation, an estimation of the output signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) is performed for different load conditions and channel profiles such as the COST259 typical urban (TU) and bad urban (BU). Our objective is to show the potential gains of space-time processing in EDGE for extremely tight reuse patterns.

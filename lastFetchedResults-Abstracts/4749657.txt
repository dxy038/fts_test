The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the application of matrices in generating a three-dimensional stick figure from sampled magneto-resistive sensor readings. While conventional frame capture techniques offer at best post-analysis motion studies, three-dimensional stick figures may be rendered for real-time and post-analysis studies. An added benefit of rendering a three-dimensional stick figure is the flexibility in changing the observerÂ´s perspective

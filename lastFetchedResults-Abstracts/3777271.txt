In this paper, some morphological transformations are used to detect the background in images characterized by poor lighting. Lately, contrast image enhancement has been carried out by the application of two operators based on the WeberÂ´s law notion. The first operator employs information from block analysis, while the second transformation utilizes the opening by reconstruction, which is employed to define the multibackground notion. The objective of contrast operators consists in normalizing the grey level of the input image with the purpose of avoiding abrupt changes in intensity among the different regions. Finally, the performance of the proposed operators is illustrated through the processing of images with different backgrounds, the majority of them with poor lighting conditions.

The present paper advances a new watermarking method featuring robustness against noise addition, transcoding and the StirMark (geometric) attacks. The mark is inserted into the MPEG-4 AVC quantisation indexes selected according to an energy-based selection criterion validated by information theory basic concepts. The insertion procedure combines the QIM principles and a perceptual mask obtained by adapting the popular Watson results. The video corpus consists of 7 video sequences (2 hours). The transparency is exhibited by both subjective and objective evaluations.

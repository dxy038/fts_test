An experimental study has been made, with the objective to find the impact of directed forced convection (impingement) on food quality. Two different foods were chosen for the study, yeast buns (representing category bread) and pork cutlet (representing meats). The tests were made in an experimental oven intended for the domestic market. The main results were a shorter cooking time and more uniform browning for meat (a reduction by up to 50% at similar air temperature as recommended). For smaller pieces of meat, browning was a general problem, as centre temperature increased to rapidly, at the air temperatures tested here.

Objective: To investigate the effect of fluticasone propionate (FP) on the symptom of nasal obstruction and to assess the correlation between the subjective visual analogue score (VAS) and the objective acoustic rhinometry (AR) measurements. Methods: A prospective study of 45 consecutive patients, 30 males and 15 females with a mean age of 27 years (range: 16â€“59 years), with moderate/severe symptoms of perennial rhinitis who were treated by FP nasal spray for 4 weeks. AR and VAS were used to evaluate, compare and correlate the efficacy of FP nasal sprays. Results: There was a significant improvement in the VAS post-treatment (3.9) compared with pre-treatment (6.3). There was also a significant increase in the nasal volume (V) and minimum cross-sectional area (MCA) after intranasal FP. Good correlation between the total MCA and total V was noted. Subjective improvements in symptoms did not correlate well with objective measurements as the correlation between VAS and AR was poor. Conclusion: Our study provides subjective and objective evidence on the efficacy of intranasal FP in improving nasal obstruction in perennial rhinitis. AR also proved to be a useful instrument in monitoring the effectiveness of medical therapy for perennial rhinitis.

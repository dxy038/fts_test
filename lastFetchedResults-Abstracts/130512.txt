Scheduling and sequencing problems are the most significant areas in production planning and are applicable to a number of service and manufacturing firms. Nowadays, one of the main objectives for every unit in an organization, its survival, present competitions, and in this global village is to increase the customer satisfaction. Thus, this issue has its effect on doing the job for any organization. In this paper, the customer satisfaction is considered as the main objective function divided into three different objectives such as minmizing the maximum lateness, the number of tardy jobs, and the total late work. Due to the complexity of the associated mathematical model, a new heuristic algorithm, named three blocks (3B), is presented in this paper. To show the efficiency of the propposed algorithm, a number of test problems are generated at random and solved by the above algorithm. Finally, the obtained results are compared with the optimal solution in terms of the computatioanl time and objective function values. However, it takes more than three hours to find the optimal solution for 9 jobs and more.

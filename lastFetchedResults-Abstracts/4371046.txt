In this paper, the problem of bit-errors recovery in JPEG2000 images transmission is addressed, with particular attention to errors in the high-frequency components. In the HL and LH sub-bands, differently from the LL band, interpolation based recovering results tend to be often ineffective when more than a few adjacent wavelet coefficients are missing. The solution proposed is then to apply a wavelet patch repetition procedure by predicting the similitude between the contour structure in the damaged area and its surroundings. To this aim, the correlation in the spatial structure, that is the contour information, existing between different sub-bands has been analyzed and exploited. Accordingly, the patch used to conceal the corrupted region is that obtained by minimizing a correlation measure with the spatial structure extracted from an adjacent not corrupted subband. Objective and subjective improvements have been obtained

of higher education. Descriptive-survey method and combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques have been used for the present study. The statistical
population included the students and teachers of the University of Kurdestan and
the required sample was obtained through stratified proportional to size sampling
method. Questionnaire and semi-structured interview as well as focused groups
were used for the collection of the data. For the analysis of the data the following
techniques were applied: descriptive statistics, t-test of independent groups, t-test
of dependent groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The findings of
the research indicate that in the viewpoints of the teachers and students, the existing
professional ethical condition in the field of educational activities is below average.
At the same time the respondents opined that it was necessary to pay attention to
such standards in the university education.
The comparison of the viewpoints of the teachers and students and consideration
of other demographic features of the sample in the secondary analysis demonstrated
a sort of convergence in their viewpoints with regard to the current condition and
desirable condition of these standards.

In this research, we propose a general relationship model for Eco-enterprises in an EIP based on the Smith model. The proposed relationship model has one objective - set the desired production capacity for any symbiotic enterprise to establish a self-control mechanism. A Liyapunuofu function approach is introduced into the specific relationship model based on mutualism. A fourth-order Runge Kutta algorithm is introduced into mining data so that the relationship model can be applied to establish an orderly and harmonious environment with self-control mechanism.

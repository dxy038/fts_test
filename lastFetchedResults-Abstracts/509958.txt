Introduction: Endobronchial actinomycosis is an uncommon disease with symptoms of cough, hemoptysis and endobronchial obstruction. It can imitate the presentations of pulmonary tuberculosis or cancer.

Case Report: A 68 year-old male was referred with the complaint of fever, cough and severe hemoptysis. His weight loss during the last 3 months was 8 kgs. Blood tests indicated mild leukocytosis and increased sedimentation rate. In his chest radiography, opacity was observed in the left lower pulmonary lobe. Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy revealed a nodular lesion in the lateral segment of left lower lobe. Pathologic diagnosis confirmed the presence of actinomycosis.

Conclusion: Although endobronchial actinomycosis is uncommon, it is included in the differential diagnosis of endobronchial obstructive lesions, especially bronchogenic malignant tumors and bronchial tuberculosis. In areas with high incidence of tuberculosis, endobronchial actinomycosis can mimic its symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate whether maternal serum corticotropin-releasing factor levels during pregnancy were predictive of spontaneous preterm delivery. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal serum levels of corticotropin-releasing factor and its binding protein were measured from 20 weeks of gestation in a cross-sectional study of 396 asymptomatic women at high risk for preterm delivery. RESULTS: Gestational ageâ€“specific corticotropin-releasing factor levels were not consistently or substantially increased for preterm compared with term deliveries, whether preterm delivery was due to preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. The binding protein for corticotropin-releasing factor did not vary according to gestational age until term, when it dropped substantially. CONCLUSION: Serum corticotropin-releasing factor levels do not appear to be an important predictor of preterm birth in asymptomatic patients who subsequently have either preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. Nevertheless, the drop in the corticotropin-releasing factor binding protein level at term suggests that the bioavailability of corticotropin-releasing factor increases as parturition approaches.

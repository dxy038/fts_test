Nonlinear finite element analysis is used to investigate the quasi-static axial collapse response of cylindrical tubes which are externally stiffened by multiple identical rings. The rings divide the long tube into a series of short thin-walled tubes. It is assumed that the size and shape of integral stiffeners are controlled through a machining process. The effects of various geometric parameters such as wall thickness, ring spacing, ring thickness and width on the collapse response, crush force and energy absorption of monolithic, integrally stiffened steel tubes are studied and used as a general framework for a design optimization study. Through design and analysis of computer experiments, global metamodels are developed for the mean crush force and energy absorption, using the radial basis function approximation technique. Using both single- and multi-objective design optimization formulations, optimum designs for different response characteristics are found. The crush mode in the form of progressive collapse or buckling is found to heavily depend on the ratio of stiffener spacing to stiffener height as well as the ratio of wall thickness to stiffener thickness. The optimization results show the viability of externally stiffened tubes as efficient energy absorbers.

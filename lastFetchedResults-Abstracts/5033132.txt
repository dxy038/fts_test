In this paper, we analyze a dataset containing student and industrial developer ratings about the key software engineering concept of object-oriented class dasiacohesionpsila. In particular, we use a number of statistical tests to determine, as a key objective, the extent to which student developers and industrial developers differ. Results revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the cohesion ratings for the two groups. Correlation of cohesion against class features, however, did reveal evidence that the two groups might be disparate. The research suggests that student and industry practitioners may not differ to the large extent that is commonly believed but when class features are used as a benchmark do show certain differences.

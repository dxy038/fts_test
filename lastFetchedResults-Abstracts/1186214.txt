The layup optimization by genetic algorithm (GA) for the composite wing subject to random gust is presented. The aim of optimization is to maximize the strength of wing and the failure index of Tsaiâ€“Hill criterion is used as the objective function. The failure index is calculated by Monte Carlo simulation because the external loading and the material properties have random characteristics. The optimization results are validated by comparing the failure probability of the initial and optimal designs. In addition, the optimum by maximum stiffness criterion is also obtained to show that current objective function is appropriate for the design of composite wing.

For a long time the design of internal combustion engine is commonly used trial and error method. By traditional design methods the design results will only be feasible option meeting the design requirements, but not be the optimal solution. Therefore it is of great significance to design the operating parameters of vehicle engine by design optimization method. The cooling area of cylinder greatly impacts on the thermal efficiency of engine, the cylinder heat loading may be measured by cooling area of unit cylinder volume, so that the smallest cylinder cooling area is chosen as the objective function. The drawbacks of the traditional optimization methods is that solving process is complicated, and optimizing process is easy to fall into local optimal solution. In this paper, the simulated annealing method is adopted to optimize operating parameters of vehicle engine, so that optimization process was simplified and the global optimal solution is ensured reliably.

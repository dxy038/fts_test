We consider single machine scheduling and due date assignment problems in which the processing time of a job depends on its position in a processing sequence. The objective functions include the cost of changing the due dates, the total cost of discarded jobs that cannot be completed by their due dates and, possibly, the total earliness of the scheduled jobs. We present polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithms in the case of two popular due date assignment methods: CON and SLK. The considered problems are related to mathematical models of cooperation between the manufacturer and the customer in supply chain scheduling.

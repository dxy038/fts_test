Micro-grid technology provides an opportunity and a desirable infrastructure for improving efficiency of electrical and thermal energy consumption. The key to improve electrical and thermal energy efficiency in operation is to coordinate and optimize the operation of various energy resources and loads. In this paper, a typical micro-grid consisting of photovoltaic and wind turbine as renewable resources and diesel generator, combined heat and power and boiler as other Supply resources and battery as system´s storage is considered. The objective function was minimizing overall cost of electrical and thermal energy during 24 hours. With regards to demand and supply balance and operation constraints of every energy source and storage and also considering demand response plans, the objective function was minimized by specifying each unit´s production or storage. Simulation results show that, a significant save of money and fuel can be achieved through scheduling and control of various energy supply and storage resources.

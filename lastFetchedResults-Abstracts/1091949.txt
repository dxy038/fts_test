
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Kidney transplantation is a choice treatment for most patients with end-stage renal disease and transplantation outcome is different in kidney transplant centers. This study was done to analyze the results of kidney transplantation in kidney transplant center of Shahid Beheshti hospital in Babol, Iran.
METHODS: This survival analysis study was performed on the results of the first 200 renal transplantations during 5 consecutive years. Data including age, sex, 1, 2 and 3 years graft and patient survival, kidney transplant recipients, nephrologic and urologic complications, and creatinine distribution at end of 1, 2 and 3 years after transplantation were gathered and evaluated.
FINDINGS: The mean age of patients was 39.34Â±15.1 years, and 116 (58%) of patients were male. 1, 2 and 3 year graft survival was 98.86%, 97.3% and 97.3%, respectively and 1, 2 and 3 year patient survival was 96.63%, 96.63% and 93.12%, respectively. Treatment of clinical acute rejection without pathological diagnosis was performed on 19 patients (9.5%) and 16 patients responded to treatment. Acute tubular necrosis and gradual decrease in creatinine was seen in 13%. The surgical complication was seen in 3.5%.of patients who respond to treatment. At the end of first year, 0.5% of patients had creatinine more than 2.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the short term graft survival in kidney transplant recipients was considerable.

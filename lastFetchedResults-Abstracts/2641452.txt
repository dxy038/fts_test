Data were collected using a valid and reliable questionnaire covering nine dimensions of organizational issues including leadership and management, planning, organizational learning, organizational culture, employee management, customer management, resource management, process management, and organizational performance. The data were analyzed by statistical tests using the SPSS software

The most and least success were observed for planning and employee management dimensions respectively. Process management, organizational culture and customer management constructs had the most effect on the success of strategic plans. Significant statistical correlation was also observed between strategic planning implementation and managers' commitment (p= 0.0001, r= 0.406), employees’ involvement (p= 0.0001, r= 0.338), and physicians’ participation (p= 0.001, r= 0.363).

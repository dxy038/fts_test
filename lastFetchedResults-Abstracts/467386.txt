Objective: We investigated the influence of acute hypoxia on the placental vascular endothelial growth factor system in vitro and in vivo in acute birth asphyxia compared with pregnancies that were complicated by preeclampsia and with healthy control subjects. Study design: Messenger RNA levels for vascular endothelial growth factor, flt-1, and KDR were measured by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction in human placental choriocarcinoma cells (BeWo) that were exposed to hypoxia (1% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, 94% nitrogen) and in placental tissue of neonates with birth asphyxia (n = 20), newborn infants of mothers with preeclampsia (n = 20), and gestational age-matched control subjects. Immunhistologically, placental vascular endothelial growth factor protein expression was compared among the groups. Results: In BeWo cells, vascular endothelial growth factor, flt-1 and KDR messenger RNA increased in a time-dependent manner in response to hypoxia. In vivo, vascular endothelial growth factor/β-actin and KDR/β-actin messenger RNA were significantly higher in placental tissue of newborn infants with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy than with newborn infants with mild or no hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and control subjects. In chronic placental hypoxia (preeclampsia), vascular endothelial growth factor and both receptors were found to be up-regulated. Increased placental vascular endothelial growth factor expression was confirmed by immunohistologic examination. Conclusion: The vascular endothelial growth factor system is up-regulated in response to placental hypoxia and is assumed to be a potential early indicator of severe birth asphyxia.

This paper describes the application of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) fiber optic technology to support an antenna remoting infrastructure for high density, multi-channel wireless communications. The approach uses fiber optic supertrunking of multiple RF channels. It employs Er-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) to provide extended range capabilities (20 km to 50 km) with analog signals without the use of electronic repeaters. We describe a design approach that facilitates radio frequency (RF) spectrum management and improves range operations with a smaller compliment of antennas. The objective is to affect cost reductions through system improvements related to the quantity of antennas, placement of antennas, maintenance of equipment and management of the RF spectrum. The discussion includes analysis and results of the constraints on the optimum operating condition with a balance between distortion, thermal noise, optical intensity noise, spontaneous intensity noise and the optical receiver sensitivity. The goals include reduction in costs and the mitigation of collocation and interference problems

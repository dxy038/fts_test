Background and objective: The periodic evaluation of antimicrobial activity of different antibiotic is essential because  antibiotic sensitivity pattern may also changed during short courses. The aim of this study  was to assess the  frequency of Multi-drug Resistance (MDR) in Gram negative uropathogens.

Material and Methods: This study was conducted on 111 gram negative uropathogens using standard  microbiology  methods in Gorgan, 2011-2012. Antibiotic susceptibility was investigated  by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion methods (DDM).

Results:  the most common isolates were klebsiella ( 40.5%) , Enterobacter (26.1%) , pseudomonas (13.5%) , proteus( 6.3%) , acinetobacter (1.8% ) and other gram negative bacteria ( 18.3%) .The highest  antibiotic resistance  was seen  to  clindamycin (99.1%), and the most sensitivity  to Carbapenems (94.6%).Multi drug resistant  was seen in 68.5% of isolates. In inpatients,  all of the citrobacter species had resistant to multi drugs simultaneously. 

Conclusion:a  high frequency of multi drug resistant in uropathogens  is  observed in both inpatients  and outpatients.

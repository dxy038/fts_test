Conformal or flush-mounted window antennas of various types have recently become popular on commercial vehicles. Their performance, however, is generally less well characterised than that of their more conventional counterparts. The paper presents some results from a study of the effects of the vehicle body on the performance of various conformal window antennas at VHF. The objective is to develop a design procedure for these antennas when used either singly or within diversity schemes. The NEC-2 moment method (MM) code was used for all the simulations and the results were compared with full scale measurements

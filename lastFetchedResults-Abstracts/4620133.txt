Single-image space resection is a fundamental issue of photogrammetry. This paper designs an anti-symmetric matrix to constitute Rodrigues matrix, used to represent the rotation matrix, then establishes the mathematical model of space resection applied to pattern search method, further uses pattern search method to directly solve the three elements of the antisymmetric matrix, finally obtains the attitude elements and line elements. The algorithm needs only objective function value without linearization, and has weak demand of initial values of 3 elements of the anti-symmetric matrix; no matter the attitude angles are small or large. Illustrative examples are given.

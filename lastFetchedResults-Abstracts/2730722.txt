A real-time coding system with lookahead consists of a memoryless source, a memoryless channel, an encoder, which encodes the source symbols sequentially with knowledge of future source symbols up to a fixed finite lookahead <i>d</i> , with or without feedback of the past channel output symbols and a decoder, which sequentially constructs the source symbols using the channel output. The objective is to minimize the expected per-symbol distortion. For a fixed finite lookahead <i>d</i> &#8805; 1, we invoke the theory of controlled Markov chains to obtain an average cost optimality equation (ACOE), the solution of which, denoted by <i>D</i>(<i>d</i>), is the minimum expected per-symbol distortion. With increasing <i>d</i>, <i>D</i>(<i>d</i>) bridges the gap between causal encoding, <i>d</i>=0, where symbol-by-symbol encoding-decoding is optimal and the infinite lookahead case, <i>d</i>=&#8734;, where Shannon Theoretic arguments show that separation is optimal. We extend the analysis to a system with finite-state decoders, with or without noise-free feedback. For a Bernoulli source and binary symmetric channel, under Hamming loss, we compute the optimal distortion for various source and channel parameters, and thus obtain computable bounds on <i>D</i>(<i>d</i>). We also identify regions of source and channel parameters where symbol-by-symbol encoding-decoding is suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our approach by applying it in additional coding scenarios, such as the case where the sequential decoder can take cost-constrained actions affecting the quality or availability of side information about the source.

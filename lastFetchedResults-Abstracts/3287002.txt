Battery and plug-in hybrid vehicles equipped with bidirectional battery chargers are capable of supplying power to the electric grid according to power system demand. This technology is called &#8220;vehicle to grid&#8221; or V2G. A bidirectional on-board charger can be used to improve the charge availability. An on-board charger should have small size and light weight. On the other hand, the charger must minimize power quality impact, draw current at high power factor to maximize power from an outlet. In this paper, a new three-phase integrated bidirectional isolated soft-switched battery charger is proposed which is appropriate for vehicle to grid technology. The charger utilizes a 4-switch 3&#934;-rectifier as the front-end AC/DC converter and a phase-shift controlled dual bridge series resonant as the rear-end DC/DC converter. The performance of the proposed charger is investigated by simulation results.

Background & Objective: Since 2003, University Open Day (UOD) is being held in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences to introduce the University's capacities and help students become familiar and finally select a study field. This study aimed to evaluate students' point of view about the effect of UOD on selecting field of study in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, a self-directed questionnaire was distributed amongst students of all study fields and educational levels including technician's, bachelor's, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy in entrance years 2003 to 2007 in their classrooms. Results: Among 940 students of entrance years 2003 to 2007 in all fields and educational levels, only 218 (23%) had visited the UOD. Most of them (60%) declared the reason that they chose their field was their matriculation score, alone or together with other factors. 2.7 percent (the minority) believed that the guidance provided by UOD attending authorities was a contributing factor to select a field. The majority (63.5%) demonstrated that parents contributed to field selection while 0.5% chose the guidance provided by UOD attending authorities as a contributing factor. 36 percent of students declared that they chose the University due to being close to their hometown or family and only 2 (1%) declared that the guidance provided by UOD attending authorities affected their choice.

Conclusion: According to the results of this study and costs of holding this program, revisions

should be made in following years and UOD should be held in other forms.

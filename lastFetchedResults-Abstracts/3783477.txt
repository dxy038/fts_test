Since the PWM induction motor drive has become the industrial drive of choice, applications involving four-quadrant operation for AC drives have become more common. To satisfy such applications, a regenerative AC/DC converter that is robust is needed to allow bidirectional power flow between the load and power distribution system. A robust technology that is well understood is the 6 SCR converter operating in the inverting mode. However, the typical 6 SCR converter will either limit the maximum DC bus voltage or require a step-up transformer. The proposed regenerative converter allows the SCR power structure to operate as a synchronous line commutator, while a two-transistor series/shunt chopper, with a power resistor, controls the regenerative power flow, and offers an emergency braking capability. In addition, SCR commutation is accomplished by the line voltage and diversion of bus current. Both simulation and experimental results are given

This paper presents an original software implementation of the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) applied and adapted to the multi-objective optimization of a polysiloxane synthesis process. An optimized feed-forward neural network, modeling the variation in time of the main parameters of the process, was used to calculate the vectorial objective function of NSGA-II, as an enhancement to the multi-objective optimization procedure. An original technique was utilized in order to find the most appropriate parameters for maximizing the performance of NSGA-II. The algorithm provided the optimum reaction conditions (reaction temperature, reaction time, amount of catalyst, and amount of co-catalyst), which maximize the reaction conversion and minimize the difference between the obtained viscometric molecular weight and the desired molecular weight. The algorithm has proven to be able to find the entire non-dominated Pareto front and to quickly evolve optimal solutions as an acceptable compromise between objectives competing with each other. The use of the neural network makes it also suitable to the multi-objective optimization of processes for which the amount of knowledge is limited.

The objective of this study was to produce and characterise xylitol microcapsules for use in foods, in order to prolong the sweetness and cooling effect provided by this ingredient. Complex coacervation was employed as the microencapsulation method. A preliminary double emulsion step was performed due to the hydrophilicity of xylitol. The microcapsules obtained were characterised in terms of particle size and morphology (optical, confocal and scanning electron microscopy), solubility, sorption isotherms, FTIR, encapsulation efficiency and release study. The microcapsules of xylitol showed desirable characteristics for use in foods, such as a particle size below 109 Î¼m, low solubility and complete encapsulation of the core by the wall material. The encapsulation efficiency ranged from 31% to 71%, being higher in treatments with higher concentrations of polymers. Release of over 70% of the microencapsulated xylitol in artificial saliva occurred within 20 min.

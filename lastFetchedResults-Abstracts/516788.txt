Objective: The aim of the present research is to analyze the role of memory self-efficacy on the function of episodic and semantic memory among male and female students. Method: A sample comprising 16 female and 16 male psychology undergraduate students from Tarbyat Moalem University was se-lected using cluster sampling from among six groups of psychology, educa-tional technology, curriculum planning, counseling and guidance, educational basis, and educational administration. Episodic memory was examined us¬ing test of recalling high and low frequency words as well as famous and non-famous images. Semantic memory was evaluated using mobility and classification vocabulary tests. A 2 X 2 factor design (two genders and two self-efficacy levels) was used. Results: ANOVA results showed a significant difference in episodic memory between students' high and low self-efficacy. In other words, higher memory self-efficacy leads to a better function of episodic memory. There is no significant difference in semantic memory be¬tween students with high and low self-efficacy. Conclusion: The interaction of gender and self-efficacy factors had no significant effects on the function of semantic and episodic memory.

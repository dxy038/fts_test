The objective of this study was to evaluate a partially introgressed (Gossypiumbarbadense L. × 
G. hirsutum L.) population of cotton for two years. The traits that studied were lint yield per plant, 
lint %, fiber length, fiber strength and micronaire. A total of 31 cytogenetically stable lines (2n=4x=52) were produced from a cross between a G. barbadense line, Carnak and a G. hirsutumline, 4S, through an alien pollination production system and three generations of self-pollination. Normal distribution was observed for all traits that studied apart from lint yieldper plant. Coefficients of variation were the highest for lint yield per plant and lint %. Heritability for lint yield ranged from 0.77 in 2004 to 0.71 in 2005. Correlation coefficients were the highest between fiber length and fiber strength which may indicate the possibility of concurrent selection of lines within the population for these two traits. In addition, micronaire and lint yield per plant were favorably associated. In the partially introgressed population (PI), Carnak × 4S, several lines that combined better yield, fiber quality performance or both than the introgressed parental lines were identified.

We extend the concepts of &#945;-Q-Effective solution and &#945;-Effective solution to the model of multi-objective linear programming problem with fuzzy coefficient constraints. The levels of &#945;-Q-Effective solution and &#945;-Effective solution are uniquely determined, which fully describe the degree of solution satisfying constraints. &#945;-Effective solution has the highest degree of constraint satisfaction among the &#945;-Q-Effective solutions of achieving the same goal. A numerical example is given to illustrate the difference between Q-Effective solution and Effective solution in the multi-objective linear programming problem with fuzzy coefficient constraints.

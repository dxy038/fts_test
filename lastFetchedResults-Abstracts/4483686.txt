This paper proposes a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with an adaptive weight. Benchmark tests of the algorithm is described. Compared with standard PSO, it shows better convergence as well as ability of escaping from local optima. Diesel engines must meet the increasing demands for higher efficiency, cleaner exhaust gases and better drivability. Model-Based control is one of effective solutions to satisfy these demands. In this paper, a model-Based control system Based on the proposed algorithm is designed for the objective of raising fuel efficiency and reducing environmental-burden. A set of simulation results have demonstrated potential of such advanced engine control logic.

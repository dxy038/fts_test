This paper studies the problem of designing H<sub>infin</sub> controllers for networked control systems (NCSs) with both network-induced time delay and packet dropout by using active varying sampling period method, where the sampling period switches in a finite set. The newly proposed active varying sampling period method can ensure the sufficient use of network bandwidth. A multi-objective optimization methodology in terms of LMIs is proposed to deal with the problem of H<sub>infin</sub> controller design for NCSs with active varying sampling period, and the parameter uncertainty-based method is also adopted for H<sub>infin</sub> controller design. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed parameter uncertainty-based H<sub>infin</sub> controller design.

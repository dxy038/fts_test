In the day of economic globalization, the ability of scientific and technological innovation is a measure of national comprehensiveness. The transformation of scientific and technological achievements which transformed the laboratory achievements into productive forces is an important part of the national innovation system. The successful transformation will directly determine the scale and efficiency of the scientific and technological innovation in a country. This paper regarded the transformation of scientific and technological achievements from the view of cooperation, analyzed its characteristics by using the complex adaptive system theory, and described its objective evolution laws. Then, the author defined the concept of cooperation entropy, and designed tripartite (universities, research institutions and enterprises) cooperation mechanism for income distribution based on the principle of maximum entropy, in older to ensure the cooperation system stable operates and evolve.

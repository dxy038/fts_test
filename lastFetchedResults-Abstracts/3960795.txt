This paper presents a new two-dimensional (2-D) optimum block stochastic gradient (TDOBSG) algorithm for 2-D adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filtering. The TDOBSG algorithm employs a space-varying convergence factor for all the filter coefficients, where the convergence factor at each block iteration is optimized in a least squares sense that the squared norm of the a posteriori estimation error vector is minimized. It has the same order of computational complexity as another 2-D optimum block adaptive (TDOBA) algorithm. Computer simulations for image restoration show that the TDOBSG algorithm outperforms the TDOBA algorithm and other related algorithms in terms of objective and/or subjective measures

The performance of a visible light communication system is greatly affected by LED layout setting. Received power and SNR can be increased or decreased by changing LED placement. However, there is trade-off between received power and SNR. This makes it impossible to design a VLC system that maximizes both received power and SNR simultaneously. In this paper, we find the Pareto-optimal LED layout settings, as well as the performances according to these setting using the SPEA2 multi-objective optimization algorithm. Based on the result of the multi-objective optimization process, one can design a VLC system with optimized performance.

Objective: Our aim was to assess the knowledge of women regarding the gender-specific health risks associated with smoking. Study Design: A cross-sectional survey was given to 388 female hospital employees. Knowledge of smoking-related illnesses that are specific to women was assessed. Regression analysis was used to discern potential predictors of this knowledge. Results: Most women are aware that smoking causes respiratory disease (99%), lung cancer (99%), heart disease (96%), and pregnancy complications (91%). Few women are aware of the health risks of smoking that are specific to women, such as infertility (22%), osteoporosis (30%), early menopause (17%), spontaneous abortion (39%), ectopic pregnancy (27%), and cervical cancer (24%). Knowledge of these health risks was not predicted by age, education, or smoking status. Health care professionals were no more likely than other women to have knowledge of these risks. Conclusion: Most women are unaware of the health risks specific to women from smoking. Even female health care professionals do not generally have greater knowledge of these conditions. Further public health measures are necessary to increase knowledge of smoking risks that may be particularly relevant to women. This increase in knowledge has the potential to reduce significantly the smoking-related illnesses in women. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:934-9.)

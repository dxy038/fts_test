The ferroresonant transformer is used to compare transformers of the same output using 9 Mil, 11 Mil and 14 Mil laminations. The objective is to decide how the improvements in efficiency with the thinner laminations are reflected in performance as measured in temperature rise, stack length and increased watts output

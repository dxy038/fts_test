Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is one of the most widely disseminated manufacturing technologies, in particular as regards the generation of accurate and complex geometrical shapes on hard metallic components. Nevertheless current EDM technologies have major limitations when dealing with fine surface finish over large process area. Indeed this is one reason that explains the need of final manual polishing of mould cavities performed by EDM. Recently EDM with powder-mixed dielectric (PMD-EDM) has been a focus of an intense research work in order to overcome these technological performance barriers. This paper presents a research work within the objective to acquire deep knowledge on EDM technology with powder mixed dielectric and to compare its performance to the conventional EDM when dealing with the generation of high-quality surfaces. In particular the analysis of the effect of the electrode area in the surface quality measured by the surface roughness and craters morphology was carried out for both technologies. The results achieved evidenced a linear relationship between the electrode area and the surface quality measures as well as a significant performance improvement when the powder mixed dielectric is used.

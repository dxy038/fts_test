A rough-to-fine image registration algorithm is brought forward for the calculation of satellite attitude information. Rough transformation parameters are calculated through feature point sets algorithm. In fine registration process, edge map of partial real-time image is firstly detected and edge tentative connection technique is applied, then edge labeling is performed; the objective coastline is matched through dynamic programming. After this, chain code-based corner detector and cubic B-spline interpolation are used to acquire the accurate position of corners on coastline; arc length restriction is applied in the corner matching algorithm and corner matching confidence is calculated.; accurate transformation parameters are obtained adopting the least squares method with arc-length as weight. Simulated experimental results indicate that the algorithm is of high accuracy and timesaving

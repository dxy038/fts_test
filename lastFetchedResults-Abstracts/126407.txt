Introduction: Meningiomas are usually slow growing and benign neoplasms that arise from the intracranial and spinal meninges and their dural extensions. They constitue about 20% of all central nervous system neoplasms. Objective: The objective of this study was to gain more insight into some of important characteristics of meningioma in neurological department of the hospital.
Materials and Methods: We reviewed retrospectively a series of 62 patients operated on for an intracranial meningioma over a period of 6 years (1994-1999).
Setting of study was Rasht Poorsina Hospital and medical records were used. Demographic characteristics, age, gender, clinical, pathological, radiological and other important data were investigated and analyzed. Results: Meningioma represent 19.1% [CI95%: 14.8%-23.3%] of intracranial tumors. Mean age was 49.1 Â± 11.7 years. Female/ male ratio was nearly 1.6:1. History of head trauma was seen in 5 (8.1%).
Contraceptive pills were used in 23.7% of women. The most common presenting symptom was headache.
The majority of tumors originated in convexity of brain. Peritumoral edema was observed in 37 (59.7%) of cases. Fibroblastic tumors were the most common reported pathology. In our series, we did not observed malignant meningioma and/or multiple meningioma.
Conclusion: Findings of this study were consistent with other demographic and clinical studies.

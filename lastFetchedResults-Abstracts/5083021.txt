The path following problem is concerned for conventional surface ships with second order nonholonomic constraints. A nonlinear feedback algorithm is presented using decoupling control method. The cross track error and heading error are stabilized by means of the rudder alone and the thruster is left to adjust the forward speed. The underactuated following control objective is achieved without a reference orientation generated by a ship model. The estimation of systemic uncertainties and disturbances and the yaw velocity PE (persistent excitation) conditions are not required. Computer simulation results on a full nonlinear hydrodynamic ship model of M.V. YULONG are provided to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.

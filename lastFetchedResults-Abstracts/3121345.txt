Weapon target assignment (WTA) problem is the problem of assigning weapons to targets with the objective of minimizing the expected damage of targets. In this work, a standard expert system is proposed for the particular WTA problem. The idea is to build expert system using grid partitioning over a training set. The proposed system is implemented and tested with a number of randomly generated WTA instances. The proposed system has a satisfactory performance.

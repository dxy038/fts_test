The main objective of the paper is the development of an approach, that allows us to study complex problems by means of their behavior similarities. In particular for the study of combustion in spark ignition engines, with variations of the parameters and the operational conditions, first we establish a set of known patterns to be later compared with sets of combustion data, with the purpose of establishing the similarity of the patterns and the combustion data. Then, we make inferences of the conditions or functional state of the engines at any moment. We also present a method for the analysis of signals and systems based on the theory of temporal fuzzy sets and pattern recognition, by modeling the trajectories of dynamical systems in the fuzzy information space

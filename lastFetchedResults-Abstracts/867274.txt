In many applications of DEA finding the most efficient DMUs is desirable. This paper presents an improved integrated DEA model in order to detect the most efficient DMUs. The proposed integrated DEA model does not use the trial and error method in the objective function. Also, it is able to find the most efficient DMUs without solving the model n times (one linear programming (LP) for each DMU) and therefore allows the user to get faster results. It is shown that the improved integrated DEA model is always feasible and capable to rank the most efficient one. To illustrate the model capability the proposed methodology is applied to a real data set consisting of the 19 facility layout alternatives.

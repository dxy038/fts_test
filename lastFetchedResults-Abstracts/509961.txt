Background and Objective: Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas that can be associated with mild abdominal pain to severe disease and even death. In several studies various drugs have been used, with various results, to control the symptoms and to prevent its complications. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of octreotide in two groups of patients suffering from this disease.

Subjects and Methods: This research was carried out from March 2002 until September 2004 in Emam Khomeini (group A: 19 patients) and Golestan hospitals (group B: 6 patients) of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences. Group A was treated with octreotide (0.05 mg q 12 hr sc) and group B was treated with conventional method. Follow up period was at least 6 months.

Results: According to Ranson's criteria, severity of disease was greater in group A and octreotide therapy had no benefit in the healing time and relieving of fever and leukocytosis, but incidence of complications and mortality in group A was non-significantly lower than group B.

Conclusions: Although administration of octreotide had not significant effects on course of the disease (p>0.5), and the relapse rate was equal in both groups, it seems that this drug, at the prescribed dose of 0.05mg ql2 hrs sc, could be partially effective in lowering morbidity and mortality.

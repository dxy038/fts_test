The authors propose a predictive load sharing (PLS) scheme to elevate localised congestion by using the knowledge of users potentially entering and leaving a cell. They study the system in a linear bidirectional highway environment. Results show that load carried is increased and the handoff failure rate is lowered compared with the Fixed Channel Assignment (FCA) scheme. A lower handoff failure rate is a desirable feature since the forced termination of an existing call can be very annoying to a user

Background: Citizenship behavior is a useful valuable behavior manifested by individuals voluntarily. Thus, in the challenging world we live in, organizations seek competitive advantages by employing individuals who act beyond their tasks.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the structural relations between job satisfaction and organization citizenship behavior among nurses of Qazvin and Isfahan hospitals.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study was performed on 481 randomly selected nurses of Qazvin and Isfahan hospitals during the winter 2011. Data were collected through the "job satisfaction questionnaire” developed by Smith, Kendall, and Halyn" and the “organizational citizenship behavior questionnaire” employed by Gonzalez and Garsyakarazv in their study. Data were analyzed by descriptive correlation method and structural equation. 
Findings: The study of each individual aspect of job satisfaction revealed that nurses were satisfied with both the nature of their job and their colleagues (P < 0.001) while they were neither satisfied with their job promotion nor their supervisors (P < 0.05). The nurses also showed a high degree for all three aspects of organization citizenship behavior including organizational participation, delivery of service, and organizational loyalty (P < 0.001). Job satisfaction was shown to have significant direct effect on every dimension of organizational citizenship behavior (R2=0.32).
Conclusion: As demonstrated by the findings of the present study, while the level of job satisfaction was low among the nurses, the level of their citizenship behavior was high.

Multislot just-in time scheduling deals with processing a set of jobs in an environment with cyclically repeating due dates. Every job must be completed exactly at one of its due dates (just-in-time), and the objective is to minimize the number of cyclical periods (slots) in which all jobs can be scheduled, so that no two jobs scheduled on the same machine overlap in time. In this paper we consider several cases of the problem on identical parallel machines, and discuss their complexity.

The objective of this research was the identifying the contaminants of oil degrading bacteria.This study was conducted to isolate and identify oil-degrading bacilli. In order to increase the chances of isolating Bacillus samples were cultured on specific culture media (MSM) and was added 1% crude oil as the sole carbon source.By Culturing on blood agar, bacteria were isolated whit a beta hemolysis which produce biosurfactant. surface tension test  was done. emulsification tests were performed.for selected bacteria to identify the species of bacteria was used biochemicall medium.for evaluated degradation of crude oil We used gas chromatography(GC) and spectrophotometry. Surface tension for this strain equal 35  mN / m  the emulsification ability of the strains was 70%. Finally, this strain was identified as Bacillus cereus by molecular method.

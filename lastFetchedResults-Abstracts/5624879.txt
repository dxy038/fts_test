Vector feature matching method is one of the key techniques in data updating. In this paper, disadvantages of existed methods have been analyzed, and a matching method of polygon shapes based on tangent space has been proposed. This method has also combined with discrete curve evolution algorithm to improve the efficiency of matching shape, which can simplify the complexity of polygons . And the paper proposed a matching method for multi-characteristic vector elements of complex Polygon, base on the features of shape center, bidirectional overlap area and shape tangent space. The result of experiment shows that this algorithm is easy to implement. It has high matching efficiency for area feature in same-scale topographic map; also, it could be well used to match spatial area vector data in multi-scale.

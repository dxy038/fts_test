<p><strong>Background and objective:</strong> Shahr-e-Ray , Islamshahr and South Tehran were selected for this investigation. The main reason for the selection of these sites was based on the population density. The main objective of this investigation was to assess the sources and distribution of Salmonella serovars from barbecued meat, ground beef burgers and their antimicrobial resistance.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> In a one year period, a total of 390 samples of food, consisting of 195 samples of raw barbecuing meat and ground beef burgers and 195 samples of cooked ones were examined for the presence of Salmonella contamination.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> From a total of 195 raw samples, (n=33 ,16.9%) were Salmonella positive. Most detections of Salmonella occurred in Shahr-e- Ray (n=15, 45.5%) and then in South Tehran (n=10, 30.3%) and Islamshahr (n=8, 24.2%). The highest rates of detection of Salmonella occurred in Summer (n=17,51.5%). In serological evaluations of Salmonella, thompson serovar had the highest prevalence in barbecuing meat and ground beef burger samples (n=18,54.5%). Salmonella serovars were: (n=31, 93.9%), (n=30 ,90.9 %) and (n=30, 90.9 %) resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin and nalidixic acid respectively.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The results show that there is no reason for concern in consuming cooked barbecuing meat and ground beef burgers. In case of raw samples, microbes could originate from the vendors. Vendors have to be educated on hygienic practices which could help to reduce risks of food- borne infection. These data indicate that food handlers may contribute to contamination and that there are some handling practices that require more attention.</p>

Objective
ilot study examined the relationship of education level, years of critical care nursing experience, and critical thinking (CT) ability (skills and dispositions) to consistency in clinical decision making among critical care nurses. Consistency was defined as the degree to which intuitive and analytical decision processes resulted in similar selection of interventions in tasks of low and high complexity.

udy was nonexperimental and correlational.

al care nurses (n = 54) from adult critical care units in 3 private teaching hospitals. The majority of nurses held a BSN or MSN and had an average of 9 years of direct clinical experience in the care of the critically ill.
s
on-making consistency decreased significantly between low-complexity and high-complexity tasks. Both intuitive and analytical decision processes produced clear intervention selections in the low-complexity task, although the analytical process resulted in a more complete specification of interventions. In the high-complexity task, however, only the intuitive process resulted in a clear, plausible, and safe specification of interventions. Education and experience were not related to CT ability, nor was CT ability related to decision-making consistency. Only greater years of critical care nursing experience increased the likelihood of decision-making consistency.
sions
l, intuitive decision processes resulted in more clinically consistent selection of interventions across tasks. More investigation is needed to examine the influence of decision heuristics, and the conceptualization and measurement of CT abilities among practicing nurses.

The objective of this work was to lower the sintering temperature of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) without reducing the piezoelectric performance. PZT was sintered using PbO–WO3 additive of eutectic composition, which assists the densification process by liquid-phase formation. Sintering was carried out from 1075 to 1125 °C between 1 and 4 h. Density, dielectric properties and piezoelectric properties were measured. Microstructure and fracture mechanism have been studied by SEM. At the mildest sintering conditions, the additive has a positive effect on dielectric and piezoelectric properties. The liquid-phase sintering leads to a denser material without additional grain growth. PZT with PbO–WO3 additive is mechanically weaker than pure PZT. The liquid phase leads to weaker grain boundaries and the material cracks in intergranular fracture, whereas pure PZT has a mixture of intergranular and transgranular fracture, and PZT sintered conventionally at 1260 °C has transgranular fracture.

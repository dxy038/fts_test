The study of the synthesis and catalytic properties of the oxovanadium(IV) complex [N,N′-bis(3-ethoxysalicylidene)-m-xylylenediamine]oxovanadium(IV) ([VO(L)]) is the principal objective in this work. The Schiff base (L) and the its oxovanadium complex ([VO(L)]) have been characterized by elemental analysis, melting point, Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR), UV–Vis., 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The catalytic study of the [VO(L)] in the oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide was carried out in the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS), IR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The progress of the catalytic reaction was followed by gas chromatographic analysis (GC). The oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide after 24 h of reaction, presented for [VO(L)], [VO(L)]-alumina and [VO(L)]-Y was 50 mol%, 98 mol% and 34 mol%, respectively. In the [VO(L)]-Y system it was noted an increase in the oxidation of the methyl phenyl sulfide from 34 mol% to 92 mol% after four days. In the systems [VO(L)] and [VO(L)]-alumina the sulfide oxidation reached a maximum after 24 h of reaction. [VO(L)]-supported Y and [VO(L)]-Wessalith®P were inactive under the same reaction conditions.

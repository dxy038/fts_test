Objective To study the environment of high altitude hypoxia in rats plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels and its relationship with the relationship between altitude hypoxic acclimatization. Methods 60 male SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, namely, 1d, 2d, 3d, 1 w and 1 month (A, B, C, D, E) group, while the control group (in Xi´an area, altitude 5m). From Xi´an, were brought 1d Golmud, Qinghai (altitude 2700m), 2d to the Tibetan Tanggula (altitude 5000m), 3d to the Naqu (altitude 4500m), 1 w Nagqu and 1 y Nagqu, were sacrificed at different time points, Application of radioimmunoassay of plasma AVP concentration, and compared with the control group. Results Plasma AVP concentration increased after entering the plateau, then decreased to the lowest in the 2d, after rising gradually to 1w close to the level of control when, a month reached the highest level. Conclusion Under the environment of High altitude chronic hypoxia, the plasma concentration of AVP with the time change hypoxia, this may be related to High Altitude acclimatization process and high altitude hypoxic extent.

We present an evolutionary computation of the fuzzy mSTP (multicriteria solid transportation problem) in which the coefficients of the objective function are represented as fuzzy numbers. The ranking fuzzy numbers with integral value are used in the evaluation and selection. The proposed algorithm is incorporated with problem-specific knowledge and can find the set of nondominated points in the criteria space based on decision maker degree of optimism

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the surgical feasibility and clinical outcomes of a vaginal enterocele repair that was based on the theory of site-specific defects in the vaginal fascia. Study Design: Seventeen patients during a 2-year period with a diagnosis of enterocele and vaginal vault descensus with or without coexisting rectocele underwent surgical correction with a site-specific fascial defect repair. An enterocele was defined as vaginal wall prolapse seen during the operation in which the peritoneum was found to be in direct contact with the vaginal epithelium, with no intervening fascia. Patients were examined at 4 weeks after the operation and then at 6-month intervals, with site-specific analysis of pelvic prolapse at the vaginal apex and posterior vaginal segment. Results: Identification and site-specific fascial defect repair of the enterocele were successfully performed in all 17 cases. All patients also underwent a uterosacral ligament vaginal vault suspension, and 15 patients (88%) underwent concurrent posterior colporrhaphy. There were no intraoperative complications. At a mean follow-up of 6.3 months (range 1-17 months), 2 patients (12%) had mild, asymptomatic vaginal vault descensus but no patients (0/17) had evidence of a recurrent enterocele or rectocele. Conclusion: Enterocele correction through a fascial defect repair is easily performed through the vaginal route and is associated with excellent surgical outcomes on short-term follow-up.

Different protocol conversion is a regular problem on industrial field data communication networks. In this article, we design a Flex Ray and CAN communication gateway, mainly discussing system design, hardware design and software design in detail. The gateway can realize bidirectional transceiving data on FlexRay bus and CAN bus. It implements a conversion of two different protocols. In addition, the gateway can acquire 0-5 V analog data directly, as well as communicate with supervisory system through RS232 interface. The communication gateway has a wide range of application in industrial control field.

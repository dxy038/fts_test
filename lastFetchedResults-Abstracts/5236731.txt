The objective of this research is to reduce intersymbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI) in a highly mobile environment by optimizing the performance of Biorthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (BFDM). In time-frequency dispersive channels, reducing the signal interference depends on the shaping of the signal pulse. BFDM was invented to reduce the interference through a flexible design of the signal pulse shaping. However, the shape of the Gaussian pulses used in BFDM is not always optimized in every situation and as a result the interference is not always minimized. This research seeks to optimize the shape of the Gaussian pulse. In particular, we optimize the Gaussian pulse in BFDM by maximizing the ratio of the ambiguity function of the transmitter (Gaussian) and its receiver pulses. Numerical results obtained show that the proposed method is effective for the optimization of BFDM. Furthermore, we show that the optimized BFDM outperforms the conventional OFDM in time-frequency dispersive channels.

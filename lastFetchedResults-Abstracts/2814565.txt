In the frame of the GMES program, the main objective of the Sentinel-1 mission is to ensure the continuity of SAR data acquisitions in C-band for global earth monitoring. Sentinel-1A is the first of two C-band satellites launched in April 2014. In addition to the commissioning of Sentienl-1A executed by ESA, an independent verification of the system calibration is executed for the first time by an external institution. For this purpose, the complete calibration chain was developed and established by DLR, starting with an efficient calibration concept, a detailed in-orbit calibration plan, the SW-tools for analyzing and evaluating all the measurements up to the calibration targets serving as accurate reference. Based on an efficient calibration strategy, this paper describes the different activities performed by DLR and presents first results obtained from real in-orbit data. As Sentinel-1A had not achieved the reference orbit at the time of uploading the full paper, a discussion of radiometric and geometric calibration results will be presented at the conference on July 2014.

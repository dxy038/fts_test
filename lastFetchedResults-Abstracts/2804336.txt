An interleaved bidirectional switched capacitor converter with regulation capability is proposed in this paper. This converter is able to step up the voltage to near three times and regulate the output, while maintaining continuous input current as well as small output voltage ripple. Due to its natural interleaved structure, fewer components are required compared with traditional interleaved switched-capacitor converter with similar functionality. The proposed topology can also be modified as unidirectional converter with reduced number of switches. A PWM technique is proposed to regulate the output voltage. A modeling method is presented which provides the voltage gain formula. Criterion for high efficiency switched capacitor converter design is obtained. A 10W 5V to 14V prototype of proposed SC converter with efficiency higher than 90% was realized. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of proposed topology and regulation technique.

The class of uncertain systems considered is described by input/output interval models. The objective is to find one stabilizing controller such that the closed-loop system is stable for all the parameters of the model confined to prespecified real intervals. With this synthesis approach, one can design a closed-loop feedback system which will have the property of a robust trajectory

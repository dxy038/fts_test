Since its inception in 1999, a primary objective of the Web Site Evolution (WSE) series of events has been to foster the development, validation, and dissemination of best practice related to the disciplined evolution of largescale Web sites. Over time, the interpretation of "Web site" has expanded to encompass numerous aspects of Web site design, development, and deployment, including the mastery of the many rapidly changing underlying technologies that make modern Web sites so complex to engineer and so rich to experience.

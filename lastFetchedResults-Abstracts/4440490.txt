A novel dual-input architecture for high step-up ratio non-isolated applications is proposed in this paper. Compared to conventional structure, the proposed architecture has several advantages. The energy utilization ratio in super capacitor is still high even without bidirectional DC-DC converters. Only one unidirectional DC-DC converter is needed in the system. So it has a simple structure and low cost. Meanwhile, the proposed converter has some features, such as high voltage gain, low voltage stress and high efficiency. This paper derivates the proposed architecture firstly. Based on this, a specified dual-input converter is introduced, the voltage gain and switch voltage stress are analyzed. Finally, a 1KW prototype is built in lab to verify the theoretical analysis.

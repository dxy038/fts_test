The Joint Information Systems Committee and the National Science Foundation
programme, Digital Libraries in the Classroom (DLiC), addresses implications
for the learning of the revolution in scholarly communication.What are
the obstacles to undergraduates ‘ “writing” on and for the Internet’? Glasgow
Caledonian University (GCU) is a partner in one of the DLiC-funded projects,
Spoken Word. At GCU the focus was on the practical demonstration of the
implications and potential for learning of a remote electronic library extremely
and extensively rich in culturally significant multimedia; the archives of the
British Broadcasting Corporation. This paper considers one significant
objective—embedding the developments generated in the project. It considers
the reactions of major stakeholders to the attempts of the project team to raise
institutional awareness of developments and pursue a strategy to induce
change. This account is interim; the project has a 5-year life, from 2003 to
2008.

Buoyant vehicle concept provides the attractive solution to the many adverse problems. Basic objective is to operate the vehicle with a sufficient level of autonomy under extreme range of atmospheric conditions. In order to achieve these goals, a guidance and control system is needed which controls the airship attitude in the air. The accurate control system first requires an accurate model of the airship dynamics. In this paper, we discuss first some airship basic concepts. Based on six degree of freedom, airship dynamic model is presented next. Its aerodynamic part is based on analytical geometry instead of expansive wind tunnel test arrangement and the easily understandable MATLAB environment is used to simulate the results.

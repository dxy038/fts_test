By taking into account the fluctuations of the renewable energy based power production, this paper describes a 24-hour ahead energy management for a micro grid. Based on the prediction of the energy available from the PV generator, storage availability, the microturbines emissions characteristics and the load prediction, a central energy management system calculates a day-ahead plan of the power references for three gas turbines and a PV-based active generator. A multi objective optimization is implemented in order to minimize the emissions of the three main pollutants coming from the gas turbines: CO<sub>2</sub>, CO and NOx.

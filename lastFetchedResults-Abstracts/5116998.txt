One of the most important issues in electric power market design is to create an appropriate auction mechanism. And one of the most common failures of power market is lack of demand side response to high market price. This paper discusses the bid cost minimization auction mechanism and social welfare maximization auction mechanism in pool market with demand elasticity. A social welfare maximization auction model with elastic demand is presented in this paper. The traditional unit commitment and economic dispatch approach is adapted to solve this power market centralized control problem in the spot pricing model by replacing the objective function with maximum social welfare. Numerical testing results show that this method is efficient.

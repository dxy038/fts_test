The problem of designing a logical topology over a wavelength-routed all-optical network (AON) physical topology is studied. The physical topology consists of the nodes and fiber links in the network. On an AON physical topology, we can set up lightpaths between pairs of nodes, where a lightpath represents a direct optical connection without any intermediate electronics. The set of lightpaths along with the nodes constitutes the logical topology. For a given network physical topology and traffic pattern, our objective is to design the logical topology and the routing algorithm so as to minimize the network congestion while constraining the average delay seen by a source-destination pair and the amount of processing required at the nodes (degree of the logical topology). Ignoring the delay constraints can result in fairly convoluted logical topologies with very long delays. On the other hand, in all our examples, imposing it results in a minimal increase in congestion. While the number of wavelengths required to imbed the resulting logical topology on the physical all optical topology is also a constraint in general, we find that in many cases of interest this number can be quite small. We formulate the combined logical topology design and routing problem described above as a mixed integer linear programming problem which we then solve for a number of cases of a six-node network. This programming problem is split into two subproblems: logical topology design, and routing. We then compare the performance of several heuristic topology design algorithms against that of randomly generated topologies, as well as lower bounds

The tracking control of a suspension durability test simulator is investigated in this paper. The objective is to control a hydraulically actuated durability simulator, so that vehicle responses, previously measured on the test track, can be reproduced in the laboratory. A two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control design procedure is proposed to improve tracking performance in the face of noise and disturbances. The 2DOF formulation consists of a feedback and feedforward term, which is directly extended to include preview control

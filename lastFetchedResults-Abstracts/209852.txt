Objective: Anti-cancer therapies frequently lead to ovarian damage and defective fertility . To
preserve fertility , cryopreservation and subsequent transplantation of the ovaries has been
suggested . The aim of this study was to investigate the survival of follicles in intact intramuscular
mouse autologous ovaries , according to the time the ovarian tissue remained In the
grafted site.
Materials and Methods: Ovaries (n=9) were transplanted intramuscularly into gluteus supe rficialis
. These grafted ovaries were removed after one , two and three weeks from the grafted
site . A histological examination and counting of follicles was then performed . Some ovaries
(n= 3) from the same mice were selected randomly for the control group. Hematoxyline and
eosin (H & E) staining was used for follicle counting and TUNEL staining for the examination
of apoptosis in grafted tissues.
Results: Mean follicular survival was significantly lower in experimental groups compared to
the control group (non-grafted) (p<O.05) , because of ischemic damages. Also healthy primordial
follicle numbers in grafted ovaries were higher than other types .
Conclusion : Antral follicles are the most sensitive to ischemic damages and primordial follicles
are the least sensitive. Also the presence of healthy folli cles in grafted tissues shows
that ovarian transplantation could be a promising method for infertil ity treatment of patients
diagnosed with cancer.

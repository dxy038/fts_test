Background and objective: Despite all its advantages, many people still engage
less physical activity in their leisure time. In this context, a theory-based intervention
to promote physical activity in women referred to Izeh health centers
was designed.
Methods: In a quasi-experimental study, a random sample of 120 women
was selected and randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. A
valid and reliable questionnaire including data on stages of change, benefits,
barriers, self-efficacy and processes of change were used to collect the data.
Data were gathered at baseline. educational intervention including lecture and
group discussion was implemented for the experimental group. After3 -month
follow-up, data were collected again and analyzed via SPSS16 using t test and
Chi-square at the level of 0.05 significance.
Results: Although before the intervention, there was no significant association
between experimental group and control, after the intervention, stage transition
was significant between the two groups (p < 0.05). The mean scores of
the variables increased: self-efficacy (from 19.38±4.03 to 23.60±2.79), benefits
(from 11.95±5.18 to 19.95±6.03), processes of change (from 33±7.57
to 47.23±5.01). This difference was not significant for barriers between two
groups (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: Implementing interventional programs based on Trans-theoretical
Model could improve physical activity behavior.

The objective of this article is to propose new determinations of the diffusion
coefficients of various dopants in liquid silicon. The approach of this
work is based on an analysis of the effective segregation coefficients obtained
by Kodera in Czochralski growth of silicon-based alloys. However, it will
be shown that the solidification model used by Kodera presents some serious
deficiencies as it does not account for (i) the dependence of the solute boundary
layer thickness on the iInterface velocity and (ii) the effect of density
change upon freezing. In addition, the values of the thermophysical parameters
used by Kodera can be questioned in view of recently published data.
The approach proposed in the present work can be used to provide a much
sounder physical basis for the analysis of the data, but it should be stated
that the uncertainty on the partition coefficients is such that a measurement
technique based on solidification experiments cannot be expected to be very
accurate. In this respect, the scatter of the data, hardly avoidable in Czochralski
growth experiments, is also discussed. To put things on a quantitative
basis, an error analysis is carried out to quantify the error bar attainable
by such a measurement technique.

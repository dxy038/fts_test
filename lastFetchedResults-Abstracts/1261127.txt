Objective/Hypothesis To evaluate and correlate voice-specific quality of life (QOL) and health-related QOL (HR-QOL) after treatment for advanced cancer of the larynx and/or hypopharynx. Study Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Patients submitted to partial laryngectomy (PL), salvage PL (sPL), concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RTآ +آ Chemo), total laryngectomy (TL), salvage TL (sTL), total pharyngolaryngectomy (TP) and salvage total pharyngolaryngectomy (sTP). The following questionnaires were used: (1) Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and (2) University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL; version 4). Results Eighty-four patients participated in the study. All the patients PL (10), sPL (1), and RTآ +آ Chemo (24) communicated by laryngeal voice. Of the 49 patients submitted to total removal of the larynx, 30 communicated with alaryngeal phonation, the major part being tracheoesophageal prosthesis (17). The worst subscale of VHI for the total patient group was functional (meanآ =آ 13.15), and the value of the total score was 31. Patients submitted to PL, RTآ +آ Chemo, and TL presented slight handicap (medians of 27, 14, and 21.5, respectively). Patients treated with sTL, TP, and sTP presented moderate handicap (medians of 45, 37.5, and 31.5, respectively). HR-QOL was considered between good and excellent for 78.6% of the patients, and poor for 21.4%. The correlation between voice-specific QOL and HR-QOL was significant (Pآ =آ 0.0001). Conclusion Patients treated for advanced cancer of the larynx/hypopharynx present slight to moderate voice handicap and good/excellent HR-QOL. Stricter analysis of both the VHI and UW-QOL data suggests that more attention be given to the vocal handicap of the individual patient.

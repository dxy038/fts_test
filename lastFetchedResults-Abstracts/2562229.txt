Abstract
Introduction: Perioperative blood loss is thought to be associated with an increase in urinary fibrinolytic activity. Tranexamicacid (TXA) is a potent inhibitor of plasminogen and also urokinase activators.
Objective: To determine the efficacy of preoperative treatment with tranexamic acid in the rate of perioperative transfusions in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate(TURP).
Materials and Methods: In a clinical trial, 80 patients were randomly divided into two groups: Tranexamic acid (TXA) and controls. After Spinal anesthesia with marcaine, in the Tranexamic acid group (TXA), the patients received intravenous infusion of tranexamic acid15 mg/kg before surgery and the control group received no medication, and serum Hb concentration was measured 1 hour after beginning the surgery, in recovery room, and 6 hours and 24 hours after surgery. If the hemoglobin concentration was lower than 10 mg/dL, one or more units of allogeneic packed red blood cells were transfused to keep the concentration of hemoglobin above 10 mg/dL, finally the mean need  for the erythrocyte transfusions was compared between two groups. We used statistical tests such as T-test, Repeated Measurement, ANCOVA Test and SPSS software 16. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. 
Results: This study, showed that  the mean perioperative blood transfusion  24 hours post operation, in  TXA group was less than that in control group (0.2± 0.6)vs(0.6 ±0.92).(P=0.026)
Conclusion: preoperative treatment with tranexamic acid reduces the rate of perioperative blood transfusions in patients undergoing T.U.R-P.

Due to limitations on the image capturing devices, distance, storage capability and bandwidth for transmission, many images in multimedia applications are low-bit-rate compressed and low resolution. In this paper, we proposed a class-specified learning based super resolution for this kind of low quality images. Firstly, we proposed a class-specified filter to remove the compressed distortions. Then a class-specified learning based scheme is employed to super resolve images with different compression rates. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve both the objective and subjective quality of the images effectively.

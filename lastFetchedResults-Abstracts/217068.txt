Biological removal of lead was observed in this study during treatment of synthetic
solu tions of this heavy metal by a pie of waste activated sludge (WA ') having MLSS
concent ation of 10000 mgfL. he objective was determining the cap bility ofWAS in removal of
I d in three different conditions of treatment: without any H tion and feeding. by simultan us '
aerati and feedin andbya tion without feeding. Besides thee ct ofinitial metal concentration
nd contact tim in these treatment stages were determined.Results showed that the efficiency of
lead removal was reduc d by increasing the initial metal cone entration, but th changes ofcontact
time h d r ulted in different responses depending to the t Â·t conditi . Moreover, it as found
that th effectsof'aerationand feedingin increasingthe efficiency f'treatment weremore pronounced
or the stage oftrearlng low concentrations oflead .The maximum removal 0 lead in the first step
( lthout aer rion and f ing) was55.2% in contact time of75 minutes. in the second step(without
feedingandby 12 hoursaerarion) 63.3%and third step it was94.2% in contact timeof48 hours .The
initial I d concentrati n in these experiments was 5mg/L.

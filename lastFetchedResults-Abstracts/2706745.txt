This paper presents dc-bus voltage control with a three-phase bidirectional inverter for dc distribution systems. The bidirectional inverter can fulfill both grid connection and rectification modes with power factor correction. The proposed control includes two approaches, one line-cycle regulation approach (OLCRA) and one-sixth line-cycle regulation approach (OSLCRA), which take into account dc-bus capacitance and control dc-bus voltage to track a linear relationship between the dc-bus voltage and inverter inductor current. Since both of the approaches require the parameter of dc-bus capacitance, this paper first presents determination of dc-bus capacitor size and an online capacitance estimation method. With the OLCRA, the inverter tunes the dc-bus voltage every line cycle, which can reduce the frequency of operation-mode change and current distortion. The OSLCRA adjusts current command every one-sixth line cycle to adapt to abrupt dc-bus voltage variation. The two approaches together can prevent dc-bus voltage from wide variation and improve the availability of the dc distribution systems without increasing dc-bus capacitance. Experimental results measured from a three-phase bidirectional inverter have verified the feasibility of the discussed control approaches.

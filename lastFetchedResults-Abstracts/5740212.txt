Towards an ultimate objective of lower cost, large area multijunction cells for space applications, we report the demonstration of high efficiency GaInP<sub>2</sub>/GaAs solar cells on germanium substrates, and highly uniform cell results from a multiwafer MOVPE reactor. A peak efficiency of 24.2% (AM0, 28&#176;C) has been achieved for dual-junctions grown on Ge. Further, the degree of MOVPE layer uniformity required for large area cells has been demonstrated with multiwafer growths on 3 inch diameter GaAs substrates. In addition to this experimental dual-junction result, we present modeling for the next step of this cell technology a triple junction GaInP<sub>2</sub>/GaAs/Ge cell

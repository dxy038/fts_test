Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) is widely used in ranking one or more alternatives from a set of available alternatives with respect to multiple criteria. Inspired by MCDM which are methods to systematically evaluate alternatives, we propose a new fuzzy TOPSIS approach for evaluating alternatives using both subjective and objective weights. Objective weight can be helpful in identifying more important attributes. With our method, we provide decision makers more information to make more subtle decisions.

Background and objective: Although the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccines in patients under chronic hemodialysis (HD) treatment has been documented, the persistence of immunity in this population remains largely unknown. In this study we aimed to evaluate the long-term immunity of hepatitis B vaccine and its related factors in HD patients.

Materials and methods: In this study we had followed 37 Hepatitis B vaccinated HD patients [four doses vaccination schedule 40 |ng injections intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle at 0,1,2,6 months] up to 1 year to evaluate the persistence of immunity (as indicated by serum levels of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) equal or higher than to 10 IU/1).

Results: At 1 year after vaccination, 18.18% of patients had lost their anti-HBs (transient responders) while 81.82% of them had detectable antibody in the serum (persistent responders). From 81.82% of persistent responders 11.5% and 88.5% were weak and high responders respectively. There was no significant difference between persistent and transient responders regarding age, sex and nutritional factors.

Conclusion: We didn't find any factors that related to maintain protective levels of anti-HBs in HD patients. It seems that an antibody titer above 100 IU/1 following vaccination is necessary in order to maintain that level of antibody 1 year later.

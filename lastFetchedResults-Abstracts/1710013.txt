BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Surrogacy motherhood as a reproductive technique has helped many infertile couples during recent years. Currently, this technique is growing in Iran, but little evidence exists about the position of this technique in medical ethics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ethics of surrogate motherhood in Iran.
METHODS: Data was collected through the literature review and interviews with experts. Electronic databases such as Iranmedex, Scopus, Sciencedirect and PubMed were searched. Interview was done with 7 experienced and practiced people from May to July 2012. 
FINDINGS: In terms of ethics, surrogacy particularly commercial surrogacy has considered as a controversial challenge. Commercial surrogacy is known as an unethical method.  
CONCLUSION: Commercial surrogate mother conflicts with medical ethics. This is due to exploitation. Since surrogacy is growing in Iran, it seems necessary to substitute commercial with altruistic surrogacy. Surrogate mother support is possible when legislation exits.

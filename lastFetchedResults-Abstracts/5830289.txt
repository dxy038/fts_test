Through the National Security Space Acquisition Policy (NSSAP) 03-01 the United States Air Force requires an Independent Program Assessment (IPA) prior to each Key Decision Point (KDP) program milestone decision by the Defense Space Acquisition Board (DSAB). The goal of an IPA is to ensure a program is ready to pass into the next milestone. During the IPA process the acquisition experts on the IPA review team share a wealth of experience and ideas with the program. A good IPA makes a significant impact on a program, helping to establish a solid foundation early, move forward with critical processes in place and share experience during program execution. Despite a strong acquisition team on the Global Positioning System (GPS) III program that had been trying to move the program forward past Phase A for almost 10 years, the first IPA visit in summer of 2007 was unsuccessful. Through a myriad of initiatives, actions, and lessons learned, the GPS III IPA lead worked with the GPS III team to change the red and yellow of the failed KDP-B IPA ratings to green. This paper focuses on the IPA process, lessons learned and the tools and methods from mundane to sublime that brought the GPS III IPA from failure to the best in recent SMC history. The extensive IPA preparations, execution and lessons learned that put the program back on a solid footing with the objective of achieving a successful IPA are detailed. Additionally, the processes, tools and methods established as a result of the IPA to help the program during execution and in preparation for the KDP-C are also discussed. The goal of this paper is to pass on the knowledge from months of preparation and direct involvement with the KDP-B IPA team to successfully answer their questions, meet the their objectives, and see the results briefed out at a successful DSAB review that allowed the GPS III program to move forward into the Design Phase and official Program Initiation.

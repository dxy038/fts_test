This paper presents a novel multifrequency antenna optimization algorithm to achieve novel metallo-material (magnetic and dielectric) conformal antenna designs. For the first time, combinations of dielectric, magnetic and metallic materials were concurrently modified volumetrically subject to multi-objective optimization criteria. An aggressive optimization scheme using genetic algorithms in conjunction with a fast finite-element boundary-integral code was employed. Interpretation of the multi-objective outputs was found a key issue. The presented color-coded graphs allowed for quick and efficient evaluation of the best/optimized cases

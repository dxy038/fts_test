This paper describes the electric dynamic load simulator (DLS) driving by permanent magnet synchronous motor. It can reproduce desired load torque acting on loaded objective to test its performance. A simplified dynamic model is derived to clarify the causation of redundancy torque caused by the motion of loaded objective and illustrate the drawbacks of applying conventional control strategy. Real-time recurrent neural networks based iterative learning control strategy is adopted. It can restrain redundancy torque and improve the accuracy of load torque in spite of the nonlinearity and uncertainty in the system. The expected results have been obtained from simulation and experiment.

In this paper, we formulate the problem of multiple targets coverage in WSNs as determining the sensing range of each sensor node to maximize total utility of the network. Our utility model includes a logarithmic function of sensing range for the utility of each sensor node as an approximation to the number of targets it covers. We used the dual decomposition technique to derive a distributed price-based algorithm for each node to adjust its sensing range during iterations with static targets. By using the dual-based algorithm in consecutive time intervals, it can be used to cover the moving targets. Extensive simulations show the convergence of sensing ranges and objective function of our approach towards optimal values in few iterations with near optimal energy consumption of nodes.

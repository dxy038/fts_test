Abstract
Objective
Removing plasma from the platelet concentrate (PC) medium could be an effective way to increase the safety of this product. The goal of this study was to compare PC stored in plasma or in an additive solution (Composol) with in vitro testing.
Materials and Methods
Fifty-four single donor PCs were prepared from Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO). Each PC unit was divided into two portions. Then in one of the portions, plasma was replaced with Composol. Sampling was carried out at the days 2, 4 and 7 from the preparation time. The levels of pH, glucose, lactate and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were analyzed by colorimetric methods.
Results
The levels of pH and glucose were decreased during storage whereas the levels of LDH and Lactate were increased with time over. At the day 7 of storage, the mean values for glucose were 404.44 and 25.19 mg/dl in plasma and Composol, respectively. These values were 3306.1 and 683.33 U/L for LDH and 142.07 and 90.90 mg/dl for lactate. The differences between LDH, lactate, and glucose levels were significant between the two storage media of plasma and Composol (P-value < 0.001).
Conclusion
This study could imply the potential capacity of an additive solution as a candidate for plasma replacement in PC in vitro.

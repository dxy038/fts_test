The modification of polysulfone surface was used to obtain effective interactions between an organic polymeric surface and
an inorganic specie. A previous treatment of the polymer surface with modifiers is required in order to provide adherence. Our
objective was the synthesis and the surface characterization of copper sulfide coated polysulfone (CuS–PSf) films. SEM
micrographs showed a homogeneous distribution of copper sulfide, which contributes to increasing electrical conductivity. Xray
analysis showed a decrease in copper sulfide particles (covellite porcelain) when compared with other polymeric composites
prepared under similar conditions. The measured surface conductivity of the CuS–PSf films was higher than those of other
similar systems, ca. 800 S cm 1.

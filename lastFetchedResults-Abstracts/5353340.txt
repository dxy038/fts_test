In this paper we tackle the design problem of the trunk group (TG) overlay in wide area ATM networks under reliability constraints. The TGs are composed of virtual paths (VPs) that the soft-permanent virtual connections (S-PVCs) can ride on. The private network-network interface (PNNI) routing standard is used to route these connections. The design problem consists to find the capacity and the administrative weight (AW) of each TG that ensure the successful rerouting of the S-PVCs for all failure scenarios of interest to the network planner. The objective is to minimize the cost of the TG overlay. An optimization model is proposed as well as a tabu search algorithm. A detailed TG overlay design example is performed and tested. The results showed that the tabu-based algorithm has improved the solution by 9.80%

The aims of and indications for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reconstruction are well-established but the method of reconstruction is controversial. We describe a retrospective, two-centre audit of 49 patients treated with costochondral grafting and 50 patients treated with alloplastic joints. The characteristics of the patients were similar in both centres and the minimum follow-up period was 2 years. For each patient a number of variables were recorded including both subjective scores (pain and interference with eating) and objective data (interincisal distance). Patients in both groups showed an improvement in symptoms but more patients required reoperation in the autogenous group.

Scheduling multiple large-scale parallel workflow applications on heterogeneous computing systems like hybrid clouds is a fundamental NP-complete problem that is critical to meeting various types of QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. This paper addresses the scheduling problem of large-scale applications inspired from real-world, characterized by a huge number of homogeneous and concurrent bags-of-tasks that are the main sources of bottlenecks but open great potential for optimization. The scheduling problem is formulated as a new sequential cooperative game and propose a communication and storage-aware multi-objective algorithm that optimizes two user objectives (execution time and economic cost) while fulfilling two constraints (network bandwidth and storage requirements). We present comprehensive experiments using both simulation and real-world applications that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in terms of algorithm complexity, makespan, cost, system-level efficiency, fairness, and other aspects compared with other related algorithms.

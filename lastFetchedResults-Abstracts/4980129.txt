This paper presents an approach describing transmit power controlled clusters for Heterogeneous Sensor Networks (HSNs). There are two types of nodes in the network: the low-end and high-end nodes. The objective is to set a threshold limit of transmit power for low end nodes for the intra-cluster communication, and also set a limit for high end nodes for inter-cluster communication. We have tested the Tabu-Voronoi clustering approach with Improved Tree Routing based on unique addressing scheme. With appropriate bounds on intra cluster and inter cluster transmission ranges, it is shown that the connectivity of clustered networks increase. The simulation results show that our technique is efficient in persevering the lifetime of the sensor networks. In this paper, it is maintained that the pairing of two complementary radios with heterogeneous range characteristics enables greater life and range diversity at lower energy cost than a single radio.

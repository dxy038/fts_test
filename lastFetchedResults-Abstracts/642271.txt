Objective
This study investigated the effects of soymilk on lipid metabolism in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a cholesterol-enriched (0.3%) diet.
Methods

Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 230.0 Â± 9.8 g were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, S1 (containing 15% soymilk powder in the diet), and S2 (22.5%). After 8 wk, lipid profiles of the plasma, liver, and feces were determined.
Results

Body weight gain, daily food intake, and feeding efficiency showed no differences across groups (P > 0.05). The experimental groups had significantly lower plasma levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than the control group (P < 0.05) at weeks 4 and 8. However, total fecal excretion of neutral steroid did not significantly differ across groups (P > 0.05).
Conclusion

Soymilk affects the metabolism of plasma cholesterol in Sprague-Dawley rats.

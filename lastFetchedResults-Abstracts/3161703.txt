The capability of Bidirectional Model Transformation (BMT) has been continuously investigated by the software engineering community. BMT approach is able to improve the productivity of software development and save the production cost through a precise transformation definition process. However, nowadays a systematic study that is related to the current issue and supporting approaches of BMT does not exist yet. Therefore, this paper aims to analyse and explore the current issues on BMT by using a systematic literature review (SLR). Based on the results of the SLR, seven issues related to BMT were identified and two prominent approaches in solving the inherent BMT problem were discovered and reviewed. These results will be useful as an input in designing a better framework of BMT in the future.

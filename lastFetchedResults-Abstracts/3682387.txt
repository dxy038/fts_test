We describe a methodology for the characterization of the 2-wire twisted-pair subscriber loop plant for high-speed digital communications typical of evolving integrated service digital networks (ISDNÂ´s). Through use of this analytical/numerical approach it is possible to predict the resulting error probability performance as a function of signal-to-noise ratio for a given set of input parameters representing a particular subscriber loop and its noise environment, including such effects as intersymbol interference, crosstalk and impulse noise. The results are useful in penetration assessment studies of the loop plant population at a fixed grade of service measured objectively in terms of operating bit error probability. This approach is in contrast to simulation-based methodologies leading to subjective performance assessment criteria, such as eye opening measurements. In the present paper we describe the modeling assumptions together with the analytical/numerical techniques underlying this approach. Attention is restricted to time-compression multiplexing (TCM) schemes with bipolar line coding, although the approach is much more general. Numerical results are illustrated through sample graphical output of an extensive computer program implementing this approach. Finally, we illustrate the application of this approach to objective penetration assessment of the GTE subscriber loop plant utilizing data collected as part of an extensive recent survey.

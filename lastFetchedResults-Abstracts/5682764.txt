This paper deals with the design of filters for processing data obtained from arrays of sensors used for signal measurements in a variety of applications. The objective of the filters is to optimally suppress undesired signals intercepting the array while at the same time preserve the desired signal that the array is attempting to measure. A constrained minimization problem is formulated for determining the filters coefficients and the computational requirements necessary for designing and applying the filters are kept to a minimum. When compared to the widely used delay-and-sum and Chebyshev methods, this technique is shown to have a superior frequency reject response which becomes more apparent if the array has a relatively small number of sensors.

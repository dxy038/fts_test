This paper presents a graphical model for de-formable face matching and landmark localization under an unknown non-rigid warp. The proposed model learns and combines statistics of both appearance and shape variations of facial images (learnt purely from a set of frontal training images) in a complex objective function in an unsupervised manner. Local and global shape variations are included in the objective function as binary and higher order clique potentials. The proposed approach exploits the sparseness of facial features to reduce the complexity of inference over the probabilistic model. Besides presenting a method for face feature localization, the paper proposes a framework for incorporation of statistical shape priors as higher order cliques into MRFs. The problem of optimizing the objective function is performed using the dual decomposition approach in which the higher order subproblems based on point distribution models are formulated as instances of convex quadratic programs. The evaluation of the approach for feature localization is performed both on the frontal and rotated images of the XM2VTS dataset images as well as images collected from Google. The method shows high robustness to partial occlusion, pose changes etc. The method is then applied as an initialization step for a more costly matching method and is shown to be instrumental in improving performance and reducing runtime.

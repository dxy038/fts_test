Level set methods have been used for image segmentation. Because partial deferential equations are solved to propagate a curve, level-set image segmentation has a slow convergence speed. The objective of this paper is to propose a method that increases the convergence speed. The proposed approach exploits the benefit of multi-resolutional analysis. Wavelet transform is used to decompose the image into different resolutions. The obtained results show a great improvement in terms of speed and accuracy.

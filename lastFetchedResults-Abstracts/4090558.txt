Soft handoff is an essential component of code-division multiple-access (CDMA) digital mobile communication systems. While soft handoff has some advantages of system capacity and communication quality, it also has some disadvantages arising from the excessive use of channel resources. In this study, we propose a new control policy to alleviate effectively this excessive use of channel resources. For CDMA cellular mobile systems consisting of homogeneous cells, a variety of traffic parameters are estimated by the detailed traffic analysis, based on which a Markovian queueing model is developed to analyze the performance of the proposed call control policy. With a well-known performance objective, a mathematical problem of finding optimal call control parameters is proposed, along with its solution method

Background and Objective: BCL-2 is the first gene involved in apoptosis and was regarded as a proto-oncogene that suppresses the cell death rather than stimulating cell proliferation. The present study was conducted to assess and compare the immunohistochemical expression of BCL-2 in selected benign (Pleomorphic adenoma) (PA) and (adenoid cystic carcinoma and polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma) (ACC, PLGA) salivary gland tumors.
Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study seven ACC and three PLGA tumors were considered as malignant and 17 PA as benign tumors. The immunohistochemical staining procedure was performed using BCL-2marker, as directed by the manufacturer. Results were assessed in percentage of cells stained in 0-3 [0(negative), 1(1%-30%), 2(31%-70%), 3(71%-100%)] scores.
Results: All malignant tumors showed a positive expression for BCL-2whereas only %58 of benign tumors was positive. Statistical significance was observed with regard to BCL-2expression in benign and malignant tumors. In findings of this study no relationship between BCL-2expression with independent variables such as age, sex, and the origin of the lesion was found.
Conclusion: According the results of the present study greater expression of BCL-2in malignant salivary gland neoplasm suggests a higher survival rate of tumor cells in malignant tumors. It seems that BCL-2 is not a suitable marker to differentiate various salivary gland tumors from each other.

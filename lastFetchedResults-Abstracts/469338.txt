Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine if use of a Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, Ganirelix (Antagon), can improve pregnancy rates during superovulation with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI).
Study design
This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, controlled trial of females (n = 54), ages 18 to 39 undergoing superovulation/IUI with up to 4 cycles of superovulation/IUI without Ganirelix (n = 66), or up to 4 cycles of superovulation/IUI with the addition of Ganirelix (n = 52).
Results
No statistically significant difference in clinical pregnancy rates per cycle initiated was found for patients in the treatment or control group (12% vs 7%, P = .29). Other variables assessed, including endometrial thickness, size of follicles, peak serum estradiol levels, mid-lutea progesterone levels, and total vials of rFSH used also showed no statistically significant difference.
Conclusion
Superovulation/IUI cycles using Ganirelix produce similar pregnancy rates when compared with cycles not using a GnRH antagonist, although there is a trend towards better pregnancy rates in cycles with Ganirelix.

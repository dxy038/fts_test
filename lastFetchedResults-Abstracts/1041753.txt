The main objective of this work is to achieve ultra-fine grained structures within the pure aluminum sheet via equal channel angular rolling (ECAR). An attempt has been made to investigate the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of the processed specimens in terms of process pass numbers and routes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination showed ultra-fine grains (UFGs) with the average grain size of 0.85, 0.34 Î¼m for the seventh pass, respectively. Yield and tensile strengths and microhardness of specimens were significantly increased upon the first pass; however, elongation was dramatically reduced. Subsequent process cycles caused no considerable improvement on the mechanical properties.

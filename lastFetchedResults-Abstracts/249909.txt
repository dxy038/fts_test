To analyse the trade-o  relations among the set of criteria in multicriteria optimization, Pareto optimum
sensitivity analysis is systematically studied in this paper. Original contributions cover two parts: theoretical
demonstrations are  rstly made to validate the gradient projection method in Pareto optimum
sensitivity analysis. It is shown that the projected gradient direction evaluated at a given Pareto optimum
in the design variable space rigorously corresponds to the tangent direction of the Pareto curve=surface
at that point in the objective space. This statement holds even for the change of the set of active
constraints in the perturbed problem. Secondly, a new active constraint updating strategy is proposed,
which permits the identi cation of the active constraint set change, to determine the in uence of this
change upon the di erentiability of the Pareto curve and  nally to compute directional derivatives in
non-di erentiable cases. This work will highlight some basic issues in multicriteria optimization. Some
numerical problems are solved to illustrate these novelties

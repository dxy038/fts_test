Objective
Resistin is a specific fat-derived hormone that affects fuel homeostasis and insulin action in rodents. However, its role in human physiology and pathophysiologic conditions, such as malnutrition, remains uncertain.
Methods

To enhance understanding of the role of resistin in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN), we measured plasma resistin levels in 13 women with a restrictive type of AN and in 16 healthy age-matched women (control). Further, we measured resistin levels in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of eight women from the AN group and eight women from the control group with an in vivo microdialysis technique (CMA/107 pump, CMA/60 catheters, CMA Microdialysis AB, Solna, Sweden).
Results

Body mass index, percentage of body fat, fasting plasma leptin and insulin, and homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance were severely decreased in patients with AN compared with the control group. Plasma resistin levels were significantly decreased in patients with AN (P < 0.05), whereas subcutaneous adipose tissue resistin levels were significantly increased in patients with AN compared with the control group (P < 0.05). In both groups, plasma resistin levels showed no significant relation to resistin in dialysate, percentage of body fat, body mass index, homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance, and fasting plasma leptin levels.
Conclusion

We demonstrated that AN is associated with decreased plasma resistin levels and increased resistin levels in extracellular space of the abdominal adipose tissue. Plasma resistin levels in patients with AN or in healthy normal-weight women were not directly related to body mass index, percentage of body fat, plasma leptin levels, and insulin sensitivity.

A dynamic model that includes four subsystems is developed to analyze the fundamental characteristics of a bimodal ultrasonic motor. The first subsystem is the driving circuit designed for the motor to achieve bidirectional motion. The stator is modeled as a Timoshenko beam, and the assumed mode energy method is used to obtain the dynamic equations. The normal interface force is represented by an elastic spring existing in between the tip of the stator and the moving platform. The interface forces are coupled into the dynamic formulations of the stator and the moving platform. The behavior of the force transmission between the stator and the moving platform are analyzed using the developed model. Transient and steady-state responses of the system are obtained by numerical simulation, and the results are validated by experiments. Furthermore, the existing of a nonlinear deadzone is predicted analytically, and the causes of this nonlinearity are clarified.

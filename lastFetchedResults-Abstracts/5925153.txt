The objective of this presentation is to look at the concepts of wireless communication viewed from an electromagnetic perspective via the MaxwellÂ´s equations as it is these equations which captures the real physics of the space-time continuum. Incorporation of basic physics in modern wireless communication system design can significantly improve their performances.

An epitaxial structure comprising depletion mode In<sub>0.7</sub>Ga<sub>0.3</sub>As/In<sub>0.52</sub>Al<sub>0.48</sub>As/InP pHEMT has been simulated using SILVACO. The main objective of our work was to incorporate a highly strained pseudomorphic In<sub>0.7</sub>Ga<sub>0.3</sub>As channel layer and study the effects of variations of supply layer thicknesses, delta doping and gate length. The important DC parameters such as pinch-off voltage, maximum drain current and transconductance are extracted from these simulations which suggest that our device architecture and material exhibits optimized performance. This research also focuses on inverse device modelling from experimental data and proposes calibration changes in epitaxial structure, geometry and doping of simulated pHEMT device in order to match simulated results with the measured results.

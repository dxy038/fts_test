The objective of this paper is to present an improved
computational method for the overall reliability assessment of
autonomous power systems that may or may not contain HVdc
interconnection links. This is a hybrid method based on a Monte - Carlo
simulation sequential approach which incorporates an analytical
approach for the reliability modeling of the HVdc transmission links.
The developed models and techniques have been implemented into a
computer program that can be used to simulate the operational practices
and characteristics of the overall system under study efficiently and
realistically. A set of reliability indices are calculated for each
load-point of interest and the entire system while a set of additional
indices is calculated for quantifying the reliability performance of the
interconnection links under the specified operating requirements. The
analysis of a practical system is also included for a number of studies
representing its various operating and design characteristics.

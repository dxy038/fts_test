Combining with the conception of minimum spanning tree in graph theory and with entropy in information theory, a new algorithm is proposed for clustering. An objective function of the weighted entropy based on intra-variance in cluster and variance between clusters is built. The cluster result for the data set is derived from the maximum objective function. This algorithm doesnÂ´t need the prior knowledge about the cluster number and the initialization centre

Summary form only given. We present a software framework designed to provide transparent latecomer support and session recorder to a synchronous collaboration environment written in Java. The objective of this work is to develop a generic framework that can be easily integrated into other similar systems. The system supports not only Java applications and applets, but also Java media framework player allowing sharing of multimedia applications in a transparent way. In the meantime, we developed client synchronization for the system in order to minimize the network transmission latency and let all the clients see the same view of the shared application at the same time. In our design, we add a session recorder to the system. The collaboration server is responsible for recording events while clients send events to others through it.

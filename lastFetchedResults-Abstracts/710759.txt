Study Objective
Using four cases, this study describes common etiological factors and clinical sequelae in anorexia nervosa and athletic anorexia to present a biological explanation for interactions.
Design
Four anorectic girls were interviewed regarding their training programs and dietary intake. Bone mineral content, hormonal status, and energy intake were assessed during follow-ups.
Results
All the girls began training before puberty and had a low energy intake for age and height. Amenorrhea, low bone mineral content with stress fractures in three cases, and growth retardation in one case, were present at the follow-up after 6 years. Low amount of body fat and high serum cortisol is indicated and included in the discussion. The etiology is presented in an integrated model in addition to a biological explanation based on a negative energy balance, an acidic condition.
Conclusion
Energy deficits during puberty can result in the clinical sequela of the anorexia syndrome.

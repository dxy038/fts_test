To be effective a perfectly matched layer (PML) must be reflectionless to all impinging waves over a broad band of frequencies whilst not overly increasing the computational burden. This can be difficult to achieve as one must find a balance between the discretization error, the number of PML layers and the reflection coefficient. This work presents an optimized solution for simulating PMLs for the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique using both the mono-objective genetic algorithm (GA) and multiobjective genetic algorithm (MGA). The main goal is to implement a tool capable of finding the best choice of parameters for the conductivity profile to achieve a minimum for both the reflection and computation time

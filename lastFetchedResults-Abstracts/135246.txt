Background: Health care for increasing number of elders is an important aspect of health care systems and social workers can play an effective role to meet the elders' needs.
Objective: This study was performed to assess the effects of using health workers to meet the elders' needs.
Methods: In this field trial 75 elders above 60 years old in Isfahan were involved by a simple random sampling. Elders' needs were assessed by a questionnaire before and after a 6 month social workers' care with collaboration of volunteer social workers. Data were analysed by SPSS software and paired t and ANOVA tests.
Findings: After intervention the emotional and health related needs scores were decreased significantly (Paired t-test, P<0.0001). There was significant relationship between marital status and education with mean of needs reduction but no significant relationship between age and sex, with mean of needs reduction.
Conclusion: Results indicated that social services with a low cost process and using existing facilities can make a significant decrease in elders' needs.

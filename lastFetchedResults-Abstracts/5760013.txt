The femtocell concept is an emerging technology for deploying the next generation of the wireless networks, aiming at indoor coverage enhancement, increasing capacity, and offloading the overlay macrocell traffic. Nevertheless, one of the most critical issues in femtocells deployment is the potential interference, thus mitigating the overall system capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel joint power resource allocation mechanism to deal with the interference between nearby femtocells in Enterprise networks. With the autonomic and distributed architecture considered we aim to improve the energy efficiency. Based on cognitive approach, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem with mixed integer variables for the joint power control, base station assignment, and channel assignments according to userÂ´s QoS.

This paper considers the &#945;-&#946; target tracking approach to the benchmark tracking problem for beam steering of an array radar system with highly maneuvering targets. Since &#945;-&#946; target trackers are widely used in practical radar systems, this investigation/design considers the implementation problems such practical trackers experience, i.e. the various benchmark radar/target cases introduce rate variations, track lags and noise characteristics. One objective of the &#945;-&#946; tracking approach is to develop fundamental &#945;-&#946; ´rules-of-thumb´ and outline countermeasures to variations in track rate, maneuvers, measurement noise and system changes. It is expected that the overall tracking performance of the &#945;-&#946; approach will be inferior to other design techniques such as extended Kalman filtering, fault detection and multiple model. However, the simplicity and computational savings of the &#945;-&#946; target tracker are engineering advantages.

The standard treatment for respiratory failure remains endotracheal intubation, with periods of 22 or more days being commonplace. Posterior glottic stenotic web formation, from scarring in the posterior interarytenoid area, may occur after endotracheal intubation, thermal, corrosive, or direct surgical injury. A commonly used classification system for posterior glottic stenosis divides the occurrence into four types. Type I involves an interarytenoid scar band between the vocal folds that is anterior and separate from the posterior interarytenoid mucosa. Type II stenosis involves scarring of the mucosa or musculature of the posterior interarytenoid area. Types III and IV involve unilateral and bilateral cricoarytenoid joint fixation, respectively. Strobovideolaryngoscopy (SVL), rigid and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, electromyography (EMG), radiologic imaging of the neck, larynx, and trachea as well as pulmonary function tests, including flow volume loops, provide important objective measurements of upper airway obstruction. A representative case of a professional voice user who suffered a Type II posterior glottic stenosis is presented. The treatment utilized a specific contact-tip neodymium-yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) laser delivery system to achieve precise cutting, vaporization, and coagulation simultaneously, returning tactile touch technique to the airway/voice surgeon. Completely successful restoration of voice and airway have been maintained for 12 years postoperatively.

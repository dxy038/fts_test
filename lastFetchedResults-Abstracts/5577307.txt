A model of a customer service center using a manufacturing-based interactive simulation language is described. The current customer service center operating conditions were modeled so that `what if?´ scenarios could be analyzed. The objective was to identify the conditions necessary to optimize the level of service to the customer based on the department´s goal of answering 95% of the calls within the first three rings. Animation shows call and personnel flow within the system. The model is data driven and the inputs are obtained from the telephone system. The user interacts with the model and databases to test the effects of manpower and telephone system changes. The model records information on the performance of the individuals, bottlenecks, and staffing requirements based on the frequency of incoming calls. The authors describe the approach of data gathering, creating the model, simulating `what if?´ scenarios, and reaching conclusions based on the results

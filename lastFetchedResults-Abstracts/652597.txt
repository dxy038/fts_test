The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate mercury exposure and health status among Munduruku Indians from the community of Sai Cinza, State of Pará, Brazil. The population studied included 330 indians, who submitted to a questionnaire, clinical exams, and collection of hair, blood, urine, and feces. Mercury was measured in hair and fish. Although no person was found to have overt mercury intoxication, the mean levels of mercury in hair were elevated (14.45 μg/g for children from 7 to 12 years old, 15.70 μg/g for women between 14 and 44 years old, and 14.1 μg/g for the remaining population). Mercury levels in fish were below levels recommended by the World Health Organization, but rates of fish consumption were high. These results place this indigenous populations as a group under risk of mercury toxicity from the gold production.

This paper presents briefly the domain of conceptual modeling of the enterprise and the famous methods used. Some techniques present hiatuses and they are not precisely coherent or complementary for modeling the functional and decisional system of the enterprise. The objective of this paper is to show the relevance of these methods particularly for the methods of SADT (Structured Analysis Design Technique) and GRAI (Graph with Results and Actions Interrelated) in order to offer a complete and combined modeling of an enterprise.

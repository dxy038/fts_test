Two-stage thermoelectric generator in exo-reversible mode is thermodynamically optimized in view of finite time thermodynamics (FTT) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). Electrically series configuration with only internal irreversibilities of thermoelectric generator has been considered for investigation in the current research. Power output and thermal efficiency of the aforementioned system are considered as dual objective functions obtained from FTT technique. These two objectives are maximized at the same time with the use of multi objective genetic algorithm. For MOGA optimization of thermoelectric generator, five decision variables as number of thermoelectric element pairs at the bottom and top stage as m and n, heat source temperature and heat sink temperature and working electric current has been considered in the current study. MATLAB environment is used to obtain the Pareto Optimal frontier between power output and thermal efficiency and their best optimal values are selected by Fuzzy Bellman-Zadeh decision making technique. A comparative analysis of single objective and dual objective optimization of aforementioned objectives has been carried out and discussed.

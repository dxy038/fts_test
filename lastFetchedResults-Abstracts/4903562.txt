This paper presents a 3 phase 6/4 pole switched reluctance motor (SRM) with a low torque ripple. In order to reduce torque ripple especially in silent operation, a new stator pole face shape and a pole shoe attached to the lateral face of the rotor pole are designed based on an efficient optimization strategy employing Ordinary Kriging model and genetic algorithm (GA). In this optimization method, the uniform sampling technique is used to obtain some sampling points in the design space, and Ordinary Kriging uses an interpolation function to approximate the design objective. The GA is used to find the minimum of Kriging function instead of solving the optimization problem by finite element method. It is verified that the proposed algorithm can reduce the torque ripple of SRM effectively with high computation efficiency.

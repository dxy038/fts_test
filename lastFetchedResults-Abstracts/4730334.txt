Objective To research and implement transmitting, interchanging and sharing medical information. Methods By parsing HL7 message structure, using HAPI as supportive toolkit and based on object-oriented programming, HL7 Client and HL7 Server are constructed through adopting C/S mode to accomplish transmitting and interchanging HL7 medical information and high degree of sharing medical information. Results Lots of HL7 messages are tested by transmission test, all of which can achieve sharing patient demographic, laboratory analysis and other relative therapy information. Conclusion Constructed HL7 client and HL7 server can fully meet the demand, which not only enhance efficiency for physicians to diagnose patients and strengthen the construction of hospital medical digitalization, but also support telemedicine and regional healthcare with auxiliary.

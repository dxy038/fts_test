A solid travelling salesman problem (STSP) is a travelling salesman problem (TSP)
 where the salesman visits all the cities only once in his tour using different conveyances
  to travel from one city to another. Costs and environmental effect
 factors for travelling between the cities using different conveyances are different.
 Goal of the problem is to find a
 complete tour with minimum cost that damages the environment
 least. An ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is developed
 to solve the problem. Performance of the algorithm for the problem
 is compared with another soft computing algorithm, Genetic
 Algorithm(GA). Problems are solved with crisp as well as fuzzy costs. For
 fuzzy cost and environmental effect factors, cost function as well as environment
 constraints become fuzzy. As optimization of a fuzzy objective function
 is not well defined, fuzzy possibility approach is used to get
 optimal decision. To test the efficiency of the algorithm, the
 problem is solved considering only
 one conveyance facility ignoring the environmental effect constraint, i.e., a classical
 two dimensional TSP (taking standard data sets
 from TSPLIB for solving the problem). Different numerical
 examples are used for illustration.

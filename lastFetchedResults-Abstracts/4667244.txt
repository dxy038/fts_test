This paper investigates the integration of various subsystems of an automobileÂ´s chassis. The specific focus of this research is the integration of active suspension components with anti-lock braking (ABS) mechanisms. The performance objective for the integrated approach is defined as a reduction in braking distance over just anti-lock brakes. A two degree of freedom half car vehicle model is developed along with models for a hydraulic active suspension and an ABS system. For both subsystems, actuator dynamics are included. Individual controllers are developed for the subsystems and a governing algorithm is constructed to coordinate the two controllers. Simulations of the integrated controller and an ABS system demonstrate a significant increase in performance

Earth dam is a structure as homogeneous or non homogeneous forms for raising water level or water supply. Earth dam consist of different parts that one of the main parts is clay core. Choosing an optimal non permeable core which causes reduction of seepage through dam body and also being stable is necessary. The objective of this research is to optimize the geometry of earth dam clay core such that, beside of reduction of seepage through dam body, the volume of core material is minimized. For access of this objective a consolidated model consist of a simple model which obtained by linear regression and SA algorithm were used. So the necessary model has been written in Matlab7.8 and using SA algorithm, to optimize the Birjand Hesar Sangi dam. Optimal parameters such as seepage through dam body, hydraulic gradient and safety factor of stability access from model compared by the values access from the direct run of the software modeling that show a good agreement. Also the result of access by modeling have been compared by real dimensions of Birjand Hesar Sangi dam, that cause reduction of material volume for construction core dam about 21% and shell dam about 8% with satisfactory stability.
Result show that the consolidated  model have successful operations and a general optimal plan design of clay core dimensions in stable condition can be achieved.

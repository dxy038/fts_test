There is no consensus regarding the accuracy of bioimpedance for the determination of
body composition in older persons. Objective: This study aimed to compare the assessment of lean body mass of
healthy older volunteers obtained by the deuterium dilution method (reference) with those obtained by two
frequently used bioelectrical impedance formulas and one formula specifically developed for a Latin-American
population. Design: A cross-sectional study. Participants: Twenty one volunteers were studied, 12 women, with
mean age 72±6.7 years. Setting: Urban community, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. Measurement: Fat free mass was
determined, simultaneously, by the deuterium dilution method and bioelectrical impedance; results were
compared. In bioelectrical impedance, body composition was calculated by the formulas of Deuremberg, Lukaski
and Bolonchuck and Valencia et al. Results: Lean body mass of the studied volunteers, as determined by
bioelectrical impedance was 37.8±9.2 kg by the application of the Lukaski e Bolonchuk formula, 37.4±9.3 kg
(Deuremberg) and 43.2±8.9 kg (Valencia et. al.). The results were significantly correlated to those obtained by
the deuterium dilution method (41.6±9.3 Kg), with r=0.963, 0.932 and 0.971, respectively. Lean body mass
obtained by the Valencia formula was the most accurate. Conclusion: In this study, lean body mass of older
persons obtained by the bioelectrical impedance method showed good correlation with the values obtained by the
deuterium dilution method. The formula of Valencia et al., developed for a Latin-American population, showed
the best accuracy.

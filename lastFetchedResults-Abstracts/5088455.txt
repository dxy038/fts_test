In this contribution, a passivity-based output feedback controller is developed for the unity-power-factor pre-compensation of a boost-type AC/DC power converter. In such applications, aside from load voltage tracking to a pre-specifled initial and final constant level, a vital additional control objective consists in keeping the input power factor close to unity. By means of this controller, the desired input current of the converter has been designed for being in phase with the supply voltage. The control law is synthesized using a linear time-varying combination of the converter input current and voltage variables. The experimental results underscore that the controlled tracking performance of the output voltage is satisfactory, even under unity power factor requirements.

This paper theoretically extends the connotation of coordinated allocation of water resources, and presents that both the coordinated allocation and the carrying capacity of water resources are significant factors to support sustainable water resources development and utilization. A coordinated model is set up to evaluate district water allocation based on multi-objective decision, carrying capacity, optimal allocation, and so forth. Weifang city of Shandong Province is taken as an example to test the model and expected results achieved.

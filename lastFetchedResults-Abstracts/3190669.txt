The simulation of Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal Robots (EOD/IEDD robots) is a tremendous technical challenge to military engineers. The objective of such simulations is to prepare the operational forces for real-life missions as fully as possible by plausibly simulating the robot´s handling and steering characteristics as well as its complex interaction with the environment (particularly with explosive substances). This application paper presents the training simulations of Telerob´s tEODor and telemax EOD robots and discusses the special challenges that training simulations of this kind are expected to meet.

A wind-hydrogen project which converts offshore wind energy into hydrogen has been proposed. Because wind speed changes rapidly in wide range, the system safety boundaries are often violated. This paper deals with the problem of system control for the wind-hydrogen system, in order to avoid dangerous conditions like over-temperature and over-pressure. First, the mathematical models of the wind-hydrogen system are introduced. Then, a multi-objective switching control scheme for solving the problem is presented. Finally, simulations are carried out and the effectiveness of the control scheme is validated.

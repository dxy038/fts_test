The objective of this paper is to contribute to a perspective on economic performance, i.e. the interaction between norms specific to a company, the knowledge basis of the company and innovation.

estions we will try to shed light on in this article are: what is the connection between norms specific to the company, the knowledge basis of the company and innovation?

l argue that norms specific to the company, knowledge development and innovation strategies are closely linked, in order to promote competitive advantages at the company level. We will present and discuss a model in this connection. At the end of the article we will integrate this model and develop policy implications. We will see norms specific to the company in the light of social autopoiesis theory. It is this theory which will be used when evaluating the importance of knowledge development and innovation.

in thesis in the article is that a company's capabilities are primarily developed on the basis of social norms and values already existing in the social relations of the company. This in turn influences how the company develops and applies the knowledge basis, thus influencing innovation strategies.

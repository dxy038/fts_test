The main considerations in the existing XML data dependency models are the structural relevancies of XML nodes but not the information relevancies in XML data which derive from the real world. In this paper, we propose an XML data dependency model (XDDM) based on entity segments. Our main objective is to make XML data dependencies in XDDM match the information relevancies derived from the real world.

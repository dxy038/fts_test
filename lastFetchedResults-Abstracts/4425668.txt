Depending on the nature of the specific blackboard system, the specific order in which knowledge sources are chosen can have a major impact on the quality of initial solutions developed. A priori ordering of the knowledge sources is discussed, with the objective of achieving better initial solutions. Analytical results are developed to establish partial orderings of the knowledge sources and rules within the knowledge sources for economic-base systems (i.e., systems where there are costs or revenues associated with the outcomes in the rules)

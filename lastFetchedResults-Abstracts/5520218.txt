Distributed Integrated Modular Avionics (DIMA) is a promising architecture of the avionic in large aircraft. Compared with IMA, DIMA not only has the valuable metrics in weight, volume, power consumption and system complexity, but also in the system reliability. In order to explain the advantage of DIMA mathematically, the DIMA system is modeled as a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integration scheme with physical layer and function layer in this paper. With the combination of physical and cyber parameters, improvement is given to the conventional lexicographic optimization for the multi-objective optimization problem. A new measure to evaluate the reliability of the system, i.e. CPM burden, is proposed. With the consideration of reliability measure in the optimization, the reliability of the DIMA is highly improved. The improved lexicographic optimization gives a good tradeoff between the measures, while the higher priority of reliability is guaranteed. Moreover, a comparison between DIMA and IMA based the modeling shows that, the DIMA enjoys higher performance in reliability, while DIMA and IMA have their own merits and defects on the effectiveness measures.

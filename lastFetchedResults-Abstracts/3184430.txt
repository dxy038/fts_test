The ablation plasma generated by pulsed ion beam evaporation has been studied. The objective of this study is to understand the property and the behavior of the ablation plasma which is being used for thin film deposition. In the experiments reported in this paper, we have concentrated on the processes of target material ablation and ablation plasma expansion. The diagnostic results are used to analyze the process of thin film deposition.

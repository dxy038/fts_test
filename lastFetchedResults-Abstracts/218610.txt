Objective: Changes in chloride cell abundance, Na+, K+-ATPase immunolocalization
and activity were investigated in the gills of the golden grey mullet, Liza aurata, fry acclimated
to freshwater (FW) and different salinities (12‰, 36‰ and 46‰).
Materials and Methods: Na+, K+-ATPase localization was performed through immunofluorescence
light microscopy using a mouse monoclonal antibody IgGل5. Quantitive
analysis of Na+, K+-ATPase intensity was analyzed using Optima’s version 6.51 image
analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).
Results: In FW, the fluorescent cells (chloride cells) were observed on the epithelia
of filaments (mainly in inter-lamellar regions) and on the lamellae. Following transfer
to 12‰ salinity, the abundance of Na+, K+-ATPase immunofluorescence cells on the
filaments decreased 1.7-fold, and no immunofluorescence cells were detected on the
lamellae. Samples from 36‰ and 46‰ salinity showed a high density of chloride cells
on the epithelia of filaments, and a few cells on the lamellae. Na+, K+-ATPase intensity
did not change significantly with an increase in salinity from 36‰ to 46‰ but it was
significantly higher (p>0.05) in the FW compared to 12‰ salinity. There was no significant
difference between gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity in FW and 12‰ salinity, but it was
significantly higher (p>0.05) in the fish acclimated to 36‰ and 46‰ salinity (3.3- and
5.1-fold) compared to 12‰.
Conclusion: The capability of L. aurata fry to change the number and size of gill chloride
cells, as well as their activities indicate the high degree of adaptability of this fish
to a wide range of salinity.

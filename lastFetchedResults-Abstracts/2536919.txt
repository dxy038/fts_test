Background and Objective: Common anticancer drugs have adverse effects due to targeting both normal and cancerous cells, so it seems valuable to search for further new anticancer compounds. Previously reported, herbal preparation SIM5 has toxic effect on cancerous cells, although its effect on normal proliferating cells is not clear. The present study was performed in order to further comparing the effects of the preparation and its fractions on normal resting, proliferating cells and cancerous cells.

Materials and Methods: The BCL1 cell line (cancerous) and mouse splenocytes (normal resting) were cultured, the stimulator (ConA or LPS) was added to half of the wells (normal proliferating). Then, incubated with various concentrations of SIM5 or its fractions (according to relative molecular weight) for 48 hours, MTT test was performed and the cytotoxicity and IC50 were calculated.

Results: SIM5 had strong toxic effect on BCL1 (from 0.2-2 mg/ml, IC50 about 0.41 mg/ml), however no toxic effect was observed on activated lymphocytes. Besides, it was able to activate normal resting lymphocytes. The most effective anti-cancer fractions lie between the molecular weight of 30-50 KDa and the best immune-activating effect was between of 10-30 KDa.

Conclusion: The herbal preparation SIM5 has distinct effects on cancerous cells, lymphocytes and normal proliferating cells, so seeking possible discriminative mechanisms may clarify its potency as a candidate anti-cancer drug.

Various N-substituted benz[g]isoquinoline-3,5,10(2H)-triones 7 were prepared starting from vitamin K3 (menadione) 9. The key steps involve substitution of a benzylic bromide by a primary amine and intramolecular condensation across the ester moiety of a (3-bromomethyl-naphth-2-yl)acetate 8 followed by oxidation with cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) and spontaneous dehydrogenation, resulting in the title compounds 7. A selection of the synthesised new compounds was tested in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The Smart City concept relates to improve efficiency of city services and facilitate a more sustainable development of cities, as well as standing as the key concept for the future technological developments in Future Internet, IoT and, for the great quantity of information stored, big data and cloud computing. In this sense, this paper presents the ClouT project, a joint European-Japanese project, whose main aim is making citizens aware of city resources and helping them to use and care these resources by mean of smart IoT services in the Cloud. This objective is addressed through the definition of a three layer architecture composed of: CIaaS, CPaaS and CSaaS layers. On top of this architecture, different use cases associated to different application domains will be developed, mainly within the four cities that take part of the consortium: Mitaka and Fujisawa in Japan, and Santander and Genova in Europe.

The injection of a Î³-emitting tracer in backward-facing step flow was modelled. Flow and concentration fields were calculated by CFD and detector responses by a Monte-Carlo code. The objective was to show the influence of the radiotracer energy on the detector response, so as to interpret better data from radiotracer experiments. The radiotracer selection is important in obtaining reliable results, each specific case requiring careful analysis of the experimental data. However, more work is still required to achieve the prescribed goal aimed at.

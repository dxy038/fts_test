The main objective of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of Bovine herpes virus type 1 and
parainfluenza type 3 in a non-vaccinated population cattle in the livestock region of Qazvin province.
Totally 504 sera were randomly collected and tested from 8 industrial dairy farms in Qazvin province
during March 2010-March 2011. The result of one way analysis of variance was used for the analysis data.
Also Tukey Method was employed to detect pair wise differences among the ages determined that there
were a significant differences among the average titer in 1 to 3, 1 to 4, 2 to 3 and 2 to 4 year cows (P < 0.005,
P < 0.001, P < 0.041, P < 0.001). Due to the significance at the different titers, and comparing pair wise among
different seasons Tukey,s method had been used and showed significant difference in summer with autumn
(P < 0.038 ) and winter (P < 0.001). A chi-square test showed the significant differences among ages
(P=0.001). The sero- prevalence of BHV-1 was estimated to be 7.1% with 1.2% standard error (SE). The
result of PI3 showed the significance at the different titers comparing with the different seasons. Therefore
Tukey,s method had been used and showed significant difference among seasons (P < 0.001). The seroprevalence
of PI3 was estimated to be 95% with 1% SE.

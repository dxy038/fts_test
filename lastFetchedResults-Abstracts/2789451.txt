Due huge increase in power demand, power system network will lead to have major problems such as voltage instability and voltage collapse in the power system. To overcome these problems, Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices have been implemented in power system. By placing these devices in suitable locations, the power system can be operated far away from the instability point. In this paper, the optimal location and the ratings of FACTS devices such as Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), Static VAR Compensator (SVC) and Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) are determined using Genetic Algorithm (GA). A multi objective optimization problem is formulated with the consideration of minimizing voltage stability index, real power loss and generator cost. Evolutionary algorithm such as GA is a population based search method is used for solving multi objective optimization problem that is capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run and provide an optimal solution. It is observed from the results that the voltages stability index, real power loss and generator cost are reduced by optimally locating the FACTS devices in the power system. IEEE 14 bus system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

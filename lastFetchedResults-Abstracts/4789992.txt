The work is devoted to solve distributed task allocation task problem in group of agents with multi-objective genetic algorithms. The paper introduce the approach to select the correct stopping criterion for multi-objective genetic algorithms and the way to apply a new genetic operator using the solution information of the other agents for save time in the search of the optimal space in a group of agents.

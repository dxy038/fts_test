A direct flow cytometric erythrocyte immunofluorescence assay (FC) was developed and compared with the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) for detection of erythrocyte-bound immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM) and complement (C3) in dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). Tests were performed on erythrocytes from 13 healthy nonanemic dogs and from 13 anemic dogs with IMHA. The FC and DAT were negative for erythrocyte-bound immunoglobulin in all healthy dogs. The FC was negative for erythrocyte-bound C3 in 12 healthy dogs and positive in I healthy dog, and the DAT was negative for C3 in all healthy dogs. Of the 13 IMHA dogs tested for erythrocyte-bound lgG, 12 were positive using the FC and 7 were positive using the DAT. Sensitivity for the detection of erythrocyte-bound lgG in the 26 dogs was 92% for FC and 53% for DAT. Specificity for detection of erythrocyte bound lgG for FC and DAT was 100%. The addition of lgM and/ or C3 did not increase the sensitivity for FC or DAT. In this group of dogs, the FC provided a more rapid, cost-effective, sensitive, objective method to quantitate erythrocyte-bound immunoglobulin and/or complement compared with the currently used DAT.

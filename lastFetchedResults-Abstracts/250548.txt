One of the first multiple objective versions of the tabu search (TS) algorithm is proposed by the author.
The idea of applying TS to multiple objective optimization is inspired from its solution structure.
TS works with more than one solution (neighbourhood solutions) at a time and this situation gives
the opportunity to evaluate multiple objectives simultaneously in one run. The selection and updating
stages are modified to enable the original TS algorithm to work with more than one objective. In this
paper, the multiple objective tabu search (MOTS) algorithm is applied to multiple objective non-linear
optimization problems with continuous variables using a simple neighbourhood strategy. The algorithm
is applied to four mechanical components design problems. The results are compared with several
other solution techniques including multiple objective genetic algorithms. It is observed that MOTS
is able to find better and much wider spread of solutions than the reported ones

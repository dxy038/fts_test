In order to support the growing interest in demand response (DR) modeling and analysis, there is a need for physical-based residential load models. The objective of this paper is to present the development of such load models at the appliance level. These include conventional controllable loads, i.e., space cooling/space heating, water heater, clothes dryer and electric vehicle. Validation of the appliance-level load models is carried out by comparing the modelsÂ´ output with the real electricity consumption data for the associated appliances. The appliance-level load models are aggregated to generate load profiles for a distribution circuit, which are validated against the load profiles of an actual distribution circuit. The DR-sensitive load models can be used to study changes in electricity consumption both at the household and the distribution circuit levels, given a set of customer behaviors and/or signals from a utility.

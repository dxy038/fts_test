The objective of this work was to use Box - Wilson experimental plan to establish the relation between a dependent variables P (the delivered power) and three independent variables X1 (current density), X2 (air pressure) and X3 (air stoichiometry) in order to obtain the optimal values of the independent variables which give the maximum values of the fuel cell electric delivered power. The development of a PEM Fuel Cells mathematical model based on the design of experiment and surface response methodologies are described.

Objective: Technologic advances in ultrasonographic imaging have revolutionized the management of women's health care. We recently began to evaluate the clinical applications of three-dimensional ultrasonography. Study Design: This study prospectively evaluated 161 obstetric and gynecologic patients. Both two- and three-dimensional imaging data were acquired from real-time ultrasonography. Three orthogonal planes were displayed on a monitor and were used to create the rendered three-dimensional images. Results: To date, 201 three-dimensional ultrasonographic studies have been performed, 165 transabdominally and 36 transvaginally. Transabdominally, an average of eight acquisitions per patient were obtained. Of the clinically suspected abnormalities, 29 of 32 (91%) were confirmed by three-dimensional imaging. Three of 32 (9%) improved the diagnostic capabilities or changed the diagnosis. Of the 36 transvaginal studies, an average of four acquisitions per patient were done. Thirty (83%) of these patients had suspected abnormalities and all were confirmed. Conclusions: Three-dimensional ultrasonographic imaging appears to be highly promising in the clinical setting.

A novel presentation for channel selection problem in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) is introduced here. Continuous presentation in a projected two-dimensional space of the Electroencephalograph (EEG) cap is proposed. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization method (D<sup>2</sup>MOPSO) is employed where particles move in the EEG cap space to locate the optimum set of solutions that minimize the number of selected channels and the classification error rate. This representation focuses on the local relationships among EEG channels as the physical location of the channels is explicitly represented in the search space avoiding picking up channels that are known to be uncorrelated with the mental task. In addition continuous presentation is a more natural way for problem solving in PSO framework. The method is validated on 10 subjects performing right-vs-left motor imagery BCI. The results are compared to these obtained using Sequential Floating Forward Search (SFFS) and shows significant enhancement in classification accuracy but most importantly in the distribution of the selected channels.

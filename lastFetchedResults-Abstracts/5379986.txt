According to the law of agriculture production, we put forward a superiority evaluation-quota-system of different plots, and build the plot-superiority-evaluation model based on multi-objective system-fuzzy-optimization theory. Several cases on evaluation of competition superiority to agriculture plot are presented to show the difference of each agriculture plot in competition superiority, and provide decision support for production processes. The model can point out the direction of gaining more profits and improving the decision ability for agriculture production

Multi-objective optimisation is applied to encourage the effective use of state variables in car controlling programs evolved using Genetic Programming. Three different metrics for measuring the use of state within a program are introduced. Comparisons are performed among multi- and single-objective fitness functions with respect to learning speed and final fitness of evolved individuals, and attempts are made at understanding whether there is a trade-off between good performance and stateful controllers in this problem domain.

This paper represents the comparative study of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for Grid scheduling. The objective of ACO and PSO is to
dynamically generate an optimal schedule so as to complete the tasks in minimum period of
time as well as utilizing the resources in an efficient way. Makespan is the performance
measure used for the comparison of the scheduling techniques. This paper compares both
the above said optimization techniques and it is concluded that particle swarm optimization
has better performance compared to ant colony optimization for grid scheduling.

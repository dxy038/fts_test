The objective of this paper is to present a flash cell model for static and transient simulations. As a core element of this model, a Philips MOS model (MM11) model has been used coupled with the charge neutrality expression in the structure. The charge neutrality, including the charge trapped in the floating gate, is applied to determine the potential of the floating gate. From the floating gate potential, related to the terminal voltages, the drain current and the different charges present in the cell structure are calculated with the MM11 formulation. This pragmatic model takes into account the different injection mechanism (CHE, CHISEL and FN). Moreover, the characterization procedure developed under ICCAP to extract the MM11 model card as well as the tunnel current parameters is presented. This model has been successfully implemented in ELDO

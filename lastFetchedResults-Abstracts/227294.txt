Power electronic control of
electromechanical systems has become common.
These systems employ electronic components
which switch at high frequency and have very
complex interactions. The load which they supply
is often intricate in itself and difficult (or often
impossible) to create in an experimental
environment. It would be advantageous to replace
the electromechanics with a solid-state equivalent
which can be flexibly programmed to emulate the
real system. The paper is concerned with
describing this idea, illustrating the concept by
emulating an electric motor and its associated
mechanical load. The phrase ‘virtual machine’ has
been coined to describe the system. It givesitakes
power from the electronic converter to match as
closely as possible the real electrical machine and
load. The virtual machine is effectively a
dynamically controllable sourceisink which is
capable of providing a bidirectional power level
interface to a power electronic converter. Using
the virtual machine, a power electronic converter
can be tested in diverse applications and under a
wide variety of loading conditions without the
need for any electromechanics. Test results show
that close agreement between the virtual and real
systems is possible. The limits imposed by
practical implementation of the concept are also
examined.

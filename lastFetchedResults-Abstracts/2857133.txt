The objective of the Microprocessors and Microcontrollers course is the students to meet the general idea and concepts of a low-level assembly language and controlling the hardware devices with embedded microcontrollers. Since this is the hardware based course, which requires a lot of efforts by both the teachers and students, the students avoid to learn its material for gaining knowledge, but just to pass the course and continue with their studies. Apart of the courses bad reputation, it is usually among the courses with the lowest throughput. Starting from 2010, the courses syllabus was changed each year towards making the course more practical exercises and exams where the students could use their software skills. In this paper we elaborate all changes that improved not only the course throughput, but also the courses reputation, average grade, curiosity to learn hardware, etc, which are presented through years.

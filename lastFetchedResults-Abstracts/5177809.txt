Evaluation of the quality of image compression still remains an important issue. In this paper, we propose a novel objective assessment to evaluate the quality of gray scale compressed images. An image characteristic measurement, Spatial Frequency Measurement (SFM), is employed to get the new objective measurements, which are Mean Square Error with SFM (MSESFM), Edge Measurement with SFM (ESFM) and Correlation Measurement with SFM (CSFM). From the experiments, we found that SFM influences to the objective assessment. In addition, the reliabilities of the new measures have been improved and better match the subjective assessment than using the traditionally simple objective assessments.

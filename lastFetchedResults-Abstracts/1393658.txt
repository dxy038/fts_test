The objective of the paper is presenting a simple and more accurate technique for precise identification of nonlinear elastic force functions acting in asymmetric vibration systems. The identification procedure based on the Hilbert transform is a nonparametric one; it does not require a priori information about the system structure or its parameters. The examples of the identification of asymmetric classic vibration nonlinear models – the Helmholtz and the double-well Duffing oscillators – are investigated.

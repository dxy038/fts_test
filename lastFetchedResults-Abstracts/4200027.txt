Energy conservation is one of the most important challenges in wireless sensor networks. Sensor networks are composed of hundreds or thousands of nodes dispersed in a wide field. In large-scale sensor networks, the most demanding task is lifetime. Hierarchical architecture and data aggregation are effective approaches to prolong the lifetime of the network as long as possible. The overall objective of this paper is to present a critical comparative analysis among existing data aggregation techniques. This paper has shown that the existing researches have focused on stationary sink as well as stationary nodes based WSN but in real time environment, most of the applications are based on mobile sink and nodes. The use of compressive sensing while transmitting the data to the sink has been neglected in the majority of researches. The effective data aggregation that utilizes the hierarchical approach for removing the redundant data has not been considered by the existing researches.

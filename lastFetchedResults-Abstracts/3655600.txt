The commenters refer to the above mentioned paper by Wolpert and Micheli-Tzanakou (ibid. p.955-61, 1993), and point out the oversight of previous activity in circuit design. In their opinion the paper in question does not seem to represent a novel approach either in circuitry or computationally. In reply, the authors acknowledge their oversight of the conference papers cited by the commenters, but point out that they never suggested that a simple shunting lateral inhibitory (SLI) pair was a novel circuit, and the overall objective of their effort was simply to carry analysis of SLI to a higher dimension.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

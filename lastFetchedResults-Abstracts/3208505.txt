While reliable and efficient tools are widely available to solve (full-order) &#8460;<sub>&#8734;</sub> control problems, formulating appropriate weighting functions constitutes the main obstacle to a good &#8460;<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller design. In order to facilitate the weighting function design, we propose to break apart the classical &#8460;<sub>&#8734;</sub> objective into various &#8460;<sub>&#8734;</sub> design objectives and constraints, each relating to a particular closed-loop subsystem. The result is a versatile and intuitive control design approach, and the resulting control problem is solved using the Lyapunov shaping paradigm. The potential of our approach is demonstrated on an overhead crane setup.

Objective
estigate the therapeutic effects of cationic nanoliposome-mediated gene therapy combined with immunotherapy for colon cancer treatment.
s
inant plasmids containing green and red fluorescent protein reporter genes were constructed using gene cloning methods. Gene-carrying cationic nanoliposomes were prepared based on the electrostatic adherence principle and then transfected into dendritic cells (DC), which were transplanted into colon cancer cells.
s
inant plasmids containing green or red fluorescent protein reporter genes were successfully constructed by gene cloning and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. Gene-carrying cationic nanoliposomes were transfected into colon cancer cells, and good gene expression was detected. A better level of apoptosis was observed in the combined group of tyrosine kinase receptor 3 ligand (FL) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), while the lowest level was detected in the control group. The parameters in the FL and TRAIL groups were between the above-mentioned combined group.
sion
ic nanoliposomes have the advantage of being gene carriers. The joint therapeutic effects of the two genes are superior to those of a single gene. Gene therapy combined with immunotherapy has significant implications for cancer treatment.

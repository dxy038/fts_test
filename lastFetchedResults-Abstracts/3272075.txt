This paper presents linear transceiver designs for MIMO interfering broadcast channels (MIMO IFBC). A new global objective, referred to as a Total Signal-to-Leakage-plus-Noise Ratio (TSLNR), is proposed and is solved based on alternating optimisation. The algorithm is also proven to converge. The proposed objective is further modified into an Individual SLNR (ISLNR) to relax the requirement of global channel state information (CSI). High-performance practical linear transceivers are also given and are shown to achieve near-theoretical performance. Moreover, robust designs of the proposed algorithms in the presence of imperfect CSI are presented. The advantages of the proposed algorithms are also illustrated through simulations.

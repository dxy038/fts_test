The impairment detection method (IDM) is proposed. It is an objective measurement technique of subjective image quality. Given the original and reproduced image as inputs, both images are divided into three areas: flat area, texture area, and sharp edge area. Features are extracted from each area using gradient vector block analysis. The IDM produces three output parameters that measure blocking distortion, blurring, and spatial edge noise

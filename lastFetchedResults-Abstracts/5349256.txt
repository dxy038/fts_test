Video data compression is one the core technologies of video conference, which aims to enable significantly high performance data coding. In order to achieve this, a robust rate-distortion optimization (RDO) technique is needed to be employed to select the best coding mode This paper presents optimization solution about inter prediction mode decision algorithm of H.264/AVC for video conference under the HLA/RTI framework. Our objective is to reduce the computational complexity of the CODEC (coder &amp; decoder) with insignificant rate-distortion performance degradation.

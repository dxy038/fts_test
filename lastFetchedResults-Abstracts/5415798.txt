Among the scientific objectives defined in the frame of the INTERMARSNET International Mission is included the measurement of the surface dielectric constant on the whole Martian surface. For this purpose a radar/scatterometer system has been studied which is in principle able to provide information concerning backscattering coefficient averaged over the radar spatial resolution cell. As a secondary science objective the same instrument is also able to provide 3D mapping of the Martian surface with a coarse horizontal (or spatial) resolution and an accurate measure of the mean surface height and roughness (altimeter mode). Furthermore the use of a spinned satellite without an antenna stabilization in the mission results in a proper system design for the radar sensor

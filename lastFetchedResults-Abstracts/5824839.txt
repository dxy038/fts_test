The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a method to help people make a complex decision by analyzing and synthesizing multiple criteria for the decision objective in a hierarchy. We adopt the AHP as a new strategy for the semantic concept detection (SCD) in video so that multiple factors involved in SCD, including multiple modalities and relating concepts, can be hierarchically analyzed and synthesized. In this paper, we first explain, by an example, why and how the SCD problem can be analyzed by the AHP. Then, following the idea of the AHP, we develop a new rank aggregation (RA) method, called AHP-RA. Experimental results of RA for SCD in video show the effectiveness of this method.

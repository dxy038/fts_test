The main objective of this research was conducted with reduction of salinity stress by calcium nutrition on seedlings of wheat. The Zagros, Opaata/bow and Pego/ Seri genotypes were selected for this aim. The plants were transplanted in hydroponics culture system with Hogland nutrient solution in growth chamber under control condition. The treatments were included 0 and 100 mM NaCl each one along with 2.5, 5 and 10 mM Ca^2+. Salinity induced the significant reduction in total dry weight and leaf area but Opatalbow genotype by 18 percent and Pego/ Seri genotype by 14 percent increase of dry weight in 5 mM CaCI2 treatment with salinity indicated significant lower decrease of dry weight and leaf area than 2.5 mM CaCI2 treatment. In spite of significant increase of Na+ concentration by salinity, 5 mM CaCI2 treatment with salinity caused significant reduction on Na+ concentration in roots of all genotypes and shoots of Opata/bow genotypes in the proportion of other calcium treatments. Salinity induced decrease of K+ uptake. However, 5 mM CaCI2 treatment improved significantly the K+ concentration in all genotypes. Though the Ca^2+ concentration decrease under salinity, addition of CaCI2 to culture solution occasioned to increase of Ca2+ concentration in all genotypes. The results indicated that 5 mM CaCI2 reduced the toxin effects of salinity especially in Opata/bow genotype. Consequently, the protein content was increased in 5 mM CaCI2 treatment in compare to other calcium treatments. Further experiments are recommended on reproductive stage and other genotypes of wheat.

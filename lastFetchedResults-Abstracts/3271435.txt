Small cell deployment can significantly enhance the system performance by increasing the network throughput and reducing the overall energy consumptions. In this paper, we consider the problem of co-tier interference mitigation among Home Base Stations (HeNBs) in small cell overlaid macrocell network. A genetic algorithm based user access control scheme is proposed for downlink open access small cell networks with the objective of optimizing the overall system throughput. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed access control scheme is capable of improving the system performances, in terms of both system throughput and energy efficiency.

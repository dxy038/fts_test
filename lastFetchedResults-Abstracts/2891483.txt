This paper presents a study of Double Gate MOSFET. The design possibilities of the Double Gate MOSFET will be explored in this paper which operates efficiently in sub threshold region to achieve ultra-low power and increases the performance of the circuit. The main objective of this paper is to understand the structure of Double Gate MOSFET while comparing them with traditional bulk MOSFET. The aim is to carry out simulations of Double Gate MOSFET and to improve the performance of MOSFET by studying the MOSFETs with double gate. Power consumption of the designed logic gates with Single Gate MOSFET and Double Gate MOSFET have been compared in this paper. Simulations are performed on SPICE tool at 45nm technology for a variety of inputs at different supply voltages and frequencies.

Objective.
To examine longitudinal changes in daily fruit and vegetable consumption among black and white adolescent girls and calculate the percent of girls who met the Healthy People 2010 recommendations.
Methods.

Girls (1186 black and 1126 white) who participated in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth Health Study (NGHS) were included if they had completed a 3-day food diary for at least one of six annual assessments visits, beginning at ages 11 or 12. Mixed models estimated the association of visit and race with (a) average daily consumption of fruits and vegetables and (b) the probability of meeting intake recommendations on one or more out of 3 days.
Results.

For girls of both races, fruit and vegetable consumption increased with age; white girls showed a greater increase in fruit and nutrient-rich vegetable intake than black girls. Across visits, girls consumed considerably fewer than the recommended daily servings of fruits (1.0–1.5), vegetables (1.7–2.5), or nutrient-rich vegetables (0.25). Most girls (95%) failed to meet Healthy People 2010 recommendations.
Conclusions.

Public health efforts are needed to meet Healthy People 2010 objectives.

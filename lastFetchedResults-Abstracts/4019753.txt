The basic objective of bulk power system planning is to develop the system as economically as possible while maintaining an acceptable level of service reliability. The traditional methods used by system planners to maintain acceptable bulk power system reliability are challenged in the present move to incorporate higher wind power penetration levels. Combining deterministic considerations with probabilistic assessment in order to evaluate the quantitative system risk and conduct bulk power system planning has therefore become increasingly necessary and important in recent years. This paper examines the capacity value of wind generation using various approaches and the utilization of this value under the deterministic N-1 criterion. The application of a joint deterministic-probabilistic criterion for bulk system expansion planning in wind integrated systems is presented. The application of the conventional deterministic N-1, the basic probabilistic and the joint deterministic-probabilistic criteria is illustrated in a wind integrated test system in this paper.

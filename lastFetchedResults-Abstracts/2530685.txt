Biological synthesis of nanoparticles has emerged as a promising field of biotechnology. Various biological systems including fungi, yeasts, bacteria, and plants have been used for biosynthesis of nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles have unique properties that make them ideal for various medical and industrial applications. Owing to high levels of organic reducing agents and ease of manipulation, plant extracts are widely used for biological generation of various types of metal nanoparticles. The objective of the present study was to evaluate efficacy of Carum carvi extract in biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles and to investigate antifungal effects of the biosynthesized nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by addition of silver nitrate solution into fresh extract of C. carvi. Characterization of the synthesized silver nanoparticles was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Inhibitory effect of silver nanoparticles on Candida albicans growth was evaluated by serial microdilution method. The results revealed the formation of spherical silver nanoparticles with an average size of 10 nm. Moreover, concentration of SNPs in a 25 mL sample containing both SNPs and plant extract biomass was 2.934 mg/L on average. Serial microdilution test showed that SNPs at the concentration of 50 Î¼g/mL can inhibit growth of the pathogen. The present study extends the existing literature about green synthesis of nanoparticles using plant tissues and extracts.

Optimal selection of size of the conductors in distribution system would result in reduction in capital investment, reduction in energy losses. In this paper, selection of conductors is done based on cost of energy loss and interest and depreciation on capital investment. The main objective is to minimize the real and reactive power losses and also to maximize savings in total cost of conductors, obeying the current and voltage limits. The effectiveness of the algorithm is tested on a part of distribution network of Eastern Power Distribution Corporation of Andhra Pradesh which consists 22 buses, five different types of conductors have been chosen for the analysis.

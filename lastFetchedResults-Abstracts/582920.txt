Objectives: Cisplatin (CP) is used as the commonest drug to treat
solid tumors. It is accompanied by a nephrotoxicity side effect. The
main objective of this study is to investigate the protective role of
magnesium (Mg) supplementation in CP-induced nephrotoxicity
in a rat model.
Methods: Twenty-nine Wistar rats were randomly assigned to
four groups (1–4). Groups 1–3 received 20, 80, and 200 mg/kg
magnesium sulfate respectively, for 10 days, but on day 3, a single
dose of CP (7 mg/kg, i.p.) was also injected. Group 4 (positive
control group) received the same regimen of Groups 1–3 except
saline instead magnesium sulfate. One week after CP administration,
blood samples were obtained and all animals were killed for kidney
histopathological investigations.
Results: All CP-treated animals lost weight, and the percentage
of weight loss in Group 1 (low dose Mg sulfate treated) was
significantly higher compared with the positive control group
(Group 4, P  <  0.05). The increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
and creatinine (Cr) levels in serum in Group 1 were more than
those in other groups (P  <  0.05). No statistical differences were
observed in serum magnesium, nitrite, and total protein levels
among the groups. The kidney tissue damage in Groups 1–3 was
not significantly different when compared with Group 4. Moreover,
the kidney and testis weights in Group 1 were significantly greater
than those in the positive control group (P  <  0.05).
Conclusion: Regarding the BUN and Cr levels in the serum,
kidneys weight, and the histopathological study, the low dose of Mg
supplementation intensifies kidney toxicity and renal dysfunction
in CP-induced nephrotoxicity in the rat model. However, the
protective role of Mg with moderate and high doses is not certain.

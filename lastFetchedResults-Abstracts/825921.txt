To achieve the original and fundamental objective of nuclear power, i.e., to put to use the inexhaustible reserves of cheap fuel, it is essential to develop cost-effective and safe breeders, and to solve the problems of radwastes and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Extensive experience in nuclear technology and studies performed in recent years provide sufficient grounds for choosing in the near future a certain engineering concept, developing the concept and demonstrating it within 15â€“20 years. In such a case it would be possible to expect that by mid-century, nuclear power will be developed on a large scale to meet a considerable part of the world energy demand increase.

We have been developing a monolithic active pixel sensor with the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS technology for use in future X-ray astronomical satellite missions. This sensor is called XRPIX. Our objective is to replace the X-ray CCD, which is currently the standard detector in the field, with the developed XRPIX, which offers high coincidence time resolution (~ 50 ns), superior hit-position readout time (~ 10 &#956;s), and wide bandpass (0.5-40 keV), in addition to having comparable performance in terms of imaging spectroscopy. In our previous study, we built a prototype sensor called XRPIX1 and confirmed its basic X-ray imaging spectroscopy performance in a mode that read out the entire area (all pixels). The next step is to realize a high-speed, intelligent readout for X-ray detection. XRPIX1 comprises a trigger circuit for each pixel, so as to detect an X-ray photon injection; this system is capable of direct access to selected pixels to read out the signal amplitude. We describe the design of the trigger circuitry system and report on the first resolved X-ray spectra obtained in the trigger-driven readout mode.

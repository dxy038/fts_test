Objective Vocal fold paresis has a multifactorial etiology and is idiopathic in many individuals. The incidence of thyroid-related neuropathy in the larynx has not been previously described. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed thyroid disease in patients with laryngeal neuropathy and to compare this prevalence with that in a cohort of patients with a neurotologic neuropathy. Study Design and Setting Case series with chart review; tertiary care, otolaryngology practice. Subjects and Methods Charts of 308 consecutive patients with dysphonia and vocal fold paresis and 333 consecutive patients with sensorineural hearing loss, who presented for evaluation during a 3-year period, were reviewed. Results One hundred forty-six of 308 (47.4%) patients with vocal fold paresis were diagnosed with concurrent thyroid disease, whereas 55 of 333 (16.5%) patients with sensorineural hearing loss were diagnosed with concurrent thyroid disease (Pآ <آ 0.001, Pearson chi-square = 92.896; degrees of freedom = 5). Thyroid diagnoses among those with vocal fold paresis included benign growths (29.9%), thyroiditis (7.8%), hyperthyroidism (4.5%), hypothyroidism (3.6%), and thyroid malignancy (1.6%). Conclusions Thyroid abnormalities are more prevalent in patients with dysphonia and vocal fold paresis than in patients with symptomatic sensorineural hearing loss, suggesting a greater association between previously undiagnosed thyroid abnormalities and laryngeal neuropathy than that between neurotologic neuropathy and thyroid disease.

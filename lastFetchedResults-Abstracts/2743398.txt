Optical fiber communication networks can provide terabit aggregate capacities to buildings and offices within modern cities. Practical wireless systems are orders of magnitude below this capacity. In this letter, we describe an indoor optical bidirectional wireless link with an aggregate capacity over 100 Gb/s. The link operates over ~3 m range at 224 Gb/s (6 x 37.4 Gb/s) and 112 Gb/s (3 x 37.4 Gb/s) with a wide field of view (FOV) of 60&#176; and 36&#176;, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a wireless link of this type with a FOV that offers practical room-scale coverage.

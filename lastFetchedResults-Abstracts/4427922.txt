The objective of this work is to demonstrate a mechanism to improve the advising of students in a nontraditional environment. We applied two project management tools designed to help the students complete their degree plan sooner. The first tool provides a visualization map of course sequences, customized for each student, making advising adjustments that will optimize the time to obtain the degree under a constrained set of resources. The second tool collects information from multiple students through several semesters and can be used to identify bottlenecks in the curriculum. This article shows the application of the first tool in our university and in the local community college. The purpose is to optimize the time for graduation and align the students before transferring to our programs.

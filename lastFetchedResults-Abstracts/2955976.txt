In the mid-1980s the Kansas Board of Regents mandated that all schools in the state system develop a program for assessment of alumni experiences. The objective of this program is to provide feedback on many issues having to do with the experiences that alumni had while in school. The program developed at Kansas State surveys new graduates, one-year graduates, and four-year graduates on a periodic basis. Feedback from these surveys has been used to make adjustments in academic programs, advising, and enrollment processes. This paper summarizes some of the actions initiated in these areas. The ABET Engineering Criteria 2000 indicate that acceptable evidence of success can be obtained from &#8220;alumni surveys that document professional accomplishments and career development activities&#8221;. No mention of alumni feedback regarding program quality issues is made in the criteria. This paper discusses this issue and other assessment groups mentioned in the ABET Engineering Criteria 2000. Questions about the various methods of obtaining evidence for ABET are raised. The appropriate use of the results of various methods is discussed

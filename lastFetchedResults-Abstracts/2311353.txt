In the Fujian Province, southeastern China, most of the hot springs emerge in fluviatile valleys and the geothermal resources are mainly medium and low temperature ones by mixing of hot water with cold superficial groundwater. The occurrence of the thermal waters is controlled by deep tectonic fractures in the bedrock where higher-temperature geothermal reservoirs of economic interest are present. The objective of this study is to detect the deeper active hydrothermal zone under a thick sedimentary cover by geoelectrical methods. In the Gui-An site, the combination of telluric-telluric profiling and magnetotelluric methods turns out very efficient to delineate more accurately the width of the deep conductive fracture zone. Moreover, the self-potential method allows us to localize the most active geothermal zone by electrofiltration processes above a convective cell of hot water which flows up from a deep source. The combined results constitute a possible guide for deep geothermal exploration currently encountered in several geothermal regions over the world.

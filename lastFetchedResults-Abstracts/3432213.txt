This note is concerned with control of input/state asynchronous sequential machines with nondeterministic models. The objective is to use state feedback for controlling the machine so as to match any possible behavior of the model. When exact model matching is unsolvable, the model matching inclusion problem is considered in which we find the supremal controllable sub-model, or the largest sub-model of a given nondeterministic model that can be matched by the closed-loop system.

Background and Objective: Abortions are the most common complications of pregnancy. This study was conducted to figure out primary outcomes of surgical and conservative management of incomplete abortions in early pregnancy.
Materials and Methods: This study was carried out in Mousavi and Vali Asr hospitals of Zanjan in 2008-2009.
48 women with incomplete abortions were divided into two groups based on their own preferences: conservative management (n=25) and surgical management (n=23). In the conservative group, the patients were granted with a two-week interval for spontaneous resolution and then a sonoghraphy was performed. In the surgical group curettage was done and after two weeks patients were visited. In both groups, we compared satisfaction, time taken to do normal activities, bleeding days, pelvic pain and the need for follow up care after two weeks. 
Results:  In the conservative group, spontaneous resolution occurred in 19 patients (76%) after two weeks. In this group satisfaction was higher and time taken to return to the normal activities was shorter than the surgical group, but bleeding days was longer in the conservative group and more patients needed follow up care after 2 weeks. There was no significant difference in pelvic pain between two groups.
Conclusion: Conservative management is a superior alternative method in the management of incomplete abortions in early pregnancy. However, further researches are necessary in order to attribute these results to all patients.

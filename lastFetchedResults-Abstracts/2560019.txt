Having a good relationship with family members is the utmost consideration in family
life. This socio-legal study focusses on the family institution, in which all family members
play pivotal roles in determining the wellbeing of the family. The main objective of this
study is to understand family relationships in terms of legal awareness among family
members. The survey was the main method used in this study and it will be analysed using
statistical techniques. The semi-structured interview was also employed in this research.
The study shows that most rural folks prefer mediation in settling disputes. The findings
of this research are expected to fill the gap in socio-legal literature on Muslim marriage
matters and to provide valid reasons for designing a new policy and regulatory framework
to deal with the implementation and enforcement of Islamic Family Law in Malaysia

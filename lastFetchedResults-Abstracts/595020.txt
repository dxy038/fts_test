Objective: To study the clinical complications in patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction.Material and Methods: A retrospective observational study in coronary care unit of Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar. Patients of all age groups and both sexes were included. The diagnosis was based on inferior wall myocardial manifested in II, III, AVF with raised cardiac enzymes clinched the diagnosis. The patients were examined clinically, alongwith the ECG on daily and if needed basis.Results: Over a period of three (3) months i.e August - October 2002, a total of 27 patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction were studied for complications. Bradyarrythmias, Hypotension were found in quite a few. Sinus Bradycardia in eight (29.6%) with complete AV block in two (7.4%) and one 2:1 (3.7%) AV Block in a single patient was observed, one (3.7%) patient arrived in cardiogenic shock and did not survive. Two patients (7.4%) presented with left ventricular failure and six (22.2 %) had Hypotension. Two patients had re-infarction and one (3.7 %) each had Ventricular fibrillation, Ventricular tachycardia, Right Ventricular infarction and Ventricular Septal Defect.Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of the regional blood supply and the peculiar arrythmias and haemodynamic changes with inferior Infarction. Thrombolytic Therapy, age and the presence of risk factors for coronary artery disease signify the final outcome.

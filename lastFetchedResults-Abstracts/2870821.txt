Managing and allocating available resources are vital in communication networks in order to attain a network design objective while keeping great satisfaction in quality of service (QoS) for all users. Resource allocation in multi-cell system can be described as maximizing of a system utility by allocating transmits power among users and spatial directions. Different resource scheduling algorithms also have been addressed to handle the resource allocation among users. Hence, this study provides an optimization framework for downlink resource allocation in a single cell with multi user system. The framework will then be extended for multi-cell system. The structure of optimal resource allocation is derived based on TaguchiÂ´s method. An initial simulation study has been carried out using OMNeT++ simulator. Three performance criteria are measured which are MAC throughput and delay of the system, and also the mean opinion score (MOS) for VoIP traffic application.

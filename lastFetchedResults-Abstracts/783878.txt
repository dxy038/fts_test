Objective To evaluate whether adolescents committed to
psychiatric inpatient care are the most disturbed, and
whether psychosocial factors other than psychiatric symptoms
are associated with commitment to and detainment in
psychiatric care among adolescents.
Materials and methods The case histories of 187 13- to
17-year-old adolescents consecutively admitted to the
study clinic were scrutinized with the help of a structured
data collection form. Psychiatric, demographic and familyrelated
characteristics of those referred involuntarily
(n = 93) and voluntarily (n = 94), and those detained
involuntarily (n = 42) and treated on a voluntary basis
(n = 145) were compared.
Results Involuntary referral and involuntary detainment
were associated with psychotic symptoms, temper tantrums
and breaking property, involuntary referral also with violent
and hostile behaviours and suicidal ideation and talk.
They were not associated to family adversities, previous
treatment history or sociodemographic factors. The risk for
being committed when presenting with aggressive behaviours
was greater in girls.
Conclusion Involuntary referral and detainment in adolescents
is associated with symptom severity, and not with
aspects of the adolescent’s living conditions. This is in
agreement with the legislation. Gender bias resulting in
girls’ greater risk of being involuntarily committed if displaying
aggressive behaviours may be an ethical and legal
problem.

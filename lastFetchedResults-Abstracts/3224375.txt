Data arranged in a particular fashion creates information. To arrange data several techniques are used amongst which sorting is a popular one. In this research study, I am proposing anew sorting algorithm. Complexity analysis and the results obtained after implementation are described in a graphical form with an objective to compare the efficiency of the proposed algorithm with standard algorithm technique.

A novel full-reference image quality assessment metric employing statistical local correlation as an indicator for quality quantification is presented. The local correlation is extracted in a wavelet domain and is pooled into an objective quality score. Simulation and testing results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms the other methods in terms of high accuracy of image quality prediction, but also is consistent with the subjective evaluations.

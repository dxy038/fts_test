Introduction: Maternal immunization provides potential means for protecting infants against some infections
with universal application.
Objective: This study was designed to determine the levels of immunity against Diphtheria and Tetanus in
mothers & their two mounths old infants who reffered for vaccination, and evaluate the relation of mothers
vaccination on their infants immunity and determine the ratio of mothers who didn't observe the vaccination
during pregnancy.
Materials and Methods: Sera were collected from 110 mother-infant pairs before DTwP vaccination and from
69 infants after receipt of three doses of DTP vaccine. Anti diphtheria, anti tetanus toxins TgG levels were
measured by ELIZA. History ofDT vaccination of mothers at pregnancy was recorded .The mean concentration
of antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus in mother and their infants before vaccination and in infants after
receipt of Jdoses of DTwP vaccine were measured and compared by paired t-test.
Results: Of 110 mothers, 22 (20%) did not receive dT vaccine. Of these 22 unvaccinated mothers, one (4.5%)
and six (27.2%) were serologically susceptible to tetanus and diphtheria respectively. The mean concentrations
of antibodies titers of unvaccinated mothers were significantly lower than vaccinated mothers. All infants
acquired immunity against both infections after receipt of three doses of DTP vaccine. Infants' immune response
to DTP was not affected by maternal immunization
Conclusion: Diphtheria - tetanus toxoids components of DTP vaecine were highly irnrnunologenic, Aceording
to lack of vaccination in pregnancy, more effort must be made to increase the coverage rate of this highly
immunogenic vaccine to sustain protection against diphtheria and tetanus.

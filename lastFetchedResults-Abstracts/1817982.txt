Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate if a combination of five diffusible angiogenic growth factors were released in human dental pulp during orthodontic force application, by using growth factor neutralising antibodies (NAs) to block their effects. Materials and methods: Dental pulps from 18 premolar teeth treated with orthodontic fixed appliances for 2 weeks were divided vertically, and each half pulp further sectioned and co-cultured with a section of rat aorta in collagen surrounded by growth media. NAs (anti-h VEGF, anti-h FGF2, anti-h PDGF, anti-TGFÎ² and anti-h EGF) were added to the media of the co-cultures from one half of each pulp from 10 teeth. The co-cultures from the remaining eight teeth acted as controls. Sections of rat aorta alone were also cultured with and without NAs. Cultures were examined daily by light microscopy for growth and number of microvessels. Results: NAs significantly reduced microvessel numbers in the co-cultures, but not in the rat aorta alone cultures. Conclusions: The results show that a combination of these angiogenic growth factors are released in the pulp following orthodontic force.

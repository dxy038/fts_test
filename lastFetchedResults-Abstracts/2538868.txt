Background and Objective: The endurance and strength of lumbar paraspinal muscles play an important role in the spinal columnrsquo;s stability and mobility. It seems that the people who feel weak in these muscles have difficulties including instability and pain in the spinal column. Therefore, the aim of this research was to study the effects of exercise in water on endurance of trunk extensor muscles in people with chronic nonspecific back pain.

Materials and Methods: In this semi Experimental research, 30 men with chronic nonspecific back pain with the age range between 20 and 35 were selected by convenience and randomly divided into experimental and control groups. Then, the experiment group was presented 24 sessions of exercise in water for (6 weeks, each week 4 sessions of 45 to 60 minutes). Quebec standard questionnaire was used to determine the severity of pain and lumbar muscle strength were measured using the Sorensen test. The data analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 and independent dependent tests were used.

Results: The results showed that the exercises in water a significant decrease reduction of pain severity and also increase in endurance of the lumbar extensor muscles in patients with chronic nonspecific back pain (ple;0.005).

Conclusion: The patients with chronic nonspecific back pain have a lower degree of trunk extensor muscle endurance compared to healthy people. These patients do exercises in water can significantly increase the strength of the muscles through, the amount of pain and functional disability in activities of everyday improved.

Purpose
pression of the epidermal growth factor receptor has been demonstrated in advanced prostate cancer and is associated with a poor outcome. A multi-institutional, randomized, phase II study was undertaken by the National Cancer Institute of Canada-Clinical Trials Group to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of two doses of oral gefitinib in patients with minimally symptomatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).
ts and Methods
n July and November 2001, 40 patients with HRPC and increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or progression in measurable disease who had not received prior chemotherapy were randomly assigned to 250 mg (n = 19) or 500 mg (n = 21) oral gefitinib daily continuously. The primary end points were PSA response rate and objective measurable response. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate Cancer Subscale (FACT-P) quality-of-life questionnaires were completed at baseline and during treatment.
s
f the patients demonstrated a PSA or objective measurable response. Five (14.3%) of 35 assessable patients had stable PSA (one patient at 250 mg and four patients at 500 mg), and five patients (14.3%) had a best response of stable disease (duration, 2.5 to 16.8 months). No significant effect on the rate of increase in PSA was seen. The most common drug-related nonhematologic toxicities observed were grade 1 to 2 diarrhea (250 mg, 65%; 500 mg, 56%), fatigue (250 mg, 29%; 500 mg, 33%), and grade 1 to 2 skin rash (250 mg, 24%; 500 mg, 39%). FACT-P scores decreased during treatment, indicating worsening of symptoms compared with baseline.
sion
nib did not result in any responses in PSA or objective measurable disease at either dose level. Gefitinib has minimal single-agent activity in HRPC.

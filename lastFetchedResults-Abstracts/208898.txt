In the new approaches to agricultural extension, extension workers play a major role in
transferring knowledge and technologies from research stations to farmers. This role is highlighted
when it comes to participatory extension approach which is to empower farmers through building
their capacities. In such an approach, extension workers play different roles out of which facilitation
is highly important. Keeping this in view, the main objective of this research was to analyze
participation areas of state and local extension workers in extension activities of the national
extension system of the country. This was a correlational-descriptive study conducted through
survey method. The population of the study consisted of about 7000 state extension workers and
7100 local extension workers out of which 140 and 120 samples were selected by using Cochran
Formula. Multi-stage sampling technique including both simple and cluster random techniques were
applied in the study. panel of experts' judgment. The reliability of the tool of the study was proved
byCronbach Alpha as it was above 0.75 for main scales of the questionnaire. The results offactor
analysis indicated thatfour factors viz., individual and group education of farmers, context analysis
and provision of educational opportunities, distribution of agricultural inputs and production as well
as distribution of extension-education materials accounted for 64 per cent of variation of state
extension workers. With respect to local extension workers, four factors namely: context analysis,
provision and expansion of educational opportunities; distribution of farming and form related
inputs; mutual relationship with research centers and executive offices and close contact with
progressive farmers accounted for 70 percent of variation in the respondents' pattern of participation
in extension activities.

The objective of this study was developing a simple mechanistic model lor bambara groundnut to predict crop performance at both potential and water limited conditions. An agrometerological model "BAMunt" driven by solar radiation, temperature, rainfall and atmospheric humidity was developed to simulate the growth and development of the bambara groundnut: at a range of locations. When water is not limiting, BAMunt predicts light-limited growth as a result of intercepted radiation and conversion of radiation into dry matter. A separate module calculates the depth of the root front and the extractable water amount to predict water-limited growth. Our results show that the model predictions arc reasonably close for both light and water Limited production. In most cases, simulated pod yield was similar to observed yield which ranged from 2.6 to 28.4 gm Similar results obtained in comparison between observed and simulated shoot weight with range of 78.8 to 535.8 gm-2. The reasonable agreement obtained showed that the model could be a good starting point to provide a generic model for a range of underutilized crops.

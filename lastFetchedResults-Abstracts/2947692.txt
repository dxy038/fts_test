The objective of this study is to determine if ill-shaped tetrahedral elements can be used to reduce the mesh size in a 3D finite element (FEM) bidomain simulation of cardiac transmembrane potential (TMP) induced by a uniform field. The myocardium of the heart is modeled as a spherical shell. The curved and branching cardiac fibers are represented by anisotropic conductivity tensors with realistic intra and extracellular conductivity values. The TMP induced by a uniform electric field is simulated using a 3D FEM bidomain model. Ill shaped tetrahedral elements are utilized in the model to reduce the mesh size. The mesh has a high spatial sampling rate along the radial direction of the myocardium but low sampling rates on the other two directions (&#952;, &#966;). The simulation shows that the FEM result has an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of less than 4% and a correlation coefficient (CCF) of 1.000 compared to an analytic solution. The use of such ill-shaped elements reduces the myocardial mesh size by a factor of approximately 10<sup>3</sup> compared to the mesh size constructed by using well shaped elements. These results suggest that it is feasible to use ill-shaped elements to simulate the cardiac TMP arising from a uniform field. The approach greatly reduces the mesh size which in turn reduces the memory and computational cost tremendously

This paper investigates passivity-based visual feedback pose regulation whose objective is to control a vision camera pose so that it reaches a desired configuration relative to a moving target object. For this purpose, we present a novel visual feedback control structure including a vision-based observer called visual motion observer under the assumption that a pattern of the target motion is available for control. We first focus on evolution of the orientation part and the resulting estimation/control error system is proved to be passive from observer/control input to the estimation/control error output. Accordingly, we also prove that the control objective is achieved by just closing the loop. We then prove convergence of the remaining part of the error system associated with position. Finally, the effectiveness of the present control structure is demonstrated through simulations.

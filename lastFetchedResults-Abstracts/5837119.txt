The main objective of the current paper is to design and validate a sub sate observer which can communicate the health status of the stitching needle to the stitch controller in right time without any false alert signal using Microcontroller and CPLD interfacing. This has been achieved through a design methodology of a fault aware controller which can interact with a stitch controller for automatic decorative cricket ball stitching machine. The reason behind this is it cannot recognize a `degraded state´- in proper time before turned in to a bad state. Thus it necessary to convert it to a grey scale with proper truth value. In order to impose this aspect - health is estimated by its `duration of work´ - which measured and associated with a degraded state in terms of a specific time duration. The novelty of the paper is that to overcome the Microcontroller based high speed state estimation and observer design by this CPLD.

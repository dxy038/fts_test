In this paper, experimental results for a singularity-free control algorithm capable of adapting for unknown control direction is presented. Specifically, the adaptive control design is implemented on a simple DC motor/inertial load system where the influence of the voltage control input is uncertain. Specifically, the controller is not sure whether a positive/negative torque is produced when a positive command voltage is applied. As a result, the armature winding connections can be reversed and the rotor velocity control objective tracking can still be achieved without additional hardware modification.

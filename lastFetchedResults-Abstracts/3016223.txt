Time reversal operator (TRO) decompositions are performed in a wave-guide using different kinds of bottom. The purchase objective is to study the effects of bottom reverberation and absorption by mean of ultrasonic experiments. Amplitude compensation is proposed to improve the resolution of the system and signal to noise ratio at the target. Time dependent reverberation eigenvectors are back propagated in the medium and the conditions of focus on the bottom are discussed. A 3D-TRO is also constructed using an original array configuration which takes huge advantage of the multipath propagation in the wave-guide and allows selective multi target 3D-detection. The results could be used to increase echo levels in shallow water active detection or mine countermeasures.

The PMSM servo system of Rockwell lab is considered as the objective to be studied in this paper. First, the composition, communication and configuration of the servo system are introduced. And the SERCOS network employs the master station/slave station means of communication, in which the servo module and the driver are regarded as the master station and the slave station of network, respectively. Then, based on the PMSM mathematical model, the vector control strategy for the PMSM servo system is studied in this paper. The vector control for the AC motor results in the decoupling of the control for the torque and the flux. By controlling the two components i<sub>d</sub> and i<sub>q</sub> of d and q axles, respectively, we can keep the control state no matter for steady state and for transient state. So, the vector control strategy proposed in this paper obtains not only good steady performance but also good dynamic performance.

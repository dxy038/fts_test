Abstract
Background: The main objective of the study was the assessment of the prevalence and the identification of
species of human gastrointestinal parasites as an indicator of the pollution of the seashore of Gaza City.
Methods: The investigation was conducted by analysis of the parasitic contamination of seawater along the study
area. A total of 52 samples of seawater were analyzed during the summer period; from June to October 2011. The
study area was divided into six zones (A, B, C, D, E and F) according to specific criteria such as the presence of the
wastewater discharge points and other geographical characteristics.
Results: The results show that about 48% of the seawater samples from the shoreline region of Gaza City were
contaminated with parasites. Zones A, B and D (mouth of Wadi Gaza, Al Sheikh Ejleen discharge and Al Shalehat
discharge points respectively) have the highest level of parasitic contamination, while, zones C and E (From Al-Baydar
restaurant to Khalel Alwazer Mosque and the basin of the Gaza marina respectively) had a lower level of contamination
and zone F (From the northern part of the Gaza marina to the Intelligence Building) was uncontaminated. The parasitic
species found were: Ascaris lumbricoides, Giardia lamblia, Strongyloides stercoralis, Hymenolepis nana, Entamoeba
histolytica/dispar and Cryptosporidium parvum.
Conclusions: The present study revealed a high level of contamination with parasites at most of the points which
were investigated along the Gaza City coast line.

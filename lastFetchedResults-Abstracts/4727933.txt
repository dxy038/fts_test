A new controller-design framework for cooperating manipulators is considered in this paper based on a reliable controller design concept. The objective of this paper is to derive a set of controllers for cooperating manipulation especially which can hand over an object. The key idea is to reformulate the original problem of coordinated control as reliable stabilization problem; i.e., to design a set of controllers which can stabilize a plant both jointly and alone. By introducing a kind of strict force control scheme in the workspace, the reliably stabilizing controller design technique is applied to derive the controllers. Two contributions are existing: (i) clarifying a class of the object which can be handed over at least by using the proposed control scheme and (ii) presenting a constructive design method of the controllers. Experimental results on the hand-over control of a 2D inverted pendulum with two 6-DOF manipulators are included

This paper presents a novel power control strategy for a hybrid power supply system consisting of wind-driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and energy storage device. In this study, a single leg multi-mode power converter, which includes a boost and bidirectional converters to control power flows between energy sources and loads, has been used as a dc/dc converter. This converter has cost effectiveness and fault tolerance features with respect to fewer switches. In order to ensure optimal power flow between energy sources and loads, a novel power control algorithm has been developed. This power control algorithm operates based on input energy from wind turbine, battery state of charge (SOC), and load condition. The proposed system is implemented with Matlab &amp; Simulink software and to verify the performances of the proposed power management control strategy, several simulation studies are performed under different operation conditions. The results show that the proposed system is feasible and applicable.

Continuous data acquisition from current meters and other sensors deployed in the surf zone makes special demands on the capabilities of systems. This paper describes a new system that allows continuous digital recording of data at 10 Hz, with the simultaneous processing of the data to estimate statistical moments. This new design uses a real-time multitasking operating system in a client-server model to achieve the objective of continuous operation while maintaining a robust distributed system. This paper explores some of the alternatives and then details the hardware and software design of the new system. Data collected during the Duck94 field experiment are presented as examples of the capabilities of the new system

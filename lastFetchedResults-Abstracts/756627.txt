Background
Left ventricular hypertrophy is an important predictor of cardiovascular risk and its detection contributes to risk stratification. However, echocardiography is not a routine procedure and electrocardiography (ECG) underestimates its prevalence.
Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy in low and medium risk non-treated hypertensive subjects, in order to find out the percentage of them who would be reclassified as high risk patients.
Methods

Cross-sectional, multicenter study was performed in hospital located hypertension units. An echocardiogram was performed in 197 previously untreated hypertensive patients, > 18 years, classified as having low (61%) or medium (39%) risk, according to the OMS/ISH classification. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy was considered if left ventricular mass index was ≥ 134 or 110 gr/m2 in men and women, respectively (Devereux criteria). A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Results

The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was 23.9% (95% CI : 17.9–29.9), 25.6% in men and 22.6% in women. In the low risk group its prevalence was 20.7% and in medium risk group 29.5%. Factors associated to left ventricular hypertrophy were: years since the diagnosis of hypertension, OR : 1.1 (95% CI : 1.003–1.227); systolic blood pressure, OR : 1.08 (95% CI : 1.029–1.138); diastolic blood pressure, OR : 0.9 (95% CI : 0.882–0.991); and family history of cardiovascular disease, OR : 4.3 (95% CI : 1.52–12.18).
Conclusions

These findings underline the importance of performing an echocardiogram in low and high risk untreated hypertensive patients in which treatment would otherwise be delayed for even one year.

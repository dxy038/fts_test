Mobile Cloud Computing enables execution of compute-intensive mobile applications by leveraging the services of the cloud. In spite of enabling compute-intensive mobile application execution on resources constrained Smart Mobile Devices, the execution in MCC is not able to carry out without disruption; which degrades the end user experience, hence, deteriorates the usability of emerging applications. The state-of-the-art solutions focus only on the mobile application execution in MCC but do not incorporate all diverse features of the heterogeneous environment to make the execution seamless for the end user. Seamless refers to uninterrupted application execution in MCC with minimal user involvement and interaction to deliver enhanced performance, compared to the local application execution. In this paper, we propose Multi-Objective Optimization model for seamless execution of distributed applications in mobile cloud computing that optimizes the execution time subject to execution cost and energy consumption. The problem is formulated as nonlinear integer programming.

In the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP), a fleet of vehicles is available to serve a set of customers with known demand. Each customer is visited by exactly one vehicle as well as the objective is to minimize the total distance or the total charge incurred. Recent years have seen increased attention on VRP integrated with additional loading constraints, known as 2L-CVRP or 3L-CVRP. In this paper we present a survey of the state-of-the-art on 2L-CVRP/3L-CVRP.

The main objective of this paper is to illustrate the current state of the art of the newborn smart gas grid concept. We provide a detailed discussion of the envisaged features of the smart gas grid, giving attention to both the related academic literature and to the ongoing world-wide projects. In doing so, we also discuss the potentialities of rethinking the smart grid paradigm from the perspective of a whole energy system, that both encompasses the electrical and the gas grid, and identify some critical key aspects that must be handled while developing the new smart energy paradigm.

Objective: The present study aimed to review the relapse rate in patients with schizophrenia treated with
orally taken atypical agents (serotonin dopamine antagonists, SDAs) and depot preparation of conventional
(typical) antipsychotics.
Methods: In this historical cohort study, mean relapse per month (MRM) index, duration between initiation
of antipsychotic treatment and the first relapse episode, and the time gap between successive relapses were
compared between 84 patients on SDAs-except clozapine (group 1) and 81 others on depot typical antipsychotics
(group 2).
Results: The two groups were comparable regarding mean (±SD) MRM index [0.033 (±0.004) in group1 and
0.044 (±0.05) in group 2; p = 0.345]. Mean (±SD) duration of time between initiation of maintenance treatment
and the first relapse was 15.5 (±13.67) months in group 1 and 16.40 (±15.31) months in group 2, (p = 0.876).
Mean (±SD) duration of remission periods between successive relapses were 17.92 (±14.2) and 15.8 (±16.9)
months for group 1 and group 2, respectively (Mann-Whitney test, (p = 0.048).
Conclusion: Orally taken atypical antipsychotics were able to keep the duration of remission periods
between successive relapses more prolonged compared to depot conventional preparations. This could be added
to their other remarkable benefits especially if the patient is expected to experience multiple relapses.

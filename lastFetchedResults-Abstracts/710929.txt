Hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinism have both been suggested as etiologic factors behind functional ovarian hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovary syndrome. Females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia provide a clinical model to evaluate the contribution of pre- and post-natal hyperandrogenism on ovarian structure and function.
Study Objective
To evaluate glucose tolerance, and structure and androgen production of the ovaries in young females with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
Design, Setting, Participants
Cross-sectional study, including the enrollment of participants, ages 8 to 20 years, recruited from the pediatric endocrinology clinical program of a tertiary pediatric referral center.
Interventions
Ten participants had oral glucose tolerance testing, adrenal and ovarian androgen measurements, and pelvic ultrasound studies performed.
Main Outcome Measures
Presence of altered response to glucose challenge, ovarian hyperandrogenism, or presence of polycystic ovaries by ultrasound.
Results
Measurements of fasting blood glucose, post-challenge glucose, and insulin resistance were normal in this sample. There was no evidence of ovarian hyperandrogenism after adrenal suppression with dexamethasone. All participants had normal ovarian structure without evidence of polycystic ovaries.
Conclusions
Females with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21-hydroxylase deficiency) and normal glucose tolerance appear to have normal ovarian structure and function during the peripubertal period.

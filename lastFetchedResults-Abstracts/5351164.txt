The specific problems found during the development of integrated manufacturing system components are discussed, and some principles for their design are presented. The object-oriented approach, which has the qualities of simplification and abstraction necessary for large reusable manufacturing systems, is considered. The methodÂ´s advantages for overall system-structure design and basic software component development are highlighted. The case of a numerical-control programming module is taken as an example. Also presented is a flexible workshop simulator that drives a computerized workshop scale model whose main objective is the modeling of distributed flexible manufacturing-control systems

This paper presents an optimal capacitor placement method which employs simplified power flow formulations, genetic algorithms and sensitivity factors for a given load pattern. In the method, capacitor placement is applied to correct voltage deviation and reduce power loss. The capacitor placement problem is a combinatorial optimization problem having an objective function composed of power losses and capacitor installation costs subject to bus voltage constraints, which is commonly solved by employing mathematical programming methods. The proposed approach is demonstrated by employing an application example. Computational results show that the proposed method is simple and effective.

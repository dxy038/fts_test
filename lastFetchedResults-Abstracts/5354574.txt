The electrical performance (such as electrical resistance, inductance and fusing current capability) is a key factor for a power electronic product. Studying the impact of the defect on package electrical performance, especially for the parasitic effect is very important. It can help to understand the potential root causes and failure mechanisms, as well as to ensure the electrical performance meets the product requirements by optimizing the package design and assembly process. The objective of this paper is to study the impact of wire bonding-related defects and the die attach solder voids for the electrical resistance, inductance and fusing current capability of the power packages. The major work in this paper consists of two parts. One is the impact of wire bonding-related defects on the electrical performance of the power package. The other is the impact of die attach (DA) solder void. Both electrical and coupled thermal electrical simulations are conducted to study the wire bonding-related defects and DA solder voids of different levels. Simulation results show that the resistance and inductance of the package are not sensitive to the wire bond defects. However, the wire bond defects may induce significant impact on the fusing current capability of the package. For die attach voids, the inductance of the package seems not sensitive to the die attach voids while the electrical resistance has been affected significantly.

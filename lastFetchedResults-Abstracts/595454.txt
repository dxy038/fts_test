Objective: To determine the prevalence of hyperlipidemia in obese and non-obese patients with diagnosed coronary artery disease. Methodology: This hospital based descriptive study was conducted in Cardiology Department of Postgraduate Medical Institute, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from 15th March 2005 to 30th May 2006. A total of 200 patients with diagnosed coronary artery disease were enrolled, 100 were classified as obese and 100 as non-obese. Results: There were 139 males and 61 females in total 200 CAD patients. Serum triglycerides level was 184±82 in obese patients and 158±68 in non-obese patients (p = 0.015). Serum cholesterol level was 208±61 in obese and 180±67 in non obese (p = 0.001). Serum HDL level was significantly more in non obese (48±36) as compared to obese (37±8) (p =0.005). Serum LDL was more (157±49) in obese as compared to (148±44) in non obese but with no statistical difference (p =0.156). Conclusion: Obese CAD patients had significantly had higher levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol with lower HDL levels as compared to non obese CAD patients.

The flow of saturated liquid helium at 4.2 K was studied in a unique weir flowmeter mounted inside a duct. The objective was to develop a calibration for helium flow rate in the weir, and thereby, making it a viable flowmeter. The weir flowmeter was tested in a liquid helium system at Fermi National Laboratory used for cooling the superconducting magnets in the experimental areas of the site. Unlike for open channel weir devices, the calibration of this flowmeter was influenced by both the liquid flow through the weir notch and the vapor flow over it. The results of this study and the calibration are presented taking into account effects of both liquid and vapor.

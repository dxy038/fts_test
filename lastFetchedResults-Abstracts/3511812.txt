The problem of power control and signature sequence adaptation in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems is studied under a game-theoretic framework. Each user tries to maximize his own utility function, which may be different from others. Sufficient conditions for the existence of an equilibrium point in this multi-objective optimization problem are identified. The methodology for analyzing this class of problems is illustrated by examples.

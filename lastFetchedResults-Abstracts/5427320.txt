The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of noises and disturbances related to the power quality on power line communication (PLC) systems installed in residential environments. The motivation for the approach of the present study stems from the verification, in several experiences previously conducted, of frequent changes in data transmission rates for those systems when installed to the residential consumer distribution network. For this analysis, an objective methodology was developed to assess the performance of the PLC system, and to record the disturbances present in the network. This methodology allowed the comparison between the noise present in the lines, and the changes in PLC system performance over a given period of time. The potential sources of interference problems were identified, and the mitigation techniques that guarantee a good performance for the system.

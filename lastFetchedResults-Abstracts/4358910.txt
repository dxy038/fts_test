The objective of this paper is to study the scheduling problem of batch systems with a cyclic feeding policy. The proposed approach is based on the formal representation of the system constraints by using a p-time t-timed Petri net model. A token player algorithm with an intelligent backtrack mechanism is then used to compute a feasible schedule consistent with the set of constraints

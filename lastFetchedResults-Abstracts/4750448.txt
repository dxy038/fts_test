In this paper, it is used analytical and measurement tools in order to compare five different indoor path loss propagation models: one-slope; dual-slope; partitioned; Cost-231 multi-wall model and average walls. The main objective is to use the receive signal strength indicator (RSSI) in order to set a simple and fast procedure, taking into account accuracy, complexity and scalability, to estimate the coverage of IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs). We have concluded that the average walls model propitiate a better path loss prediction among the selected models.

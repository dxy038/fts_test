This paper proposes a work selection methodology to the medium-voltage distribution system aiming to adequate the reliability continuity indexes DEC and FEC (it corresponds to the English abbreviations SAIDI and SAIFI, respectively) to the limits defined by the Brazilian regulatory agency. This mathematical methodology is based on the optimization program and the works selection problem will be modeled and simulated using bilevel programming. To a example simulation will be used part of COPEL (Parana utility company) works programming. The simulations results have shown that the methodology main objective which was to take the greatest number of sets off transgression, was reached faster and with less budget when the methodology and mathematical methods described in this paper were used.

The overall objective of the project is to screen an efficient adsorbent for adsorption/separation of CO<sub>2</sub> from industries by using a novel adsorbent hollow fiber material. In the design of an adsorption based CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption device, the choice of the adsorbent is the most crucial design consideration. In this paper, several CO<sub>2</sub> selective adsorbents will be trialed and the adsorbent hollow fibers will be prepared and tested in order to optimize robustness/integrity and selectivity. These adsorbent hollow fibers are light, could be as small as 0.5 mm to 3 mm in diameter. It is ideal as fiber cartridges for CO<sub>2</sub> removal from enclosed spaces, because of their small dimension, and the open finger-like structure giving ready diffusion of small CO<sub>2</sub> molecules and the high surface-to-volume ratio that can be achieved (&gt;3000 m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>). The open finger-like structure in the adsorbent hollow fibers provides more accessibility for the adsorbate molecules to reach the adsorption sites and hence gives better kinetic performance. The results show that an adsorbent hollow fiber module has a far sharper breakthrough curves and longer times to breakthrough for CO<sub>2</sub>, than for equivalent beds of pellets, and the 13X hollow fibers have a superior performance for the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> over the other hollow fibers. This means that the adsorbent hollow fibers with the advantages of higher surface-to-volume ratio, low pressure drop and low mass transfer resistance give great potential on CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and further environmental applications.

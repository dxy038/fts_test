Here we address the problem of computing finite size Hausdorff approximations of the Pareto front of four-objective optimization problems by means of evolutionary computing. Since many applications desire an approximation evenly spread along the Pareto front and approximations that are good in the Hausdorff sense are typically evenly spread along the Pareto front we consider three different evolutionary multi-objective algorithms tailored to that purpose, where two of them are based on the Part and Selection Algorithm (PSA). Finally, we present some numerical results indicating the strength of the novel methods.

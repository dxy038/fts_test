A novel approach to HVAC fan machinery fault diagnosis based on combination of artificial neuron network and D-S evidence theory is presented in this paper. Firstly, the system pre-processes the acquisition data from multi sensor, then makes pattern classifies observations based on BP neural network. Secondly, the output values of BPNN are directly taken as the basic probability assignment of the proposition in the frame of discernment. Therefore realizing the objective treatment of the basic probability assignments and avoiding the complexity of constituting the basic probability distribution function. The experiment results demonstrate that the reliability and accuracy to apply the fusion BPNN results with the D-S evidence theory are higher than the independent BPNN diagnosis.

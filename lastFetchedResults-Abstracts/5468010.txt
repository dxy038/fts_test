Most wire communication systems utilize communication lines as power lines. The powered terminal needs to separate ac communication signals and dc supply power in its input part connected to the communication lines. In our communication system, it is preferable that the electronic choke be bidirectional. So, we have already proposed a low-loss electronic choke with small inductors and an amplifier. This circuit can be also used in the powering terminal. The electronic choke has high input impedance against communication signals. The frequency range of acceptable signals is determined mainly by resonance frequency of the inductors. In this paper, a method fitting this frequency range to the communication signal is proposed. To realize this, we introduce an inductor having new structure and external connection. By the effective use of electric coupling and magnetic coupling in windings, input impedance of the electronic choke is increased.

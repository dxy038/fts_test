Verticillium dahliae represents one of the main
limiting factors in olive production in the Mediterranean
countries. Increasing shortage of fresh water
and land, increase the pressure on using alternative
sources of marginal or saline water, and land previously
cropped with V. dahliae host plants. The objective
of the present study was to evaluate the
influence of salinity on V. dahliae expression in olive
stem cuttings. V. dahliae-inoculated cuttings of cvs.
Picual, Frantoio, Mansanillo and Barnea, showed
higher senescence symptoms than their non-inoculated
controls. Colonization levels obtained in cv. Picual
were significantly higher than in cv. Frantoio.
Manzanillo was the most sensitive cultivar to salinity
alone, with significant senescence symptoms in 4 and
6 dS/m NaCl treatments. When cv. Manzanillo was
exposed to both salinity and V. dahliae, significantly
higher senescence symptoms were obtained as compared
with each of them separately. Senescence
symptoms of cv. Picual exposed to V. dahliae, whether
or not in combination with saline solutions,
were significantly higher than those when cuttings
were exposed to a saline solution alone. In cv. Frantoio,
which is more resistant to salinity than the
other cultivars, significantly high senescence symptoms
were observed only in combination of V. dahliae
and high saline concentration (8 dS/m). The fungal
colonization index in cv. Manzanillo in high
salinity (8 dS/m) was significantly higher than in the
treatment without salt. In cv. Barnea, colonization
index in 8 dS/m salinity was significantly higher than
in the 4 dS/m concentration or control (fresh water).
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the interaction
between V. dahliae and saline irrigation in various
cultivars. Thus, stem cuttings could serve as an
effective screening method in breeding olive clones
for V. dahliae resistance, salt tolerance and their
interaction

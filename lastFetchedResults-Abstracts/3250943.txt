Our objective is to build a fully functional remote e-voting system that can be used in local, state and federal elections. We have designed a secure online e-voting system that provides confidentiality, anonymity, integrity, authenticity, auditability and verifiability. Confidentiality prevents anyone else from knowing who has voted for whom except the voters themselves. Anonymity is to prevent the tracking of the votersÂ´ real identities. Authenticity is to ensure that voters are eligible with unidentifiable-untraceable signatures of the real votes. Integrity is to ensure that no one else is able to change the ballot, and to detect the change if it occurs. Auditability makes the election auditable with or without tracing back the true identity of the voters. Finally, verifiability enables the system to verify and count the votes, and to detect any missing or fraudulent votes.

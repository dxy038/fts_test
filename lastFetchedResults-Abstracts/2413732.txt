The objective of this study was to offer an integrated approach to understanding destination loyalty by examining the theoretical and empirical evidence on the causal relationships among destination image, tourist attribute and overall satisfaction, and destination loyalty. A research model was proposed in which seven hypotheses were developed. The empirical data was collected in a major tourism destination in the state of Arkansasâ€”Eureka Springs. A total of 345 questionnaires were returned and the data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results supported the proposed destination loyalty model: (1) destination image directly influenced attribute satisfaction; (2) destination image and attribute satisfaction were both direct antecedents of overall satisfaction; and (3) overall satisfaction and attribute satisfaction in turn had direct and positive impact on destination loyalty. The theoretical and managerial implications were drawn based on the study findings, and recommendations for future researchers were made.

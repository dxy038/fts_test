This paper presents a system that combines mobile services, ubiquitous computing, and augmented reality concepts in order to bring the kind of information-rich environment, which is currently limited to computer screens, to the physical world. This objective is achieved by constructing an architecture based on existing wireless Web application and sensor network technologies. Users of the system as well as objects in the environment are associated with individual sensors. The system collects proximity information between objects and users, which is then used by the Web application server to provide adaptive services. The users then access these location-based services over the wireless network using a standard Web browser on their mobile device, e.g. smart phone. Unlike existing GPS-based solutions, this approach allows for a proximity resolution of approximately one meter inside buildings and rooms. Thus, the augmented objects in the surrounding environment of the users become local hubs of interactive services, creating an information-rich environment that is similar to the one on the Internet. The system presented, which can be built using already existing technologies, has widespread potential applications in, for example, elderly care, education, and commerce.

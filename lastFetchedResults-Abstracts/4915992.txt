In tomorrowÂ´s wireless communications systems it is envisaged that users will be able to roam freely throughout a building while transferring information via a range of electronic technologies. To achieve this objective, knowledge of the indoor propagation environment is required. The effects that floors and walls have on system performance and efficiency are investigated. Comparisons of system performance are made using outage probability and a measure of spectral efficiency. It is shown that floors and walls can obstruct the propagation path of the indoor channel sufficiently to enable efficient system design

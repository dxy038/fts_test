It is known that the design of antenna array configuration is an important issue to the antenna array applications. We present a method to design antenna array configurations for space-time adaptive processing (STAP) applied to mobile communication systems. We first derive an upper bound of the residual error power of STAP systems under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Then, the relationship between the bound and the space-time channel auto- and cross-correlation functions is established. According to this relationship, an objective function under perfect Monte Carlo sampling is proposed, based on which the array configuration that optimizes the performance is thus obtained. Numerical simulation results under a given statistical signal environment show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

In this letter, an alternative method is used to generate the bidirectional soliton solutions of the classical Boussinesq system. We point out that the classical Boussinesq system is gauge equivalent to a member of the AKNS system, give a general formula of the multi-soliton solutions by using Darboux transformation, and present some examples for different cases.

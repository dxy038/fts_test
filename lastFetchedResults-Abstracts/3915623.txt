Currently available microprocessors usually represent the control and processing portion of a small computer. Their implementation as an LSI package represent a viable low-cost alternative to the use of minicomputers in the areas of digital instrumentation and control of data flow. Some existing microprocessor designs are surveyed, the objective being to obtain an understanding of their suitability for the above mentioned applications. A possible design for a statistical analyzer for the measurement of mean and variance in real time is also considered. A different organization of a microprocessor as compared to the existing designs is proposed. This organization considers the control aspects only. Thus it can yield a simple but special purpose microprocessor, when combined with an arithmetic element.

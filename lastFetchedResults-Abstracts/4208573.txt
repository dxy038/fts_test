In order to solve the problem of the communication between PC and grating data acquisition card, the PCI bus interface chip CH365 was proposed to communicate. The parallel interface chip 82C55A can be programmed to solve the bidirectional data transmission. The mode of 2 of 82C55A was analyzed and the interface circuit was given. In software, according to Windows XP operating system environment, the paper introduces the development of WDM mode driver based on DriverStudio3.1 software toolkit. It introduced the grating data collection card driver development process based on PCI bus interface chip CH365. The development method of PCI device drivers with DriverStudio3.1, shorten the development cycle, improved the efficiency of the development the data acquisition card. Test results show that the interface chip CH365 and bidirectional data transmission chip 82C55A realize data communication between grating data acquisition card and PC, the hardware circuit structure is simple, the system is stable and reliable.

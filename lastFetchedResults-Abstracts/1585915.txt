Evaluation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) at the planning level requires the use of appropriate tools that can capture the dynamic and stochastic interactions between demand and supply. The objective of this paper is to present a methodological simulation-based framework for such applications and implement it in the context of dynamic traffic assignment. The framework consists of a mesoscopic supply simulator and a demand simulator that combines OD estimation capabilities with discrete travel behavior models. Simulation-based DTA systems are particularly suited to evaluate a wide range of Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) and Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS). The simulation model performance is illustrated through two large-scale case studies in Irvine, California, and Lower Westchester County, NY.

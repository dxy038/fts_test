Objective (s): Health education campaigns play an important role in improving public’s health. This study aimed to evaluate the Health Citizen’ campaign in Tehran, Iran. The campaign was launched by the Tehran municipality and included health statements on nutrition, physical activity, smoking and risky behaviors using billboards and lasted for a month (January 2016).
Methods: A population-based survey was conducted in Tehran and a random sample of adults living in different districts of Tehran was interviewed using a structured questionnaire. They were asked whether they have seen the campaign or not. Then a number of questions related to the campaign including items on attention, remembering the main idea, relevance, design and place were examined. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the data.
Results: In all 1196 individuals took part in the study (561 female and 615 male). Of these 491 (41%) indicated that they have seen the campaign. Of those who seen the campaign 85% (n = 415) said that they could remember the main idea, and 95% of participants (n = 466) believed that the campaign was informative, convincing (n = 426, 87%), believable (n = 455, 93%), and well done (n = 387, 79%). In addition the data analysis showed that 90% (n = 443) of participants indicated that messages were worth remembering, interesting (n = 437, 89%), and personally relevant (n = 331, 67%). Participants also indicated that the best way for communicating health messages are electronic media (n = 287, 58.5%), and billboards (n = 279, 56.6%).
Conclusion: It seems that communicating health messages via billboards received well by participants and could be repeated in different occasions in order to put health in public’s agenda.

Bidirectional optical transmission using polarised light waves is demonstrated for the first time. Transmission of 100 Mbit/s signals over 13.6 km of polarisation-maintaining fibre occurs simultaneously in both directions at 1.55/&#194;&#191;m. LD transmitters with polarisation-maintaining fibre pigtails, polarisation-maintaining fibre couplers, fibre polarisers and Ge-APD receivers are used.

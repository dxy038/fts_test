The Internet occasionally experiences large disruptions, arising from both natural and manmade disturbances, and it is of significant interest to develop methods for locating within the network the source of a given disruption (i.e., the network element(s) whose perturbation initiated the event). This paper presents a new approach to realizing this logical localization objective. The proposed methodology consists of three steps: 1.) data preprocessing, in which publicly available measurements of Internet activity are acquired, "cleaned", and assembled into a format suitable for computational analysis, 2.) event characterization via tensor factorization-based time series analysis, and 3.) localization of the source of the disruption through graph theoretic analysis. This procedure provides a principled, automated approach to identifying the root causes of network disruptions at "whole-Internet" scale. The considerable potential of the proposed analytic method is illustrated through both computer simulation studies and empirical analysis of a recent, large-scale Internet disruption.

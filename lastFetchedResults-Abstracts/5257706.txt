The history and advantages of EDFAs over other optical amplifiers are discussed. Analysis and optimized designs of EDFAs that overcome the problems faced while amplifying WDM signals consisting of both C and L band signals are presented. Their configurations and operation in overcoming the problems faced by using fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are presented. Parameters and equations along with numerical calculations and simulated results are provided. Comparison is provided based on various aspects. Finally, it is shown that the bidirectional FBG-EDFA configuration offers the best performance in comparison to other designs.

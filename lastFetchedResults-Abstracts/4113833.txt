This paper shows how to reconstruct the original 275-m resolution data of the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument in the 24 spectrodirectional global mode channels that are spatially averaged to 1.1 km on-board the Terra platform, with negligible loss of information relative to images acquired in native-resolution local mode. Standard approaches to improve the spatial resolution of products rely on one (typically panchromatic) high-resolution (HR) image to sharpen multiple spectral images. In the case of the MISR-HR package described here, three of the 12 available HR channels are combined to regenerate each of the 24 reduced-resolution channel to its native resolution. The accurate and rigorously reconstructed spectral bidirectional reflectance data allow sensitive and physically meaningful land surface attributes to be recovered at a spatial resolution appropriate to document the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface and relevant for climate and environment studies. MISR has been in continuous operation since February 2000 and provides global coverage in at most nine days (depending on latitude). This technique allows the generation of quantitative information to monitor change and model ecosystem function virtually anywhere and at any time during the last decade. The potential is demonstrated for a savanna landscape in South Africa.

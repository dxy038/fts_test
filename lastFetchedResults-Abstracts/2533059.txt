Background and Objective: Wheras renal ischemicreperfusion injury increases lipid peroxidation level in the liver tissues, it decreases the antioxidant activity and antioxidant enzymes. Olive leaves are considered as significant sources of bioactive phenolic compounds with superior antioxidant capacity, antiinflammatory and radical scavenging.

Materials and Methods: In this study 50 male rats were allocated randomly to 5 groups: 1) control, 2) 1h I/R, 3) 1h I/ROLE (Olive Leaf Extract), 4) 24h I/R and 5)24hI/ROLE. The animals received 100 mg/kg olive leaf extract in 0.5 ml drinking water using gavage for 28 days in 3and 5 groups before induction of ischemia (1hour). Other animals received 0.5 ml normal saline by gavages. At the end of the reperfusion period (1and 24 hours respectively), the serum level of urea, creatinine and liver enzymes as well as antioxidant enzymes including MDA, SOD and GPX were determined in liver tissue.

Results: MDA level in OLE treated groups decreased significantly compared to ischemicreperfusion groups (p<0.05). In the meantime, it was detected that activity level of SOD and GPX in liver tissue of ischemic groups was significantly lower in  comparison to OLE treated groups (p<0.05).

Conclusion: This study enlightened  that OLE is a protective agent  against renal ischemicreperfusion injury in liver tissue.

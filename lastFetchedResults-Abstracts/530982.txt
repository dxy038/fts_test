Background: Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common and serious diseases resulting from coronary artery occlusion and major reduction in blood flow. Streptokinase as a thrombolytic is considered the first and most important therapeutic intervention for reperfusion following MI in most countries including Iran. Our previous study showed that, the prevalence of high antibody titers against streptokinase was 13.5% in the studied population from Iran, which was 2.5 times more common than data from other studies. Objective: To evaluate anti-streptokinase antibody titers before and immediately after streptokinase administration and its relation to reperfusion therapy success rates. Methods: A total of 200 patients with acute MI was selected. Antibodies against streptokinase were measured before and 2 days after administration of streptokinase. Before streptokinase administration and every hour after streptokinase administration, for 3 consecutive hours, an ECG was taken from each participant and changes were evaluated in relation to antibody levels. Results: Out of 200 patients, 42 (21%) had high levels of antibody titer. Out of these 42 patients, 13 (6.5%) still had measurable levels of anti-streptokinase antibody after streptokinase administration. Conclusion: Our results show the ability of the antistreptokinase antibody to neutralize the effects of streptokinase

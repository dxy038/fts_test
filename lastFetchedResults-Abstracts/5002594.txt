This paper presents an evaluation of the specifications of the QoS policies for trunk interfaces Metro and Core equipment MPLS over ASON. This paper is based in a project named "Prototype for evaluation of the costs and technical benefits in backbone networks with next-generation services based on ASON (Automatic Switched Optical Network)". The first part defines the services provided by service providers, the second part corresponds to a QoS services analysis with service level objective (SLO), then defines the QoS architecture adopted. Finally, this article presents the defined QoS mechanisms.

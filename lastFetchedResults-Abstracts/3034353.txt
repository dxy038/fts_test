The development of hydrocarbon production activities in environmentally sensitive zones is an authentic impulse to generate activities aimed to give a diagnostic of the situation of each operation area and build mechanisms to identify and prevent the potential incidents. A detailed analysis of the precise locations of the pipe crosses with the local hydrographs (rivers, laminar floods, irrigation pipes, etc.) let establish a starting point in the study and design of plans of action referring to the environment protection, natural resources and reengineering of surface installation. Obtaining a framework of general reference for the treatment of the pipes crosses in a formal geographical surround, which also, let establish programs with the objective of avoiding potential incidents or minimize its impact in case it occurs. The resultant cartography and detailed information, that turns out of these programs are a dynamic working tool that can assist significantly to the production management, environment and engineering area establishing the basic parameters in the quantifiers of the changing rate in the infrastructure.

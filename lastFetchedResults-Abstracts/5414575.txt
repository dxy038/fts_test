How to evaluate and forecast sustainable development is one of key subjects for research. The influential factors of sustainable development were selected, which was including environment, economy and society in this paper. BP neural network is used to forecast XiamenÂ´ sustainable development factors. The superiority of neural network makes it well simulate the nonlinear relationship between indexes and avoiding the subjectivity in traditional weight design methods. Furthermore, the evaluation results will be more objective and scientific than before. The experiment of Xiamen shows that the adaptive learning ability of BP neural network could effectively exclude artificial disturbance and objectively evaluate the sustainable development level.

One of the more difficult tasks in the petroleum refining industries that have not been considered largely in the literature is hydrotreating (HDT) of crude oil. The accurate calculations of kinetic models of the relevant reaction scheme are required for obtaining helpful models for HDT reactions, which can be confidently used for reactor design, operating and control. In this work, an optimization technique is employed to evaluate the best kinetic models of a trickle bed reactor (TBR) process utilized for hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodemetallization (HDM) that includes hydrodevanadization (HDV) and hydrodenickelation (HDNi) of crude oil based on pilot plant experiments. The minimization of the sum of the squared errors (SSE) between the experimental and estimated concentrations of nitrogen (N), vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) compounds in the products is used as an objective function in the optimization problem to determine the kinetic parameters.

es of experimental work was conducted in a continuous flow isothermal trickle bed reactor, using crude oil as a feedstock and the commercial cobalt–molybdenum on alumina (Co–Mo/γ-Al2O3) as a catalyst.

e-phase heterogeneous model based on two–film theory is developed to describe the behaviour of crude oil hydroprocessing in a pilot–plant trickle bed reactor (TBR) system. The hydroprocessing reactions have been modelled by power law kinetics with respect to nitrogen, vanadium and nickel compounds, and with respect to hydrogen. In this work, the gPROMS (general PROcess Modelling System) package has been used for modelling, simulation and parameter estimation via optimization. The model simulations results were found to agree well with the experiments carried out in a wide range of the studied operating conditions. The model is employed to predict the concentration profiles of hydrogen, nitrogen, vanadium and nickel along the catalyst bed length in three phases.

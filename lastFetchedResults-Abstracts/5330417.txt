A genetic algorithm with injecting artificial chromosomes was developed for solving the single machine scheduling problems with the objective to minimize the total deviation. Artificial chromosomes are generated according to a probability matrix which was transformed from the gene structure of an elite base. A roulette wheel selection method was applied to generate an artificial chromosome by assigning genes onto each position according to the probability matrix. The higher the probability is, the more possible that the gene will show up in that particular position. By injecting these artificial chromosomes, the genetic algorithm will speed up the convergence of the evolutionary processes. Intensive experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is very encouraging and it can improve the solution quality significantly

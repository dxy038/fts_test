We study the problem of unrelated parallel-machine scheduling with deteriorating maintenance activities.
Each machine has at most one maintenance activity, which can be performed at any time throughout
the planning horizon. The length of the maintenance activity increases linearly with its starting time. The
objective is to minimize the total completion time or the total machine load. We show that both versions
of the problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time.

Background and Objective: Increasing evidence has shown that diabetes induces cognitive dysfunction and impairs learning and memory. Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid and vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant with multiple pharmacological effects on diabetes. Thus, we investigated the effect of Berberine hydrochloride and vitamin E on diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats.
Materials and Methods: 48 male Wistar rats were randomly selected and allocated in 6 control groups: control treated with vitamin E (30mg/kg), diabetic and Berberine-treated diabetic group (100mg/kg), vitamin E-treated diabetic group (30mg/kg) and a diabetic group treated with both vitamin E and Berbrine. Diabetes was induced by STZ administration at dose of 55mg/kg through Intraperitoneal injection route. Berberine hydrochloride and vitamin E were administered per os, respectively at doses of 100 and 30 mg/kg/day 1 week after STZ injection for a period of 6 weeks. Blood samples were taken from the tail vein 1, 3, 5, 7 weeks after STZ injection to measure blood glucose levels. Behavioral tests including spatial recognition and objective recognition were performed at the end of the study.
Results: Diabetic group treated with both drugs demonstrated significant behavioral differences as compared to diabetic, vitamin E-treated diabetic (30mg/kg), and Berberine -treated diabetic (100mg/kg) groups. In the meantime, cognitive test value demonstrated an increase in this group. 
Conclusion: Berberine hydrochloride and vitamin E administration for 6 weeks improve cognitive dysfunction in streptozotocin -induced diabetes in rats.

The inventory control model based on the multi-objective programming of the spare parts is set up. The algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed and improved to solve the inventory control multi-objective programming model. Aiming at the question of the particle that deviates from the solution space and the prematurity problem in the searching course, the regain mechanism and interference mechanism are built up to improve the classical PSO, and the switching mechanism from the Cartesian space to the discrete space of inventory control model is established, and then the optimized solution algorithm based on the improved PSO is presented. At last, the simulation experiments of inventory control are made to validate the multi-objective programming model. It lays the foundation for design and realization of simulation and optimization of inventory control of the spare parts.

Various policies are used for optimum exploitation of water resources. Increasing water productivity in agriculture sector is one of the major goals of these polices. Understanding farmers. risk attitudes and water opportunity cost is needed to achieve these type of objectives. In this study, a multi-objective programming and non inferior set estimation (NISE) technique were used to determine efficient set of objectives including maximizing gross return and minimizing sum absolute deviation of mean season water (ADMSVV). Also, compromise set, opportunity cost of water and the level of farmers' risk aversion were obtained using compromise programming. As a contribution of this paper, a risk aversion coefficient is developed in this study as ADMSW that farmers accept to increase a unit in return, subtracted from one. Results indicated farmers were risk averse and according to the considered risk aversion coefficient, the level of farmers. risk aversion was obtained to be 0.862. Base on the other results, the opportunity cost of water in view of farmers was calculated to be about 7291 thousand Rials. This figure is almost nine times greater than that of the risk takers in efficient set. According to the findings, policies should be offered somehow to direct farmers in understanding real opportunity cost of water in their decisions.

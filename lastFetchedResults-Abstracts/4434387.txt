Although vaccination is still the most cost-effective strategy for tuberculosis control, there is an urgent need for an improved vaccine. Current BCG vaccine lacks efficacy in preventing adult pulmonary tuberculosis, the most prevalent form of the disease. Targeting nasal mucosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection site, will allow a simpler, less prone to risk of infection and more effective immunization against disease. Due to its biodegradable, immunogenic and mucoadhesive properties, chitosan particulate delivery systems can act both as carrier and as adjuvant, improving the elicited immune response. In this study, BCG was encapsulated in alginate and chitosan microparticles, via a mild ionotropic gelation procedure with sodium tripolyphosphate as a counterion. The particulate system developed shows effective modulation of BCG surface physicochemical properties, suitable for mucosal immunization. Intracellular uptake was confirmed by effective transfection of human macrophage cell lines.

Introduction: Indium is used as an element for radio imaging in diagnosis of cancers and also as a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of cancers. It is believed that indium may interfere with iron metabolism and reduce cell growth in cancer tissues.
Objective: Objective of present study was to examine Indium interaction in plasma concentration changes and parameters related to the iron metabolism.
Materials and Methods: Indium as Indium-Chloride was injected (I.P) daily to male rats (2.1 mg/kg for 10 days and 0.35 mg/kg for 30 and 60 days). Animals were anaesthetized and sera were collected at indicated time. Serum iron parameters were determined spectrophotometrically. Transferrin was isolated using immunoaffinity chromatography technique.
Results: Daily administration of Indium (2.1 mg / kg) as Indium Chloride for 10 days reduced serum levels of iron, Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC), Hemoglobin and Hematocrit by 58, 46, 50 and 48 percent respectively. It was suggested that transferrin saturation be reduced by 20 percent. Significant reductions in the aboved parameters were also seen where Indium (0.35 mg 1 kg) was injected daily for 30 and 60 days.
Conclusion: Results obtained from present study indicated that Indium might be able to interfere with iron metabolism. More investigation is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism by which Indium undertakes its role in the cells with intracellular Iron biochemical pathways.

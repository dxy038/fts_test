A number of 6-(2-furyl)-9-(p-methoxybenzyl)purines carrying a variety of substituents in the 2- or 8-position have been synthesized and their ability to inhibit growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro has been determined. It is demonstrated that sterical hindrance in the purine 8-position reduces activity and that C-8 should be unsubstituted. In the purine 2-position small, hydrophobic substituents are beneficial. The electronic properties of the 2-substituents appear to have only a minor influence on bioactivity. The compounds studied exhibit low toxicity toward mammalian cells (VERO cells) and are essentially inactive toward Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The most active and selective antimycobacterial in the series detected to date is the novel 2-methyl-6-furyl-9-(p-methoxybenzyl)purine with MIC = 0.20 μg/mL against M. tuberculosis and IC50 against VERO cells >62.5 μg/mL. Also the novel 2-fluoro analog and the previously known 2-chloro compound, both with MIC = 0.39 μg/mL, are highly interesting drug candidates.

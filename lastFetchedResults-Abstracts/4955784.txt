A procurement negotiation is performed in order to find the solution which satisfies both negotiators´ conditions of their own objectives between two companies. They don´t know the opponent´s conditions mutually and they sometimes appease tactically. A negotiation method has been proposed in which received opponent´s plan is improved to satisfy the conditions of the negotiator´s objective and sent back each other, but it does not have a tactical appeasement function. This paper proposes a function by which the conditions of objective are automatically and gradually relaxed with the negotiator´s knowledge, and the function is incorporated into the existing negotiation method.

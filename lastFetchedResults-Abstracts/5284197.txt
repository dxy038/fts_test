Adaptive modulation techniques in wireless communications are paramount technologies designed to thrive in fading and noisy environments. Methods as such require an accurate estimate of the channel condition at the receiversÂ´ end in order for the transmitter to adapt appropriately. With that in mind, a communication link which changes the degree of modulation scheme according to the estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values is proposed. Hence, the objective of the system is to achieve acceptable quality in a changing communication link. In this paper, spectral efficiency and average bit error rate of the overall system is measured. Monte Carlo simulations of different signals and channel conditions corroborate our analysis and discussion.

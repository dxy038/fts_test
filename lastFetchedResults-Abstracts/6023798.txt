The objective of this paper is to revisit the solving of the second order fuzzy interval equation A.X<sup>2</sup> + B.X = C according to the alpha-cut representation. The proposed general solution is expressed in an analytical compact form which is directly used for deriving the condition of the solution existence. The validity of the proposed method is illustrated by a simulation example

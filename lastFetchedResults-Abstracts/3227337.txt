In this paper, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is designed for an Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) system, so that faster settling to rated voltage is ensured and the instability is avoided. AVR is a closed loop control system compensated with a PID controller. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm, Simplified PSO (MOL) Algorithm, Adaptive PSO (APSO) Algorithm are used to tune the PID controller, to attain an optimal solution. MOL and APSO differ from the basic PSO in the velocity updation formula. MOL has the advantage of easy implementation and APSO has the advantage of faster convergence. Optimal control parameters are obtained by minimizing the objective function ITAE (Integral Time Absolute Error). Simulations are done to show the performance of PID controlled AVR system tuned using PSO, MOL, APSO algorithm and the results are compared. Time domain analysis and stability analysis are done using root locus and bode plots.

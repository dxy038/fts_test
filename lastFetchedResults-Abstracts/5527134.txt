Hardware implementation of data compression algorithms is receiving increasing attention due to exponentially expanding network traffic and digital data storage usage. Among lossless data compression algorithms for hardware implementation, Lempel-Ziv algorithm is one of the most widely used. The main objective of this paper is to enhance the efficiency of systolic-array approach for implementation of Lempel-Ziv algorithm. The proposed implementation is area and speed efficient. The compression rate is increased by more than 40% and the design area is decreased by more than 30%. The effect of the selected bufferÂ´s size on the compression ratio is analyzed. An FPGA implementation of the proposed design is carried out. It verifies that data can be compressed and decompressed on-the-fly.

Objective
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful diagnostic tool for the evaluation
of congenital or acquired brain lesions. But, in all of less than 8-year-old children,
pharmacological agents and procedural sedation should be used to induce
motionless conditions for imaging studies. The purpose of this study was to
compare the efficacy and safety of combination of chloral hydrate-hydroxyzine
(CH+H) and chloral hydrate-midazolam (CH+M) in pediatric MRI sedation.
Materials & Methods
In a parallel single-blinded randomized clinical trial, sixty 1-7-year-old children
who underwent brain MRI, were randomly assigned to receive chloral hydrate
in a minimum dosage of 40 mg/kg in combination with either 2 mg/kg of
hydroxyzine or 0.5 mg/kg of midazolam. The primary outcomes were efficacy
of adequate sedation (Ramsay sedation score of five) and completion of MRI
examination. The secondary outcome was clinical side-effects.
Results
Twenty-eight girls (46.7%) and 32 boys (53.3%) with the mean age of 2.72Â±1.58
years were studied. Adequate sedation and completion of MRI were achieved in
76.7% of CH+H group. Mild and transient clinical side-effects, such as vomiting
of one child in each group and agitation in 2 (6.6 %) children of CH+M group,
were also seen. The adverse events were more frequent in CH+M group.
Conclusion
Combinations of chloral hydrate-hydroxyzine and chloral hydrate-midazolam
were effective in pediatric MRI sedation; however, chloral hydrate-hydroxyzine
was safer.

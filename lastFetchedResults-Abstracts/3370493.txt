The adaptive multiscale moment method (AMMM) is presented for the analysis of scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfectly conducting bodies. This algorithm employs the conventional moment method (MM) using the subsectional triangular patch basis functions and a special matrix transformation, which is derived from solving the Fredholm equation of the first kind by the multiscale technique. This methodology is more suitable for problems where the matrix solution time is much greater than the matrix fill time. The widely used triangular patch vector basis functions developed by Rao et al., (1982), are used for expansion and testing functions in the conventional MM. The objective here is to compress the unknowns in existing MM codes, which solves for the currents crossing the edges of the triangular patch basis functions. By use of a matrix transformation, the currents, source terms, and impedance matrix can be arranged in the form of different scales. From one scale to another scale, the initial guess for the solution can be predicted according to the properties of the multiscale technique. AMMM can reduce automatically the size of the linear equations so as to improve the efficiency of the conventional MM. The basic difference between this methodology and the other wavelet-based techniques that have been presented so far is that we apply the compression not to the impedance matrix but to the solution itself directly in an iterative fashion even though it is an unknown. Two numerical results are presented, which demonstrate that the AMMM is a useful method for analysis of electromagnetic scattering from arbitrary shaped 3D perfectly conducting bodies.

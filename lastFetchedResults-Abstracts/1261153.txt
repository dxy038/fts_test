 Spectrographic analysis of male actorsâ€™ voices showed a cluster, the â€œactorâ€™s formantâ€‌ (AF), which is related to the perception of good and projected voice quality. To date, similar phenomena have not been described in the voices of actresses. Therefore, the objective of the current investigation was to compare actressesâ€™ and nonactressesâ€™ voices through acoustic analysis to verify the existence of the â€œAFâ€‌ cluster or the strategies used to produce the performing voice. Thirty actresses and 30 nonactresses volunteered as subjects in the present study. All subjects read a 40-second text at both habitual and loud levels. Praat (v.5.1) was then used to analyze equivalent sound pressure level (Leq), speaking fundamental frequency (SFF), and in the long-term average spectrum window, the difference between the amplitude level of the fundamental frequency and first formant (L1آ âˆ’آ L0), the spectral tilt (alpha ratio), and the amplitude and frequency of the â€œAFâ€‌ region. Significant differences between the groups, in both levels, were observed for SFF and L1آ âˆ’آ L0, with actresses presenting lower values. There were no significant differences between groups forآ Leq or alpha ratio at either level. There was no evidence of an â€œAFâ€‌ cluster in the actressesâ€™ voices. Voice projection for this group of actresses seemed to be mainly a result of a laryngeal setting instead of vocal tract resonances.

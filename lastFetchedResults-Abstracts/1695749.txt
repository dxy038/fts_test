The objective of the work is to consider the first-order effects of the realistic microstructure morphology in the macroscale modeling of the multiphase Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS). Instead of using constitutive equations at macroscale, the strength–microstructure relationship is studied in the forms of micromechanical and multiscale models that do not make considerable simplifications with regard to the microscale geometry and topology. The trade-off between the higher computational time and the higher accuracy has been offset with a stochastic approach in the construction of the microscale models. The multiphase composite effects of AHSS microstructure is considered in realistic microstructural models that are stochastically built from AHSS micrographs. Computational homogenization routines are used to couple micro and macroscale and resultant stress–strain relations are compared for models built with the simplified and idealized geometries of the microstructure. The results from this study show that using a realistic representation of the microstructure, either for DP or TRIP steel, could improve the accuracy of the predicted stress and strain distribution. The resultant globally averaged effective stress and strain fields from realistic microstructure model were able to accurately capture the onset of the plastic instability in the DP steel. It is shown that the macroscale mechanical behavior is directly affected by the level of complexities in the microscale models. Therefore, greater accuracy could be achieved if these stochastic realistic microstructures are used at the microscale models.

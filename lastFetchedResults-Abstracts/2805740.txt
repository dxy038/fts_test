This paper presents a new control strategy for single-phase bidirectional converters. The converter can be operated as a rectifier, an inverter, and as a static VAR compensator, i.e. four-quadrant of operation. The key of this capability is the current controller of the converter. A new hysteresis current controller is proposed in this paper. The proposed hysteresis current controller can distribute evenly power semiconductor switching stresses without sacrificing the fast response feature and simplicity advantages of conventional hysteresis current controller. The proposed controller has been successfully implemented digitally by using an FPGA board. Experimental results are included to show the validity of the proposed controller.

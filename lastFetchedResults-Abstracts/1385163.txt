This paper presents a study on the optimization of sound transmission loss across anisotropic sandwich beams. It has been found in earlier studies that there is a significant increase in the sound transmission loss for sandwich beams with anisotropic materials compared to those with isotropic ones. The optimization studies presented in this work further validate this concept. The material and geometric properties of the structure are treated as the design variables with the objective to maximize the sound transmission loss across the beam. Appropriate constraints are imposed to maintain material and structural integrity.

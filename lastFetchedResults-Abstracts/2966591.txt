The research objective is to establish a new theoretical foundation for flexible information processing which enables one to treat a variety of information in the real world, in nature, subjected to incompleteness, uncertainty and changeability. For this purpose, it is necessary to expand and generalize the conventional framework of information processing in all aspects of information representation, processing an evaluation. Since flexible information processing intends to expand the abilities of information: processing beyond the conventional limitations, the range of expected application fields is quite wide. Research and development on novel functions for applications should be directed toward investigating elemental novel functions which are essential for realizing the flexible information systems that solve a wide range of real-world problems.

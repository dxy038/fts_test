We consider the problem of passive spread-spectrum steganalysis where the objective is to decide the presence or absence of spread-spectrum hidden data in a given image (a binary hypothesis testing problem). Unlike conventional feature-based approaches, we describe an unsupervised (blind) low-complexity approach based on generalized least-squares principles that may enable rapid high-volume image processing. Extensive experiments on image sets and comparisons with existing steganalysis techniques demonstrate most satisfactory classification performance measured in probability of correct detection versus induced false alarm rate.

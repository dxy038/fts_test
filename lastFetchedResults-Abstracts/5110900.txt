Topcare is a research project of the 5<sup>th</sup> framework program of the European Commission for a user-friendly information society (ist). The overall objective of TOPCARE is to develop technical devices and telecommunication structures and to lay the organisational groundwork for bringing cooperative health care services into the home of patients. Telematic communication technologies and modern vital sign monitoring is applied in order to enhance post-clinical treatment in an out-patient setting, to foster the communication between patient, practitioners and clinics, and to provide electronic assistance in documentation management for improved quality assurance. A telematic homecare platform is being established and evaluated in European co-operative health care environments for home monitoring and treatment of patients needing controlled ventilatory support, infusion therapies and monitored medication adjustment and adherence control when treated with anti-coagulants.

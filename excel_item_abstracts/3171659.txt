Networked impulsive controller is designed for a class of nonlinear singular time-delay system based on data dropouts. First, the mathematic model of nonlinear singular time-delay networked impulsive control system is established. Then, according to the Lyapunov stability theory, the design method of networked impulsive controller is proposed via data dropouts considering the stability of the continuous interval and impulsive instant, respectively. Using the given networked impulsive controller, exponential stability of nonlinear singular time-delay system can be ensured based on packet dropouts. Finally, Lorentz system is illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design methods.

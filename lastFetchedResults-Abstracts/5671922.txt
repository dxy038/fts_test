Aggregation of individual wavelengths into wavebands for their subsequent switching and routing as a single group is an attractive way for scalable and cost-efficient routing in optical networks. Our objective is to minimize the switching cost by employing a waveband hierarchy subject to physical constraints. To that extent, we establish the equivalence between the waveband routing/assignment problem and the logical topology design problem. We provide a general model for logical topology design using an integer linear programming formulation. We propose a heuristic-based algorithm for the case of ring networks and use extensive simulation results to describe the performance of this algorithm towards our general goal of minimizing the switching cost.

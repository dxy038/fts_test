This paper presents a detailed Performance analysis evaluation of a bipolar excitation for supplying a switched reluctance motor (SRM). The proposed method can significantly enhance the performance of the SRM in terms of efficiency and power quality. The bidirectional power converter is well justified by the extent of our improvement in performance of SRM drives, higher torque density, lower core losses. The results show that the THD in bipolar excitation is less than THD in unipolar the THD reduced by 26.77% Which introduce to improve power quality which obtained from the SRM under bipolar excitation technique.

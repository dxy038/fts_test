In this paper, an optimized proportional and derivative (PD) controller is proposed for an active suspension system. A new method to select the derivative gain is presented subject to the error and error derivative values, such that a faster response achieves mentioned to the control signal. The proportional coefficient is tuned to increase the speed of the plant response. To achieve this objective, the control signal is set at maximum level for all error values larger than a pre-specified value. The proportional coefficient is tuned to increase the speed of the plant response. To achieve this objective, the control signal is set at maximum level for all error values larger than a pre-specified value. The derivative portion entered in control signal when the output signal is moved away from setpoint and when the output signal is moved toward the setpoint the derivative portion is eliminated from control signal production. Simplicity of the presented controller and its performance make it a proper technique to control the suspension system. Comparison the results with an optimized fuzzy PID via PSO algorithm show that the proposed controller is more stable and has less damping in response while the system speed is improved.

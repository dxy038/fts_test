Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely used in many applications. Under outdoor surveillance, limited power supply to nodes in WSN systems is usually difficult to maintain operations for a long period of time. Previous studies have indicated that the load-balanced first layer nodes cannot extend the duration of WSN; more energy is consumed when nodesÂ´ loadings are heavy. The objective of this study is to propose a first order load-balanced algorithm with a dynamic modification where remaining energy in the node is taken into account. Using the proposed scheme, the pathway of data transmission depends upon the weight parameters of power consumption of sensor nodes and the remaining energy of the corresponding parent node. Simulation results show that the suggested scheme is able to significantly enhance the WSN lifetime.

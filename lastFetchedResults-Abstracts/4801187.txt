In this paper, we propose an application of interval analysis to the problems of optimal design of high power induction machines. The considered tool proved its usefulness as a decision-support system for design engineers. Interactive algorithm for bi-objective optimization is implemented. Generally, it is suitable for any problems with discrete variables. Interval arithmetic is used for evaluating technical characteristics imposed by the customers in the form of requirements. In addition to that, total costs of machine evaluated by using interval methods. Proposed approach seems to be a powerful tool for aiding to make decisions during design procedures.

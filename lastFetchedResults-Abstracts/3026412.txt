This paper presents a genetic algorithm to seek the optimal solution of the unit maintenance scheduling. For the maintenance scheduling, reliability is as important as cost reduction. Therefore, the objective function of this algorithm considers the effect of reliability as well as economy. This formulation can find a most economic solution under the situation of enough spinning reserve. On the contrast, if the spinning reserve is tight, a compromising solution between reliability and economy can be obtained.

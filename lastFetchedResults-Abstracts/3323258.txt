In this paper, we introduce an approach for distributed nonlinear control of multiple hovercraft-type underactuated vehicles with bounded and unidirectional inputs. First, a bounded nonlinear controller is given for stabilization and tracking of a single vehicle, using a cascade backstepping method. Then, this controller is combined with a distributed gradient-based control for multi-vehicle formation stabilization using formation potential functions previously constructed. The vehicles are used in the Caltech Multi-Vehicle Wireless Testbed (MVWT). We provide simulation and experimental results for stabilization and tracking of a single vehicle, and a simulation of stabilization of a six-vehicle formation, demonstrating that in all cases the control bounds and the control objective are satisfied.

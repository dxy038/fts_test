Introduction: The significance of meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is discussed both in obstetric and pediatric management. The primary concerns regarding MSAF are its significance as a sign of fetal distress and prenatal asphyxia. The objective of our study was to know the incidence and type of MSAF and associated mortality and morbidity in new born infants.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, the statistical population sample included all the 1,353 deliveries carried out at Bessat Hospital in Sanandaj. The collected data was analyzed by SPSS WIN software.
Results: Our study showed that the frequency of MSAF was 11%, of which 88% was thick meconium, 4% was moderate meconium and 7.5% was thin meconium.
According to our results 6.8 % of the population under study had an apgar score of less than 7. Furthermore, our study showed that prenatal mortality was 0.7%; admission to NICU was 9.3%, respiratory distress delivery was 4.7%, preterm delivery was 2% and post term delivery was 6.5%. The rate of cesarean section was 83.3%, of which 14% was due to fetal distress and 75.6% was due to the discharge of meconium.
Conclusion: Prenatal complications during MSAF deliveries are high and the discharge of meconium is still an important risk factor in obstetrics. Therefore, if fetus monitoring facilities are not available, a cesarean section will be done to prevent normal child delivery side effects and to decrease mortality and morbidity rates.

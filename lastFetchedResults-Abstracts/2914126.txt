Presents a direct control scheme for a class of continuous time nonlinear systems that are linear in the control variable. The objective of control is to track a desired reference signal. This type of system is encountered in many applications, e.g. rigid link robot manipulator control. The advantage of restricting attention to these systems is that the control theory of these systems is well developed. The control method proposed here does not assume knowledge of plant nonlinearities

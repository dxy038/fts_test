The paper is concerned with super-resolution angle estimation for two waves received by a linear array antenna divided into four subapertures. A ready for implementation computationally efficient and stable algorithm for this task is derived and presented. This algorithm is based on maximum likelihood estimator and Newton optimization method to find maximum of an objective function.

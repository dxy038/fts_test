The development of the Written-Pole<sup>TM</sup> single-phase motor by the Precise Power Corporation (PPC) is an ongoing Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) project funded through the collaborative efforts of EPRT and participating electric utilities. The objective of this project is to design, test and commercialize a large horsepower single-phase motor in sizes up to 75 horsepower. As a utility member of this collaborative effort, Manitoba Hydro is providing funding for the development work performed by PPC. In addition, Manitoba Hydro is actively participating in laboratory and field testing of prototype motors. The purpose of this testing is to independently verify performance of the Written-Pole<sup>TM</sup> motor and determine its suitability for intended applications in single-phase environments

Objective and design
ies of the submandibular gland, the vestibular folds and the soft palate from 65â€“87 old humans were examined to record the immunohistochemical expression of MUC1 and the simple mucin-type antigens Tn and Sialyl-Tn.
s
e serous acini in the submucosal glands from the larynx and the soft palate expressed MUC1-associated glycans that were not detectable in the serous acini from the submandibular gland. (2) Virtually all the submucosal acini at oral site of the soft palate are mucous, and in contrast to mucous acini in the vestibular folds and submandibular gland, the palatinal acini in the submucosa underneath the oral mucosa showed a well-defined cytoplasmic reaction with anti-MUC1 antibodies as wells as with anti-Tn. (3) Both the mucous acini and the ducts at the oral site of the soft palate showed reaction for Sialyl-Tn while in the vestibular folds and in the submandibular gland expression for this carbohydrate was observed only in the acini. (4) The staining obtained after incubation with the Tn antibodies showed no cross localization with the staining obtained after incubation with an anti-A blood group antibody. (5) All the autopsies showed reaction in the glands after incubation with the MUC1 antibodies while some autopsies reacted with the anti-Tn antibodies and/or with the anti-Sialyl-Tn antibodies and others did not.
sion
cin expression in the acini and ducts from the upper human aerodigestive tract strongly depended on the location of the glandular tissue.

An analysis of the design factors involved in optimizing laser transmitters for SCM video distribution networks is presented. This includes optimization of the erbium-doped amplifier, linearized external modulation, and laser overmodulation to increase the optical loss budget. A full nonlinear distortion spectral analysis is employed to determine the dependence of the optimum optical modulation index on the allowable postamplifier loss. A general optimization procedure has been developed for the fiber amplifier and modulator to maximize the postamplifier loss for a specified CNR objective. Results are presented showing a comparison between the distribution capacity of direct and externally modulated SCM-EDFA systems for VSB-AM and FM-SCM transmission systems

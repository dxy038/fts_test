The frequency temperature behavior and electrical characteristics of a novel G-type quartz crystal resonator, formed by an etching method, are described. An objective of the present research is to provide a miniaturized quartz crystal resonator with a frequency of approximately 1 MHz. A novel shaped G-type portion and supporting portions is proposed, and its resonator frequency constant, frequency temperature behavior, and electrical characteristics are theoretically and experimentally clarified in order to realize a miniaturized quartz crystal resonator with a zero temperature coefficient and good electrical characteristics

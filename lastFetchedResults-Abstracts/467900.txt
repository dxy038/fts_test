OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether water baths during labor are associated with the development of chorioamnionitis or endometritis. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred ten cases of chorioamnionitis or endometritis and 97 controls were identified among singleton term gestations from the University of California at San Francisco perinatal database. Medical record review and patient interviews provided information on membrane rupture, history of bathing during labor, and relaxation and pain relief perceived by patients who experienced water bathing during labor. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant association between water baths during labor and the occurrence of chorioamnionitis or endometritis (odds ratio 0.93 [95% confidence interval 0.53 to 1.63]). CONCLUSIONS: Water baths during labor are not associated with chorioamnionitis or endometritis. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:1215-21.)

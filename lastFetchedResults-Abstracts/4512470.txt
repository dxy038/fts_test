By the cooperative and competitive PSO algorithm, the goal of this study is to provide the cooperative trajectories of multiple UAVs in the three dimensional space. To effectively reduce the dimension of this problem, the optimization process is mainly divided into two substages to reduce the difficulty of selecting the weights of objectives and constraints in the considered objective function. Considering several objectives and constraints, the cooperative trajectories in the first substage are given by the cooperative and competitive PSO algorithm in the two dimensional space. In the second substage, the altitude of cooperative trajectories is adjusted according to the considered objectives and constraints. In the complicated scenarios, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the cooperative and competitive PSO algorithm, which possibly provides one guideline for optimal cooperative planning trajectories of multiple UAVs in the three-dimensional space.

Summary form only given. Optical effects of phase separation in InGaN quantum wells (QWs) such as carrier localization are still open questions although great research efforts has been made recently. To have an insight into such effects in high-quality InGaN QWs, micro-photoluminescence (/spl mu/-PL) intensity imaging technique was employed in this work. The high spatial resolution of 150 nm, which is comparable to or even smaller than that of conventional near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), was achieved by an objective lens using an immersion oil. Such high resolution in optical spectroscopy enables us to spectroscopically probe into phase separation in InGaN QWs and other microscopic optical properties inherent in nitride-semiconductors.

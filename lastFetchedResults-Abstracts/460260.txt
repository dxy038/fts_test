Objective: To report the effectiveness of use of comprehensive infection control measures to reduce the incidence of Clostridium difficile (CD) in an acute-care teaching hospital. Methods: All CD infections were reviewed by the infection control coordinator from 1987 to 1996. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s nosocomial infection definition was used. CD-inclusion criteria remained unchanged during the study period. Interventions were started in 1990. Interventions: The interventions used were: (1) Isolation policy-revision and enforcement, which included universal precautions policy, (2) educational program-monthly to all health care workers, (3) phenolic disinfectant for environmental cleaning, (4) triclosan (0.03%) soap for handwashing, (5) centralization of sterilization department, (6) cart-washer installation, and (7) aggressive surveillance activity. Results: From 1987 to 1989, before the interventions, a total of 466 CD infections (mean 155 per year) occurred. From 1990 to 1996, after the interventions, 475 infections (mean 67 per year) occurred. Incidence of CD decreased by 60% from 1990 to 1996. Conclusion: The sustained decrease of nosocomial CD during the 7-year period demonstrated the effectiveness of aggressive infection control measures that involve multiple disciplines.

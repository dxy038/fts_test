The objective of the paper is to present a statistical model for predicting collision rates of inertial particles immersed in turbulent flow. This model is valid over the entire range of particle inertia (from the zero-inertia to the high-inertia limit) and accounts for two mechanisms influencing the collision rate, namely, the particle relative motion induced by turbulence and the accumulation effect that leads to an additional enhancement to the collision rate. The model is applicable to near-homogeneous two-phase turbulent flows with colliding or coalescing particles.

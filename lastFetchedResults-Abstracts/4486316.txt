During the last 3 years, the French MoD has supported technology developments and/or specific MMICs designs for power amplification from S-band to Ku-band (i.e. 18 GHz), for radar and electronic warfare applications. Our objective in this paper, is to present and analyse the results obtained on three X-band power amplifiers using different GaAs technologies and designs with a view to meeting the same specifications target. To our knowledge, this is the first time a concrete comparison is conducted on three different state-of-the art technologies, simultaneously taking into account, technology, reliability issues and microwave measurements of MMICs.

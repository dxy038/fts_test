To reduce the mechanical cooling energy cost of new housing built in a hot and humid region, the design should maximize the natural ventilation and minimize the fraction of sun energy absorbed by a dwelling. This objective is accomplished by using the roof structure to act as a solar collector. The roof solar collector design (RSC) used CPAC Monier concrete tiles and gypsum board. Two units of RSC were integrated in the roof structure of the school solar house. The effects of air gap and openings of RSC on the induced air flow rate and thermal comfort were studied experimentally.

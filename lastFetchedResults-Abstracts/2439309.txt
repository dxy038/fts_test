The stellarator machine WENDELSTEIN 7-X is in the construction phase at IPP Greifswald, Germany. The elements of the mechanical structure supporting the superconducting coil system are critical components subject to very high forces and moments. The design of such components has been optimised with the objective of minimising the deformations of the coil winding packages and to limit the stresses within acceptable values. An extensive R&amp;D program is in progress to qualify the adopted solution. The paper reports main design features of the support elements of the mechanical structure and the preliminary results of the tests campaign.

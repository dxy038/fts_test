Background & Objective: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in the world among women. Human papilloma virus (HPV) plays a major role in its development. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of HPV type 16 and 18 in cervical discharge by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in women with atypical biopsy or Pap smear.
Materials and Methods: This case- control study was performed on women in Yahyanejad Hospital, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran during 2008-2009. Sixty women with normal Pap smear (group1) and 30 with atypical Pap smear or biopsy (group 2) were enrolled in the study and their cervical discharge was assessed for HPV type 16 and 18. Data were analyzed with SPSS, Chi-Square, Fisher,s Exact test and t-test and P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: HPV type 16 was found in 10% women of group 2 but not seen in group1. HPV 18 was not detected. All women had one partner and none of them had alcohol consumption.
Conclusion: In comparison with other studies, the frequency of HPV infection was lower in our study. We considered this is strongly related to our culture and religious beliefs.

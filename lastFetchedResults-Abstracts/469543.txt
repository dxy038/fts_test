Objective
This study was undertaken to determine the features of an effective computer-based residency curriculum in reproductive endocrinology and infertility.
Study design
A review of the literature to determine those features that have been used by training programs in medicine. Reproductive endocrinology and infertility division directors, current obstetrics and gynecology residents, and obstetrics and gynecology practitioners in the community were surveyed to evaluate critical subjects for study.
Results
Programs most successful in using computers in training health care providers use a case-based approach that prioritizes important subjects. Areas of greatest importance to the 3 groups surveyed include infertility, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and management of the climacteric, and several other areas were also deemed critical.
Conclusion
Benefits of computer-based learning include consistency, the ability to develop problem solving skills for life-long learning, and a self-paced approach, but its validity as a teaching tool will require rigorous appraisal.

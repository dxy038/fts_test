The objective of this paper was to perform an analysis on thermal acceptability in naturally ventilated (NVB) and air-conditioned buildings (ACB) located in hot and humid climates in Brazil. Experiments were carried out in April and November 2005 with 1.301 questionnaires based on ISO 10551:1995(E). Indoor and outdoor climatic variables were monitored simultaneously. The results revealed that 53% of the occupants of NVB and 78% of ACB were thermally satisfied. However, some restrictions were observed with the applications of the following methodologies: ISO/FDIS 7730:2005(E); ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55:2004; Adaptive Temperature Limits (ATG) and prEN15251: 2005(E). Differences were observed between thermal sensation (TSV) and predicted mean vote (PMV) and between the subject's percentages expressing thermal unacceptability of the environment and the PPD calculated according to ISO/FDIS 7730:2005(E).

Moving target detection at low radar frequencies is associated with long integration time and has to handle azimuth focusing for reliable detection. The detection by focusing in which time-domain is the basis for the focusing approach has been proposed and successfully experimented in reality. The main objective of this paper is to apply and evaluate the detection method for frequency-domain algorithms. Range Migration Algorithm (RM) is chosen as a candidate for this study due to the accuracy of the algorithm with very wide integration angles. The simulated SAR data, which is used in this study, is based on the parameters of a airborne UWB low frequency system such as CARABASII.

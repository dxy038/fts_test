The demand for higher power efficiency and bandwidth is increasing as mobile devices keep enhancing its graphic computing and media processing capabilities. Current memory interfaces with single-wire signaling operate at 5Gb/s/pin [1] and 6Gb/s/pin [2] with the power efficiency of 17.4pJ/b/pin and 15.8pJ/b/pin, respectively. Mobile DDR memory I/O with differential signaling has better power efficiency of 6.4pJ/b/pin [3], and so does the prior dual-band interconnect (DBI) [4] with the efficiency of 5pJ/b/pin at 4.2Gb/s/pin for simultaneous bidirectional (SBD) mobile memory I/O interface. However, DBIÂ´s differential signaling is incompatible with existing standards, and it also occupies large die area for using differential transmission lines and an LC-oscillator for generating RF-carrier. To alleviate these concerns, we propose to use a Single-Transmission-Line DBI (STL-DBI) with the best figure-of-merit (FoM) defined as data rate per pin divided by the I/O-interface die area and power consumption.

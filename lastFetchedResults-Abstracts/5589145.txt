This paper investigates the use of a single-phase AC/AC converter with a reduced number of devices. The proposed converter uses a six-switch converter topology to compose the rectifier, at the line side, and the inverter at the load side. The configuration provides bidirectional power flow and power factor control. The PWM technique for the converter control and the implementation of power factor control for the front end rectifier is investigated. Experimental results for the proposed converter are presented

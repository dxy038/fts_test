This paper investigates the control of a HVDC link, fed from an AC source through a controlled rectifier and feeding an AC line through a controlled inverter. The overall objective is to maintain maximum possible link voltage at the inverter while regulating the link current. In this paper the practical feedback design issues are investigated with a view of obtaining simple, robust designs that are easy to evaluate for safety and operability. The investigations are applicable to back-to-back links used for frequency decoupling and to long DC lines. The design issues discussed include: (i) a review of overall system dynamics to establish the time scale of different feedback loops and to highlight feedback design issues; (ii) the concept of using the inverter firing angle control to regulate link current when the rectifier firing angle controller saturates; and (iii) the design issues for the individual controllers including robust design for varying line conditions and the trade-off between controller complexity and the reduction of nonlinearity and disturbance effects

Quantitative analysis using comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) gas chromatography (GC) is still rarely reported. This is largely due to a lack of suitable software. The objective of the present study is to generate quantitative results from a large GC×GC data set, consisting of 32 chromatograms. In this data set, six target components need to be quantified. We compare the results of conventional integration with those obtained using so-called “multiway analysis methods”. With regard to accuracy and precision, integration performs slightly better than Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) analysis. In terms of speed and possibilities for automation, multiway methods in general are far superior to traditional integration.

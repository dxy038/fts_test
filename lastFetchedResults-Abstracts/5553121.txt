Extension of range is a critical factor in ultra wideband (UWB) research as the range is limited in the normal case of wireless personal area networks (WPAN) applications due to the FCC mask and power transmission level constraints. As per the IEEE 802.15.3a technical requirement, the expected range at 200 Mbps is about 4 m. The main objective of the project described in this paper is to demonstrate wireless communication at high data rate, e.g. 200 Mbps, with an enhanced range capability using UWB technology. The key deliverables are FPGA based, multi-band OFDM alliance (MBOA) standard compliant UWB transceiver prototypes - with USB interfaces - capable of high data rate UWB communications among multiple devices. An enhanced range of up to 8 m is demonstrated with a suitable video streaming application.

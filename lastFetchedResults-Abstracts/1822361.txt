Objective
cterium nucleatum is an opportunistic pathogen with a key role in subgingival plaque formation and it is found in increased numbers in periodontally affected sites. This study aimed to investigate the potential of F. nucleatum to penetrate and induce alterations in an in vitro reconstructed human gingival mucosa model.
s
dimensional (3D) organotypic models of human gingiva were engineered using primary gingival keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The reconstructed tissues were challenged with four different strains of fluorescently labelled F. nucleatum in suspension placed on top of epithelial layers. Confocal laser scanning was used to assess the presence of fusobacteria through the organotypic model. Apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) and cell proliferation (Ki-67) were evaluated by the use of immunohistochemistry in 3D-tissue models. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to investigate the mRNA expression for MMP-13 and E-cadherin in both 3D-tissues and monolayers.
s
leatum invaded the superficial epithelial layers of gingival 3D-tissue models. Challenged tissues showed accentuated shedding of superficial layers and increased number of cleaved caspase-3 and Ki-67 positive cells than controls, although not statistically significant. Levels of E-cadherin and MMP-13 mRNA were not significantly perturbed in multilayer culture. A variable and disproportionate response of MMP-13 mRNA level resulted in challenged primary keratinocytes in monolayers, compared to multilayer culture.
sion
results indicate that F. nucleatum is able to invade superficially a differentiated, stratified gingival epithelium in vitro and triggers the efficient elimination of bacterial infection through epithelial shredding without causing a permanent damage of the tissue.

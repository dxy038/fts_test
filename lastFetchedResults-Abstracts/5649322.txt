A SVPWM-DTC strategy to control a single-phase induction motor drive is investigated in this paper. The basic operating principles of DTC and SVPWM are described. The objective is to implement a low-cost solution for low-power applications. As DTC scheme do not require the use of speed or position signal for torque control, this technique is a good solution for single-phase induction motor. In this paper, a dq model for single-phase motors in the stator reference frame is implemented. Simulations were carried out and performance analysis of the scheme is presented.

The objective of the present study was to examine the superficial quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle electromyogram (EMG) during dynamic sub-maximal knee extension exercise between young adult men and women. Thirty subjects completed, in a random order, 2 sub-maximal repetitions of single-leg knee extensions at 20–90% of their one-repetition maximum (1RM). Vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscle integrated EMG (IEMG) during each sub-maximal lift was normalized to the respective 1RM for concentric, isometric and eccentric modes. The EMG median frequency (fmed) was determined over the isometric mode. Men attained a significantly (p<0.05) greater knee angular velocity than the women during the concentric mode (83.6±19.1°/s and 67.4±19.8°/s, respectively). RF IEMG was significantly lesser than the VM (p=0.014) and VL (p<0.001) muscles, when collapsed across all contraction modes, loads, and sex. Overall IEMG was significantly greater during the concentric (p<0.001) and isometric (p<0.001) modes, than the eccentric mode. Men generated significantly (p=0.03) greater VL muscle IEMG than the women, while the opposite pattern emerged for the RF muscle. VM fmed (105.1±11.1 Hz) was significantly lesser than the VL (180.3±19.5 Hz) and RF (127.7±13.9 Hz) muscles across all lifting intensities, while the men (137.7±10.7 Hz) generated greater values than the women (129.0±11.4 Hz). The findings demonstrate a reduction in QF muscle activation across the concentric to eccentric transition, which may be related to the mode-specific velocity pattern.

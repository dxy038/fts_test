Objective: The purpose of this article is to present a case of metastatic malignant melanoma of the ovary, a review of the current literature, and current recommendations for preventative and consultative management. Study Design: This is a case report and literature review. A 34-year-old woman had symptoms of pelvic abscess 1 month after clomiphene citrate stimulation for infertility. After a failed course of antibiotic therapy, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. Bilateral malignant melanomas of the ovary were discovered. The patient died 4 weeks later of disseminated metastases. Retrospectively, a history of a “mole” with unknown histopathologic characteristics had been removed from her arm 15 years earlier. A review of the literature was performed to provide current findings regarding malignant melanomas of the ovary, as well as to evaluate the potential relationship between the use of ovarian stimulating drugs and the development of melanomas. Results: Melanomas account for 3% of cancers, but the incidence of melanoma is rising. Genital melanomas are uncommon; the primary site is the vulva. Primary malignant melanoma of the ovary is rare; however, delayed recurrence from a primary skin site with metastasis to the ovary is documented. The literature suggests a possible relationship between the use of clomiphene citrate and an increase in melanomas of the skin. Conclusion: The gynecologist, as a primary provider, must be aware of the increasing incidence of malignant melanoma, as well as the recommendations for prevention. The gynecologist, as a consultant, must be aware of the risk of delayed recurrence of malignant melanoma. The potential for development of melanomas associated with the use of ovarian stimulation for infertility needs further monitoring and analysis. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:1499-503.)

A new real time power voltage control strategy is proposed in the paper. A novel off-line evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm called jumping genes is used to generate the wide spread control solutions which are readily stored into a knowledge data base. A separate on-line multiple criteria decision making scheme is established for selecting the appropriate control solution. This concept of power voltage control has been demonstrated by a representative 6-buses nonlinear power system model. The system output performance is speedy and accurate.

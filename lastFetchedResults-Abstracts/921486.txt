Objective: The prevalence of obesity is rising in both developed and developing countries. Globally, it is estimated that nearly one billion adults are overweight; at least 300 million of them are clinically obese. In Afghanistan no published data is available regarding non-communicable diseases including obesity. This paper reports the prevalence and associated risk factors of obesity among adult population in Kabul.
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Kabul from December 2011-March 2012. A multistage sampling of districts and neighborhoods was used to enroll adults of ?40 years. Data on socioeconomic status, lifestyle, behavioral factors, blood pressure, and blood sugar were collected and anthropometric measurements were carried out for 1200 inhabitants. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using measured height and weight; a waist circumference of ? 94cm for men and ? 80cm for women were considered as central obesity.
Results: The overall prevalence of obesity was 31.2% (BMI?30kg/m2). Main risk and protective factors independently associated with obesity were age (adjusted OR=0.55, CI: 0.40-0.78), sex (AOR=1.73, CI: 1.19-2.51), having diabetes (AOR=1.86, CI: 1.16-2.99), blood pressure (AOR=1.46, CI: 1.03-2.08), central obesity (AOR=5.29, CI: 3.68-7.60), and frequency of walking per week (AOR=2.08, CI: 1.50-2.89).
Conclusions: About one-third of the adult population aged 40 and above in Kabul city had obesity. It was strongly associated with risk factors for non-communicable diseases. Modification of lifestyle and promotion of physical activity is recommended. Awareness campaigns on prevention of obesity should be considered.

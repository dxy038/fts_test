This paper shows the results obtained in the analysis of the impact of Distributed Generation (DG) on distribution losses and presents a new algorithm to the optimal allocation of distributed generation resources in distribution networks. The optimization is based on a modified discrete particle swarm optimization (MDPSO) aiming to optimal DG allocation in distribution network. Through this algorithm a significant improvement in the optimization goal is achieved. The objective function is tested on a section of Tehran distribution network. With a numerical example the superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in comparison with the discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO).

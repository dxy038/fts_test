Artificial neural network was a information processing paradigm that took a model from the works of biological neural network in processing information hence it would have an ability which seems like human brain. Artificial neural network was able to solve some problems which contain uncertainty inside, which usually only human who could solve it. It was pattern recognition for example. The objective of this research was to find the effectiveness of backpropagation artificial neural network method to recognize human behaviour pattern in paper rock scissor game. The result were: an application using artificial neural network to recognizing human behaviour pattern in paper rock scissor game (1), an effectiveness of backpropagation artificial neural network method to recognize human behaviour pattern in paper rock scissor game (2).

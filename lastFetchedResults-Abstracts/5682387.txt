The objective of this paper is to present a solution to the decentralized estimation and control problem for linear discrete time-varying systems, composed of overlapping sub-systems. The solution is based on the expansion-contraction framework of the Inclusion Principle. It is shown how decentralized estimation and control laws can be independently computed for the expanded system, and then contracted for implementation in the original system to satisfy the overlapping information structure constraint.

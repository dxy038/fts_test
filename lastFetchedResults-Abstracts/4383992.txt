The construction of the JT-60SA tokamak is one of the three projects of the Broader Approach activities being undertaken jointly by Japan and Europe. The construction of the new load assembly and the refurbishment of some reutilized equipment from JT-60U is now well underway, and is on track to produce its first plasma in March 2019. As a satellite tokamak of ITER, and being superconducting, JT-60SA has the objective of supporting ITER in its operation as well as complementing ITER in the definition of the design basis of DEMO, particularly to identify the best ways to extend plasma pulse lengths toward steady state.

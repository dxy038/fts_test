Supply chain network design is one of the most important issues in designing supply chain due to its effect on performance and efficiency of the logistics network. Recently most of the companies take into account the reverse flows, going backward from their customer zones to their remanufacturing centers in designing their supply chain network because of customer service improvement or legislation changes for environmental protection and social requirements. This paper employs an interactive fuzzy goal programming (IFGP) method to solve the fuzzy multi-objective reverse logistics network design problem with fuzzy demand and return-product. This method attempts to minimize the total cost and total transportation time of the system simultaneously. The presented method provides the decision maker with interactive framework that facilitates the process of decision making in fuzzy environment. Moreover this framework enables the decision maker to interactively change the fuzzy data in order to reach the most satisfactory solutions.

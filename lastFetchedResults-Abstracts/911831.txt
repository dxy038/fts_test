Introduction: There are many factors that affect the ‎severity of dysmenorrhea. The objective of the present ‎article is to investigate the relationship of body image ‎and coping styles with the severity of primary ‎dysmenorrhea.‎
‎ Materials and Methods: This descriptive-correlational ‎study begun in November 2010 and ended in December ‎‎2011. 254 Islamic Azad University students were ‎selected through stratified random sampling method and ‎filled in three questionnaires including Andersh and ‎Milsom dysmenorrhea severity determination ‎questionnaire, Fischer's body image questionnaire and ‎Lazarus-Folkman coping styles questionnaire. To ‎analyze the data, SPSS. 16, Pearson's correlation test, ‎one-way ANOVA and stepwise regression analysis were ‎applied.‎
‎ Results: Significant relationship was observed between ‎primary dysmenorrhea and body image (P‏?‏‎0.01) and ‎coping styles (problem-based P‏?‏‎0.01 and emotional-‎based (P‏?‏‎0.05). The same was observed between ‎primary dysmenorrhea and all components of body ‎image (P‏?‏‎0.01). Body image components can predict the ‎severity of dysmenorrhea. There were also significant ‎relationship between dysmenorrhea and some ‎components of coping styles such as programmed ‎problem-solving (P‏?‏‎0.01), seeking social support (P‏?‏‎ ‎‎0.05), self-restraint (P‏?‏‎0.05), problem reassessment (P‏?‏‎ ‎‎0.05) and responsibility (P‏?‏‎0.05). Programmed problem-‎solving component can predict the severity of ‎dysmenorrhea.‎
‎ Conclusion: Two psychological factors of body image ‎and coping styles are related to the primary ‎dysmenorrhea and need to be paid more attention in ‎management and control of primary dysmenorrhea.‎

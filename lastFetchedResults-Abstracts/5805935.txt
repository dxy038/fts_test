This paper discusses how internet services can be brought one step closer to the rural dispersed communities by improving wireless broadband communications in those areas. To accomplish this objective we describe the use of an innovative Multi-User-Single-Antenna for MIMO (MUSA-MIMO) technology using the spectrum currently allocated to analogue TV. MUSA-MIMO technology can be considered as a special case of MIMO technology, which is beneficial when provisioning reliable and high-speed communication channels. This paper describes channel modelling techniques to characterise the MUSA-MIMO system allowing an effective deployment of this technology. Particularly, it describes the development of a novel MUSA-MIMO channel model that takes into account temporal variations in the rural wireless environment. This can be considered as a novel approach tailor-maid to rural Australia for provisioning efficient wireless broadband communications.

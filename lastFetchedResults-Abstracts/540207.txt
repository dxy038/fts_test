Declining soil fertility is recognized as one of the major biophysical constraints affecting agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa. “Improved fallows” technology, a leguminous trees-based soil replenishment technology was introduced in smallholder farming system in Tanzania to address this problem. The objective of this study was to identify the factors that influence the adoption of the technology among smallholder farmers in western Tanzania. The results revealed that lack of farmer awareness of the technology, inability of farmers to wait for two years before obtaining direct benefits from the technology were the major constraints to planting improved fallows. The study identifies farmer training through workshops and seminars, enforcement of village by-laws on animal grazing, and facilitation of farmers’ access to credit as the major approaches to enhance the adoption of the technology.

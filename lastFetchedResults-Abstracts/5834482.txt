The main objective of the paper is to introduce a vision based measurement concept for acquiring 3D shapes of various complexity in real-time, especially 3D shapes of deformed objects. Creating 3D models of real objects plays an important role in several application domains like deformation analysis, medicine, manufacturing, etc. The proposed concept enables to acquire objects of various materials, which can contain many overlapped parts. The measurement of such surfaces usually is not a trivial task.

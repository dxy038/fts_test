We study a single batch machine on-line scheduling problem with delivery times, which is related to processing times. Once the processing of a job is completed it is delivered to the destination, the objective is to minimize the time by which all jobs have been delivered. For each job J<inf>j</inf>, its arrival time, processing time and delivery time are denoted by r<inf>j</inf>, p<inf>j</inf> and q<inf>j</inf>, respectively. Two variants are considered: 1) p<inf>j</inf>&#8805; &#946;q<inf>j</inf>, we provide an optimal on-line algorithm with competitive ratio (&#8730;5+1)/2; 2) q<inf>j</inf>= &#946;q<inf>j</inf>, we provide an on-line algorithm with competitive ratio(&#8730;&#946;<sup>2</sup>+2&#946;+5&#8722;&#946;+1)/2, and give a lower bound (&#8730;&#946;+5)/(&#946;+1)+1)/2.

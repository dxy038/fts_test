The DoD high level architecture (HLA) has been designed with the objective to promote interoperability and reuse among heterogenous and interactive simulation systems, including those distributed simulations that offer varied levels of resolution and therefore provide practical training to personnel of different ranks and expertises. In this paper, we focus upon the aggregation/disaggregation (A/D) paradigm to ensure consistency in state updates between federates simulating objects at various levels of resolution, and enhance the performance of the data distribution management (DDM) in large-scale distributed simulation. We also examine the scalability of an aggregation/disaggregation scheme for several DDM implementations and study its performance evaluation using an extensive set of simulation experiments.

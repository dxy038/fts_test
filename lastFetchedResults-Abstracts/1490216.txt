This paper proposes a method to establish a proper values range of each characteristic dimension of shells, to make the work easier for the designers. To obtain them, a technique that minimises bending has been employed. With this aim a parameter, termed volumetric flexure, which takes into account the difference between the main stresses produced on each face of the shell, is introduced as the objective function. At the same time, with the purpose of minimising displacement, another objective function, termed volumetric displacement, has been defined. It considers the displacements produced throughout the structures, not simply the highest ones, as is usual practice. The approximation technique used to calculate the bendings and/or displacements, which are needed to evaluate the objective function, was the finite elements method.

ustrate the validity of the presented method, this procedure was applied to the structural elements of a hyperbolic-parabolic shell of straight edges. This geometry has been chosen because of its extended use, and enables comparision with the results found by other authors and the design recomendations traditionally adopted.

timisation methodology of shapes proposed, involving bendings or displacement minimisation, can be a valuable tool for the designer of structural surfaces that require to take special care of stresses, strains or displacements.

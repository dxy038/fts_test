The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of surgical menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the new biochemical markers of bone turnover. Fourteen women who had undergone surgical menopause and began HRT 3 months after surgery were recruited for a 1-year study. Results were compared with a control group of 31 healthy premenopausal women of similar age. Serum samples were obtained to determine total alkaline phosphatase, bone alkaline phosphatase, propeptides carboxy- and amino-terminal of type I procollagen (PICP, PINP), osteocalcin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and carboxy-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (ICTP and serum CTX). Urine samples were analyzed for hydroxyproline, pyridinoline, deoxypyridinoline, α- and β-carboxy-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (α-CTX and β-CTX), and amino-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX). Determinations were performed after 3 months of surgical menopause and after 3 and 9 months of HRT. All biochemical markers increased after menopause, and most of them normalized after 9 months of HRT. Serum PINP showed the highest proportion of increased values after surgery among bone formation markers (62%), as well as the highest mean percent increase (101%). Among bone resorption markers in postmenopausal women, urinary β-CTX, α-CTX, NTX, and serum CTX showed the highest proportion of increased values (100%, 67%, 58%, 58%, respectively) as well as the greatest mean percent increase. They were also the markers with the most marked response to HRT. In conclusion, serum PINP is the most sensitive marker of bone formation, whereas β-CTX is the most sensitive marker of bone resorption after surgical menopause. In addition, both markers showed the highest response after HRT.

The interface between a solid modeler and a robot vision system dealing with 3-D scenes is considered. The general requirements needed by a vision system of a link with a geometric modeler are outlined. An outline of a robot vision system integrated with a solid modeler in conjunction with an example using a real image is described. This integration involves a bidirectional online interaction between a commercially available solid modeler and the robot vision system

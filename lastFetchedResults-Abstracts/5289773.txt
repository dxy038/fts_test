This paper presents the modeling and control of a nonlinear coupled three tank system (CTTS). In this work, nonlinear state space dynamics of CTTS are derived. The objective is to control the level and temperature of water in each tank. The control is achieved using classical nonlinear feedback linearization technique. Input and output scaling is done according to the interface with a standard PLC. Design steps of nonlinear control and input/output responses are shown.

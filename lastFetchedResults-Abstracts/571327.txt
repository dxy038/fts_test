Introduction & Objective: Joint position sense is impaired after Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tearing. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of reconstruction surgery on position sense in patients with A.C.l tear 
Materials & Methods: This study was Quasi- experimental and the patients were selected in a nonprobability sampling manner. 30 patients with ACL tear, with mean age of 26.52Â±8.72 years old were recruited. The patients were 16 males and 14 females. Two centered Electrogoniometer were used to test the position sense as a dependent variable. The data were analyzed with Paired T-Test, ICC, SEM and K-S tests. 
Results: The difference of the position sense before and after the reconstruction surgery on the impaired ligament was significant (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Reconstruction surgery in patients with ACL tear at acute phase was effective in improvement of joint positional sense.

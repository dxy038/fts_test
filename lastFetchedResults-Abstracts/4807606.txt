The goal of this paper is to describe the objective, the pre-requisites, the methodology and the evaluation process of a Multiplier Formation Program (MFP) for the AulaNet "Learning-Doing: New Pedagogical Practices using an Environment of Distance Education via Web". AulaNet is a collaborative and learning environment based on Web that has been developed at the Laboratory of Software Engineering in PUC-Rio since 1997. This Formation Program was realized in Brazil in 2005 (periods: March-June and September-December) and has already prepared forty four K12 teachers from many Brazilian states as AulaNet\Â´s multipliers. The main results observed were the change of attitude of the participants in relation to ICT (information and communication technologies) as the methodology adopted which allows activities that stimulate the "Make-Learning". This fact is representing a great innovation, since the teachers can work with their students using a new pedagogical tool. The success reached by this experiment in Brazil is making possible the first English edition of this Formation Program that will be offered to K12 teachers from Kidlink Institute of Research, in the period March-June of 2006. Kidlink is a non-commercial, user-owned organization and a knowledge network which is run by 500 teachers and volunteers in over 50 countries and helps students at school through secondary school. In the paper are described in detail: the AulaNet environment, the methodology that will be used in the English version of the MFP, some results that have been obtained with the implementation of the MFP in Brazil and the conclusions.


Abstract
Background: Moderate keratoconus reduces visual acuity which is not corrected by glasses. In these situations, the administration of rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses may increase the visual acuity. The aim of this study was to determine the prognosis of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in keratoconus patients according to the correlation between aberrations changes and visual changes before and after RGP lenses.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study a total of 40 eyes of twenty patients aged 20-40 years with mild to moderate keratoconus were participated. Ocular examinations included visual acuity with standard Snellen chart, contrast sensitivity with CSV 1000 chart and HOAs with technolas aberrometer objective (Bush & Luamb). All these tests were performed before and after fitting RGP lenses. Data were analyzed with SPSS software. 
Results: Mean contrast sensitivity at each spatial frequency with RGP lenses was higher than the best correction. Mean high order aberration of the 5 and 6 mm pupil was reduced with RGP lenses compared to condition without lens. Mean high order aberration with pupil 6 mm was more than pupil 5 mm. Also there was no significant correlation between visual change and contrast sensitivity changes with high order aberrations. 
Conclusion: Visual performances and visual acuity were improved with RGP lens more than best correction by reduction of high-order aberrations. However, there was no correlation between high order aberrations and visual performance.

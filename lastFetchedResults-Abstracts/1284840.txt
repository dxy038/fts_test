Recent identification of the sterol 14-α demethylase genes (CYP51 A and B) from Aspergillus fumigatus and other species by Mellado et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001, 39(7), 2431–2438), has opened up possibilities of investigating the interactions of azole antifungals with the enzyme(s) from fungi. This study describes for the first time, a model of the three-dimensional structure of A. fumigatus 14-α demethylase (AF-CYP51A), using the crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 14-α demethylase (PDB code:1EA1) as a template. The paper also describes the various interactions between azole antifungals and the target from A. fumigatus (AF-CYP51A). Quantitative evaluation of these interactions is done using COMBINE analysis to understand contributions of active site residues to ligand activity. It also provides explanation for the activity/inactivity of different ligands for AF-CYP51A.

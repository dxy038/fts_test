Mobility models allow to mimic the behavior of mobile nodes when MANET performances are evaluated via simulations. Nevertheless, simulations results are strongly correlated with the mobility model. In this work, we introduce new metrics in order to characterize any mobility model. These metrics reflect the nodes distribution, the local topology changes, the repetitive behavior of a model, etc. They allow in consequence to characterize mobility models, and particularly to introduce a taxonomy based on objective and quantitative criteria. Using these metrics, we characterize some individual and one group mobility models.

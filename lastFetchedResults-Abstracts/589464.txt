Objective: A review of background and the mode of formations, models, developmental stages and scientific application of information epidemiology theory.
Methodology: Literature review
Findings:  The present study indicated that the theory can trace the rise and decline of a school of thought through time. By combining Goffman and Newillâ€™s mathematical model with ISI based analyses,  it  is possible to predict the outbreak of a research topic, duration of its outbreak, number of individuals affected and  when to establish the communication facilities for scientific exchange.

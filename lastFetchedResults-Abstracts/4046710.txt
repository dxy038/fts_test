A novel method based on genetic algorithm is proposed to find the location, the operating point as well as the number of multi-type FACTS devices in the restructured environments simultaneously and optimally. This method comprises two separate algorithms and takes the advantages of a proposed heuristic search manner, which can decrease considerably the feasible search space. A desirability criterion is proposed to evaluate the suitability of the results. The objective function of the combinatorial optimisation problem is designed such that the nodal prices along with their standard deviation are decreased effectively. A new model, average-neural lossy model is used for FACTS devices, STATCOM and SSSC, which takes the converter power losses into account and thus produces the required PQ-phasor to evaluate STATCOM and SSSC in steady-state situation. The proposed method is appropriate for medium and large-scale systems and its effectiveness is demonstrated by the test results.

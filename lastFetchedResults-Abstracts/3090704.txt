A bidirectional front-end converter for a battery powered switched-reluctance motor (SRM) drive is developed in this paper. It can be operated as a DC/DC boost converter to power the SRM with boostable DC-link voltage. A robust speed controller is proposed to yield improved speed control response. In addition, the proposed SRM converter can recover the demagnetized winding energy to the battery. In idle condition, the proposed front-end converter is arranged to act as a buck-type switch-mode rectifier (SMR) battery charger. Four diodes of SRM converter and the two motor windings are used to form the input stage of the SMR.

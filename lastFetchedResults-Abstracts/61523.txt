Three-phase AC-DC converters have been developed to a matured level with improved power quality in terms of powerfactor correction, reduced total harmonic distortion at input AC mains, and regulated DC output in buck, boost, buck-boost, multilevel, and multipulse modes with unidirectional and bidirectional power flow. This paper presents an exhaustive review of three-phase improved power quality AC-DC converters (IPQCs) configurations, control strategies, selection of components, comparative factors, recent trends, their suitability, and selection for specific applications. It is aimed at presenting a state of the art on the IPQC technology to researchers, designers, and application engineers dealing with threephase AC-DC converters. A classified list of around 450 research articles on IPQCs is also appended for a quick reference.

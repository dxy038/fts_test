The objective of this research is to design a new JPEG-based compression scheme which simultaneously considers the security issue. Our method starts from dividing image into non-overlapping blocks with size 8&#215;8. Among these blocks, some are used as reference blocks and the rest are used as query blocks. A query block is the combination of the residual and the resultant of a filtered reference block. We put our emphasis on how to estimate an appropriate filter and then use it as part of a secret key. With both reference blocks and the residuals of query blocks, one is able to encode secured images using a correct secret key. The experiment results will demonstrate that how different secret keys can control the quality of restored image based on the priority of authority.

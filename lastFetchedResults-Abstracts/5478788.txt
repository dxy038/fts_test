Reliability-based robust design optimization (RBRDO) is one of the most essential tools developed in recent years to improve the quality and reliability of the products at an early design stage. This paper presents a comparative study of different formulation approaches of RBRDO models and their performances. The paper also proposes an evolutionary multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to one of the promising hybrid quality loss functions (HQLF)-based RBRDO model. The enhanced effectiveness of the RBRDO model is demonstrated by optimizing suitable example.

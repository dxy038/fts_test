This work describes a microfluidic device integrated with multichamber polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multichannel separation for parallel genetic analysis. The microdevice consists of three functional units: temperature control, multiple PCR (four chambers PCR), and multiple channel separation (four separation channels, each channel connected to a PCR chamber). Platinum (Pt)/titanium (Ti) microheater was used to ensure homogeneous temperature field, and Pt-chip sensor was used for temperature monitoring. The interface between chip-PCR and chip separation was simplified by connecting the PCR chamber with separation channel directly. After chip-PCR, PCR products were introduced into parallel separation channels for subsequent separation/detection by applying an electric field automatically. This microdevice was successfully applied for detection of pathogens including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and genotyping of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 as well, demonstrating the feasibility of the integrated microdevice for parallel genetic analysis.

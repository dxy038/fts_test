We show that many open and challenging problems in control theory belong to the class of concave minimization programs. More precisely, these problems can be recast as the minimization of a concave objective function over convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. In this setting, these problems can then be efficiently handled using local and/or global optimization techniques

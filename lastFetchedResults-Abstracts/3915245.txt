In this paper, we have three goals: the first is to delineate the advantages of a variably delayed system, the second is to find a more intuitive Lyapunov function for a delayed neural network, and the third is to design a delayed neural network for a quadratic cost function. For delayed neural networks, most researchers construct a Lyapunov function based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. However, that approach is not intuitive. We provide a alternative candidate Lyapunov function for a delayed neural network. On the other hand, if we are first given a quadratic cost function, we can construct a delayed neural network by suitably dividing the second-order term into two parts: a self-feedback connection weight and a delayed connection weight. To demonstrate the advantage of a variably delayed neural network, we propose a transiently chaotic neural network with variable delay and show numerically that the model should possess a better searching ability than Chen-Aihara´s model, Wang´s model, and Zhao´s model. We discuss both the chaotic and the convergent phases. During the chaotic phase, we simply present bifurcation diagrams for a single neuron with a constant delay and with a variable delay. We show that the variably delayed model possesses the stochastic property and chaotic wandering. During the convergent phase, we not only provide a novel Lyapunov function for neural networks with a delay (the Lyapunov function is independent of the LMI approach) but also establish a correlation between the Lyapunov function for a delayed neural network and an objective function for the traveling salesman problem.

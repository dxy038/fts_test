Background and Objective: Cool temperature dialysate has been recommended to improve hypotension during dialysis. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of lowering the dialysate temperature on intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and some interventions in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD).
Material and Methods: This randomized controlled trial with a cross over design was conducted on 50 patients divided into two equal groups. Each group was dialyzed for two periods of 12 HD sessions, once with standard temperature (37°C) and in the next period with cool dialysate (35.5°C). Blood pressure and   the related interventions were noted during each dialysis.  The Data was analyzed using Chi-square, McNemar, Independent and Paired T Tests.
Results:  Overall, the frequency of hypotension in routine method was 18% and in cool dialysis was 5%. It means that hypotention in cool dialysis is significantly less than that of routin method (P < 0.004). Furthermore, the mean of hypotension related interventions in both groups was also significant (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Owing to the effect of cool dialysate temperature on stabilizing hemodynamic parameters, we recommend using this method during hemodialysis in hypotensive patients.

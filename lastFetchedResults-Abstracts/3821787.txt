A 1.5%-&#916; silica directional coupler-type wavelength-division multiplexer dividing 1310/1550-nm wavelength bands was used to develop a bidirectional optical transceiver module. The active devices such as a spot-size converted Fabry-Pe&#180;rot laser diode and waveguide photodetectors were hybridly integrated on a silica-terraced planar lightwave circuit platform. As main performances of the module, the clear eye pattern and the minimum receiver sensitivity of -25.5 dBm were obtained under the full duplex operation at 1.25 Gb/s without a severe power penalty.

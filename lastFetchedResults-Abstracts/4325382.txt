A new neural fuzzy combiner (NFC) is proposed to solve multi-objective control of missile. The proposed NFC can combine n existing controllers in a hierarchical way to form a multi-objective fuzzy controller. It is assumed that each controller (fuzzy controller) has been designed to reach a particular objective. The method in this paper is an expert knowledge based hierarchical control method. Finally the numerical simulation results demonstrate the NFC can simultaneously finish the task of controlling multi-objective.

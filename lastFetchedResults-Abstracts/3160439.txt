We considered the problem of customer orders scheduling in a set of parallel batching processors with the objective of minimizing total weighted tardiness. We provided three simple intuitive heuristics to batch the customer orders. The simulation results revealed that the split-merge heuristic can minimize the total weighted tardiness, especially in the case of high customer demand variation and tight due date.

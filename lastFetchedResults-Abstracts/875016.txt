This paper is concerned with an asymptotic analysis of hierarchical production
planning in a stochastic manufacturing system consisting of machines that are
subject to breakdown and repair. The system produces a single product whose rate
of demand over time is constant. The problem is formulated as a continuous-time
dynamic programming problem in which the objective is to minimize the cost of
production, inventories, and backlogs. The size of the buffer between the two
adjacent machines is assumed to have lower and upper bound constraints. As the
rates of change of the machine states approach infinity, the analysis results in a
limiting problem in which the stochastic machine availability is replaced by its
equilibrium mean availability. The value function for the original problem converges
to the value function of the limiting problem. A method of ‘‘shrinking,’’
‘‘total lifting,’’ and ‘‘modification’’ is introduced in order to construct near-optimal
controls for the original problem by using near-optimal controls of the limiting
problem. The convergence rate of the value function for the original problem to

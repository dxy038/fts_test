Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is the most common ligamentous injury of knee in athletes. This is often accompanied with meniscal tear. In recent years, there had been more
tendency towards ACL reconstruction, even in cases of irreparable menisci. The study of patients who have had combined ACL and meniscus injury and have not had ligament reconstruction is warranted.
Materials and Methods: 46 patients who had sustained both meniscus and ACL tears, and had been only treated by meniscectomy were studied with an average follow up of 10 years. The Lysholm Tenger and IKDC systems were used for asssessment. Results: At the end of this intermediate-term follow up the Lysholm score was 84. The average Tenger activity level of 7.24 pre-injury had fallen to 4.71 in the last visit, the subjective IKDC scores was
73.5 on average. The objective IKDC score was D (severely abnormal) in 67%, C (abnormal) in 28% , B (near normal) in 4%. No one had A (normal) score. In spite of increased activity level post meniscectomy no patient experienced increased instability subjectively in presence, the patients did not have any major complaint and were happy with their knee.
Conclusion: The knee with meniscectomy in presence of ACL tear did not have good functional outcome scores. The exision of torn part of meniscus, however, did not seem to increase the instability
symptoms. The patients who can modify their sport activities and do not experience "giving way" symptoms would do well for at least 10 years without need for ligament reconstruction. We still recommend ACL reconstruction in those with irreparable meniscus tear, with uncontrollable giving way, or those who do not want to modify their activity level.

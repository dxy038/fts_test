Information is one of the most important inputs for the activities in the transportation systems. The demands for information can be derived from the functions. Since modelling and analysis of particularly complex systems requires different techniques depending on the application purposes new methods have been introduced by us in order to facilitate the integration intentions. Our objective was to determine exact methods, which are applicable in the practice. The most important models have been adapted for the road transportation, because this mode has lags and here operates the most organizations.

Local performance optimization for joint limit avoidance and manipulability maximization is presented using the Jacobian matrix pseudoinverse and objective function gradient projection into the Jacobian null space. Real-time performance optimization is achieved for a member of the class of 8-joint redundant manipulators having a 3-axis spherical shoulder, a single elbow joint, and a 4-axis spherical wrist. Symbolic solutions are used for both full and partitioned Jacobian matrix pseudoinverses and objective function gradients. Results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the performance optimization. A kinematic limitation of this class of manipulators and its effect on redundancy resolution is discussed

The comprehensive utilization hydropower project not only plays a role in power generation and flood control, but also has some benefits in navigation, water supply, irrigation, aquaculture, and tourism. Meanwhile, it greatly influences the basin ecological environment. Firstly, quantitative calculation methods for several types of benefits from hydropower development were proposed. Secondly, the benefit relationship between the hydropower development company and the area influenced by the hydropower station was discussed. Then, a multi-objective evaluation model with incomplete information was built based on comprehensive benefits. Finally, an example was given to demonstrate the rationality on the construction of R station which was built in some river of southwestern China. It is shown that the proposed approach is an effective method for the feasibility study and benefits evaluation of the hydropower station.

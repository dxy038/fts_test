Reduced-reference systems can predict in real-time the perceived quality of images for digital broadcasting, only requiring that a limited set of features, extracted from the original undistorted signals, is transmitted together with the image data. This paper uses descriptors based on the color correlogram, analyzing the alterations in the color distribution of an image as a consequence of the occurrence of distortions, for the reduced reference data. The processing architecture relies on a double layer at the receiver end. The first layer identifies the kind of distortion that may affect the received signal. The second layer deploys a dedicated prediction module for each type of distortion; every predictor yields an objective quality score, thus completing the estimation process. Computational-intelligence models are used extensively to support both layers with empirical training. The double-layer architecture implements a general purpose image quality assessment system, not being tied up to specific distortions and, at the same time, it allows us to benefit from the accuracy of specific, distortion-targeted metrics. Experimental results based on subjective quality data confirm the general validity of the approach.

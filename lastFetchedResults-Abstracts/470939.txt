Objective
The objective of the study was to revisit the anatomical path of the tension-free vaginal tape and better describe its relationship to the perineal membrane and other important anatomic landmarks.
Study design
Dissections of the anterior perineal triangle, periurethral, and retropubic spaces were performed in 24 unembalmed female cadavers following placement of the tension-free vaginal tape to identify the sling's relationship to the perineal membrane, periurethral muscles, and the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis.
Results
In 100% of specimens, the device passed cephalad to the perineal membrane. The urethrovaginal sphincter muscle was perforated in 2 of the specimens. The sling passed lateral to the arcus tendineus and perforated the pubococcygeus muscle in 6 (25%) of the cadavers. In the remaining 18 (75%) specimens, the mesh was medial to the arcus tendineus and penetrated the periurethral connective tissue.
Conclusion
The assertion that the tension-free vaginal tape perforates the perineal membrane is incorrect.

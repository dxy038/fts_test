Based on previous research, there are about 5% of the population in Thailand who have learning disabilities. Therefore assistive technology will be a tool to help improve or change the ability of students with learning disabilities. Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Institute in Thailand suggests that technology to support students with learning disabilities in Thailand is still limited. Hence, the institute has agreed to set up a project to help students with learning disabilities. The main objective of the project is to conduct research and develop assistive technology for students with learning disabilities. The project has successful on developing software programs such as Thai word prediction program and Thai word search program to enhance students with learning disabilities in their writing. However, not only the writing skill of the students with learning disabilities in Thailand is the problem but they also have the problem in mathematics. Therefore in this paper, the researcher will propose a new way of learning and understanding math for students with dyscalculia in Thailand. The results showed that Calculating Aid Tools: KidKanit helps improve basic calculation of students with dyscalculia in this study 35%, 55%, 50% 55% and 50% respectively. Additionally results indicated that Calculating Aid Tools: KidKanit helps the students with dyscalculia in math problems 60%, 40%, 66.70%. 53.30% and 53.30% respectively.

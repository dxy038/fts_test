The objective of much recent work in the telecommunications community has been the formulation of a suitable architecture for the support of advanced multimedia services. An important focus of this work has been the definition of appropriate modularity, layering, and partition of functionality in order to provide an open and maintainable infrastructure. A step toward the formulation of a general fault-tolerance approach for use in such a context is described. The philosophy underlying this fault-tolerance, work is overall system stability, not necessarily the perfect handling of every call. A resource recovery method is presented. This method enables the system to regain the control of lost physical resources

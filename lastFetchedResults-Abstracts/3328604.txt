Automated face recognition is a rapidly growing field that uses computer algorithms to determine the similarity between two face images. One of the major challenges in face recognitions to extract features from face images varying in facial expression, varying in lighting condition and varying in poses. The objective of this paper is to present the recognition of face images based on Gabor wavelets. Performance comparison of recognizing face images taken under varying facial expressions, varying lighting condition and varying poses are presented. Experimental results of Gabor wavelets for face recognition under varying lighting, poses and expression conditions are provided. For experiments face images from the three datasets (ORL, Yale and FERET) are used.

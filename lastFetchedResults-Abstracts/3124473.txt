The paper deals with the real time optimal voltage control integrated into contemporary Distribution Management Systems. The voltage profile of the entire distribution network is the optimization objective. Tap changer positions of all remotely controlled under load tap changing transformers are control variables. The optimization procedure is based on the results of the real time distribution state estimation running. The quality of the developed voltage control is quantified with the sum of squares of the deviations of voltages on low voltage busbars of the network distribution transformers. The presented results prove that this quality is significantly better than the quality of the network voltage profiles achieved by the application of the classic voltage control. The results are verified in several real-life distribution networks. The paper offers the results of the voltage control verification in the distribution network of the city of Sombor, the branch of the Electric Power Distribution Utility Elektrovojvodina, Novi Sad, Serbia.

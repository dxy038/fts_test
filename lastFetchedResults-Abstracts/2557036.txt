Objective: Dermal papilla and hair epithelial stem cells regulate hair formation and
the growth cycle. Damage to or loss of these cells can cause hair loss. Although
several studies claim to reconstitute hairs using rodent cells in an animal model,
additional research is needed to develop a stable human hair follicle reconstitution
protocol. In this study, we have evaluated hair induction by injecting adult cultured
human dermal papilla cells and a mixture of hair epithelial and dermal papilla cells in
a mouse model.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, discarded human scalp skins were
used to obtain dermal papilla and hair epithelial cells. After separation, cells were cultured
and assessed for their characteristics. We randomly allocated 15 C57BL/6 nude mice into
three groups that received injections in their dorsal skin. The first group received cultured
dermal papilla cells, the second group received a mixture of cultured epithelial and dermal
papilla cells, and the third group (control) received a placebo [phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS-)].
Results: Histopathologic examination of the injection sites showed evidence of hair
growth in samples that received cells compared with the control group. However, the
group that received epithelial and dermal papilla cells had visible evidence of hair growth.
PKH tracing confirmed the presence of transplanted cells in the new hair.
Conclusion: Our data showed that injection of a combination of adult human cultured
dermal papilla and epithelial cells could induce hair growth in nude mice. This study emphasized
that the combination of human adult cultured dermal papilla and epithelial cells
could induce new hair in nude mice.

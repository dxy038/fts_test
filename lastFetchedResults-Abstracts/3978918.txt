In the paper the fuzzy logic based multi-criteria protective relay for a three-phase power transformer is presented. Twelve criteria used to stabilize the relay are introduced and integrated by means of multi-objective decision-making methods. The introduced protection scheme contains several internal functions and coefficients which are subject to off-line pre-installation self-setting. Three unique procedures are delivered for self-adjusting the relay, and thus, making it self-organized. The results of testing show significant gains in both sensitivity and selectivity of the self-organized relay compared with traditional approaches

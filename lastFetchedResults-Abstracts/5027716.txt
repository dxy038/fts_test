In this paper, we report upon the prototype development of a wrist-worn integrated biosignal measurement system-WIBMS-with a wireless-transferring function. The functional objective of the WIBMS is to provide information concerning clinical state, such as vital signals and motional information in activity, to experts at a distance. Thereby, the unit provides the facility for rapid and appropriate directions to be given by experts in emergency situations, and enables the user or the supervisor to manage changes in health condition with helpful treatment.

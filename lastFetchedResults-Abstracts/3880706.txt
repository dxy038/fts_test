In order to realize long amplifier spacing, long-distance soliton transmission, dispersion-allocated fiber was optimized. Dispersion-decreasing-allocated fiber is favorable to transmit stable solitons over long distances. Fiber loss plays an important role in stable soliton transmission with the dispersion-allocated fibers. In order to realize soliton bidirectional transmission, symmetrical configuration of the dispersion-allocated fiber within an amplifier spacing must be designed, so the dispersion-decreasing-allocated fiber is not favorable to soliton bidirectional transmission.

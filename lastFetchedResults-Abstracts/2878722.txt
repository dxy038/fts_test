Learning vocabulary is a very important part of learning a new language. It is vitally important for beginners and children to learn the keywords needed to understand what they hear and read, and to express their own ideas. Despite this importance, vocabulary acquisition stills the hardest part of the language and faces the problem of low motivation of learners. One of the effective ways of raising motivation and increase learnersÂ´ desire to learn is to use learning games. This paper describes a learning version of memory match game specifically designed for second language acquisition. The objective of this learning game is to render the learning experience with more fun, to engage learners and to keep them motivated.

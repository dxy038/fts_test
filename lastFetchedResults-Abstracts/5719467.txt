Since today´s complex digital systems and circuits are difficult to design, optimize, implement and verify, decomposition methods and tools have attracted great interest recently. The objective of the new decomposition method presented in this paper is to implement a complex Boolean function or an assigned sequential machine with a minimal number of constrained building blocks and minimal connections between the blocks. The method aims in solving problems with hard constraints in multiple dimensions for which, to the authors´ knowledge, no solution has yet been published. It differs substantially from the methods for solving similar simpler one-dimensional problems. The method is very general and, after some small changes, it can be applied to many other partitioning problems. The experimental results show that the method is very efficient

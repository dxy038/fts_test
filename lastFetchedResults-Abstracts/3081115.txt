A psychophysical method combining two-interval-forced-choice (2IFC) protocol with up-down-transformed rule (UDTR) is used to study a noise-controlled technique based on stochastic resonance phenomenon. The technique is investigated by the experiments that employed a semi-automation setup producing quantitative vibration outputs added external electrical noise different from vibration stimulus. The results indicate that a certain quantity of electrical noise can induce non-monotone change of the threshold of vibration touch of subjects, which suggest occurrence of stochastic resonance. Combination of 2IFC protocol and UDTR can greatly remove subjectsÂ´ psychological influences and guarantee the experimental method to be objective

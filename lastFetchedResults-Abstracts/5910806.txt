In this paper, a novel FCM-based target recognition algorithm is proposed. The algorithm used color and texture characteristics of each frame of video in the time domain modeling, the use of the video frame sequence of images to enhance the relationship between the space division of the accuracy of the classification algorithm to achieve through the MAP, in order to achieve in complex cases, the background video to identify the precise objective of the human body. In complex multi-objective circumstances, the algorithm can get better classification than the cumulative background subtraction as well as the segmentation approach Gaussian Mixture Model.

Current and emerging applications involving spaceborne and ground antennas in civil and military systems have recently generated renewed interest in phased arrays based on non-regular lattices or overlapped subarrays. The objective of this special section is to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in this field, highlighting the latest developments and innovations, and proposing new applications, solutions, and challenges for the future. This Special Section will be published in the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation. Manuscripts should therefore conform to the requirements for regular papers of this Transactions as specified in the information for Authors in the inside back cover of a recent issue or on the web site (http://ieeeaps.org/aps trans/index.htm). Potential contributors may contact one of the Guest Editors by email (with the contact information provided below) to determine the suitability of their contribution to the special issue. All papers must be submitted online through the AP Transactions Manuscript Central web site (http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tap-ieee). When submitting the paper, authors should (1) choose "Special Issue Paper" as the manuscript type and (2) include in the cover letter a statement to the Editor-in-Chief that the manuscript is intended for this special section.

Compressed sensing helps in the reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals from small number of measurements. The sparse representation has great importance in modern signal processing. The main objective is to provide a strong understanding of the concept behind the theory of compressed sensing by using the key ideas from linear algebra. In this paper, the concept of compressed sensing is explained through an experiment formulated based on linear programming and solved using l1 magic and One bit compressed sensing methods in Excel.

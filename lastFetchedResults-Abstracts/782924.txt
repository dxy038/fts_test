Objective There are four services providing
mental health care to the people of Kumasi, Ghana. This
study aimed to identify previous help sought by patients
presenting to the services for an initial assessment.
Method New patients presenting to each of the four services
were asked about distance travelled, previous help
sought and time since symptoms of illness started. Staff
also recorded basic demographic details and clinical diagnoses.
Results Of the 322 patients presenting to the
four sites,only 6% had seen a traditional healer whereas
14% had seen a pastor before presentation. There was a
greater delay in presenting to that service if the patient
had seen a traditional healer or pastor. Many patients
had previously used one of the other mental health units
in Kumasi. Conclusion It is possible that fewer patients
with mental health problems present to traditional healers
in modern, urban Africa compared to rural areas.
More patients consult with pastors than traditional
healers and liaison with these groups may improve mental
health care. It is important to maintain liaison between
the four services as patients presenting to one
clinic may have presented previously to another local
clinic.

This research work presents a new approach to
prioritize distribution maintenance activities based on system
reliability and cost-effectiveness. The objective of this approach
is to minimize the weighted average system reliability index
(WASRI) by ranking maintenance tasks based on their marginal
benefit-to-cost ratios, where the benefit is defined as improvement
in WASRI. Estimations of WASRI improvement are obtained
by utilizing the linear relationship between the benefit obtained
from a maintenance task and the change of failure rate of the
maintained component.

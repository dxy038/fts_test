This paper develops appropriate models of flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) shunt-series controllers for multiobjective optimization and also presents a multiobjective optimization methodology to find the optimal location of FACTS shunt-series controllers. The objective functions are the total fuel cost, power losses, and system loadability with and without minimum cost of FACTS installation. The &#949;-constraint approach is implemented for the multiobjective mathematical programming (MMP) formulation, including the FACTS shunt-series controllers (i.e., phase-shifting transformer (PST), hybrid flow controller (HFC), and unified power-flow controller (UPFC)). Simulation results are presented for the IEEE 14-bus system. The optimization method is numerically solved using Matlab and general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software environments. The solution procedure uses nonlinear programming (NLP) and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to solve the optimal location and setting of FACTS incorporated in the optimal power-flow problem considering these objective functions and improving the power system operation. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the HFC is outperformed by PST and UPFC from the analytical and technical point of views.

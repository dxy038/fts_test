Waste generation has increased considerably worldwide in the last decades. As a consequence, incineration became an alternative for reducing waste volume, leading to the generation of ash as a new type of waste. The new cementâ€“ash composite systems have been tested for future applications in building materials. Having in mind the previous data and scientific reports, the objective of the present study is oriented to evaluate the additions of hospital waste ash in cement matrices to be potentially used as construction elements. This involved the assessment of the effect of the additions (different proportions of ash and metal-spiked ash) on the physico-mechanical properties of the building materials and the leachability of metals. The experiences show the feasibility of including hospital waste ashes in masonry blocks or other similar products.

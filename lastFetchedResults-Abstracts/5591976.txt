The objective of the research presented in this paper is to facilitate the communication between people with hearing impairment (i.e. deaf people) and normal people. In addition, an efficient and fast algorithm for automatic translation system for gestures of manual numbers in the sign Language is proposed. The proposed algorithm does not rely on the use of any gloves or visual markings to accomplish the recognition job. The proposed system uses the concept of boundary tracing and finger tip detection. As an alternative, it deals with images of bare hands, which allows the user to interact with the system in a natural way. The technique is based on interpolation of signature of hand image. Experiments revealed that satisfactory results can be obtained via the proposed algorithm.

Background: Dracocephalum polychaetum Bornm. (Lamiaceae) is one of the endemic species of Dracocephalum genus in Iran. There is no report on chemical composition of this species. This plants in Kerman folk medicines is known as Mofaroo and used for its pleasant odor, and for the releif of stomach pain.
Objective: In this investigation volatile oil components and flavonoids of D. polychaetum was studied.
Method: Dried and ground aerial part of D. polychaetum were subjected to hydro distillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The oil was analyzed by GC-MS. Identification of compounds was based on a comparison of their mass spectra with standards and using retention indices and co injection.
Methanolic extracts was chromatographed on Silica gel PTLC and two fraction separated. The structures of them were determined by UV spectra and 1H-NMR.
Results: The aerial part of D. polychaetum yielded 1.3% of pale yellowish oil, which contained perilla aldehyde (69.60%) and limonene (16.55%). Two flavons apigenin and luteolin were isolated from this plant.
Discussion: Chemical composition of other Dracocephalum species showed that essential oil and flavonoides are common in this genus and yields of oil of D. polychaetum is higher than other members of this genus. Apigenin and luteolin here been found in some Dracocephalum species.

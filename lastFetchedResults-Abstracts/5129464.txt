Active control of a constant speed horizontal axis wind turbine via pitching of the rotor blades is considered in this paper. It is the purpose of this paper to test and validate an LQG controller for a wind turbine by simulation. The controller is only active above rated wind speed. Since the wind frequently crosses rated wind speed, the controller must operate without switching transients. The main objective of the control system designed in this paper is to regulate pitch demand such that power is kept at its rated value. The performance of the control system in the presence of wind gusts is determined

In this day, ICT plays a significant role of the society transforming technology. We cannot deny the responsibility of the changing human society development. The 2014 Third ICT International Student Project Conference (ISPC2014) and Software Innovation Contest response to this global issue by giving the theme of &#8220;ICT for better living&#8221; to provide a major venue for students from Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Computer Science, Computer Engineering and other Information Technology (IT) related disciplines to present their precious projects. The objective of ICT-ISPC is to leverage and preserve the value of hundreds of ICT student research project works to share and to link to the ICT industry, community and society.

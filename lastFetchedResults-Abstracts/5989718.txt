In 2010, Yau et al. introduced the notion of searchable proxy re-encryption with a designated tester (Re-dPEKS) and proposed a concrete construction of bidirectional Re-dPEKS which was secure in the random oracle model. In this paper, we present an efficient Re-dPEKS scheme which is proven secure against an adaptive chosen keyword attack in the adaptive corruption model without resorting to random oracle. Furthermore, our scheme is proven to resist off-line keyword guessing attacks.

In this paper, we propose centralized and distributed power allocation algorithms for a multi-user, multi relay cellular network using decode-and-forward (DF) cooperation strategy taking channel uncertainty into account. The objective is to minimize the total uplink power of the network taking each userÂ´s target data rate as the quality of service (QoS) constraint under imperfect channel state information (CSI). We consider the worst-case optimization approach, in which QoS constraint is satisfied for all channels contained in some uncertainty region. First, a centralized power allocation scheme is developed to optimally allocate the power among the users and the relay nodes. Then, a suboptimal distributed algorithm is proposed based on a standard primal decomposition approach, where each relay can independently and separately minimize its own power. The proposed solutions are based on second order cone programming (SOCP), which is computationally efficient. Simulation results show that the performance of the suboptimal distributed solution is near-optimal and reveals the fact that DF cooperation strategy is more efficient in total power reduction and more robust under channel uncertainty over non-cooperative systems.

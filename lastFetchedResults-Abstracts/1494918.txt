Generally, soil compaction is a stress factor affecting negatively the plant growth, but its effects vary between species and with the soil compaction range. The objective of this study is to know the different growth responses of 17 woody species subjected to moderate soil compaction, because most of the studies about this subject compare the effects in treatments with a wide and discrete compaction range. We explore the effects of moderate soil compaction on a continuous scale (0.1–1.0 MPa) on seedling growth. Seedlings of 17 woody species (deciduous and evergreens) mainly from Mediterranean ecosystems were grown in near optimal conditions (light, temperature and water) in a greenhouse with a sandy substrate. In general, there was a great variability of the responses depending on the species and the studied variable. About 53% of the species showed a higher total biomass with a moderate increase in soil compaction possibly being due to a greater root–soil contact. In the same way, 41% of species increase the relative growth rate and 35% the total area. Nevertheless, in spite of these positive effects on growth, for some species (23%) there was a decrease in the root proportion with soil resistance, as result of soil strength. These effects of moderate soil compaction could sum up in two general responses of woody plants: growth increment and architecture distortion. This might be relevant as a lower root investment may be a disadvantage under drought conditions. Finally, a simple conceptual model is proposed to understand the general effects of soil compaction on growth and biomass allocation.

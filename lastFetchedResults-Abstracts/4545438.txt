Actigraphic measurements depicting movement during sleep, tissue bioimpedance images of different organs reflecting their physiological functional status, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire as well as sleep diary data reflecting subjective self-evaluation of sleep were collected from 20 volunteers [5 males and 15 females, 20-79 (55 &#177; 12) years of age, 105-235 lbs (158 &#177; 36) in weight, and 5 - 6.4 ft (5.5 &#177; 0.3) in height] over a period of 3 weeks at baseline and at the end of each week afterwards. Baseline data were acquired from all subjects at the beginning of the study period before wearing an organic nanopatch device: the Silent Nights patch. After one week of accommodation to wearing the Actiwatches, Silent Nights patch was applied to the right temple 1 hour before sleep each night and worn throughout the night for 2 weeks. Subjects were instructed to keep well hydrated during the study period. All subjects served as their own control. The effects of Silent Nights patch on qualitative and quantitative measures of sleep were evaluated and the impact of quality of sleep on organ function was analyzed. The hypothesis to be tested was: The Silent Nights patch worn throughout the night for 2 weeks improves cellular physiologic functional status of different parts of the brain, cardiac ventricles, adrenal glands, and thyroid gland. The overall data in this pilot investigation demonstrated that this intervention produced considerable improvements in the objective and subjective measures of sleep and resulted in enhancement of physiological functional status of the brain, adrenal glands, cardiac ventricles, and thyroid gland.

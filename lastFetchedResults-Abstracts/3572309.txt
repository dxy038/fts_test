This paper presents an integrated solution for code management, assignment, and reassignment problems in UMTS. We propose a new architecture for code management and, based upon this new architecture, a code assignment strategy, referred to as "crowded-group first strategy". Our system architecture and code assignment strategy represent significant improvements both in the time complexity and the maintenance complexity. Moreover, the code blocking probability of the crowded-group first strategy is competitive to that of the other strategies. In this paper, we also propose a new code reassignment strategy, called the "crowded-branch first strategy". The main objective of this reassignment strategy is to reduce reassigned call probability with low computation overhead and extend this strategy for the general case. In order to systematically analyze the performances of the code assignment strategy, we implement a simulator to analyze the code selection behavior and code blocking probability of each strategy. Moreover, we propose some new performance metrics, named "weighted code blocking", "reassigned call probability", and "ratio of actual code reassignments", in order to precisely measure the performance obtained by different strategies. From the simulation results, we show that our proposed strategies efficiently utilize the OVSF codes with low computation overhead.

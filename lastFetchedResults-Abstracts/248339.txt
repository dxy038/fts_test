To generate the Pareto optimal set e¦ciently in multiobjective optimization, a hybrid optimizer is developed
by coupling the genetic algorithm and the direct search method. This method determines a candidate region
around the global optimum point by using the genetic algorithm, then searches the global optimum point by
the direct search method concentrating in this region, thus reducing calculation time and increasing search
e¦ciency. Although the hybrid optimizer provides cost-e¤ectiveness, the design optimization process
involves a number of tasks which require human expertise and experience. Therefore, methods of optimization
and associated programs have been used mostly by experts in the real design world. Hence, this hybrid
optimizer incorporates a knowledge-based system with heuristic and analytic knowledge, thereby narrowing
the feasible space of the objective function. Some domain knowledge is retrieved from database and design
experts. The obtained knowledge is stored in the knowledge base. The results of this paper, through
application to marine vehicle design with multiobjective optimization, show that the hybrid optimizer
with aid of design knowledge can be a useful tool for multiobjective optimum design

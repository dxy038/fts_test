The objective of this study is to derive the optimal retailerÂ´s replenishment policy for imperfect quality items in fuzzy environment. The effect of permissible delay in payments is also considered. It is assumed that production rate depends on the demand rate. Due to different preservation facilities, we consider that the deterioration rate is time dependent in own warehouse (O.W) and Wei-bull distribution in rented warehouse (R.W). The ordering cost, purchasing cost, holding cost and selling price are taken as fuzzy numbers.

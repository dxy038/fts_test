Objective
The objective of this study was to delineate a precise molecular map of the commonly deleted region (CDR) on mouse chr2 in radiation-induced mouse acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cells.
Materials and Methods

We used a PCR-based loss of heterozygosity (LOH) assay to map the chr2-CDR in AML cells isolated from F1 hybrid mice (imageBALB/cJ × imageCBA/CaJ) which developed AML following exposure to a single dose of 3 Gy of 137Cs γ rays. A total of 30 polymorphic microsatellite markers, mapping within or close to chr2(D-E), were used under optimized PCR conditions that generate a single major band for each marker on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel.
Results

Detailed LOH mapping identified two distinct AML-CDRs: one localized to a 4.6 centiMorgan (cM) interval between markers D2Mit272 and D2Mit394; the other mapped to a 0.8 cM interval between markers D2Mit276 and D2Mit444. Both CDRs span the mouse chr2E region.
Conclusion

The data present, for the first time, evidence for two distinctly noncontiguous CDRs on mouse chr2 harboring gene(s) involved in AML development. These CDRs are orthologous to human chromosomes 11p11-13 and 15q11-15 that have been implicated in subsets of AML. This finding indicates the region of mouse chr2 that must be searched for candidate genes involved in radiation-induced AML.

Objective: To establish a practical, accurate and convenient DNA molecular genetic marker technique for the identification of Testudinis Carapax et Plastrum. Methods: The mtDNA were extracted from Testudinis Carapax et Plastrum and its adulterants by salting-out method respectively. Bioinformatics technology was used to explore the identification and characterization of mitochondrial cytobchrome b gene from Chinemys revisii and other turtle species. A pair of allele-specific PCR primers were designed according to the cyt b gene, the PCR amplification were performed with mtDNA extracted from Testudinis Carapax et Plastrum and its adulterants. Results: The pure and intact mtDNA was extracted from Testudinis Carapax et Plastrum and its adulterants. The pair of allele-specific primers could only amplify the cyt b gene of Chinemys revisii with amplification of 319 bp. Conclusion: The primers are specific to Chinemys revisii mtDNA and could be used to discern Testudinis carapax et Plastrum from its adulterants.

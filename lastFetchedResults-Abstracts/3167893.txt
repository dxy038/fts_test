This paper presents the results of an architectural study into future ESA Deep-Space ground stations. The objective of the project is to investigate solutions for building ground stations for future Deep Space missions for exploration of the outer reaches of the solar system. The study addresses not only the engineering challenges associated with various technical options, but also the cost, with a clear goal of identifying the most cost effective approach.

In this survey, we consider three unidirectional network categories: (1) the low-dimensional torus network, (2) the hypercube network, and the (3) the de Bruijn network. Our significant results are (1) a comparison between unidirectional and bidirectional implementations of each topology and (2) a comparison between the three topologies with respect to routing strategy cost-performance, fault tolerance, and deadlock avoidance

The paper presents a case study application of a cancer treatment center facility. A simulation model was created and integrated to a multi-objective optimization heuristic developed by the authors with the purpose of finding the best combination of control variables that optimize the performance of four different objectives related to the system. The results obtained show that the implementation of the proposed solution could improve the four objectives, compared to the existing solution

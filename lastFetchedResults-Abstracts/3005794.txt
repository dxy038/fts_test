In this paper a new distributed power control algorithm is proposed. It is based on the minimization of multiple objectives. The objectives are to keep the transmitted power as close to the minimum power as possible and simultaneously, to hold the carrier to interference ratio (CIR) close to the given target. The multi-objective optimization problem is transformed into a single-objective optimization problem. Its solution results in a new, efficient power algorithm, which is simple to implement. Simulations demonstrate that it converges faster than the conventional power control algorithms. Also, the average transmitted power is less than the average transmitted power using the conventional methods with comparable quality of service (QoS). Noisy, dynamical environment is assumed in the simulations. The algorithm has been modified to work with quantized carrier to interference ratio (CIR). A new soft dropping algorithm based on a multi-objective technique has been developed.

The improved power quality ac-dc converters (IPQCs) provide enhanced power quality at the utility interface. This paper presents single and three phase topologies of the dual bidirectional buck-boost type IPQC, which provides two, variable bidirectional dc voltage and reversible current, outputs, employing power MOSFET based four quadrant switches (4QSWs). The converter topologies are simulated for buck and boost modes. Performance analysis of the converter confirms the feasibility of the proposed topologies and efficacy of the switching strategy adopted for waveshaping line currents to obtain operation in any quadrant, at any mode and at any power factor.

Objective
To determine whether emergency medical services (EMS) 911 frequent users would benefit from social services intervention.
Methods
The design was a descriptive prospective subject evaluation. All nonhomeless frequent EMS users (>3× in 1 month) were identified monthly from December 2 to May 3 and contacted by 2 social workers. Information extracted from their contact with the subjects included demographics, ability to enter a social services intervention, and reason for transport.
Results
Eighty-four patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. Seventy-four patients were unable to enter a social services intervention for the following reasons: not home (2×) (26%), not at address (19%), refused (13%), unable to complete Mini-Mental Status Exam (10%), deceased (6%), hospitalized (5%), safety issues (4%), and others (10%). The reasons for frequent EMS use were cardiac (24%), asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%), seizures (14%), dialysis problems, alcohol problems, and diabetes-related problems (<10% each).
Conclusion
Among all patients, the primary reasons for transport were cardiac, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and seizures. Only 12% of patients contacted could enter a social services intervention. On the basis of the small cohort of patients that were able to enter a social services interventions, more targeted interventions are warranted.

This paper presents finite element computation of brain deformation during craniotomy. Two mechanical models are compared for this purpose: linear solid-mechanic model and linear elastic model. Both models assume finite deformation of the brain after opening the skull. We use a test sphere as a model of the brain, tetrahedral finite element mesh, and function optimization that optimizes the modelspsila parameters by minimizing the distance between the resulting deformation and the supposed deformation. Based on the final value of the objective function, we conclude that the accuracy of the solid mechanic model is higher than that of the elastic model. Applications of the methods to the MR images of the brain confirm this finding.

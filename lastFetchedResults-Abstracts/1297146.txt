This paper considers the hop-constrained multicast route packing problem with a bandwidth reservation to build QoS-guaranteed multicast routing trees with a minimum installation cost. Given a set of multicast sessions, each of which has a hop limit constraint and a bandwidth requirement, the problem is to determine the set of multicast routing trees in an arc-capacitated network with the objective of minimizing the cost. For the problem, we propose a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm, which can be viewed as a branch-and-bound method incorporating both the strong cutting plane algorithm and the column generation method. We implemented and tested the proposed algorithm on randomly generated problem instances with sizes up to 30 nodes, 570 arcs, and 10 multicast sessions. The test results show that the algorithm can obtain the optimal solution to practically sized problem instances within a reasonable time limit in most cases.

Objective
Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is an autosomal dominantly inherited
subtype of migraine with aura, characterized by transient neurological signs
and symptoms. Typical hemiplegic migraine attacks start in the first or second
decade of life. Some patients with FHM suffer from daily recurrent attacks since
childhood. Results from extensive studies of cellular and animal models have
indicated that gene mutations in FHM increase neuronal excitability and reduce
the threshold for spreading depression (SD). SD is a transient wave of profound
neuronal and glial depolarization that slowly propagates throughout the brain
tissue and is characterized by a high amplitude negative DC shift. After induction
of SD, S218L mutant mice exhibited neurological signs highly reminiscent of
clinical attacks in FHM type 1 patients carrying this mutation. FHM1 with
ataxia is attributable to specific mutations that differ from mutations that cause
pure FHM1 and have peculiar consequences on cerebellar Cav2.1 currents that
lead to profound Purkinje cell dysfunction and neuronal loss with atrophy. SD
in juvenile rats produced neuronal injury and death. Hormonal factors involved
in FHM affect SD initiation and propagation. The data identify SD as a possible
target of treatment of FHM. In addition, FHM is a useful model to explore the
mechanisms of more common types of migraine.

Findings: There was no difference in the time of pain reduction in both groups (P>0.05). On 7th day of treatment , 24 patients of group A and 15 patients of group B (P< = 0.05 - P=0.035) & after 14 days 38 patients of group A and 31 of group B had complete remission (P= 0.014). It was a significant difference. Rebound of lesion after 3 months was 5 in group A and 8 in group B which was not significant.

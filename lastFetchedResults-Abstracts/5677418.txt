The objective of this research is to discuss how to initiate fusion MODIS Chla and GOCI Chla around Tachibana Bay which is located in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. First, the equation of GOCI LCI was theoretically calculated on the basis of the LCI (Linear Combination Index) method proposed by Frouin et al. (1996). Next, MODIS LCI and GOCI LCI were compared, having assumed that both were in linear relation. As a result, significant correlation was acquired by them. GOCI Chla from the method finally proposed was very well in agreement as compared with the distributive characteristics of MODIS Chla. The Rayleigh reflectance product data set of GOCI and MODIS on July 8 and July 25 in 2012 was used for both comparisons.

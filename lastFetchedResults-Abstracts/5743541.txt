This paper presents coordination algorithms for mobile autonomous agents equipped with line-of-sight sensors in a nonconvex polygon. The objective of the proposed algorithms is to achieve rendezvous, that is, agreement over the location of the agents in the network, using only information from the line-of-sight sensors. Two key novel components of the algorithms are the notions of locally-cliqueless visibility graph and of convex continuous constraint set.

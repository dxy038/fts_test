Objective: Our purpose was to assess the prevalence of latex sensitization among women admitted for delivery and the relevant risk factors. Study Design: In a prospective study 333 consecutive patients admitted for delivery were screened for specific immunoglobulin E antibodies to latex and for atopic status. A questionnaire was filled in and included questions about the obstetric and surgical history, known contact with latex, and previous use of condoms. Results: Nine of 333 (2.7%) women showed latex-specific immunoglobulin E. All 9 women had atopy (100% vs 26.2% in the latex-negative group; P< .00001). Of 8 patients with specific immunoglobulin E who gave details about the use of condoms, 6 had had frequent contact with latex condoms (75% vs 51%). Previous cesarean delivery was more frequent in latex-sensitized patients (33% vs 8.4%; P< .05), whereas previous pregnancies, previous deliveries, and total number of operations had no influence. Conclusion: Given a prevalence of 2.7% of latex sensitization, all obstetric patients should be questioned about known immediate allergic reaction to latex, a predisposition to atopy, previous intra-abdominal operations, and the regular use of condoms in the past. Patients with atopy and additive risk factors should be treated in a latex-free environment. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:1461-4.)

Based on concept of enterprise strategic risk, a risk evaluation index system is set up which consists of five elements, including financial condition, market competition, enterprise resource, enterprise capability and business process firstly. Secondly, a corresponding comprehensive evaluation method based on wavelet network is proposed in detail for enterprise strategic risk evaluation. An empirical research for strategic risk evaluation was discussed by using the suggested method. Obviously, the application result of the method was comparatively more objective. Finally, the comparison between the mentioned approach and BPNN was discussed. It indicated that the method not only can evaluate enterprise strategic risk effectively and avoid some man-made mistakes, but also has better effective and efficient than BPNN.

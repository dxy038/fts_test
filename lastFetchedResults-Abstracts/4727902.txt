This paper describes a new interleaved bidirectional dc-dc converter for energy storage system applications. The proposed bidirectional dc-dc converter consists of energy storage system as input source and an interleaved half-bridge on both sides of high frequency transformer. The proposed converter can be easily extended to the multi-phase interleaved bidirectional dc-dc converter with modularity as the capacity of energy storage increases. The number of switching devices of the proposed converter is reduced by half count compared to the dual full-bridge dc-dc converter in parallel operation, and a high step-up voltage conversion is achieved with reduced transformer turn ratio and switching losses of all active switching devices are minimized through zero voltage switching without additional circuit components. The operation principle, mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented in this paper.

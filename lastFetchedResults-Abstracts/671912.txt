Ecological networks are becoming an important issue in nature conservation policy in Europe. Nature conservation in Europe developed from site protection in its early phase into planning systems for nature conservation in the present time. Ecological networks are based on landscape ecological principles and consist of core areas, corridor zones, buffer zones and, if needed, nature rehabilitation areas for the re-establishment of nature. The content of the networks is a reflection of their objective, the phase of nature conservation and the planning system of a region or country. In this review a distinction has been made between (1) pioneer networks, (2) networks as the basis of a nature policy plan and (3) networks as part of an integrated national or regional plan. Ecological networks are developed at several geographical and administrative levels and these levels should be integrated. The present time period is considered to be crucial for the development of nature conservation policy because of the many changes that are now taking place in Europe.

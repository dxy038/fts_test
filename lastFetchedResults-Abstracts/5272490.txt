In todayÂ´s global and open innovation environment, Supplier selection decisions are complicated by the fact that relationship is changing between supplier and manufacturer. Many models have been developed for supplier selection decisions in SCM. Among the mathematical programming models, LP, MIP (mixed integer programming) and MOP (multi objective programming) are the frequently used techniques. These models are usually based on rather simplistic perceptions of decision making process. Using multiphase selection methods and unconventional criteria combination, this paper gives a multiple phase supplier sorting model based on the supplier development orientation. The model classified selection into three phase: preselection, evaluation and development, the proposed methodology include such as PHEMETHEE, AHP and RVE. The model is supposed to evaluate supplier performance and develop supplier capacity in the same time.

An object-oriented model for network independent monitoring and performance evaluation in real-time is presented. the model describes the behavior of network objects by a set of state variables and a set of invariants. The model is used to evaluate quality-of-service characteristics of different classes of traffic in an integrated network testbed. An objective-driven measurement strategy to establish the dynamic database of the network is discussed. A statistical database derived from the dynamic database is also obtained

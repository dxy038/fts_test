For many years, space faring nations have defined and implemented docking systems that have met the needs and constraints of their own programs. The American Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960´s developed docking mechanisms specific to lunar missions. The Russian Salyut, Soyuz and later Mir programs developed docking mechanisms that were specific to docking and mating of spacecraft in low earth orbit. The end objective of these discussions is to formulate and agree upon a common docking interface definition that willing countries may design and build to if they choose to be compatible with other nation´s human space flight spacecraft.

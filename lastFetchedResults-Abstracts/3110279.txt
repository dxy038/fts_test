A rule-based fuzzy control method is proposed in this paper for the control of single-link, lightweight, flexible manipulators. The objective of this method is to control the tip position of a flexible manipulator in the presence of joint friction and changes in the payload. Both linear and nonlinear friction are overcome using a robust control scheme. The control scheme is based on two nested feedback loops: an inner loop to control the position of the motor and an outer loop to control the tip position. The tip position is controlled by a rule-based fuzzy controller. This results in a simple control law that needs minimal computing effort and can be used for real-time control of flexible arms.

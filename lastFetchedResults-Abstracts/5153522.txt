In this paper, we deal with a work shift scheduling problem with the human factors considered for the shift work management. For the work shift scheduling, various constraints have been considered related to the human factors and Regulatory guidelines. The objective function is set to minimize the differences of the workloads in each workgroup. The constraints and the objective function are implemented by using a heuristic approach. The basic functions and constraints of this algorithm are the Number of shifts, Length of shifts, Changeable working time, Shifts types, and Lengths and Numbers of various breaks.

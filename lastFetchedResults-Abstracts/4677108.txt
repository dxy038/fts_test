In view of the current common situations of the domestic grid that the number of harmonic power measuring points is small, the measuring devices are used both for the harmonic voltage and current, and the measuring points are separated, a method is introduced in this paper, which is applied in the analysis of network observability utilizing network topology assisted by suspicious harmonic injection node. This method makes recursive computation of adjacency matrix and the voltage and current measuring vectors by means of Boolean operation, with small computing amount. The method can be used in the analysis and calculation as well as the optimal measuring placement of the harmonic regional observable network, which has no or separated sensors. On the basis of observability analysis, an comprehensive objective function which has relation with load type and voltage grade is proposed to realize optimal placement and importance sort. The practicality and efficiency of this method has been testified by the example of a regional power grid.

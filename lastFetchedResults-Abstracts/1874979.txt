Objective
is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, and IL-10-producing regulatory T cells are effective inhibitors of murine asthmatic responses. This study determined whether IL-10-dependent mechanisms mediated the local inhalational tolerance seen with chronic inhalational exposure to antigen.
s
pe and IL-10−/− mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged with daily OVA inhalations for 10 days or 6 weeks.
s
-day animals developed allergic airway disease, characterized by BAL eosinophilia, histologic airway inflammation and mucus secretion, methacholine hyperresponsiveness, and OVA-specific IgE production. These changes were more pronounced in IL-10−/− mice. The 6-week IL-10−/− and wildtype animals both developed inhalational tolerance, with resolution of airway inflammation but persistence of OVA-specific IgE production.
sion
may have anti-inflammatory effects in the acute stage of murine allergic airways disease, but the cytokine does not mediate the development of local inhalational tolerance with chronic antigen exposure.

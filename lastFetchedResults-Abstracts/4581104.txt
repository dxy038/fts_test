In this paper we present SynCoBook, a distributed system that offers the functionalities of a face-to-face cooperative bookmarking system and of a recommendation system. Our overall objective was to design and realize a practical tool that can be used in project-based learning, in the classroom, to participate in the WebQuests [12] or to cooperatively build an annotated Webliography, i.e., a set of URLs, organized and scaffolded with group annotations. Moreover, our system also offers advanced awareness tools as well as recommendations based on the items in the Webliography and their Google-related pages.

Based on analyzing various parameters in course of positioning high frequency antennas on naval ship, this paper constructs the corresponding objective function model by using the weighted sum approach, solves the problems of high frequency antenna placement with multi-parameters, and sets up the constraint condition model by combining with the characteristics and the national military standard of shipboard high frequency antenna.

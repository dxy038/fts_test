Eskom\Â´s passive fire protection philosophy for major transformers is described. The term "major" refers to the size of the transformer in terms of its oil capacity. The passive fire protection philosophy used for transformers can also be applied to other major oil-filled equipment located in high-voltage yards, e.g., shunt reactors and neutral earth resistors. The primary goal of passive fire protection is to contain the fire to prevent or limit damage to adjacent equipment. Construction features such as oil catchment areas, heat radiation barriers and oil drainage systems are used to achieve this objective

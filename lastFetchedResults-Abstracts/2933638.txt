The objective of using asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) as the basic transfer mode in the new generation of NATO tactical communication systems is the creation of a unified network architecture able to support both bursty (e.g. data) and synchronous (e.g. voice) services in a flexible and organic way. Although military operational conditions may be significantly different from those of commercial networks, the future military ATM systems should benefit maximally from the massive R&amp;D effort spent on commercial ATM systems. The paper evaluates the basic operating requirements for an ATM network against those typical for conventional military tactical communication networks. The throughput and delay performance for respectively data services and low bit-rate voice services are assessed for a network of worst case size incorporating low bit-rate, high error rate trunks. A number of techniques are suggested to enhance the network performance for these services. Addition of forward error correction (FEC), possibly in combination with cell header compression at the link level, is recommended to enhance radio link performance. Prioritisation of connections is recommended for delay sensitive services. It is shown that with a combined use of these techniques ATM can be used in the tactical environment as a unifying technology to meet all of the future service requirements. Further a recommendation is made for the development of tactical quality of service (QOS) requirements

Abstract
Background: There are few investigations about the possibility of cyst production in human via accidental entrance of protoscoleces in ways other than cyst rupture in intestines. The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of cyst production by cutaneous erosion, peritoneal injection, and oral inoculation in mice.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, infected livers featuring hydatid cysts were collected from abattoir. Protoscoleces were examined for viability and lack of bacterial infection and washed 3 times by PBS. Protoscoleces were flown on the scratched skin, injected peritoneally, and inoculated orally to three groups (n=15) of mice. After 4 months, the mice were dissected and their skin and visceral were subjected to microscopic analysis. ELISA test for hydatidosis was also run for all of the groups. 
Results: All the mice were negative by ELISA test except the mice of peritoneum injection group which were positive with an average titer of 11.92Â±0.80 by ELISA. Only two mice had cysts on the peritoneum in the peritoneal injection (PI) group with an average size of 3mm. Cysts, however, were not observed in the other groups.
Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that protoscoleces flow over scratched skin and oral inoculation do not produce hydatid cyst; however, peritoneal implant of protoscolex can result in hydatidosis in mice.

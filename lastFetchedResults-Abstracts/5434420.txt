The development of the Internet has elicited the importance of information security. For national information security, other than providence and release of information security protection messages, critical infrastructure information protection (CIIP) has also become part of the overall network security. How to integrate the related information security data for industries and establish the integrative monitoring and analytical platform is the first priority at Taiwan. Hence, the establishment of the Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) for critical infrastructures has become the most important topic at present. The ISAC establishment places the greatest emphasis on information exchange and analysis so that there must be a unified standard for the exchange format and operation. Because the differences between critical infrastructures are quite large and the sources of the workflow processes and threats are not quite the same, a public tool is required for such establishment. This research discusses how to use Consultative Objective Risk Analysis System (CORAS) to establish ISAC of critical infrastructures and takes a telecom company as an example to simulate episodes of possible risks that might occur and to discuss how it functions, how it is established, and how it handles risks.

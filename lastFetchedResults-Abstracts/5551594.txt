In order to obtain larger starting thrust to meet the requirement of the mechanical property of high-voltage circuit breaker, the cylindrical linear induction motor (C-LIM) applied to the circuit breaker operating mechanism was proposed and optimized in this paper. Firstly, the multi-objective particle swarm algorithm was proposed and used in the global optimization of cylinder linear induction motor according to its characteristic. Secondly, the mathematical model of multi-objective optimization algorithm was established based on the grain of subgroup algorithm, and the programs were compiled by using the Matlab engineering calculation tool, at the same time the visual interface was developed. Finally, the results indicated that the multi-objective optimization design is obviously better than the single optimization design. The thrust are increased, the structure and size of motor are also reduced. So it can increase the usability of the C-LIM drive mechanism and provide the basis for the design of miniaturization of circuit breaker operating mechanism.

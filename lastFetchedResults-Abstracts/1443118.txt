The objective of this study was to evaluate the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) prototype, to select the hams on the basis of meat quality characteristics in commercial conditions. Measurements of meat quality were made on 95 commercial hams (11.10±0.76 kg) to evaluate quality characteristics [ham weight, conformation (H), fat thickness in the rump (FTR), visual fatness (VF), pH45, electrical conductivity (QM45) and ultimate pH (pH24, pH36) in the semimembranosus muscle]. The electrical parameters, Ro, Rinf, Ratio (Rinf/Ro), Fc and α, were obtained with the EIS equipment and was applied in five different regions of the ham (M, SM, M1, M2 and AD) at 36 h post-mortem. Principal component (PC) analysis has been used to describe the relationships between meat quality and electrical parameters in the ham meat. Two regions were selected, SM and M, showing the best correlations with pH45 and fat characteristics in relation to electrical parameters Rinf and Ratio, respectively. Multiple regression analysis of the data confirmed that electrical variables, Ratio, α and Fc contributed to predict pH45 (R2=0.50). In order to better predict visual fatness (VF), conformation and ham weight were included in the multiple regression. A R2 of 0.59 was obtained with H, Rinf, ham weight and α. In conclusion, the results of this study have demonstrated that ratio in the SM region may classify with 88.46% accuracy the technologically normal meat (pH45 &gt; 6.10) from the PSE meat. In relation to visual fatness of the ham 84.21% of the samples with a Rinf in the M region &gt; 56 had a score of &gt; 2.5.

Background: Assessment of the length of root canal is the first and the most important step of a successful root canal therapy (RCT). Although radiography is the most common technique in working length determination, it is not the technique of choice due to its limitations. Electronic apex locator has been used to solve the problem.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro accuracy of two electronic apex locators Raypex5 and Foramatron in determination of working length.
Methods: This analytical study was performed in Qazvin dental school in 2005. 30 extracted single canal teeth were selected and the access cavity was prepared for them. The working length measured by two apex locators in dry and wet situation was compared to actual canal length that was determined under stereomicroscope. Data were analyzed by paired t-test.
Findings: The accuracy of Raypex5 working length determination was 86.7% and 76.7%, respectively, in dry and wet situation for a tolerance limit of 0-0.5 mm. The accuracy of Formatron working length determination was 73.4% and 63.4% and there was no statistically significant difference between the accuracy of the instruments.
Conclusion: Although the accuracy of Raypex5 in working length determination was more than Foramatron, both of them are useful as an adjunct to radiography in working length measurement.

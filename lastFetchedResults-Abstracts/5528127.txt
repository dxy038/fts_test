Increased load forecasts can severely deteriorate the performance of a power system. Reactive compensation devices are a common method to allow a power system to return to an acceptable performance level for an expected load. Reactive power planning (RPP) is used to determine the optimal placement of reactive devices for a set of objectives. RPP is a large scale multiple objectives highly constrained and partially discrete optimization problem that is very difficult to solve. Evolutionary algorithms have been used to solve RPP problems. However, new multi-objective evolutionary computational techniques have shown the ability to consider an optimization problemÂ´s objectives independently for the determination of Pareto Optimal solutions. This paper aims at applying the <i>Non-Dominated</i> <i>Sorting</i> <i>Genetic</i> <i>Algorithm</i> <i>II</i> (NSGAII) to a multi-objective RPP. The results from the case study presented show that there is great potential in the use of evolutionary computation for solving the multi-objective RPP.

Objective: In order to analyze the effects of Natural Cerebrolycin (NC) on the gene expression profile of Mesenchymal Stem Sells (MSCs), the feasibility of NC´s clinical use for Alzheimer´s Disease(AD)and the mechanism of its gene molecular Pharmacodynamics were studied. Method: The MSCs of rats were isolated and purified by whole bone marrow adherence and adherence screening method, the homology of the cells was analyzed by immunocytochemistry staining technique. The differential expression genes of MSCs treated with NC were analyzed by Affymetric whole genome gene chip analysis method. Result: Rat MSCs of higher purity (more than 90%) was acquired. After MSCs were treated with NC, 45 differential expression genes were displayed, the expressions of 21 genes among them were up-regulated (FCges2) and the expressions of 24 genes were significantly down-regulated (FCles-2).These genes included the genes participate in TGFbeta/BMPs, Hedgehog, Bmp and Wnt signal transduction pathways that have relations with cell differentiation &amp;development and /or nervous system function, and learning and memorizing functions, the genes of Ras and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways that have relations with cell growth and proliferation and apoptosis, and the genes of MAPKKK cascading. Conclusion: NC´s anti-AD pharmacodynamic mechanism of molecular genes could have relations with numerous gene expressions of some signal transduction pathways, which participate in regulating nerve cell differentiation and development, nervous system function, functions of learning and memory, and common cell functions of growth, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis.

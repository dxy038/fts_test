ADF and Phillips-Perron tests suggest that there appears to be integrated of order two in the measures of two variables. The result of cointegration test shows that there exists a long-run cointegration between product innovation and firm growth and Granger causality test indicates bidirectional causality, not unidirectional causality. It is concluded that, although there are feedbacks, the causation runs mainly from the firm growth to product innovation rather than the other way round.

Recognition distance in urban space is affected by many factors. Based on the relevant factors, this paper sums up those which affect urban distance cognition in the travel mode of bus, and conducts a cognitive test to get peopleÂ´s recognition data. We make some quantitative analysis of these data in the use of statistical methods. The results show that: in the bus travel mode, recognition distance can be affected by travel time, objective distance, and the number of bus stop sites, among which the travel time has the greatest impact on cognitive distance; the accuracy of places cognition can affect the deviation of recognition distance, and deviation of places where have higher geographical correlation is smaller; walking distance has small effects on the deviation of cognitive distance, but it will increase the estimated travel time; and residents who are more familiar with Beijing roads have a higher accuracy of recognition distance.

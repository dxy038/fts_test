Wilhelm Diltai is one of the hermeneutics philosophers in the classic era
having a very crucial role in developing hermeneutics. His most
contribution in philosophy is the epistemological analysis of humanities
and defending its value and position. The investigation of why he has
been so interested in humanities indicates that his living period was
contemporaneous to the total rejection of humanities and vast
development of experimental and natural sciences. Thus, Diltai, in
reaction to the natural sciences dominance, tried to objectify humanities
and establish a credit and value for it like natural sciences. This gave rise
to the fundamental question in Diltai’s thought: How can definite,
objective and authentic recognition and realization be possible just like
natural sciences? After vast thinking, he came to know that the reason of
achievement natural sciences had was that they pursued a definite
foundation and a thorough method. This was lacking in humanities.
Diltai aimed to first found humanities, then provide and design a
convenient method for it. To achieve this end, Diltai started his job from
1883 to the end of his life. The result was publication of several books
the first of which was ‘An Introduction to Humanities’ and the last of
which was ‘Formation of the Historical World in Humanities’. Diltai, in
his first book, related the origination of everything (things or feelings) to
a mental or inner state and based the sciences specially humanities on it
and selected self -thought and introspection to perceive or realize it.
Then, he came to know that he could not solve the objectivity issue with
such an analysis. So, changing his attitude, he replaced awareness affaies
with objectivity of spirit to both solve the objectivity problem and defend
the authenticity and objectivity of humanities. The aim, here, is to study
Diltai’s ups and downs in this tren

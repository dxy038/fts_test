A software process is a set of activities that will be carried out over time to produce a software system. Research on the software process has been increasingly recognized. This position advocates the representation of a software development process which should be explicitly defined, maintained and executed by a PSEE (Process Sensitive Software Engineering Environment). The complexity and scope of large scale process models makes their design, development and maintenance very complex. The overall objective of our approach is to define a tool to support the software process model construction and maintenance in PSEE. We investigate how software configuration management techniques applied to the software process can provide a novel solution for the definition and composition of reusable software process components. We present the current status of our work

A new LMI (linear matrix inequality)-based filter design methodology which can solve the multi-objective optimation problem for fault detection in LTI(linear time invariant) plants is presented. The main contributions consist of the formulation of the FD problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and the successful application in the aerocraft´s closed-loop control system. The fault detection approaches proposed before mainly aim at the open-loop system. H<sub>&#194;&#191;</sub> and H- index is used to measure the residual´s robustness against disturbances and sensitivity to faults respectively. The H- index is transformed to H<sub>&#194;&#191;</sub> norm by using the residual error instead of residual in this paper, then the multi-objective problem is solved using a new LMI-based filter design methodology. Eventually, the design scheme is applied in an aerocraft´s longitudinal model and the advantages of this approach are highlighted by this computational example.

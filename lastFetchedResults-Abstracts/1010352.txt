A new hybrid cooling scheme is proposed for high heat flux management and power devices. This scheme combines the benefits of micro-channel and jet impingement cooling technologies, with the additional objective of improving the temperature uniformity of the cooled object. The geometry is tested experimentally to characterize its performances and to assess its capacity to provide this characteristic. The temperature distribution of the heat sink has been measured through a matrix of thermocouples. The hybrid cooling scheme is shown to have the capacity to optimize the temperature uniformity of the cooled object, since the experimental design provides a global decrease of the temperature of the heat sink in the direction of the fluid flow.

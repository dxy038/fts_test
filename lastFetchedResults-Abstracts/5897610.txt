A main objective in code generation for ASIPs is to develop retargetable compilers in order to permit exploration of different architectural alternatives within short turnaround time. Retargetability requires that the compiler is supplied with a formal description of the target processor. This description is usually transformed into an internal instruction set model, on which the actual code generation operates. In this contribution we analyze the demands on instruction set models for retargetable code generation, and we present a formal instruction set model which meets these demands. Compared to previous work, it covers a broad range of instruction formats and includes a detailed view of inter-instruction restrictions

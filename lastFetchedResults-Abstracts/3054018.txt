The process of a leather quality decision-making process with unaided eyes can be unreliable because of the lack of consistency caused by tiredness due to continued exposure. Therefore, an objective standard for considering the quality of leather, and based on this standard, the automation of a quality decision-making process are required The automatic discrimination system of leather which is applied in this dissertation consists of the process of achieving information about leather and evaluating grades from the former process. The quality of leather depends on the chosen density extraction. In this dissertation, an algorithm which decides the grade of leather by extracting density and defects from the black image taken by a digital camera is suggested. Density is calculated by the area, width and height of the area exited in Fourier spectrum. Also, defects are extracted by the distinction of histogram distribution of pixel considered as a window from the image proceeded the pre-operation process using a searching window. The distinctions of whole leather are used as the standard for evaluating the grade and it is considered that it can substitute the eye sight test in other fields.

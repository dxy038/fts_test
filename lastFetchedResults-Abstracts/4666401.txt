Construction safety management is the basic factor to realize safety production target. Although researchers and safety controllers have done plenty of work to establish a lot of safety technique standards and regulations, the situation of safety production is still unsatisfied. One of the main reasons for such phenomena is that we lack general recognition to construction projects safety management. Besides safety, time and cost are two major control items for construction projects management, and their relation is mutual influence. The best solution for a project is to achieve high safety with low cost in a proper time limit. So, the particle swarm optimization is employed to conduct multiple-objective project optimization. After formulating safety management optimization model, a numerical example is given. Calculation result indicates that Particle Swarm Optimization can accurately and efficiently solve multiple-objective project optimization problem.

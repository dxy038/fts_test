One of the main concerns of market entities is minimizing the energy supply cost. In this paper, an objective function for reducing the energy supply cost by DisCo will be proposed. The optimization method is based on binary genetic algorithm (BGA) for the reconfiguration of deregulated distribution networks. In addition, a case study will be analyzed and the obtained results will show that the total energy supply cost will effectively reduce.

The main objective of the paper is to point out the influence of composition and of poling state (poled and unpoled samples) on the evolution of various parameters (É›r, dilatation coefficients, lattice parameters) at different scales (lattice, bulk) using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) and dielectric methods. The transition temperatures have been determined from the above measurements and compared. The composition has an influence on the transition temperature and not on the dilatation coefficient value. The poling state influences only the macroscopic dilatation evolution and not the value of the transition temperature. A scale effect is only observed on majoritary tetragonal compositions which show different values of transition temperatures from microscopic and macroscopic methods.

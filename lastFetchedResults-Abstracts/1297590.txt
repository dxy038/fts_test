Variable neighborhood search (VNS) and Greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) are among the well studied local search based metaheuristics providing good results for many combinatorial optimization problems throughout the last decade. While they are usually explored in different environments one may encounter quite obvious commonalities. Based on previous successful applications of these two types of metaheuristics on various network design problems in telecommunications, we further enhance these approaches by incorporating ideas from the pilot method. The different heuristics are compared among each other as well as against objective function values obtained from a mathematical programming formulation based on a commercial solver. The problem instances cover a large variety of networks and demand patterns.

Robust broadband beamforming design with beampattern shaping, i.e., frequency invariant, has received extensive attention. Recently, a robust broadband beamforming design with passband shaping characteristics using Tikhonov regularization and motived weighting coefficeints procedure has been proposed, which has a better passband shaping control and robust performance. It is noticed that only the robustness in presence of micrpohone gain and phase errors is discussed, and the case with microphone position errors has not been studied yet. To bridge this lecture gap, the main objective in this work is studying the design procedure against the uniformly distributed microphone position mismatches with passband shaping characteristics. Some design examples, e.g. flap-top passband shaping and frequency invariant passband shaping, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the robust passband shaping design approach with the comparisons.

The objective of this study was to assess the mechanisms responsible for the experimentally observed nonlinear addition of forces produced by voluntary contractions during superimposed electrical stimulation of the same muscle. A model of action potential interaction predicts increased motor unit firing rates during superimposed stimulation. The resulting effects on force production reproduce experimental results, confirming that motor unit force saturation contributes to nonlinear force addition. The model further predicts that the voluntary EMG will be reduced by stimulation, due to collision block and phase resetting of motor unit action potentials. Both effects have implications for the design of FES neuroprosthesis systems.

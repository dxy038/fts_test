Calotropis procera L. is a perennial adapted plant distributed in areas of deserts of south Asia. Stage of Calotropis procera L. seeds germination is sensitive to drought stress. Seed coating with water absorbent material is a method for to increase the germination rate. The objective of this study was identifying Using of organic water absorbent material for increase the germination rate of calotropis procera L. seeds in drought stress. Factorial experiment in completely randomized design was with five levels of organic material(wheat residue, canola residue, sunflower residue, vermin compost and peat mass) and extract with four levels(0, 25, 50, 100 % by volume) the result showed that canola residue, wheat residue and wheat residue had Absorbed the most of the water in saturation mode respectively, but vermicompost and peat mass hold water longer than others. vermicompost and peat mass and canolaresidue showed the least of allelopathy effect. All seedling characteristics( germination percentage, germination rate, root length, shoot length, Lateral roots number and seedling weight) decreased with an increase in extract concentrations. Characters decline with an increase vermicompost and peat mass in extract with less steep than others. So canola residue, vermicompost and peat mass were the best organic material for calotropis procera L. seeds coating. Keywords: Calotropis procera L., coating, seed germination, organic material.

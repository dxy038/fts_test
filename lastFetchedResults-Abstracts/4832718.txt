This paper presents a new method of bidirectional intuitionistic fuzzy reasoning by employing a weighted similarity measure between the fact and the antecedent portion of intuitionistic fuzzy production rule. Our proposed method is very simple and flexible, since it not only can deal with multidimensional intuitionistic fuzzy reasoning scheme, but also consider the different importance degree of linguistic variables in production rule and that of elements in each universe. One numerical example is given to illustrate the usefulness and feasibility of the proposed method.

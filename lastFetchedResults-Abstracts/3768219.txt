This paper covers the design, assembly, and field testing of the TOMCAT Component Evaluation Unit (CEU). TOMCAT is an acronym for &#194;&#191;eleoperator for O&#194;&#191;perations, M&#194;&#191;aintenance, and C&#194;&#191;onstruction using A&#194;&#191;dvanced &#194;&#191;echnology. The unit was developed in the performance of Phase 2 of EPRI Project No. RP14967-1, "Remote Controlled Maintenance Device" system development program. The objective of this effort was to design, fabricate, assemble, and evaluate a remotely controlled manipulator system for the maintenance and repair of overhead transmission lines based upon the utilization of as many off-the-shelf components as practical. The major intent was to develop the design information necessary for a field operable prototype. The component evaluation unit was assembled and then evaluated under energized and deenergized conditions. Information gathered from the evaluation will form the design criteria for the follow-on prototype system.

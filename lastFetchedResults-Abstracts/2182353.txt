Colchicine treatment for the induction of polyploidy on different parts of the plant has different results. The aim of the present study was to compare the influence of colchicine treatment on seeds and shoot tips of thymus daenensisplants. Examination of stomatals morphological features and analysis of cellular DNA content by spectrophotometry is an indirect but faster and cheaper way to determine polyploidy levels in plants. To achieve this objective, seeds and shoot tips were treated in different colchicine concentration levels including (0.0%, 0.03%, 0.05%, 0.08%, 0.1% w/v) for 24 and 48 hours and the survival rate of seeds and shoot tips were estimated. The effects of colchicine were measured by the number of chloroplasts in stomatal guard cells, the density of stomata on the leaf surface and cellular DNA content. Significant decline was seen in both treatment in comparison to the control group but survival rate was significantly higher in shoot tips treatment than seeds. In seed treatment, frequency of chloroplasts and total DNA content varied significantly in 0.08% colchicine application for 24 hours and significant decrease was found in stomatal density at this concentration. Similar result was observed in shoot tip treatment at the concentration of 0.03% and 0.1% for 48 and 24 hours but only significant change was seen in frequency of chloroplasts. In conclusion, the section of the plant that was used for colchicine treatment could affect the results. Despite reduction of seeds survival rate under colchicine treatment, seeds treatment at the level of 0.08% (w/v) for 24 hours was a better way to induce polyploidy in comparison to the shoot tips treatment.

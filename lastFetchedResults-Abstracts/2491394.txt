The paranasal sinuses are known to be a rare location for
                            metastasis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most frequent primary
                            tumor to metastasize to the sinonasal region, followed by lung and
                            breast cancer. In particular, clear cell type RCC, which represents
                            approximately 85% of RCCs, is characterized by early metastasis, and it
                            sometimes spreads to unusual sites (1, 2). Metastatic tumors in the
                            paranasal sinuses are distributed in the maxillary, sphenoid, ethmoid,
                            and frontal sinuses, in order of decreasing frequency. Symptoms are
                            usually nonspecific, but epistaxis is the most common sign, due to the
                            hypervascularity of the primary tumor. The prognosis is uncertain, but
                            the 5-year survival rate fluctuates between 15% and 30%. The purpose of
                            this case report is to document a rare case of silent RCC that first
                            presented as epistaxis due to nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus
                            metastasis.

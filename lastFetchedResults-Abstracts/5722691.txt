In data grids huge amount of data are generated and processed by users around the world. Objective of dynamic replica strategies is reducing file access time by reducing network traffic, which leads to reducing job runtime. In this paper a replication algorithm for a 3-level hierarchical structure and a scheduling algorithm are proposed. The simulation results with optorsim show better performance (over 13%) comparing to current algorithms.

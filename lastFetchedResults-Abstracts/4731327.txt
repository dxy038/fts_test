Due to the heterogeneity, mobility, instability and other features of NGI (Next Generation Internet), it is difficult to provide users with QoS (Quality of Service). And fault-tolerance needs to be improved in NGI. Thus, an intelligent fault-tolerant QoS unicast routing mechanism based on the outlook algorithm is proposed. The knowledge of fuzzy mathematics and probability theory is introduced to adapt the uncertainness on the measurement of network status and the fuzziness on user requirements and network parameters. In the case of single SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group) failure, the preventive SRLG-disjoint based shared-path protective routing strategy is used to improve the fault-tolerance in NGI. And the mechanism is based on the outlook algorithm to find the fault-tolerant QoS unicast routing with the end-to-end multi-objective optimum. Simulation results have shown that the proposed mechanism is feasible and effective.

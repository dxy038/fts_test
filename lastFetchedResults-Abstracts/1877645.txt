Objective
e of incentive spirometry (IS) is reported to prevent and treat postoperative pulmonary complications. This study sought to use the theory of planned behavior to predict the use of IS in this population.
s
udy used a prospective design, with convenience sampling, to recruit a total of 116 postcardiac-surgery patients from 2 medical centers in Taipei, Taiwan, from November 2008 to May 2009. Data were collected through 2 instruments: a demographic questionnaire, and an IS questionnaire. Descriptive analysis, independent t test, one-way analysis of variance, binary regression, and liner regression were used to analyze the data.
s
ved behavioral control, but not intention, was a predictor of the use of IS.
sion
ndings provide partial support for the utility of the theory of planned behavior in explaining the use of IS behavior for cardiac surgery patients.

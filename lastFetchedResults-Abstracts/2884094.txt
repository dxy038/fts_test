Jobs scheduling and load balancing functionalities are crucial for best Grid performance and utilization. In this paper, we present a dynamic and adaptive polyhedron topology-aware Grid load balancing method which we called Tun Grid. Its main objective is the extreme decentralization of the scheduling and the load balancing processes at the lowest processing and networking cost. It ensures load balancing through an adaptive local neighborhood propagation strategy of overload. Tun Grid was experimented using the Grid Sim simulator and compared to other methods. Experimental results are presented and discussed.

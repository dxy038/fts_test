In content delivery services, quality of service is greatly affected by the resources provided by the underlying overlay P2P. In order to maintain the level of resources acquired, soliciting peers´ resources contributions by giving explicit remunerations is a feasible solution. From the service providers´ perspectives, the remuneration should be minimized as long as the guaranteed services are fulfilled for all users. We consider a model defining the objective function to minimize this cost in service provision and a distributed and cost-efficient resource acquisition algorithm. Our results show that, in a network of the heterogeneous peers with limited local information, the service availability can be enhanced by appropriate resource acquisition schemes even in a heavily loaded network and the number of resource providers can be controlled by applying appropriate cost model.

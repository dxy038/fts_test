E-commerce as one of the most significant aspects of innovation in business processes is what takes place in companies across the world. The gap between information and communications technology and e-business application is called the digital divide. It is necessary to understand the reasons for the failure of commercial sites. Here the objective is to assess the commercial sites of Iran. Different methods are adopted to evaluate sites and electronic stores. The balanced scorecard is a rarely adopted method of concern to evaluate these sites in Iran. The survey methodology and Delphi technique are applied in building the research tools, which led to the development of a questionnaire.  Through applying the BSC approach, the numbers of indicators in each of the four perspectives of BSC were identified. The DEMATEL technique is applied to determine the importance of different perspectives and to identify the causal correlations among the four perspectives. The results generated by SMART PLS graphics, the Structural Equation Modeling software, confirm the adequacy of this proposed model for websites. The findings here indicate that the growth and learning perspective have the greatest impact on the other perspectives while the other perspectives mostly affect the financial perspective.

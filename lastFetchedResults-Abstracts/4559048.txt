Three-phase Dual Active Bridge (DAB) Y : Y/&#916; composite topology offers advantage of nearly sinusoidal converter-currents without pulse-width modulation, which can be utilized for D-Q mode control implementation. D-Q control is smooth and regulates power-factor of DAB which ensures zero voltage switching (ZVS) operation of the DAB converter at wide-range loading conditions. A practical DAB high-frequency transformer has certain limitations like small leakage-inductance, limited magnetizing-inductance and unwanted parasitic-capacitanceÂ´s which distort the primary-side currents at the rated high-voltage because primary inter-turn capacitance is high in per-unit for a real 100kW transformerdesign. This problem can be solved by using secondary currents and estimated magnetizing current to emulate primary-currents for D-Q control. Parasitic are introduced in the LV TIPS set-up by adding lumped elements to emulate real HV-transformer with objective to test the controls in worst case scenario. This paper proposes the solutions for some of the practical implementation problems of the control algorithm for the DAB.

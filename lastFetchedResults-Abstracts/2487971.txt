A novel multiple Objective Fitness Function (OFF) is proposed for transmission
parameter optimization in dynamic spectrum access. The proposed scheme consists
of two phases: In the rst phase, four OFFs are individually designed, where the spectrum
band index is additionally considered unlike the conventional OFFs. In the second phase,
then, the individual OFFs are combined to form a multiple OFF, where the individual
OFFs may be dierently stressed depending on the transmission scenario of interest. In
simulation results, nally, the proposed multiple OFF is found to provide the optimal
parameter set for transmission under various types of scenarios.

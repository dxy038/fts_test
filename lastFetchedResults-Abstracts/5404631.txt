In this paper, we propose and analyze APPCCM: an adaptive per-user per-object cache consistency management scheme for mobile Internet client-server applications in wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The objective of the proposed scheme is two-fold: to speedup data access and to mitigate the performance bottleneck at WMN gateways. In our proposed adaptive scheme, a data object can be cached at the mesh client (MC) directly or at a mesh router (MR) dynamically selected by APPCCM, such that the overall network cost incurred for the WMN to process the MC´s mobility and data access/update events is minimized. APPCCM is adaptive, per-user and per-object as the decision of where to cache a data object accessed by an MC depends on the MC´s mobility and object access/update characteristics, and the WMN conditions. We demonstrate via model-based analysis that APPCCM outperforms non-adaptive schemes that always cache a data object at the MC, or at the MC´s current serving MR for cache consistency management in WMNs.

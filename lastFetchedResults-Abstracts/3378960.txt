Video transmission in wireless environments is a challenging task calling for high-compression efficiency as well as a network friendly design. Both have been major goals of the H.264/AVC standardization effort addressing "conversational" (i.e., video telephony) and "nonconversational" (i.e., storage, broadcast, or streaming) applications. The video compression performance of the H.264/AVC video coding layer typically provides a significant improvement. The network-friendly design goal of H.264/AVC is addressed via the network abstraction layer that has been developed to transport the coded video data over any existing and future networks including wireless systems. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview over the tools which are likely to be used in wireless environments and discusses the most challenging application, wireless conversational services in greater detail. Appropriate justifications for the application of different tools based on experimental results are presented.

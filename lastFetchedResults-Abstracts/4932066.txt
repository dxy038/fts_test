Context-aware computing is emerging as a promising technology for mobile and pervasive environments. Unfortunately, complex context-aware applications are still hard to build. In this paper, we describe an 802.11 based indoor context-aware system used in hospital. Our objective is to empower mobile devices to recognize the context in which hospital workers perform their tasks. This system is an accessory of the management system in the hospital, and it can add Context-aware ability to the existing system by providing Context-aware communications. In our work, we use BAFO (Be Away From Obstacles) algorithm to deploy APs (Access Points), and use a Received Signal Strength (RSS) based Algorithm MNNSS (Modified Nearest Neighbor in Signal Space) to position mobile terminals, then describe the implementation of this multi-agent based system

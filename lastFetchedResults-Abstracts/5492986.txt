The security of wireless sensor networks is an important field of research about WSNs, and has attracted a lot of attentions nowadays. Reputation based trust systems represent soft security mechanisms that complement traditional information security. Nowadays, the research of trust security mechanism based on reputation and has become a hot research issue in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a new security protocol RARRM to construct trustworthy sensor networks. This protocol not only can distinguish different applications, but also can rank trust values. The objective of this protocol is not only to encourage nodes to provide good services consecutively to establish a security environment of network, but also to punish strictly those malicious nodes that are trying to take advantage of reputation system to launch malicious attacks. Through intensive simulation, we will verify the correctness and efficiency of the proposed defense techniques.

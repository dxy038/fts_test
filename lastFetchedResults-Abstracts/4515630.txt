This paper presents a new application of genetic algorithms (GAs) optimization technique for solving the steady state load-shedding problem. The objective is to minimize the sum of the squares of the difference between the connected active and reactive load and the supplied active and reactive power. The equality constraints associated with the problem of load shedding are the power flow equations. The inequality constraints are the voltage magnitudes and angles, active and reactive power generations and the limits on the line flows. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 14- and 30-bus systems. The effects of GAs parameters and operators, such as population size, crossover mutation probabilities, niching and fitness function, are studied. The results are reported and compared with the results of two earlier approaches.

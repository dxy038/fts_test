In many cases, a simulation model of a system is used to evaluate alternative configurations of that system, with the goal of finding the configuration which maximizes (or minimizes) the value of an objective while meeting all of the stated requirements. The CSIM18/OptQuest package automates this kind of search for the best configuration by combining a powerful simulation engine, CSIM18, and a state-of-the-art optimization package, OptQuest. This paper describes this integrated package for doing optimization and simulation. The paper concludes with two examples: finding the best configuration for a job-shop, and finding the best configuration for a web server

The objective of the present paper is to determine the relationship between perfectionism, perceived stress and social support with academic burnout among the MBBS students. Hence, 200 students (120 girl and 80boys) were selected from amongst the MBBS students of the Ahvaz University of Medical Sciences through stratified random sampling. The data were collected through Cohen, et. al, Perceived Stress Inventory (1983); Stabor Positive and Negative Perfectionism Inventory (2007); Philips Social Support Inventory (PSSI) (1984) and Brosu, et.al. Academic Burnout Inventory (2007). The data were analyze by employment of Pearson correlation coefficient and hierarchical step-by-step multiple regression. The findings of the research indicate that perceived stress and incompatible perfectionism have significant positive relation with academic burnout, while compatible perfectionism and social support have significant negative relation with academic burnout. Also, the results of step-by-step multiple regression through hierarchical method indicate that perceived stress is the best predictor of student academic burnout. The results are compatible with previous studies and the variables can be good predictors of academic burnout.

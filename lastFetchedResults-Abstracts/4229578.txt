This paper presents a simple Differential Evolution (DE) Optimization algorithm to solving security constrained optimal power flow (OPF) with consideration of shunt FACTS Controllers under contingent operation states. Fuel cost minimization, voltage profile, and system loadability improvement are three objective function used to test the efficiency of the proposed strategy. The proposed approach is examined and tested on the standard IEEE-30Bus test system with different objective functions and under sever loading conditions. In addition, the non smooth cost function due to the effect of valve point loading has been considered within the second practical network test (40 generating units). The simulation results compared with the other recent techniques. From the different case studies, it is observed that the results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach and show clearly its effectiveness to solve practical OPF under contingency situations.

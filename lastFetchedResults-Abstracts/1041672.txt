A numerical procedure for optimizing the shape of three-dimensional channel with angled ribs extruded on both walls is presented to enhance turbulent heat transfer. The response surface based optimization is used as an optimization technique with Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes analysis of fluid flow and heat transfer. Shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model is used as a turbulence closure. Computational results for heat transfer rate show good agreements with experimental data. Four dimensionless variables such as, rib pitch-to-rib height ratio, rib height-to-channel height ratio, streamwise rib distance on opposite wall to rib height ratio, and the attack angle of the rib are chosen as design variables. The objective function is defined as a linear combination of heat transfer and friction loss related terms with a weighting factor. D-optimal method is used to determine the training points as a mean of design of experiment. Sensitivity of the objective function to each design variable has been evaluated. And, optimal values of the design variables have been obtained in a range of the weighting factor.

Background and Objective: HESA-A is a natural compound with herbal-marine origin that its therapeutic effects have been proved in cancer. The present study investigated HESA-A drug effect in an inflammatory model in rats.

Materials and Methods: In this study, four groups of rats were used with a sample size of six in each group. These groups were negative control (distilled water), positive control (methylprednisolone) and treatment groups (HESA-A at dosages of 150 and 225 mg/kg). On the first day, the drugs were injected intra-peritoneally to rats. After thirty minutes, paw volume was measured by plethysmometer and immediately, formalin solution was injected subcutaneously into the hind paw of rats. After an hour, inflamed paw volume was measured. In days 2-8, the inflamed paw volume was measured and immediately drug was injected intra-peritoneally.

Results: In this study, comparing of the HESA-225 and control groups and also HESA-225 and HESA-150 groups, indicated significant differences in days 2-8. The mean volume of rats paw in HESA-225 group was significantly less than HESA-150 and control groups (p < 0.05).                            In addition, a significant decrease in the mean volume of ratsâ€™ paw was observed in methylprednisolone group as compared to control group in days 3-8 (p < 0.05). 

Conclusion: The HESA-A drug has a chronic anti-inflammatory effect following intraperitoneal administration.

OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to identify the clinical characteristics associated with an abnormal clomiphene citrate challenge (CC) test.
STUDY DESIGN: The medical records of 123 women seen in a referral-based infertility practice who had a CC test as part of their infertility workup were reviewed. Eighty-five patients had a normal CC test and 38 patients had an abnormal test. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were reviewed and analyzed.
RESULTS: Women with abnormal CC tests were significantly older, had a lower mean body mass index, family history of early menopause, and shorter cycle intervals. Patients with an abnormal CC test had a pregnancy rate significantly lower than other women in this case series.
CONCLUSION: Increased age, lower body mass index, shorter cycle intervals, lower cycle day 21 progesterone levels, and decreased pregnancy rates are associated with an abnormal CC test. Women with an abnormal CC test also tended to have a familial history of early menopause

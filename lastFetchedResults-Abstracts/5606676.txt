This paper discusses the use of a linear programming technique for the design of two-channel perfect reconstruction (PR) biorthogonal FIR filter banks with linear phase or low-delay. Both the objective function and the design constraints for the PR filter banks are formulated as a set of linear equations and inequalities. The method is simple and good stop-band attenuation can be obtained. Two design examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method

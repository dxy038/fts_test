Reaching consensus on a self-organized wireless sensor networks through totally decentralized algorithms is a topic that has attracted considerable attention. The average consensus method is the most popular algorithm used in this kind of applications. The main advantage of these approaches is that the network does not involve a fusion center to organize nodes. Using a realistic environment to check the behavior of this scheme is the major objective of this work. Moreover, this paper contributes to answer and confirm some results which are approved by theoretical works.

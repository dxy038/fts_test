Vehicular ad hoc networks are a subclass of wireless networks in which vehicles on the road act as nodes, exchanging traffic and road safety information. The main distinguishing feature of VANET is that they are highly dynamic and have variable speed and therefore, demands a reliable routing strategy. Our objective is to purpose a routing algorithm that provides the reliable route to the user for the data transmission. This routing protocol helps in detecting the link breakage, minimizes it and thereby improves the throughput. This mechanism is based on the mathematical model of normal (Gaussian) distribution, which is a continuous probability distribution function. This function is used to estimate the link reliability between the vehicular nodes in the road[1]. This route forms the Most Reliable Journey for the data transmission. Moreover, the Link expiration time will be computed based on the velocity and direction of the vehicle, then the route reliability value and route expiration time can be given as an input to fuzzy logic to find most reliable journey from source to destination considering both the velocity parameter and the direction parameter. Fuzzy logic will help in deciding the reliable value and the most reliable path for the vehicle.

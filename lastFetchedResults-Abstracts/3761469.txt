Doppler processing in pulsed radar is analyzed for time intervals which involve motion through range resolution cells, the emphasis being on the range-Doppler imaging of a rigid rotating body. The objective of the theory is to derive a method for compensating for motion through range and cross-range resolution cells. The compensation ion procedure described is compatible with optical data processing. With such a two-dimensional processor, the method permits simultaneous eous compensation for all points in the target field. The s consists of taking the Fourier transform in the range dimension, followed by a gentle distortion of this range-transform plane, and that followed by a two-dimensional Fourier transform. Two implementations with experimental results are briefly mentioned. One implementation is all optical and utilizes a holographic hyperbolic lens and/or holographic conical lens. The other implementation, involves applying the appropriate te distortion electronically as th " range sweeps" from the pulse train are received and put on film.

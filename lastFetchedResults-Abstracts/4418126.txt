This paper deals with the development of an efficient real time system for the simulation of time varying sound fields produced by moving sources and receiver in virtual reverberant environments. The system is composed of two parts: the impulse responses generator based on image-source model and a time varying hybrid reverberator employed to reproduce the spatial impression through impulse responses interpolation. In detail, the proposed approach overcomes the computational limitations related to use of the image-source method removing redundant information in the generated impulse responses and thus, decreasing the computational complexity required to perform the audio rendering operation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been proved taking into account different virtual reverberant environments and providing comparison with the state-of-art techniques in terms of objective and subjective measures.

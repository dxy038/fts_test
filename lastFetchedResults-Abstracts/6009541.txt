The paper presents an agent-based scheduling and energy management system for a smart distribution feeder which is installed on a test site and includes an electric car sharing fleet. Distributed Energy storage systems provide flexibility in the operation of the test site, where the integration of multiple power sources including Renewable Energy Sources and Distributed Generators is implemented. A software agent control architecture is introduced, which is divided into distinct subsystems in order to consider market roles of the Micro Smart Grid Operator, Car Sharing Operator and Distribution System Operator. Within this architecture, an optimization mechanism with the objective to maximize the utilization of Renewable Energy Sources for charging the electric vehicles is implemented and the functionality of the agent-based system is tested in response to a basic electric vehicle booking and charging scenario.

An interactive fuzzy-norm (FN) satisfying method for multi-objective reactive power sources planning is presented, by considering that the decision-maker (DM) has fuzzy goals for each of the objective functions. Through the interaction with the DM, the fuzzy goals of the DM are quantified by eliciting the corresponding membership functions. After determining the membership functions to solve a candidate for the satisfying solution, which is also a noninferior solution, if the DM specifies the reference membership values, the FN approach is applied for generating a corresponding global noninferior solution for the DMÂ´s goals. Then, by considering the current solution, the DM acts on this solution by updating the reference membership values. In this way the satisfying solution for the DM can be obtained. Results of the application of the proposed method are also presented

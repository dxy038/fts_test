Objective(s): The main characteristic of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is their ability to produce other cell types. Electromagnetic field (EMF) stimulates differentiation of MSCs into other cells. In this study, we investigated whether EMF can effect on the differentiation of MSCs into dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Materials and Methods: An EMF with a frequency of 50 Hz and two intensities of 40 and 400 µT 1hr/day was generated around the cells for a week. Afterwards, these cells were injected into the left ventricle of Parkinsonian rats. The rats survived for 2 weeks, and then sampling was performed. Results: The injected cells differentiated into DA neurons and sporadically settled in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Transplanted rats exhibited significant partial correction apomorphine-induced rotational behavior compared to Parkinsonian rats (5.0±0.1 vs 7.57±0.08). Results demonstrated that endogenous serum and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were altered in all experimental groups. The greatest increase was in group of 400 µT EMF in comparison with Parkinsonian rats (398±15 vs. 312±11.79 pg ⁄ mg). Current study have shown that 6-Hydroxydopamine can cause severe loss of dopaminergic neurons (68±6.58), but injected MSCs that exposed to 40 and 400 µT EMF increased dopaminergic neurons in SNpc ( 108±2.33  & 126±3.89) (P<0.001). Conclusion: Electromagnetic fields with particular frequencies stimulate MSCs. So, these cells had anti-Parkinsonian properties in our studies.

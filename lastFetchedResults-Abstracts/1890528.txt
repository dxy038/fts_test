Background: p-Nitrophenol (PNP) occurs as contaminants of industrial effluents and it is the most important
environmental pollutant and causes significant health and environmental risks, because it is toxic to many living
organisms. Nevertheless, the information regarding PNP degradation pathways and their enzymes remain limited.
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Pseudomonas Putida 1274 for removal of PNP.
Methods: P. putida MTCC 1274 was obtained from MTCC Chandigarh, India and cultured in the minimal medium
in the presence of PNP. PNP degradation efficiency was compared under different pH and temperature ranges. The
degraded product was isolated and analyzed with different chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques.
Results: P. putida 1274 shows good growth and PNP degradation at 37Â°C in neutral pH. Acidic and alkali pH
retarded the growth of P. putida as well as the PNP degradation. On the basis of specialized techniques,
hydroquinone was identified as major degraded product. The pathway was identified for the biodegradation of
PNP. It involved initial removal of the nitrate group and formation of hydroquinone as one of the intermediates.
Conclusion: Our results suggested that P. putida 1274 strain would be a suitable aspirant for bioremediation of
nitro-aromatic compounds contaminated sites in the environment.

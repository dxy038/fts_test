High strength woven fabrics are ideal candidate materials for use in structural systems where high energy absorption is required. One of the more widely used applications for woven fabrics is in propulsion engine containment systems. In this first part of a two-part paper, details of the experiments to characterize the behavior of dry fabrics including Kevlar® and Zylon® are presented. The experimental program to characterize the behavior of 1420 Denier Kevlar® 49 17 × 17, 500 Denier Zylon® AS 35 × 35, and 1500 Denier Zylon® 17 × 17 are discussed. The primary objective is to use the experimental results in the development of a constitutive model that can be used in an explicit finite element analysis program. These include Tension Tests in both the warp and fill directions of the fabric, Trellising Shear Tests and Friction Tests between fabric layers. The results from these tests provide the basis for development of the constitutive model – relating stresses to strains, characterizing failure and interaction between fabric layers. In addition to these basic material tests, tests on systems built with fabric wraps were also conducted. Ballistic tests of containment wraps subjected to a high velocity projectile were carried out at NASA-Glenn Research Center. While these tests provide a comparison between the energy absorbing characteristics of the three fabrics, they also provide benchmark results to validate the developed finite element methodology discussed in the second part of this paper.

We have developed an AlGaN/GaN-on-Si metal-oxide-semiconductor heterostructure field-effect transistor (MOSHFET) based bidirectional switch with embedded diode bridges for power switching applications. Four Schottky barrier diodes were embedded in an AlGaN/GaN MOSHFET to minimize the parasitic elements and thus reduce the chip area. The fabricated device functioned as a normally OFF, bidirectional switch, where the gate threshold voltage was ~1 V in both forward and reverses modes. The maximum drain current density in forward and reverse operation was ~120 mA/mm with the gate voltage of 12 V. The forward and reverse OFF-state breakdown voltages were 861 and 946 V, respectively.

This paper describes the activities performed by a working group formed with the objective to support and develop mathematical software for the LHC experiments. The goal is to share common mathematical libraries between the experiments and the LCG application area projects. We present the various library components and their design, with particular emphasis on fitting and minimization, describing the new object oriented implementation in C++ of the MINUIT minimization package.

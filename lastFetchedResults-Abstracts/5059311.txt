Tacit knowledge exists in knowledge workers in enterprises. To enable full sharing, reasonable knowledge sharing incentive and restraint mechanisms should be designed to accelerate spontaneous behaviors of employees so that it can improve the ability of innovation and competitiveness. According to principal- agency theory, and taking into account incomplete information of knowledge sharing, multi-stages incentive model of knowledge sharing for knowledge worker, and incentive model of knowledge sharing for knowledge team based on team sharing interests are proposed. The results indicate that, in order to acquire maximum rewards in enterprise, special incentive contracts are to be made for different knowledge main-bodies, optimal incentive decisions to meet enterprise own objective are to be made, and knowledge bodyÂ´s knowledge sharing effort is to be improved.

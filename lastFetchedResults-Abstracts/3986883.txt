This paper summarizes diverse concepts for the next generation of power distribution system. The objective is to bring distribution engineering more closely aligned to smart grid philosophy. Issues of design, operation, and control are discussed with regard to new system theoretic as well as component/materials advances. In particular, two transmission engineering techniques are modified for use in distribution engineering: state estimation, and locational marginal pricing. The impact of electronic control in distribution systems is discussed. Because education and training have a great impact on distribution engineering, these topics are discussed as well.

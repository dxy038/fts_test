We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for multicast tree construction in ad hoc networks. The objective is to connect a source node to a set of destination nodes with a sequence of transmissions so that the number of transmissions is minimized. The algorithm utilizes shortest path information, which can be obtained from unicast routing tables for fully distributed implementation. In addition to multicast routing, the algorithm is applicable to stateless multicast forwarding for small multicast groups.

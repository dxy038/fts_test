Broadcasting/Multicasting problems have been well studied in wireless ad hoc networks. However, only a few approaches take into account the low interference and energy efficiency as the optimization objective simultaneously. In this paper, we study the interference and power constrained broadcast/multicast and the delay-bounded interference and power constrained broadcast/multicast routing problems in wireless ad hoc networks using directional antennas. We propose an approximation and a heuristic algorithm for the two problems, respectively. Importantly, motivated by the study of above optimization problems, we propose approximation schemes for two multi-constrained directed Steiner tree problems, respectively. Broadcast/Multicast message by using the trees found by our algorithms tend to have less channel collisions and higher network throughput. The theoretical results are corroborated by simulation studies.

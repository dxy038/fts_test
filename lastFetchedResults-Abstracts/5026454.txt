The newly developed phase-shift controlled bidirectional DC-DC converter has the conventional features of phase-shifted converters, including zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and constant switching frequency. However, it has been improved by developing a bi-directional power flow capability and applying synchronous rectification, hence the on-state voltage drop of the active device is small

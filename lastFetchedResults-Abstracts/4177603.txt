A bilateral series resonant inverter for a high frequency link uninterruptible power supply is described. The proposed inverter consists of a zero current switched series resonant convertor, a high frequency transformer and a zero current switched cycloconvertor, where bidirectional power flow and high efficiency are obtained. In the proposed inverter, the output voltage is regulated by controlling the resonant tank energy. The switching pattern of the cycloconvertor is fixed to obtain the high frequency transformer. A new control scheme to minimise the output ripple voltage is suggested and verified through computer simulation and experiment, and the effects of the circuit parameters on the output voltage ripple are discussed

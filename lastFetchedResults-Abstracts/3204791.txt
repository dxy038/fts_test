Over-actuated feedback control system has advantages of increasing maneuverability and robust performance in fault situation but probability of fault occurrence is also increase because of the increasing the number of actuators and sensors. Furthermore if there has no appropriate fault tolerant strategy, more hazardous accident could occur so fault tolerant strategy is highly emphasized in over-actuated system. In over-actuated system, the number of operable control input is greater than the controlled variable so control input distribution is not unique for achieve same control objectives. In this research, fault diagnoses with inherent over-actuated system characteristic and make controller reconfiguration to achieve robust performance in fault situation. If there are some probabilities to exist fault situation, fault diagnosis system makes input perturbation which satisfied holonomic constraint to achieve same control objective and diagnoses fault components by analysis system response. Because input perturbations satisfy constraint equation, there is no change in system response in normal situation. But if some critical faults are exist, unintended system response could appear. Proposed fault diagnosis method is applied to 4 wheels independently driven vehicle to verify effectiveness of that method and evaluate the performance of fault diagnosis and controller reconfiguration.

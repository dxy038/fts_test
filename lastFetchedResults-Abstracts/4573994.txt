The increasing densities in growing size circuits leads us to consider as an issue noise problems such as crosstalk, switching noise, electromigration and substrate injection. Noise safety must be a clear objective in design tools, whose development must then include circuit models for the analysis of noise phenomena. This paper points out a proposed methodology in the development of new models and related tools that focus on the noise immunity of circuit design

Today, in the era of Internet of Things, an enormous amount of research is going on in the direction of probing into vehicle´s engine control units for collecting kinematic and diagnostic information, analyzing and integrating them with software platforms and providing valuable services to drivers and passengers. This is largely facilitated by the car´s several sensors forming an in-vehicle network which communicates with cloud servers and acts as effective suppliers of massive data. With this objective of efficient data collection and analysis, in this paper, a framework for a low cost integrated web-based platform is proposed for On Board Diagnostic services, vehicle tracking, theft detection and evaluation of a vehicle´s performance in terms of fuel efficient driving behavior. A hardware and software tool for communication with vehicle and analysis purpose has been developed.

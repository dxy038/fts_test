The reliability-redundancy allocation problem can be approached as a mixed-integer programming problem. It has been solved by using optimization techniques such as dynamic programming, integer programming, and mixed-integer non linear programming. On the other hand, a broad class of meta heuristics has been developed for reliability-redundancy optimization. Recently, a new meta-heuristics called firefly algorithm (FA) algorithm has emerged. The FA is a stochastic metaheuristic approach based on the idealized behavior of the flashing characteristics of fireflies. In FA, the flashing light can be formulated in such a way that it is associated with the objective function to be optimized, which makes it possible to formulate the firefly algorithm. This paper introduces a modified FA approach combined with chaotic sequences (FAC) applied to reliability-redundancy optimization. In this context, an example of mixed integer programming in reliability-redundancy design of an overspeed protection system for a gas turbine is evaluated. In this application domain, FAC was found to outperform the previously best-known solutions available.

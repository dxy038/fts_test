This article reports an inverse analysis of a transient conductionâ€“radiation problem with variable thermal conductivity. Simultaneous retrieval of parameters is accomplished by minimizing the objective function represented by the square of the difference between the measured and the assumed temperature fields. The measured temperature field is calculated from the direct method involving the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the finite volume method (FVM). In the direct method, the FVM is used to obtain the radiative information and the LBM is used to solve the energy equation. With perturbations imposed on the measured temperature data, minimization of the objective function is achieved with the help of the genetic algorithm (GA). The accuracies of the retrieved parameters have been studied for the effects of the genetic parameters such as the crossover and the mutation rates, the population size, the number of generations and the effect of noise on the measured temperature data. A good estimation of parameters has been obtained.

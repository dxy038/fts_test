A new miniaturized capsule with 32bit processor and bidirectional communication system is being developed for multitask application. The capsule is designed to be a platform for medical assistant application inside the body. The processor core SIRIUS has been developed, simulated, synthesized to a netlist and verified. The designed telemetry unit is a synchronous bidirectional communication block using continuous phase DQPSK of 115 kHz low carrier frequency for inductive data transmission suited for human body energy transfer. The communication system can assist the electronic pill to trigger an actuator for drug delivery, to record temperature, or to measure pH of the body. The complete system is designed to fit small-size mass medical application with low power consumption, size of 7x25 mm. The system is designed, simulated, emulated on FPGA, and routed in AMIS Technology.

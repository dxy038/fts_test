To limit the impact of the intermittence of wind power, a water storage ability of the hydraulic storage plant combined with a wind power plant, called the wind-hydro power system (WS), is used. The main objective is to limit the active power output variations of wind energy resource taking into account the grid needs and the available stored energy. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem with constraints by using the linear programming (LP). Based on the forecast information of the wind power, the power demand of the grid, the penalty cost, an optimal operation strategy is proposed to help the WS system for better using of wind energy and storage management. An example study case is presented. A comparison with classical approach of economic gain is also given to illustrate the interest of the proposed method.

This paper proposes a system based on Petri nets to implement asynchronous circuits by reconfigurable hardware automatically. The description, simulation, and analysis and synthesis of the structure and behavior of asynchronous systems should be possible at different levels of abstraction. The designed system should also be capable of implementing synchronous circuits. The objective is a correct mapping of concurrent processes to reconfigurable hardware

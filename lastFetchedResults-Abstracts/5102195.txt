The main objective of the paper is to introduce how the concept of tensor HOSVD can be carried over to the class of multi-variable TP (tensor product) functions, namely, how we can define and generate the "HOSVD like" decomposition of TP functions and define it as the HOSVD based canonical form. The key idea and the basic concept of this decomposition were proposed recently with the TP model transformation based control design methodology. The novelty of this paper is to present the mathematical background of this concept

Objective: Gestational diabetes mellitus occurs during pregnancy is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) is a surrogate maker of subclinical atherosclerosis. The aim of this study is assessment of relationship between CIMT and infra-renal abdominal aorta diameter in women with and without Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
Materials and Methods: The current case-control study was conducted in department of radiology of Shahid Sadoghi hospital in Yazd medical science university 2012 to 2013. Forty women between 20-40 years old with at least 6 months after pregnancy were enrolled, 20 participants with GDM in last pregnancy and 20 participants without history of GDM. All participants underwent physical exam and laboratory findings. Finally Carotid intima-media thickness and infra abdominal aorta diameter were obtained.
Results: over all comparison between GDM and non GDM groups revealed no significant difference in mean CIMT and infra-renal abdominal aorta diameter. FBS between two groups reveal significant statistically difference (P-value < 0.05). Also Pearson correlation analysis shows association between infera-renal abdominal aorta diameter and cholesterol and LDL in non GDM participate.
Conclusion: Our study suggested GDM may not relate to CIMT and infera-renal abdominal aorta diameter. Also current study revealed women with history of GDM are prone to having impaired fasting glucose.

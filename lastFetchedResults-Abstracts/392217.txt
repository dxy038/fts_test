Objective: To evaluate the fate of autograft and homograft cartilage used in the middle ear. Method: Animal experimental study was carried out on 20 healthy guinea pigs by implanting small pieces of auto- and homograft costal cartilage in the middle ears for different periods of time (1, 3 and 6 months). The grafts were removed and examined by light and electron microscopy. Cartilage autografts, obtained from seven human cases at revision tympanoplasty, were also examined by light and electron microscopy. Results: In the animal experimental study the chondrocytes were degenerated while the matrix was preserved in both auto- and homograft specimens. The homografts were as good as the autografts as in both cases the cartilage matrix was preserved. In the human specimens obtained after 10â€“15 months of implantation (six cases), the matrix was preserved, the lacunae were empty and the chondrocytes were degenerated. The specimen removed after 3  years (one case) showed viable chondrocytes of big size with defined cell organelles. Conclusion: This work provides evidence for the beneficial role of cartilage in middle ear surgery as the matrix retained its structure. There is also a possibility for the chondrocytes to remain viable for a long time after implantation. It seems also that homograft cartilage is a good option during tympanoplasty and is comparable to autografts. In the animal study the homografts were as good as the autografts as in both cases cartilage matrix was preserved.

This paper proposes into determining an appropriate electrical vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) model and its integration with a typical stand-alone wind energy system during wind speed variation as well as transient performance under variable load. The investigated system consists of a 3 kW variable speed wind turbine with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), diode rectifier bridge, buck-boost converter, bidirectional charge controller, transformer, inverter, AC loads and VRB. Vanadium redox batteries are well suited for this type of application because of their high efficiency, high scalability, fast response, long life and low maintenance requirements.

We propose a novel radio-over-fiber system to provide full-duplex services by using optical differential phase-shift keying modulation format at the central station for downstream and on-off keying remodulation of the downlink carrier at the base station (BS) for upstream. The optical carrier suppression modulation scheme is employed to simultaneously generate and up-convert 40-GHz optical millimeter wave. As the same optical carrier is used for both uplink and downlink, no additional light source is required at the BS, which greatly reduces the cost and simplifies the overall system. Simulations and experimental results show that the bidirectional 2.5-Gb/s data is successfully transmitted over 40-km single-mode fiber (SMF-28) with less than 2-dB power penalty

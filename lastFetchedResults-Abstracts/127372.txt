Gender socialization process, as a basis for the reproduction of gender inequalities, has undergone major changes. As societies move from traditional to modern conditions and old structures and values are questioned, re-defined male and female identities require examination by social scientists. The study's objective is to identify patterns of gender socialization and its changes over time. It relies on qualitative methods, using group discussions and participant observation. The research examines learned gender symbols and roles, shifts in the family structure, and changes in gender norms among women and men across three generational groups. The findings reveal broad and imbalanced changes in gender socialization among the new generation. The discrepancy between the aspirations and expectations of young women and existing realities has led to tensions between social forces.

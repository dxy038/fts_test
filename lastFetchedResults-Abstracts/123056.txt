The main objective of this research was to improve mathematics achievement of female high-school freshman students through teaching them two strategies for self-regulation in learning (i.e.writing journals and graphical feedback). Prior to instruction Rayvan test was used to control intelligence, following the instruction "self-regulation test" was used to evaluate self-regulation degree and a "teacher made test" was utilized to evaluate math achievement. The research sample was a group of sixty freshman students from a high-school, in Tehran's school district number 10 who were underachievers in mathematics and self-regulation. These students were divided randomly to four groups: a control group and three experimental groups. The control group did not receive any teaching. The first experimental group members were thought to carry on writing journals strategy, the second experimental group members were thought the graphical feedback strategy and the third group were taught to use both strategies.
Research results showed that the students who had learned the two strategies had a high mathematics achievement and self regulation significantly different, compared with the other two groups.

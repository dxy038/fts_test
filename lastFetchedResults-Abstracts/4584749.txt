We consider a network where each route comprises a backlogged source, a number of relays and a destination at a finite distance. The locations of the sources and the relays are realizations of independent Poisson point processes. Given that the nodes observe a TDMA/ALOHA MAC protocol, our objective is to determine the number of relays and their placement such that the mean end-to-end delay in a typical route of the network is minimized. We first study an idealistic network model where all routes have the same number of hops, the same distance per hop and their own dedicated relays. Combining tools from queueing theory and stochastic geometry, we provide a precise characterization of the mean end-to-end delay. We find that the delay is minimized if the first hop is much longer than the remaining hops and that the optimal number of hops scales sublinearly with the source-destination distance. Simulating the original network scenario reveals that the analytical results are accurate, provided that the density of the relay process is sufficiently large. We conclude that, given the considered MAC protocol, our analysis provides a delay-minimizing routing strategy for random, multihop networks involving a small number of hops.

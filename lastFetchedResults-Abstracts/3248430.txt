In this work, we explain the design of a chat robot that is specifically tailored for providing FAQBot system for university students and with the objective of an undergraduate advisor in student information desk. The chat robot accepts natural language input from users, navigates through the Information Repository and responds with student information in natural language. In this paper, we model the Information Repository by a connected graph where the nodes contain information and links interrelates the information nodes. The design semantics includes AIML (Artificial Intelligence Mark up Language) specification language for authoring the information repository such that chat robot design separates the information repository from the natural language interface component. Correspondingly, in the experiment, we constructed three experimental systems (a pure dialog systems associated with natural language knowledge based entries, a domain knowledge systems engineered with information content and a hybrid system, combining dialog and domain knowledge). Consequently, the information repository can easily be modified and focussed on particular topic without recreating the code design. Experimental parameters and outcome suggests that topic specific dialogue coupled with conversational knowledge yield the maximum dialogue session than the general conversational dialogue.

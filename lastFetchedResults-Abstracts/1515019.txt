This study proposes a new optimization approach for the simultaneous determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers (BTEX) from water samples using the solid-phase microextraction technique followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) separation and detection. The objective of the study was to achieve compromise extraction conditions, suitable for all semi-volatile and volatile compounds, under which the amount extracted is maximized for all analytes. This was achieved by careful optimization of the fiber coating, salting-out effect, extraction time and temperature and extraction mode (headspace or direct immersion). With the optimized fiber coating – PDMS/DVB 65 μm – the other selected factors were optimized using a response surface methodology through central composite designs. As expected, the optimized results for each class of analytes varied significantly, probably due to the differences in their volatility and the equilibrium constants for the analyte/fiber coating. In order to overcome this issue, a new optimization approach was proposed based on a combination of extraction modes and extraction temperatures in a single extraction procedure. The final optimized procedure was: 48 min of extraction in direct immersion mode with the sample maintained at 80 °C followed by a further 32 min of headspace extraction with the sample temperature kept at 10 °C. The proposed procedure was compared with conventional methods based on the use of a single extraction mode and temperature (80 min of headspace extraction at 60 °C or 80 min of direct immersion extraction at 50 °C). The newly proposed method was shown to be more attractive as it extracted higher amounts of both semi-volatile and volatile compounds in a single extraction procedure compared to the conventional approaches. The optimized method was validated and excellent results were obtained.

In the last decade much research effort has been dedicated to deal with the issues of wireless multimedia communication, in particular, the bandwidth limitation (capacity) and channel impairment (intersymbol interference - ISI) experienced by wireless communication systems in the transmission of multimedia data such as, digital images/video. To overcome the problem of ISI caused by multipath propagation in a wireless environment, various channel coding and equalization schemes have been developed. We have recently proposed a new scheme for blind channel equalization. In this paper, we test this scheme for wireless image transmission. Simulation results show that the low complexity of implementation and the fast convergence rate are the major advantages of employing the new scheme for multimedia applications. It is also shown, from perceptual-based analysis as well as objective measurements using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the recovered image, that the recently-proposed blind adaptive equalization algorithm outperforms existing methods

Various procedures based on scanning electron microscope have been applied to the microtopographical study of solid surfaces. This paper presents a reconstruction method of surface morphology with genetic algorithms from secondary electron signals in the scanning electron microscope. In comparison with stereometric and multiple-detector methods, the proposed system requires only conventional secondary electron detectors for a line profile reconstruction in one direction. To deal with statistical fluctuations in the gray level of each pixel on the experiment line scan, the reduced chi-square distribution is used as the objective function and a scheme for minimizing the number of vertexes in the reconstructed surface profile is adopted. To test the capability of the method, a surface profile is successfully reconstructed from a line scan along the center of a latex on a substrate

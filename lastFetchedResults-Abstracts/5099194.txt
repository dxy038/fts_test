The objective of the paper is to develop methodology to analyse the impact of market-based electric heating load control on the distribution network business. In this paper, the spot market-based load control scheme is demonstrated. The main target of the paper is to illustrate the phenomenon of space electric heating load control and its impact on the distribution network. The conflict of interests between the retailer and the DSO is demonstrated. The power band pricing scheme is suggested to be one way to solve the conflict. In the future, micro generation and energy storages could also relieve the conflict. AMR data, electricity spot market prices and outdoor temperature are used in the analyses.

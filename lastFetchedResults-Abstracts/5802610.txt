The vast proliferation in the continuously changing telecommunications environment of Next-Generation-Networks (NGNs) poses strict requirements for the dynamic adaptation of mobile devices according to the user needs, system resources and Radio Access Technology (RAT) availability. The reconfiguration concept emerges as a paradigm that offers an effective solution to this problem. On the other hand, the operation of mobile devices offering cognitive functionalities is characterized by a significant number of parameters, many of which are contradictive and cannot be simultaneously optimized, thus constituting reconfiguration a multi-objective optimization problem. This work proposes a solution to the problem, addressing efficient decision making mechanisms to avoid the ping-pong effect of multiple reconfigurations and exploiting fuzzy logic reasoning approach for terminal reconfiguration decision, focusing on resource management and protocol configuration.

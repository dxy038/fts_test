ISO 3382-1 describes a number of objective room acoustics parameters that are generally accepted as useful for rating some specific aspects of concert hall sound fields. They include measures of decay times, energy ratios, measures of sound strength and several quantities related to the spatial aspects of sound fields. In most cases there are details of the measures, or their application, that raise questions. In general, there has not been a lot of practical research to explore how best to develop and use these objective measures to evaluate conditions in concert halls. For some well established measures such as Early Decay Time (EDT), we are not really sure how best to calculate their values. For other measures such as energy ratios, modifications are often proposed but without the support of subjective evaluations of the proposed changes. In other cases, such as measures of spatial impression, two approaches have been suggested, but their relative merits are not well understood. It is easy to propose ever more complex measures, but it is much more difficult to demonstrate their general utility. On the other hand, some commonly described characteristics do not have accepted related objective measures. Many more important and more general problems relate to the need, for design criteria in terms of each quantity, and for an improved understanding of just noticeable differences for each measure. This paper discusses each measure illustrating particular problems with measurements in various halls.

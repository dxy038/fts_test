An optimal feedback law, which minimizes an objective function, also contains the delayed states and the stored states. It was not clear how to decide the design parameters using the control law. In this paper, we present the stability conditions and describe the stability domain in the coefficient plane for an LMI. A design method for the optimal regulator is proposed and the control law is applied to the thixoforming system which involves an electric furnace.

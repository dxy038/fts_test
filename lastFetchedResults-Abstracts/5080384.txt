In less-than-truckload terminals arriving trucks have to be allocated to a gate and to a time slot for unloading. The allocation to a specific gate results in different transportation volumes for the forklift trucks inside of the terminal, depending on the destinations of the truck&#8217;s loads. While minimizing these transports the time for trucks waiting to be ordered to a gate also has to be minimized. For the first time this problem has been tackled as a 2-objective optimization problem and was solved by an (1+1)-evolution strategy. We developed a model which is derived from real freight forwarder&#8217;s data and represents a small company&#8217;s terminal on an average workday.

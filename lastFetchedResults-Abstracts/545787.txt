Objective
Data on the relationship between iron deficiency anemia and febrile convulsions
are controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the association between
iron deficiency anemia and febrile convulsions among children
Materials & Methods
This case-control study was conducted during 2006-2007, on 90 children with
febrile seizures (case) and 90 febrile children without seizures (control) referred
to the Amirkola children hospital (a referral hospital in the north of Iran).
Two groups were matched for age and sex. In all children hemoglobin (Hb)
level, hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular
hemoglobin (MCH) and plasma ferritin (PF) were determined and the data
collected were analyzed statistically using the t-test.
Results
The mean PF and TIBC levels were not significantly different in the febrile
seizure compared to the reference group; neither were differences in Hb levels
statistically significant between two groups. However MCV and MCH were
significantly higher in the febrile seizure group (p < 0.05) compared to reference
group.
Conclusion
Plasma ferritin levels were not significantly lower in children with febrile
seizures in comparison with the children in control group. It seems that iron
insufficiency does not play a role in pediatric febrile seizures.

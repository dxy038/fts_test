The basic objective is to build a PIC microcontroller based methodology to create and circumvent the non linear dynamics in a DC-DC converter through the use of a Variable Structure Control (VSC). The design of control scheme for such converters is challenging in view of the fact that it embodies a variety of non-linear dynamic properties such as bifurcation, sub-harmonics and chaos that creates unpredictability in the process of power conversion. A trajectory based approach serves to effectively visualize the chaotic phenomenon through phase portraits. The crux of the problem is to control the non-linear dynamics in order to ensure a stable operation. The performance of projected idea is evaluated through experimental investigation to illustrate its suitability to extend the working range of the system.

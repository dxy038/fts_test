The objective of this research was to develop the low - cost blood pressure simulator for verifying of oscillometric automated sphygmomanometer in Thailand and compared this simulator with commercial simulator Fluke Cufflink. The testing results of the precision and the accuracy of pressure generation showed that the average percentage error and percentage precision were 0.5 % and 100 % successively. Finally, oscillometric BP devices (6 models from 5 manufacturers) were tested for checking the performance of the simulator. The results of the performance testing showed that the percentage error and precision were ol % and 99 % sequentially. We expected to continue to improve for the better quality and will be commercialized to be used to verify the automated sphygmomanometer in Thailand afterwards.

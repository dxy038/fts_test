Objective: Our aim was to determine whether retention of cerclage after preterm premature rupture of the membranes occurring before 34 completed weeks’ gestation influences pregnancy outcome. Study Design: Singleton pregnancies with cerclage and premature rupture of the membranes between 24.0 and 34.9 weeks were reviewed. Women were excluded if they were first seen in labor, had chorioamnionitis, or were delivered within 48 hours. Control subjects consisted of women with premature rupture of the membranes without cerclage. Results: Eighty-one cases of cerclage with premature rupture of the membranes met criteria for inclusion: 30 women (37%) had their cerclage removed at presentation, and 51 (63%) retained the cerclage until delivery. Cases were similar in terms of gestational age at placement and gestational age at premature rupture of the membranes. There was no significant difference between the retained, removed, or control groups in terms of latency, gestational age at delivery, chorioamnionitis, or neonatal morbidity and mortality. Conclusions:Retention of cervical cerclage after premature rupture of the membranes occurring before 34 completed weeks’ gestation is associated with comparable clinical outcomes with respect to latency and perinatal outcome, when compared with removal of the cerclage.

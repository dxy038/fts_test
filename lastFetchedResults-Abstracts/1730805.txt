A strategy is explored for synthesizing latex particles with polystyrene cores and poly(vinyl acetate) shells. The seed particles are poly(vinyl acetate), which theory indicates should be immune to secondary particle formation when a second-stage seeded emulsion polymerization with styrene is carried out. The objective is to form a single hydrophobic core by inversion of the second and first stages. While this morphology is favoured thermodynamically, conditions need to be optimized so that it is kinetically achievable: many attempts to implement this using straightforward synthetic procedures result in either no core (acorn morphology) or multiple polystyrene cores. A series of experiments enables this goal to be implemented by ensuring sufficiently fast diffusion of the first-stage hydrophilic polymer (using chain-transfer agent to reduce the molecular weight and, more importantly, the degree of branching of the parent poly(vinyl acetate) seed polymer), an initiator which minimized grafting between the first- and second-stage polymers, and modifying the seed poly(vinyl acetate) to increase its hydrophilicity.

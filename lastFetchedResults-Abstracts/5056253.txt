Objective of the overall system is that of understanding (and demonstrating) what are the tasks that a robotic crew assistant must be able to execute, in order to be effective for space exploration missions. One of the most important tasks to be accomplished is the autonomous grasping of objects, which has been achieved through a vision and force-based control strategy. This paper deals with the completion of the autonomous grasping task previously described.

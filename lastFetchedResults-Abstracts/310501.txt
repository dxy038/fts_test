Objective. In order to understand the biomechanical consequences of ligament injuries and surgical reconstruction procedures, their effects on intra-articular loading in the ankle joint complex and Chopart joint lineand on the plantar pressure patterns were investigated in vitro.

Methods. Twelve fresh-frozen lower leg specimens were freed of soft tissue down to the malleoli and prepared for accessing the talocrural, subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints. The specimens were fixed in a loading simulator and axially loaded with 600 N in six experimental conditions: intact; after cutting the anterior talofibular ligament; after additionally cutting the calcaneofibular ligament; after performing three common types of tenodeses, the Evans, Watson-Jones and Chrisman-Snook procedures. The intra-articular loading characteristics were determined with pressure sensitive film. Plantar loading patterns were measured with a capacitive EMED pressure distribution platform.

Results. Average intra-articular pressures were increased and were related either to decreased contact areas or to increased contact forces found in all joints after ligament resections and tenodeses. Plantar loading was increased under the medial aspect of the foot and decreased under the midfoot region.

Conclusions. The results indicate that ankle ligament injuries, as well as surgical reconstructions by tenodeses, affect joint loading characteristics and may exacerbate joint degeneration.

In this paper, Guaranteed Convergence Particle Swarm Optimization (GCPSO) Algorithm is used for VAr planning with the Static Var Compensators (SVC) in a large-scale power system. To enhance voltage stability, the planning problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem for maximizing fuzzy performance indices. The multi-objective VAr planning problem is solved by the fuzzy GCPSO and the results are compared with those obtained by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm

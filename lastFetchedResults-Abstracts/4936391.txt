A 16 mm<sup>3</sup> autonomous solar-powered sensor node with bidirectional optical communication for distributed sensor networks has been demonstrated. The device digitizes integrated sensor signals and transmits/receives data over a free-space optical link. The system consists of three die - a 0.25 &#956;m CMOS ASIC, a 2.6 mm<sup>2</sup> SOI solar cell array, and a micromachined four-quadrant corner-cube retroreflector (CCR), allowing it to be used in a one-to-many network configuration. The CMOS ASIC includes a photosensor integrated 3 MHz oscillator, 69 pJ/bit optical receiver and 31 pJ/sample ADC.

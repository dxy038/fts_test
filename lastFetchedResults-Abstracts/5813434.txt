The objective of our research has been to achieve energy-saving key-value store system. We introduce architecture of our distributed key value store and control framework for energy saving. To reduce power consumption, the control framework should reduce the time required before node power-down. Since this time depends heavily on the amount of data migration, we employ an approach which reduce that amount. We describe and evaluate three control strategies that can be executed on this control framework, each consisting of a data allocation algorithm and data control layout algorithm for use when nodes are to be powered down. With a prototype system developed for evaluation purposes, the time required before node power down is reduced by use of our proposed data allocation algorithm, by means of its taking into account the possible presence of Write off-loading nodes.

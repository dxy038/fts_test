OFDMA will be the dominant multi-access method in 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) system. Multiuser scheduler plays an important role in optimizing its shared data channel (SDCH). This paper proposes and investigates a multi-carrier gradient scheduling algorithm with minimum/maximum rate constraints (MC-GMR) for downlink SDCH. The objective of MC-GMR scheduler is to maximize the system utility as well as provide quality of service (QoS) guarantee for data service. Performance is evaluated through system level simulations.

This paper has firstly designed a type of flexible finger based on the bidirectional active bending joint we have developed before; then we regard the finger as the actuator, and do the flexible clamping force experiments on the finger with loading the air pressure using the idea of the master-slave control based on computer; consequently, we acquire the influence on impact force under different control strategies, which is valuable for the dynamic analysis and motion accuracy control of the flexible robot hand.

Despite of undeniable necessity and positive achievements, social security programs face important challenges and crises regarding financing. One of these challenges is related to financing by selecting tax resources or insurance contributions. The countries such as England and Denmark prefer tax revenues for this purpose while Germany and France use insurance contributions. At the present time in Iranian tax and social security systems, there is no definite relationship between government tax revenues and social security and the related expenditures are financed mainly through insurance revenues (except allocating one percent of VAT to health care in 1393 budget and social security institutionsâ€™ budget deficit which is provided through state general budget). Surely, selecting one of these resources depends not only on historical backgrounds and increasing models of social security in countries but also on essential criteria such as efficiency, fairness, transparency and easiness. According to the Islamic resources, directions and related arguments, this paper attempts to prove tax revenues are the most preferred via insurance revenues. The other objective of this paper is to analyze positive consequences of selecting tax revenue.

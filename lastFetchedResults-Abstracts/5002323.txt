State estimator application is the core advanced application in the Energy Management system (EMS) that provides major inputs to other advanced network applications that are executed to determine power system security in the real-time. Those applications include transient and voltage stability analysis that are also responsible for calculation and download of the remedial action schemes arming patterns to the field in the real-time. For this reason, state estimator performance quality is highly important to BCTC real-time operations. State estimator relies on the quality of status and analog real-time telemetry and is also strongly dependent on the quality of network model parameters such as line and transformer impedances and charging admittances. The objective of this paper is to describe the maintenance practices adopted at British Columbia Transmission Corporation to ensure high quality and robustness of EMS state estimator with an emphasis on network parameter quality tracking and improvement.

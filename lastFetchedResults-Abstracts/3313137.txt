In the recent years, hybrid reverberation algorithms have been widely explored aiming to reproduce the acoustic behavior of real environment at low computational load. On this basis, exploiting the advantages introduced from hybrid reverberation structures, a novel approach for the reproduction of moving listener position through impulse responses (IR) interpolation has been presented in this paper. In particular, the presented methodology allows to remove redundant information in large IR database also decreasing the memory usage and the computational complexity required to perform the auralization operation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been proved taking into account a real IR database and also providing comparison with the existing state-of-art techniques in terms of objective and subjective measures.

The determination of power quality levels, through objective approach, is based on recordings of measurement information. For a more complete characterization of power quality parameters, the measurement process is required to include measurements of the alternating current as well, as specified in IEC 61000-4 series regulations "Electromagnetic Compatibility". In this article we present aspects envisaging both the alternating electric current measurement and the determination of measurement uncertainty with reference to IEC 61000-4-30 requirements for Class A, Class S and Class B.

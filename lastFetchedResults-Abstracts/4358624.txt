One fundamental problem with streaming audio and video data over unreliable IP networks is that packets may be dropped or arrive too late for playback. Traditional error control schemes are not attractive because they either add redundant information that may worsen network traffic, or rely solely on the inadequate capability of the decoder to do error concealment. The authors propose a simple yet efficient transformation based algorithm in order to conceal network losses in streaming real time audio and video data over the Internet. In the receiver side, we adopt a simple reconstruction algorithm based on interpolation, as sophisticated concealment techniques cannot be employed in software based real time playback. In the sender side, we design a linear transformation with the objective of minimizing the mean squared error, assuming that some of the descriptions are lost and that the missing information is reconstructed by simple averaging at the destination. We further integrate the transformations in case of video streaming in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to produce an optimized reconstruction based DCT. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs well in real Internet tests

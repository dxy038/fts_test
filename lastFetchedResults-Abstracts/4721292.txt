This paper describes the case study of a client-server system that allows real-time operation of a remote robot over an unreliable Internet connection. An operator can explore the remote environment and receive sensor and multimedia feedback. Different control strategies and their suitability are discussed. The engineering objective is to perform robust real time manual control over the Internet connection characterized by varying bandwidth and latency

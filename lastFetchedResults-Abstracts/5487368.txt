Current program mode controllers have not been widely adopted in low-power high frequency dc-dc converters due to the need for an integrated high gain-bandwidth current sensor circuit. This paper presents a peak current program mode controller IC with integrated power-stage that operates at 10 MHz and does not require any high gain-bandwidth analog circuitry in current or voltage loops. A custom bidirectional hybrid delay-line architecture emulates the inductor current based on input and output voltages. A novel calibration circuit is introduced to remove the mismatches between the actual and observed inductor current slopes. The controller consumes 210 &#956;A when the calibration block is off and 430 &#956;A during calibration and the peak efficiency of the converter is 87%.

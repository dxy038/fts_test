The major objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of the 5-year exclosure at Goladam station of Salmas rangelands.Vegetation type and  dominant species of this area was Bromus tomentellus and Festuca ovina. Changes in total forage production, plus canopy cover percentage, range condition and trend of this rangeland were measured, evaluated and then analysed statistically. Results of this study indicated that range condition and trend of this rangeland improved considerably. Total plant cover and forage production of the protected area increased. Vegetation cover and density of the plant species class I and II increased while species class III decreased considerably throughout the study period. It seems that the 5-year exclosure is an appropriate exclusion period for this area. Further investigations are recommended for find decisions.

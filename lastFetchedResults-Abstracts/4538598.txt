An AC-AC current-regulated pulse density modulated (PDM) power converter is presented. The MOS-controlled thyristor (MCT) is used in this converter due to its many advantages over existing power devices. A unique bidirectional switch configuration is used which allows the MCT to switch easily at zero voltage. The converter performance is evaluated driving a 5-hp induction motor.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

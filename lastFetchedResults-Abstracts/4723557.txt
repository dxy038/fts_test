The objective of this study is to explore the phenomenology of near infrared (NIR) light interaction with healthy and early-lung cancer by combining efficient polarimetric backscattering detection techniques with Polarimetric Exploratory Data Analysis (pEDA). Preliminary results indicate that enhanced discrimination signatures can be obtained for certain types of lung cancers.

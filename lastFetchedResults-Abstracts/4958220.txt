In this paper, we consider representations and formulations of systems of rigid bodies suitable for performance assessment, computer simulation and motion animation. In performance assessment, more realistic models of humanoids can be constructed. These models allow the integration of the information processing of the central nervous system in the car-humanoid model. Specifically, the effects of short- and long-loop delays of the efferent and afferent paths and effects of early warning systems of impending collisions can be assessed. In computer simulations, modularity of the formulation, ease of integration of man-made and/or natural actuators, realistic interaction with the environment and object manipulation, inclusion of passive tissue, and collaborative tasks of humans and robots in joint efforts are the primary objectives. In computer animation, the objective is to integrate into the programs more mechanical and physiological factors that allow wider use of such animations for teaching, research, and design. We consider state space formulations that allow integration of dynamics, control, stability and measurement and sensory subsystems. We develop systematic procedures to allow construction of Lyapunov functions for global and local stability. We consider actuation, sensing, and central controllers.

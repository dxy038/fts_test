Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different types of pregnancy-induced hypertension on fetal growth. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on the basis of 16,936 births from January 1, 1989, through December 31, 1990, by means of data from a population-based perinatal database in Suzhou, China. Pregnancy-induced hypertension was classified as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or severe preeclampsia-eclampsia. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to examine the effect of the various types of pregnancy-induced hypertension on gestational age, preterm birth, birth weight, low birth weight, and intrauterine growth restriction. Results: Gestation was 0.6 week shorter in women with severe preeclampsia than in normotensive women (P< .01). However, the risk of preterm birth was not increased with any classification of pregnancy-induced hypertension (for severe preeclampsia: adjusted odds ratio 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-3.47). After adjustment for duration of gestation and other confounders, preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia increased the risk of intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight. The adjusted odds ratios of low birth weight were 2.65 (1.73-4.39) for preeclampsia and 2.53 (1.19-4.93) for severe preeclampsia. However, the risk of low birth weight was not increased significantly for gestational hypertension (adjusted odds ratio 1.56 [1.00-2.41]). Conclusion: Preeclampsia increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:207-13.)

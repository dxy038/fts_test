This paper presents a fuzzy multiobjective optimization and genetic algorithm based method to find optimum power system operating conditions. The objectives and constraints are modeled by fuzzy sets. The problem is formulated as a multiple objective problem subject to operational and electrical constraints. The proposed method uses the genetic algorithms (GA) to solve fuzzy optimization problem. In addition to active power losses, series reactive power losses of power transmission system are also considered as one of multiple-objectives. TCSC (thyristor controlled series capacitor) is considered as a control device together with shunt VAR sources, generators and transformers. Simulation results obtained from test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

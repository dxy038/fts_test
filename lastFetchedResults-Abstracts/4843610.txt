Imperceptibility is a concern in all watermarking techniques. Consequently, most algorithms use a psychovisual mask. Interpolation techniques offer interesting perceptual properties and have been abundantly studied in image processing. This article aims at defining a class of watermarking algorithms that take advantage of this property. This class generalizes previous work on bilinear interpolation. A theoretical performance study is proposed. Moreover, optimal decoding as well as objective imperceptibility and security measures are provided for the whole class. An application to spline interpolation is studied.

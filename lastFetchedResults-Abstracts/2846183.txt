One of the electrical distribution companyÂ´s aim is to maintain the power supply to customers. In rural distribution feeders the proliferation of nest over the electric towers has committed this objective and actually the efforts of electrical companies to maintain clean their lines are huge. The problems occur when parts of nest caused the electrical contact between conductor and steel tower producing High Impedance Faults (HIF) and sometimes tripping protection. In this paper this problem is addresses, experimental tests were carried out in MV feeder to show this type of HIF is detectable from substation and a characterization of signal measured could be used to relay protection reprogramming.

The objective of this paper is two-fold. First, to adapt the earlier cognitive interactive framework for speech retrieval application and second, to enhance the accuracy of continuous speech retrieval system using fuzzy word mesh representing linguistic knowledge of users. The proposed method recognizes the audio query and retrieves the audio file(s) in corpus using an information retrieval (IR) Engine. We have used CMUSphinx4 Library for automatic speech recognition after adapting it to Indian accent and lab environment. The IR Engine in the back-end uses Fuzzy Logic based reasoning and knowledge-based filtering to retrieve relevant sentences (transcribed).

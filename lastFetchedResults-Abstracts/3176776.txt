Wind turbine vane is the key components of wind power generators effectively capture the wind. RTM is a manufacture technology of advanced composite materials, low cost, medium batch blade. Some random factors often lead to the production schedule can not be predetermined program normally. It can help reduce production costs that with the start-up costs were study of production scheduling on single injection machine vane manufacture. It is focused on the applications of queuing theory in the anemoscope processing problems of wind turbine. After a statement of the basic problem, various situations involving possibility knowledge are investigated. The single injection machine vane manufacture model based on N-policy M/G/1 is established. Making the lowest total cost of the system as the objective function to optimize the problem, it is found the most optimal number of buffer vane.

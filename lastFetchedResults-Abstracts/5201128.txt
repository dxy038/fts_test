The objective of this paper is to present a detailed description of the operation of an ad hoc network based on the Quadrature Division Multiple Access (QDMA) patent. The QDMA patent alludes to a communication paradigm for building code division multiple access (CDMA) based networks in the absence of base stations. The nodes in the QDMA network organize themselves as a hierarchical collection of squads, each having a node that manages the communication process among the squad members. To the best of our knowledge, there is no definitive explanation of any QDMA-based protocols in the literature. Herein, we describe, in detail, our understanding of the architecture of the QDMA-based network, as well as protocols for establishing and maintaining QDMA networks and for communicating among the mobile nodes. Our immediate objective is to present protocol definitions sufficient for doing meaningful performance analysis and for understanding the properties of QDMA-based ad hoc networks.

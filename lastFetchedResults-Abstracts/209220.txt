Introduction & Objective: Osteoarthritis is the most common
joint disease of humans. Acupuncture is one of the treatments for
osteoarthritis. This study aimed to compare Ibuprofen with
acupuncture in the pain reduction in knee osteoarthritis
Materials & Methods: This is a clinical trial which was
performed in Shiraz Medical School Clinics in 2007. Forty six
patients with chronic pain due to the knee osteoarthritis were
recruited using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the
patients were randomly divided into two groups (A and B) who
received Ibuprofen (1200 mglday) or acupuncture (2 sessions
per week) for 2 weeks, respectively. Evaluating measuring tools
were pain intensity (based on VAS), ROM (based on degree)
and morning stiffness of the knee joint. Collected data were
analyzed by Chi-Square test, using SPSS software.
Results: Pain intensity at baseline, after the course 01 treatment
and 3 weeks after the treatment in group A was 7.29 ± 0.61,
4.20±093 and 5.20± 132 em, respectively; while these tigures
for group B were 7.35±0.82, 3.43±0.96 and 4.93±1.32 em,
respectively (p<0.005). Also knee ROM degree in group A was
21.54±7.46, 13.08±5.60 and 15.38±3.2; and for group B was
20.36±7.19, 12.40±5.78 and 10.36±5.30, respecfively (p~0.003).
Knee morning sliffness improved more in group B.
Conclusion: Result of this study showed that both modalities
significantly reduced the pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis
and improved ROM while morning stiffness improved more in
group B.

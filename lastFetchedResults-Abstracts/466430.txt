Objective: We performed a prospective trial to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy, and safety of a postoperative fever algorithm that is based on symptoms and physical examination in an attempt to decrease the random use of urine cultures, blood cultures, and chest radiographs. Study Design: Our fever algorithm consisted of assessing all febrile postoperative patients for signs and symptoms of infection. If none were present, no tests were ordered. Results: Twenty-eight of 105 consecutive patients (27%) had postoperative fever after major gynecologic surgery. Three of 28 febrile patients (11%) were evaluated with tests according to the algorithm. Two of 28 febrile patients (7%) were evaluated in violation of the algorithm. Four febrile patients (14%) had documented infections. Two patients had infections within the first 30 days after discharge. Compared with our previous retrospective review, significantly fewer febrile patients were evaluated with testing with a significantly increased yield of positive test results. Conclusions: Our postoperative fever evaluation algorithm that is based on symptoms and physical examination is feasible, is safe, decreases random testing, and increases the yield of positive test results.

We propose an objective function to determine the focus step and the drift parameters for HRTEM images. Searching for the maximum value of this objective function, we can determine the focus step and the top-left coordinates of the imagesÂ´ corresponding region. Based on these optimized parameters, exit wave reconstruction can then be performed for experimental images. In this paper, we focus on the investigation of the characteristic of the objective function and prove its effectiveness thereby.

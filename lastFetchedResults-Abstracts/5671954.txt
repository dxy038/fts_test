A collaborative effort has been undertaken at both UMIST and Rensselaer to use interactive computer graphics to develop an improved user interface for the UMIST suite of programs for performing analysis, design, and synthesis of control systems. The objective is to explore ways in which presently available and newly emerging interactive graphics terminals can be employed with this specific suite and with control design packages in general. This paper is a presentation of the plans for this project and a report on its progress to date.

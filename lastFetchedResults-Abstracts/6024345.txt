This paper mainly focuses on the development of high efficiency non-isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter with large voltage diversity. The proposed converter can operate with soft switching using a technique of zero-voltage switching (ZVS). Coupled-inductor and voltage clamped circuit with only three switches, operating in synchronous rectification fulfill the objective of bidirectional control. Operation principle and design procedure of the converter is discussed and its feasibility is confirmed with the experimental results obtained from a prototype.

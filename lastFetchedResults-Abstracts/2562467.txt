Background and Objective: Water corrosion and scaling are known as destructive phenomenon of drinking water quality and water facilities. In this study, the groundwater tendency to corrosion or scaling in source water, water storage reservoirs and distribution system were studied. Simultaneous use of some qualitative and a quantitative index along with statistical analyses to assess the water scaling or corrosion tendency were investigated.

Materials and Methods: The data analysis of groundwater, water storage reservoirs and water distribution system in rural area of Kurdistan province were analyzed and the amount of Langelier (LI), Ryznar (RY), Pockorius (PSI) and Larson&ndash;Skold (LS) and CCPP indices were determined. Corrosion and scaling threshold for qualitative indices were determined based on CCPP index. The mean of indices was compared with the thresholds using independent t-test. ANOVA was used to assess the difference between the indices in different sources of water.

Results: The balance range for LI, RY and PSI found to be -0.1-0.05, 7-9 and 7.1-8.5. The mean CCPP for groundwater, reservoirs and networks were 9.27 &plusmn; 1.29, 9.13 &plusmn; 1.25, 11.25 &plusmn; 1.23, respectively. All three sources of water have some tendencies toward scaling; however, a significant balance status was confirmed statistically. According to Larson&ndash;Skold index, sulfate and chloride anions did not play a role in scaling process.

Conclusion: The use of qualitative indices with CCPP index can provide more accurate estimation of water tendency toward scaling or corrosion. The assessment of qualitative indices along with CCPP is recommended in drinking water corrosion monitoring studies.

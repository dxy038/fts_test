The primary objective of this research is to evolve “a model for Organizational Intelligence in Iranian Universities”. Based on the literature review, the dimensions and components of organizational intelligence in public universities were identified using expert panel opinions and DELPHI technique. A novel model for organizational intelligence in Iranian universities is investigated by using DEMATEL methodology. The proposed model consists of eight dimensions: structural, cultural, strategic, communicational, informational, functional, behavioral, and environmental dimensions. Each one of these dimensions in turn consists of its own components. The results showed that the “Structural”, “Cultural”, “Strategic”, “Informational” and “Environmental” dimensions are the cause dimensions while the “Behavioral” and “Communicational” dimensions are the effect dimensions. Hierarchical levels of these dimensions are also determined.

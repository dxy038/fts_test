Introduction & Objective: Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease in which host immune system and genetic factors have an important role in its pathogenesis. Genetic polymorphisms in cytokines and their receptors have been proposed as potential markers for periodontal diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether IL-4R gene polymorphism is associated with chronic periodontitis (CP) or not? 
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study ninety non smoker patients (61 women and 29 men) with chronic periodontitis were selected according to established criteria. They were categorized into three groups according to their clinical attachment level (CAL). Mutation at position 375(alanine/glutamine), 411(leucine/serine), 478(serine/proline), 406 (arginine/ cysteine) in the IL-4R gene was detected by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) method.
Results: The distribution of mutations for IL-4 polymorphism at amino acids 375 (P=0.41), 411(P=0.22), 478(P=0.17, 406(P=0.77) were not significantly different among mild, moderate and sever chronic periodontitis patients. 
Conclusion: This study suggests that there is no correlation between IL-4R polymorphism of chronic periodontitis.

With the objective of investigating the time of nitrogen(N) application and the beet combination of base vs. top dressing basal N/top dressing N application on some sugar beet characteristics this experiment was carried out in 1994, karaj - Iran. Experimental design was split plot within Randomize Complete Block with three replications. Four level of split N was applied (100% top dressing- 25% base, 75% top dressing - 50% base, 50%top dressing - 75% base - 25% top dressing) as the main plot and time of N application (planting time, 2-4 leaf stage, 8-10 leaf stage) as sub plots. Amount of N used in all the treatments was the same and equal to 138 kg/hectare. After 53 days from planting and receiving 824 degree days samples were taken and continued every 15 days intervals. The results showed that the time of N application influenced the amount of Na+ and a Amino - N. It was also shown that delay in time of N application increased the Na+ and a - Amino-N but did not effect amount of K+. The time of N - consumption affected on root impurities. S.C. was effected by N consumption in growth period. But, the results showed that there were no difference among N treatment with respect of sugar content.

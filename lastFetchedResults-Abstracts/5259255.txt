This paper presents an integrated model for operation planning of electric power systems that considers the natural gas transport network and the modeling of the hydroelectric power plant reservoirs. Constraints on the reservoirs, on the production and transport of natural gas, and on the generation and transmission of electric power are considered. The model of the hydroelectric power plants is a deterministic linear model for short term analysis. The model of the natural gas transport system is based on the non-linear relationship between the gas flow and the pressure at the pipeline terminals. The electric network is modeled by a linear (DC) power flow. The objective of the integrated model is to minimize the cost of operation of the electric system, considering the transmission network constraints, the hydrological limitations of the reservoirs, and the natural gas network limits for supplying the thermoelectric plants.

In order to solve the coal roof stress analysis and prediction with multiple data information, an expert system is used in this paper. By introducing coal roof stress information forecasting model and expert system model, the MIS can rationally make individual data analysis to multiple data comprehensive analysis, and the coal roof management information system is designed. Experimental analysis shows that the confidence level higher prediction results will be used as the ultimate basis in decision-making if comprehensive objective analysis of data is used for many monitoring data analysis in expert system. The expert-system-based coal roof management information system can effectively solve the shortage of single monitoring data and thus the accurate predict problems of the coal roof stress monitoring data are solved.

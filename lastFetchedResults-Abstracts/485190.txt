Background and Objective: Due to fears of postoperative complications following upper
gastrointestinal surgeries (UGI), fasting before bowl function recovery is a traditional practice,
but fasting following elective surgery is controversial. The aim of this study was to compare early
oral feeding versus traditional oral feeding in patients who underwent UGI surgeries.
Materials and Methods: Fifty two patients who underwent UGl anastomosis or surgery for
various reasons were randomly divided into early oral feeding (EOF) group and traditional oral
feeding (TOF) group. The nasogastric tube (NGT) removal time, tolerance of oral feeding,
i1euses. nausea and vomiting, vital sign before and after surgery, postoperative stay, patients'
sutisfact ion and complications were recorded.
Results: The mean time of NGT removal was 1.62 ±0.49 and 4.61±J.99 days in EOF group and
TOF group respectively (p~0.0005). The mean start time of oral feeding was 2.04 ± 0.19 and 5.87
1c 1.32 uays in the EOF group and TOF group respectively (p=0.0005). Tolerance of oral feeding
\\,':; seei in 24 (92.3%) patients and 21 (91.3%) patients in the EOF and TOF groups respectively.
Duratioi of hospital stay following surgery was 5.62 days in the EOF group and 8.04 days in the
TOF group, 24(92.3%) out of 26 patients in the EOF group were satisfied with oral feeding that
started n the second postoperative day. 1.3 patients (56.5%) complained of delay feeding in the
TOF gr up.
Conclu-ion: The results of the present study suggest that early ora] feeding following upper
gastroir testinal anastomosis or surgery IS safe and can result in a shorter hospital stay and less
L'OSt.

A large-scale phased array antenna will be adopted as a microwave power transmitter of solar power satellites. The objective of the present study is to maximize transmitting power of a large-scale phased array antenna including lossy digital phase shifters. In the present paper, we describe a newly developed algorithm for transmitting power maximization, and demonstration experiments of a one-dimensional 12-elements phased array antenna including 4-bit lossy digital phase shifters. We confirmed effectiveness of the developed algorithm through the demonstration experiments as well as numerical simulations.

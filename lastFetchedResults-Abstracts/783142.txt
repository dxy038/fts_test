Background Schizophrenia has a variety of
clinical profiles, disabilities and outcomes requiring
responsive management and the devotion of considerable
resources. The primary objective of the European
Schizophrenia Cohort (EuroSC) is to relate the types
of treatment and methods of care to clinical outcome.
Secondary objectives include the assessment of treatment
needs in relation to outcome, the calculation of
resource consumption associated with different methods
of care, and the identification of prognostic factors.
Method EuroSC is a naturalistic follow-up of a
cohort of people aged 18 to 64 years, suffering from
schizophrenia and in contact with secondary psychiatric
services. The study was done in nine European centres,
in France (N=288), Germany (N=618), and Britain
(N=302). Participants were interviewed at 6-monthly
intervals for a total of 2 years. This initial paper describes
the methods used and presents clinical and
social baseline data. Results The clinical and sociodemographic
differences between patients from the
different countries were small. However, patients from
Britain were considerably more likely than their continental
counterparts to have a history of homelessness,
rooflessness or imprisonment, even when social and
clinical differences between the samples were controlled.
Conclusions The samples were largely similar
in clinical terms. Thus, the social differences between
the samples seem likely to be due more to the societal
context and may reflect relatively benign situations in
the continental locations of our study.

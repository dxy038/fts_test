This paper presents a new generation of series power quality compensators, which is called Doubled Inverter Series Compensator (DISC). The proposed DISC pursues the global objective of fully mitigating utility side disturbances from the load point of view through application of two series inverters. Either inverter is of a predefined function in a predefined duty cycle. Technical considerations have been taken into account so that one inverter mitigates short-term disturbances such as voltage sags, and the other one continuously eliminates long-term disturbances such as waveform distortions. To coordinate the operation of each inverter and to provide them with compensating signals, a well-organized control unit has been introduced. The control unit takes advantage of an online Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to extract frequency components of the network voltage signal. In the end, the paper represents a soft-ware simulation carried out in Matlab/Simulik. The simulation results will investigate the effectiveness of the proposed compensator.

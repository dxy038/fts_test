Although services science, management, and engineering (SSME) is a new topic to both academics and practitioners, there are still many literature available so far. Since the subject is at the stage of development, a review of the literature on SSME with the objective of knowing what have been done will initiate further research and develop potential opportunities. This paper reviews the literature on SSME using a suitable classification to identify the gap between ideality and practice and to suggest future research directions. The 32 articles on SSME are classified into five categories: SSME overview, services science, services management, services engineering, and SSME education. A comprehensive list of the referenced literature is presented. We hope that the findings of this study will provide useful insight into anatomy of SSME literature and be a good source for anyone who is interested in SSME. The paper also provides some future research and education suggestions.

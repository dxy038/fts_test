The hydro-mechanical deep drawing process with radial pushing effect is studied by means of finite element simulation in conjunction with Taguchi method. An objective function for evaluating whatever the drawing operation is successful or failed is proposed. A design approach for optimization of the hydro-mechanical deep drawing process parameters is presented. It is capable of determining the optimal combination of major parameters for hydro-mechanical deep drawing process exactly and rapidly. As an example, a set of tool for hydro-mechanical deep drawing process with radial pushing effect for cylindrical cups is designed and manufactured in light of the optimal parameters combination obtained in this paper. The drawing operation can be performed smoothly as expected.

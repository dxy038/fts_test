In this contribution, several Multi-Functional Chips featuring different functionalities and integration levels are presented. A X-Band Core-Chip integrating a 6-bit attenuator, a 6-bit phase shifter, a T/R switch and a digital serial-to-parallel converter has been fabricated with 0.18 &#956;m OMMIC ED02AH process. The MMIC exhibits 6 dB and 8 dB average insertion gain for transmit and receive mode respectively, full 360&#176; phase coverage with 5.6&#176; phase steps and 31.5 dB attenuation dynamic range with 0.5 dB amplitude resolution in less than 16 mm<sup>2</sup>. Two C-Band Multi-Functional Chips, one consisting of a bidirectional 6-bit phase shifter with on-board digital controls and the other integrating a 6-bit phase shifter, a buffer amplifier and a 5-bit attenuator have been fabricated with the 0.4 &#956;m E/D GaAs process developed by SELEX Sistemi Integrati. The former exhibits full 360 degree phase coverage with 5.6&#176; phase resolution in less than 18 mm<sup>2</sup>. The latter is an unidirectional MMIC featuring 8 dB average gain, full 360 degree phase coverage with 5.6&#176; phase steps and 31 dB attenuation range with 1 dB amplitude resolution in less than 26 mm<sup>2</sup>.

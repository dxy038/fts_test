Controller design for relay-controlled, linear time-varying plants will be studied in this paper, with the main objective that the plant's steady-state output t→∞ will track the desired reference signal and all the deterministic disturbances and initial conditions at the plant's output will asymptotically die away to zero. Analysis and design of a linear time-varying controller, preceded by a relay and followed by a linear time-varying plant in the feedforward path, will be studied. Examples, as we proceed along, will, most vividly, give their support to the obtained theoretical results. The obtained results show that the proposed control scheme provides good dynamic behaviour, even if the plant parameters vary in a relatively broad range.

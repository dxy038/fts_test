Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of royal jelly (RJ) on catalase, total
antioxidant capacity and embryo development in adult mice treated with oxymetholone
(OXM).
Materials and Methods: In this exprimental study, 32 male and 96 female adult Naval
Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice (7-9 weeks of age) with a ratio of 1:3 for fertilization
purposes were randomly divided into 4 groups as follows: i. Control group (n=8)
receiving 0.1 ml/mice saline daily by gavage for 30 day, ii. RJ group (n=8) treated with RJ
at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily by gavage for 30 days, iii. OXM group (n=8) receiving OXM
at the dose of 5 mg/kg daily by gavage for 30 days and iv. RJ+OXM group (n=8) receiving
RJ at the dose of 100 mg/kg daily by gavage concomitant with 100 mg/kg OXM administration
for 30 days.
Results: Analysis revealed a significant reduction in catalase, total antioxidant, as
well as embryo development in OXM group (P < 0.05). However, RJ group showed a
salient recovery in the all of the above mentioned parameters and embryo toxicity.
Conclusion: The results of this study indicated a partially protective effect of RJ against
OXM-induced embryo toxicity.

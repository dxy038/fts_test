The aim of this paper is to describe a Hermeneutical phenomenological study of the experience of being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The research objective was to understand this particular lived experience and uncover the meanings and structures within it. Eight patients who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the preceding four weeks were purposively sampled to describe their experiences. Data was generated using semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face interviews. The data was analysed using the method described by Benner. Six themes were identified as the main components of this experience for these patients. An overview of the participants’ experiences is presented followed by a more detailed discussion of one of the most poignant themes, which is entitled ‘Feeling ‘on your own’’.

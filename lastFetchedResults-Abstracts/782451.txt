In developing countries, such as Brazil, goat business is in a considerable expansion and
the use of biotechnology may be an important tool to increase productivity of livestock
in genetic improvement programs. However, more studies are necessary to gain a better
understanding of the potential uses of such techniques, including their usefulness
to improve reproductive efficiency, which could contribute to the development of less
favoured regions. The objective of this review is to describe the main reproductive biotechniques
used in Brazil, such as artificial insemination, embryo transfer, in vitro fertilization
and transgenesis, as well as the results obtained with their use

In this paper obtaining the optimal configuration of the dual-arm cam-lock (DACL) robot at a specific point is addressed. The objective is to optimize the applicable task-space force in a desired direction. The DACL robot is a reconfigurable manipulator formed by two parallel cooperative arms. The arms normally operate redundantly but when needed, they can lock into each other in certain joints in order to achieve a higher stiffness, while losing some degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the dynamics of the DACL robot is discussed and parametrically formulated. Considering the geometrical constraints at a given point in the robot's workspace, the optimum configuration for maximizing the cooperatively applicable force by dual arms is determined.

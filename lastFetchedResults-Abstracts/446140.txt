Background: The Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) is a multistation performance-based examination that assesses the technical skills of surgery residents. This study explores the implementation issues involved in remote administration of the OSATS focusing on feasibility and the psychometric properties of the examination.

Methods: An eight-station OSATS was administered to surgical residents in Los Angeles and Chicago. The University of Toronto and the local institutions shared responsibility for organization and administration of the examination.

Results: There was good reliability for both the checklist (α = 0.68 for LA, 0.73 for Chicago) and global rating forms (α = 0.82 for both sites). Both iterations also showed evidence of construct validity, with a significant effect of training year for the checklist and global rating forms at both sites (analysis of variance: F = 8.66 to 19.93, P <0.01). Despite some challenges, the model of central organization and peripheral delivery was effective for the administration of the examinations.

Conclusions: Two iterations of the OSATS at remote sites demonstrated psychometric properties that are highly consistent with previously reported data suggesting that the examination is portable. Both faculty and residents indicated satisfaction with the examination experience. A model of central administration with peripheral delivery was feasible and effective

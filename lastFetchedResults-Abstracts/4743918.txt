The offset calculation is an important part in urban traffic coordinate control. Two offset calculation models have been set up considering the relationship between the arriving and departing of vehicles in this paper. And the objective of them is to minimize the delay of vehicles. Model 1 is based on the assumption that the vehicles arriving and departing follows uniform distribution. And another model which is called Model 2 in this paper considered the dispersion of vehicle platoon. Software of MATLAB is used to calculate the offset models under different conditions such as different distance between intersections and volumes. And then microscopic simulations are used to analyze the benefit of offset calculation models. The results of simulation show that both the two models can improve traffic efficiency greatly. And Model 1 is more convenient and practical.

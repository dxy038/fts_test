The objective of this study was to establish an analytical method to measure pesticides used to cultivate yuza (Citrus junos Sieb. ex Tanaka) and to analyze pesticide residue levels of yuza and yuza tea samples. Risk assessments were also performed by calculating estimated daily intake (EDI) and acceptable daily intake (ADI). An excellent linear correlation was achieved with coefficient correlation values of 0.9750–0.9999. Percent recoveries were 80.4–109.9% for most pesticides with a &lt;6.9% relative standard deviation (RSD). The limits of quantification for the method were 0.10–0.67 μg/ml. The RSD of intra-day and inter-day variability was &lt;15.3%. Seven pesticides in yuza (n = 80) and yuza tea (n = 75) were analyzed with the optimized analytical method. Acequinocyl, spirodiclofen and carbendazim were detected in yuza samples in the concentration range of 0.07–0.15 μg/g, 0.11–1.89 μg/g, and 0.03–5.15 μg /g, respectively, whereas chlorpyrifos, prothiofos, phosalone, and deltamethrin were not detected in yuza or yuza tea. The concentrations of acequinocyl, spirodiclofen and carbendazim ranged from 0.18–1.05 μg/g, 0.13–0.29 μg/g, and 0.17–2.36 μg/g, respectively, in yuza tea samples. The percent ratios of EDI to ADI for acequinocyl, spirodiclofen, and carbendazim were 24.6%, 22.7%, and 58.5%, respectively.

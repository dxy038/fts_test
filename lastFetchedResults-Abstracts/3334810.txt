It is largely accepted that the innovative technology of large-scale multiantenna systems (named Massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems) will very probably be deployed in the fifth generation of mobile cellular networks. In order to render this technology feasible and efficient, many challenges have to be investigated before. In this paper, we consider the problem of antenna selection and user scheduling in Massive MIMO systems. Our objective is to maximize the sum of broadcasting data rates achieved by all the mobile users in one cell served by a massive MIMO transmitter. The optimal solution of this problem can be obtained through a highly complex exhaustive brute force search (BFS) over all possible combinations of antennas and users. This BFS solution cannot be implemented in practice even for small size systems because of its high computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an algorithm that efficiently solves the problem of joint antenna selection and user scheduling. The proposed algorithm aims to maximize the achievable sum-rate and to benefit from both the spatial selectivity gain and multi-user diversity gain offered by the antenna selection and user scheduling, respectively. Compared with the optimal solution obtained by the highly complex BFS, the conducted performance evaluation and complexity analysis show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve near-optimal performance with low computational complexity.

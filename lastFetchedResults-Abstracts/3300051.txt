The human auditory system perceives sound in a much different manner than sound is measured by modern audio sensing systems. The most commonly referenced aspects of auditory perception are loudness and pitch which relate to the objective measures of frequency and sound pressure levels. This paper describes an efficient and accurate method for the conversion of the sensed factors of frequency and sound pressure level to perceived loudness and pitch. This method is achieved through the modeling of the auditory system using artificial neural networks and will be shown to have certain advantages over previous methods.

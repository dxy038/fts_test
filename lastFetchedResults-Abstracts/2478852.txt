Background: Early treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is necessary for a successful tuberculosis (TB) control program.
Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine total treatment delay and its associated factors among PTB patients in Ahvaz.
Patients and Methods: A retrospective study was performed among newly diagnosed PTB cases registered in 2010 at the Ahvaz health center. Total treatment delay was defined as the time interval between the onsets of cough to the initiation of anti-TB treatment. Tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment was based on the national TB program (NTP). Data analysis was performed using the SPSS software by chi-square and Fisher's exact test with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results: The mean age of the patients was 38.9 Â± 12.3 years; 83 were male and 56 were female. Of the 139 smear positive PTB cases, 91 (65.5%) cases had received delayed-treatment. The mean time between onset of symptoms, diagnosis and treatment was 73 days (median: 48 days, range: 4-570 days). Female gender (OR (95% CI): 2.9, 1.03-8.23, P = 0.02), smoking (OR (95% CI): 0.49, 0.22-0.96, P = 0.04) and receiving immunosuppressive drugs (OR (95% CI): 8.18, 1.09-75.31, P  <  0.05) were associated with longer delayed time.
Conclusions: Delayed diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis appears to be the main problem in the TB control program of the region. Delayed time is significantly associated with female gender, smoking and immunosuppressive drugs.

This paper provide a brief idea about the modeling of solar photovoltaic grid connected system. As the grid is a highly nonlinear system so it requires highly efficient inverter so as to minimize total harmonic distortion. It is also required to find out the exact position where maximum power can be injected. Moreover the paper tries to explain the controlling method used for controlling the duty cycle of the system. The main objective of this paper is to provide a strong idea about the different effect of grid voltage and power flow when a renewable sources like solar PV is connected to the grid. The simulation is carried out with a matlab modeled circuit and different modeling scheme is used to compare its accuracy with other model. The first part of the paper will give a review on the PV structure and its control strategies mainly inner and outer control loop.

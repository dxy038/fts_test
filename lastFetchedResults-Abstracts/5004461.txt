A new computer package, PACFOTON II, with an educational objective, that analyses the light behavior through the device gates and analyses the soliton pulses using the 4<sup>a</sup> order Runge-Kutta method, is presented. Concerning the latter aspect, an analysis of soliton pulses is shown, together with some electro-optic devices like a directional coupler and intensity modulator, with electric field control

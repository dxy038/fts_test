For a class of affine systems with stable system matrix and oscillating behavior, the control objective consists of oscillations damping while tracking a piecewise constant reference signal. Under some controllability assumptions, a control solution consists of a pole assignment procedure combined with the internal model principle. The paper discusses, within a simulation experiment, a possible extension of this control approach to a constrained affine model of a vehicle driveline, from the literature. Two choices of the dominant poles are considered and the closed loop simulated behaviors are compared to the results reported for a model predictive control approach. The proposed control solution can be adapted for piecewise affine systems, modeled as affine hybrid automata.

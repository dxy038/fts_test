Introduction: Emission of volatile organic compounds through industrial processes to the environment has been received more attentions currently. Photocatalytic oxidation process as a new emerging technique in air purification can be substituted for conventional techniques such as activated carbon adsorption. In photocatalytic oxidation process, pollutant molecules decompose to water and carbon dioxide molecules. The objective of present study was the examination of influencing parameters such as concentration, relative humidity, and superficial gas velocity on photocatalytic oxidation of Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) in a fluidized bed reactor.
.
Material and Method: In this study photocatalytic oxidation of MEK was examined in a fluidized bed reactor. Gamma alumina coated titanium dioxide particles under ultraviolet light were used as photocatalyst. The efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation process was determined using measurement of MEK concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the fluidized bed reactor.
.
Result: The study of MEKphotocatalytic oxidation was carried out in the concentration range of 100 to 800 PPM with 25% and 45% relative humidity. Photocatalytic degradation of MEK at the relative 45 % humidity was slightly lower than 25 %. Increasing MEK concentration from 200 to 800 PPM was led to decrease in degradation efficiency. At concentrations of 100 and 200 PPM MEK, increasing superficial gas velocity did not change the degradation efficiency, whereas, at concentrations of 200 to 800 PPM, increasing superficial gas velocity resulted in decrease in MEK degradation.
.
Conclusion: In photocatalytic oxidation of MEK, there is a competitive adsorption between water and MEK and at higher relative humidity degradation of MEK decreases. In the fluidized bed reactor increasing superficial gas velocity causes decrement in MEK photocatalytic degradation.Increasinginitial concentration of pollutant results in decreasing ofphotocatalytic efficiency due to the limited number of active sites on the catalyst surface.

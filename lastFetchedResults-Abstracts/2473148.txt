Objective
We aimed to assess the effect of body mass index (BMI) on reducing the risk
of refractory seizure due to lipoid tissue factors.
Materials & Methods
This matched case-control study, consisted of cases (Patients with refractory
epilepsy) and controls (Healthy children) referred to 17 Shahrivar Hospital,
Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Guilan, Iran during 2013-2014.
Data were gathered by a form including demographic characteristics, type
of epilepsy, predominant time of epilepsy, therapeutic approach, frequency
of epilepsy, time of disease onset and anthropometric indices. We measured
anthropometric indices and transformed them into Z-scores. Data were
reported by descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and analyzed
by Pearson correlation coefficient, paired t test and multinomial regression
analysis test using SPSS 19.
Results
There was no significant difference between sex groups regarding
anthropometric indices. Generalized and focal types of epilepsies were noted
on 57.5% and 38.75% of patients, respectively. Daytime epilepsies happened
in 46.25% of patients and 33.75% noted no predominant time for epilepsies.
Clinicians indicated poly-therapy for the majority of patients (92.5%). The
most common onset times for epilepsies were 36-72 months for 32.5% of
patients. Lower onset time indicated lower frequency of refractory epilepsies.
Although, there was significant difference between Zheight and predominant
time of epilepsies but no significant relation was found between types of
epilepsies and frequency of epilepsies with anthropometric indices. Using
multivariate regression analysis by backward LR, Zweight and birth weight
were noted as the predicting factors of refractory epilepsies.
Conclusion
This effect may be because of leptin. Therefore, researchers recommend
further investigations regarding this issue in children with epilepsy.

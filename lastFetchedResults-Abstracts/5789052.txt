Over the past few decades, a variety of specialized approaches have been proposed to solve large problems in speech recognition. Conventional optimization techniques have not been widely applied, because the problems do not readily admit an objective for evaluating a given set of parameters and because of the large number of parameters. This situation is changing, due to recent developments in algorithmic optimization. In this paper, we review the specialized algorithms, including methods derived from the extended Baum-Welch (EBW) approach, Rprop, and GIS. We discuss optimization frameworks that could also potentially be applied, and outline some connections between the optimization methods and existing specialized methods.

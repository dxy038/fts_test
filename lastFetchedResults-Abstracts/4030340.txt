This paper considers a hierarchical optimal control problem which involves an optimal H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm cost in the primary problem and an H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm type or a quadratic secondary objective. Using allpass dilation techniques and results from superoptimal interpolation theory, it is shown that the problem can be reduced to a multidisk minimization in terms of a free parameter of reduced dimensions. Convex programming techniques may then be employed to obtain a numerical solution to the problem

An ultra-wideband (UWB) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system is investigated for the detection of former bombing ranges, littered by unexploded ordnance (UXO). The objective is detection of a high enough percentage of surface and shallow-buried UXO, with a low enough false-alarm rate, such that a former range can be detected. The physics of UWB SAR scattering is exploited in the context of a hidden Markov model (HMM), which explicitly accounts for the multiple aspects at which a SAR system views a given target. The HMM is trained on computed data, using SAR imagery synthesized via a validated physical-optics solution. The performance of the HMM is demonstrated by performing testing on measured UWB SAR data for many surface and shallow UXO buried in soil in the vicinity of naturally occurring clutter

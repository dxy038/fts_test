Network-based digital advertisement becomes a core in e-business applications. The major objective is to send the right content, to the right audience at the right time. Technically, this is called scheduling problem. However, delivering dynamic scheduling for contents remains a major challenge especially when a diverse number of resources (both for content and display) are geographically distributed. In this dynamic environment, scheduling usually involves complex and non-deterministic interactions between different participants. In this work, we propose a distributed multi-agent approach to model intelligent dynamic scheduling solution in advertisement. We believe that agent-based model is appropriate due to its characteristics to support both dynamic behaviour and distributed structure. The main contribution of this work includes: (1) modelling the scheduling problem in advertisement, (2) developing an agent-based scheduling solution for distributed, dynamic environment. The proposed approach is validated through a prototype implementation using the coordinated intelligent rational agent (CIR-Agent) model

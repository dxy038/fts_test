An experimental embankment was constructed in Rouen, France. The construction was completed in December 2004. The first objective of this experiment is to investigate the influence of climatic changes on the soil response such as changes in water content and temperature as well as the induced vertical and horizontal displacements; and the second objective is to investigate the soil response under water flooding from the base of embankment. In this study, the changes in temperature, volumetric water content and suction along the central axis have been analysed using a one-dimensional model and based on the meteorological data obtained in the field. Comparisons made between the measurements and simulations have shown the relevance of the method adopted, provided that suitable boundary conditions and soil parameters are taken into consideration. Moreover, both the simulation and field monitoring showed that climatic effects are limited to a shallow depth, which results from the low permeability of the compacted fill.

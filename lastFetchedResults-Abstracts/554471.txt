The present research investigated the role of virtual education in realizing the pedagogical objectives; the objectives have been deducted from the common explications of key existentialist philosophers on human and his life. We used a qualitative method know as comparative analysis of the philosophers' thoughts. The first objective of the research was to help the learners express and develop their emotions as well as learning ways to apply and benefit from reasoning. Based on the research findings, however, virtual experience is rather observational and mental, i.e., not embodied or based on physical engagement in relation with the reality. The second objective is to pay attention to awareness, freedom and authenticity of the learners. In this regard, educating learners as helpful citizens requires preparing them for future careers and life, for which virtual learning has created unique and useful opportunities. To achieve the goal, it is also necessary to revive, preserve and foster traditions and genuine historical culture of the society to learners through day to day life, manner of speaking and social encountering such as face to face contact with humane character of a teacher. Finally, implications of the study has been discussed; these include employing virtual education along with face to face education; emphasis on holistic view instead of the conservative view in using virtual education; and designing virtual education in order to facilitate reasoning, critical thinking, and creativity.

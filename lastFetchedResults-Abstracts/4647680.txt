This work study four symbol phase synchronizers namely the analog, hybrid, combinational and sequential.These four synchronizers will be tested with three different input sequences (deterministic and pseudo random). The sequences are the deterministic P1=2<sup>1</sup> (one and zero dasia1-0psila), the deterministic P2=2<sup>2</sup> (two ones and two zeros dasia11-00psila) and the pseudo random P7=2<sup>7</sup>-1. The objective is to study the four synchronizers and to evaluate their jitter UI-RMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Squared) versus input SNR (Signal- Noise Ratio), when the input sequence changes between P1, P2 and P7.

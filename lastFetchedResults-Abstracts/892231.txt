Prevalence of bovine tuberculosis was determined in a herd of apparently healthy 17 pastoralist Bunaji cattle in Jalingo Local Government Area of Taraba State using a Single Cervical Comparative Tuberculin test of bovine and avian Purified Protein Derivatives. This followed a trace back report of the successful treatment of a 51 year old herd man diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis using Acid-Fast staining technique of his sputum at the Federal Medical Centre Jalingo. Of the 17 cattle aged 1-5 years with good body condition scores, 11 were females and 6 males. The result showed a young bull and a cow of 2 and 4 years respectively positive for bovine tuberculosis amounting to a prevalence of 11.8 %. The farmer was advised to cull the infected animals. Although this study could not established the source of the infection whether it was the herd man that infected his cattle or vice visa, the result does emphasized the importance of trace back information about a patient profile from the hospital to his cattle herd and the need for collaboration between physicians and veterinarians such that any patient that tested positive for tuberculosis in the hospital and owns or interacts with cattle, veterinarians should be inform of the need to screen the patientâ€™s cattle of tuberculosis. This may lead to the control and possible eradication of tuberculosis in the state.

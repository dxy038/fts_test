Background/Objective: One of the causes of inevitable abortion is structural abnormalities of the uterine cavity and endometrium, which interfere with the implantation of the embryo. We performed this study to compare the efficacy of sonohysterography and hysterosalpingography with hysteroscopy in the diagnosis of these abnormalities. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 72 infertile women who were candidates for hysteroscopy, attended to the Infertility Clinics of Vali-e-Asr Reproductive Health Research Center, affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. In this study, hysterosalpingography and sonohysterography were performed prior to hysteroscopy, which was considered as the gold-standard test for the diagnosis of the structural abnormalities of the uterine cavity and endometrium. Results: Comparing to hysteroscopy, sonohysterography had a sensitivity of 30%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 30%; hys-terosalpingography had a sensitivity of 55%, a specificity of 68%, a positive predictive value of 41% and a negative predictive value of 60%. Conclusion: Due to the absence of the complications associated with hysteroscopy, being an uninvasive procedure, with high sensitivity, lower cost, and higher feasibility, sonohysterography seems to be a suitable choice for diagnosing intrauterine lesions.

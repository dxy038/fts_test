In this paper we present a continuation of our work on three dimensional quality evaluation space for medical image compression. Quality dimensions are: presentation-objective, presentation-subjective, and technical-objective. Each quality dimension is defined by a quality vector. We present which attributes of medical image compression should be included in quality vectors.

The most salient characteristics or power theories from the past 75 years are reviewed. During this time power theories basad on a frequency domaJn approach or on a time domaJn approach have been proposed. Within these two broad categories respectively some correspondence and some differences between theorles exist. However. some correspondence between the time and frequency domaJn approaches to power theories also exist. These correspondences and differences are used as criteria to support the conctuslon In this paper that the objective of the power analysis dictates the best optlon to use In each case. The objective of power analysis could either be to describe and quantify a load process or the dimensioning, rating and control of a power compensator. comprised of static and dynamic compensating equipment

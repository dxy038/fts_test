This paper falls in the topic of qLPV state-space model based control design in which LMIs are used to optimize the multi-objective control performance. In this paper we investigate how the convex hull of the polytopic model influences the feasibility of the LMI based control design and the resulting control performances. We examine these influences through the control design of the two dimensional aeroelastic systemÂ´s example. First we define various TP type polytopic model representations of a wing section whose vertices define different convex hulls. In the second step we investigate how these models lead to different control performances.

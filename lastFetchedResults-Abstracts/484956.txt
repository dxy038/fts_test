Background and Objective: Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) suffer from failure to thrive (FTT) after delivery and severe growth retardation in these patients may lead to FTT continuity even after corrective surgery. Therefore, early detection of FTT and early and appropriate intervention can produce improvement of these conditions. In this study we evaluated FTT and its patterns in children with CHD.
Subjects and Methods: Two hundred and fifty children with CHD, who were admitted in Ahvaz Golestan hospital and were visited Mehr hospital for echocardiography out- patiently, were enrolled in our retrospective-descriptive study during 2007. Patients were divided into six age groups and evaluated for weight and stature. Data were analyzed by SPSS software and Pearson, Chi Square, Phi and Cramer testsnwere used. Results: Weight loss was more common among our patients, which was seen more frequently among girls than in boys. Weight loss and short stature were more common in patients with acyanotic diseases (the most common) with pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), while weight loss and short stature were more common in patients with cyanotic diseases without PHTN. The majority of patients belonged to 1-5 month age group and in 6-11 month age group we had the majority of FTT forms.
Conclusion: FTT was more common in patients who suffer from CHD with PHTN which was statistically significant (P<0.05). Large ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus were the first two diseases. While in other studies large ventricular septal defect and tetralogy of Fallot were the most common. The results suggest that early surgical intervention and nutritional support among the 6-12 month age group can be fruitful in prevention of these complications.

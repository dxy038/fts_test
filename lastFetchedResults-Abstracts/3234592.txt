Hypertension, the most commonly managed problem in general practice, in its early stages can be diagnosed only by measurement of blood pressure. The prevalent automated method for this purpose is based on the oscillometric principle. The evaluation of the measurement accuracy for oscillometric automated devices involves costly and time consuming population studies, often providing contradictory results. The NIBP simulators, that regenerate oscillometric waveforms, promise an alternative to clinical trials. In the paper a comparison among the most used commercial NIBP simulators is reported, as well as the last research proposals useful to the development of IEEE P1721 project for a new Standard on Objective Measurement of Systemic Arterial Blood Pressure in Humans are analyzed.

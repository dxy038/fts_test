As a relatively new population based optimization technique, differential evolution has been attracting increasing attention for a wide variety of engineering applications including power engineering. Unlike the conventional evolutionary algorithms which depend on predefined probability distribution function for mutation process, differential evolution uses the differences of randomly sampled pairs of objective vectors for its mutation process. Consequently, the object vectorsÂ´ differences will pass the objective functions topographical information toward the optimization process, and therefore provide more efficient global optimization capability. This paper aims at providing an overview of differential evolution and presenting it as an alternative to evolutionary algorithms with two application examples in power systems

A bidirectional nonreciprocal wavelength-interleaving filter based on an optically coherent high birefringence fiber transversal filter structure is demonstrated. Stable, low loss operation is achieved with reconfigurable transfer characteristics for interleaved channel spacing of 0.8 nm with &gt;30 dB isolation and ultra-low chromatic dispersion.

The main objective of this paper is that the optimization is to perform a best utilization of existing transmission lines. And also an attempt has been made to optimize each objective individually using Particle Swarm Optimization. The so developed algorithm for Optimization of each objective is to be tested on power systems i.e. on IEEE 14 bus system. In this connection, the FACTS devices like STATCOM and IPFC are optimally placed in order to optimize the power losses while considering voltage constraints. This also improves the power transfer capability and voltage profile of the system. Simulations are performed on an IEEE 14-bus system and results are presented.

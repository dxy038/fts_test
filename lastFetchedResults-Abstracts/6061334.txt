This paper describes our experience using the dynamic resource reallocation capabilities offered by virtualization technologies, in implementing: 1. Automation of end-to-end failover of mission critical virtualized application, a SAN network and EMC Clarion based storage to a remote site and 2. On-demand and scheduled assurance of failover and measurement of RPO and RTO (The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the point in time to which you must recover data as dictated by business needs. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the period of time after an outage in which the application and its data must be restored to a predetermined state defined by RPO.) By creating an application to spindle resource utilization profile through various management systems, and utilizing a combination of server, network- and storage-virtualization technologies, application specific RTO and RPO objectives (defined based on workload profiles and business priorities) are met in a technology agnostic and multi-vendor environment.

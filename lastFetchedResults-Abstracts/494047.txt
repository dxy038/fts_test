
The objective of this paper is to specify the relationships between age and gender
differentials in health among older people in China. The data were drawn from
the 2002 Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Study (CLHLS), which included 15,789
respondents aged 65 or more years. The health indicators included the Activities
of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental ADL scores, cognitive ability (using the
Mini Mental State Examination), visual function, hearing or auditory function,
number of natural teeth, self-reported health, and self-reported quality of life. The
statistical significance of the age relationships was examined using Mann-Whitney
U tests and Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficients. The principal results were
that above 65 years of age, gender differentials were observed in most of the
health indicators at most ages, although self-rated quality of life was an exception.
For most of the objective (observer-rated) health indicators, the gender differentials
increased with greater age, but that for the number of natural teeth decreased
with age. Gender differentials in the two subjective health measures had no significant
relationship with age. It is concluded that older Chinese women have
poorer health than men and are in many ways disadvantaged, and that the
relative disadvantage increases with age. Chinese women tend to live longer and
suffer ill-health more than men.

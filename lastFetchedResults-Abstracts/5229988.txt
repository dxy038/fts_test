This paper presents optimal design of antennas for passive IC tags used in UHF-band radio frequency identification. To improve the performance of IC tags, the shape of the meander line antennas and planar lattice antennas are optimized using the genetic algorithm. In the optimization process, the objective function includes the terms relevant to the antenna size, gain and input impedance. The characteristics of the antennas printed on a dielectric substrate are evaluated using the moment method. The optimization results in desirable input impedance for impedance matching and miniaturizing.

This paper shows how a real-time simulator of moving pictures compression algorithms can be rapidly assembled using a basic building block, here called MOVIE (MOdule for Video Experimentation). The internal architecture of the MOVIE VLSI chip can be compared to a small systolic machine made of a 32-bit I/O processor, a reduced linear array of 16-bit computation processors and data video input/output mechanisms. Externally, the chip is provided with four 16-bit bidirectional data ports and three 16-bit bidirectional data video port. Several MOVIE chips can be easily clustered to allow the size of the linear array of computation processors to be increased. The MOVIE chip is fully programmable in a high level language in order to make program developments easier

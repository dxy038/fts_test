Objectives
The objective of this study was to examine the two-body wear resistance of nine different resin denture teeth and one experimental material.
Methods

The two-body wear test was performed in a chewing simulator with an antagonistic Al2O3 ball under an axial load of 40 N for 100,000 cycles. In each test series, an enamel sample was included as a reference. The wear was determined with an optical 3D surface profilometer. For statistical evaluation, SPSS for Windows was used.
Results

The samples of Artiplus (18.7−SD 21.0) and e-Ha (21.2−SD 15.1) showed the lowest volumetric wear (in mm3×10−3) after 100,000 cycles. The difference from the other materials tested, except NC Veracia Posterior, was statistically significant (p=0.001−0.037). SR-Postaris-DCL (55.0−SD 6.8), SR-Orthosit-PE (61.1−SD 12.4) and Vitapan (72.1−SD 15.9) exhibited medium-sized wear values with low dispersion, whereas Orthognat (80.1−SD 31.6), Premium 8 (84.6−SD 31.4), NC Veracia Posterior (87.0−SD 52.7), SR-Orthotyp-PE (114.6−SD 28.0) and Trubyte Portrait (123.0−SD 45.6) showed high wear values with great variations. Statistically provable differences were found between SR-Orthotyp-PE and SR-Postaris-DCL (p=0.019) and also between SR-Orthotyp-PE and SR-Orthosit-PE (p=0.031). For enamel, a medium-sized wear value of 66.1−SD 76.8 was determined.
Significance

The denture teeth examined showed differences in two-body wear resistance. The wear values determined were in some cases higher and in others lower than those of natural enamel. A definite connection between the wear resistance and the chemical composition of the materials could not be found in this investigation.

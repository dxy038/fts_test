This paper proposes one kind nonlinear sequence node coverage optimization algorithm based on the mobile strategy, which establishes the sensor node and the target node mapping relation model. It uses geometric graphic in the square makes target nodes planning to the inner square region, through to the mobile node scheduling strategy for the entire coverage region for effective coverage, achieving the goal node complete coverage of the objective. The algorithm uses probability expectation values are obtained to meet under the conditions with minimal sensor nodes, and gives the optimal coverage and connectivity probability models and reasoning. The experimental results show that the algorithm can not only use nodes complete the effective target region to be covered, and in reducing the network energy consumption is also greatly improved, simultaneously reduces the network source configuration and improves the network life cycle.

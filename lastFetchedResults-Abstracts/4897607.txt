This paper presents the detailed analysis and novel hybrid controller design for bidirectional energy management solutions, using smart power electronic DC/DC converter solutions. More specifically, an intelligently designed novel digital control technique is presented for 4-quadrant (4Q) switched-capacitor (SC) Luo DC/DC converters, based on power of traction motor and gradient of battery current. Features of voltage step-down, step-up, and bi-directional power flow are integrated into a single circuit. The novel hybrid control system enables simpler dynamics compared to a standard buck converter with input filter, superior regulation capability, lower source current ripple, ease of control, and continuous input current waveform in buck and boost modes of operation.

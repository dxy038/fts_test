This paper presents the joint utilisation of the common subtraction technique "Codebook" and color invariants in order to perform a better detection of moving objects while dealing with difficult scenes, thus allowing a good tracking. We will observe the effects of the differents invariants we tested on images captured in outdoor scenes atmultiple moments of the day when we have to deal with important illumination and color changes. Our objective is to show the effectiveness of the common use of color invariants with a widely-used background subtraction algorithm, and give a preference rank of use.

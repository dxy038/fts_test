In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting both the base station locations and transmission powers of a cellular communication system based on the information of communication traffic distribution. The objective is to maximize the minimum throughput among the mobiles. The mobility model for each mobile is assumed to be a random walk and independent of other mobiles. The maximum throughput region and the scheduling policy which can have such a throughput region are characterized. Then the optimal locations and powers of the base stations are solved numerically

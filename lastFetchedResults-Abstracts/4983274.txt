This paper deals with the design and the realisation of a 100 kHz - 2 kW converter used to supply a three phased switched reluctance motor (SRM) for high speed machining (HSM) applications. The converter topology is described, and unlike some other applications, this converter is not a resonant one. This topology is justified with SRM magnetic losses and control aspect. In order to limit the iron losses at the rotor, stator electric phases are preferentially fed with bidirectional currents, this is the main reason why the full bridge converter is preferred. Converter power losses are then estimated, and dead-time delays are assessed to design driver control circuits. Several experimental waveforms, both in half-bridge and full-bridge modes, are finally presented and discussed

Traditional scheduling and due-date determination models assume that the production system is operating in a static and deterministic environment and that the system carries no workload at each scheduling epoch. In this research we consider a due-date determination model where the scheduler wishes to update the existing schedule when some new jobs have arrived into the system. In this model, jobs are categorized as either "old" or "new" jobs, where the due-dates of the old jobs are treated as given parameters and those of the new jobs are decision variables. The objective is to minimize the maximum weighted tardiness penalty and the due-date assignment cost. The computational complexity of this model is analyzed, and an efficient algorithm is developed for an important special ca.se.

In better words, first the statistical population is categorized by choosing a village in each province and then the questionnaires are randomly distributed among the related groups within the statistical population. Required sample size was estimated to be 40, 380, 186, and 25 for the rural governors, villagers, building technical supervisors, and staff respectively. Content validity was used to determine validity of indices and questionnaires. Reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) in the questionnaires was higher than 0.7 in all four groups. Findings of the study indicate that in 28 out of 40 indices, the goals of the Development Plan were met with a degree of higher than 70 percent. In addition, the government has had the highest achievement of goals in domestic processes with 88.49 percent and the lowest achievement in financial affairs with 66.19 percent.

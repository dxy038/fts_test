Under a Navy SBIR, Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) will design and demonstrate scalable solid state switches in support of future U.S. Navy needs related to power supplies and inverters. One switch approach being developed consists of a massive series- parallel array of high voltage IGBTs that are switched synchronously in order to achieve high peak currents. DTI is evolving its technology in high voltage switching to include very high peak currents. As an objective of the SBIR effort, DTI will utilize these high power switches to build a power converter. From a practical viewpoint, high voltage switches that can operate reliably at large currents have potential applications in missile launchers, high power actuators, and radar power supplies. The massive series-parallel switch array approach has the potential to provide a compact, reliable, and effective switching solution to converting sufficient electrical energy to kinetic energy that could meet a variety of Navy applications In this paper, DTI reviews current switch requirements and recent SBIR progress toward the goal of demonstrating massive series-parallel high voltage switching that meets the Navy SBIR requirements.

Deposition of layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films has been a widely applied surface modification technique to improve the biocompatibility of biomaterials. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the deposition of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) multilayer films on adhesion, growth and differentiation of osteoblasts-like MG63 cells. PAH and PAA were deposited sequentially onto tissue culture polystyrene at either pH 2.0 or pH 6.5 with 4â€“21 layers. While the MG63 cells attached poorly on the PAH/PAA multilayer films deposited at pH 2.0, while the cells adhered to the PEM films deposited at pH 6.5, depending on layer numbers. Cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic activities (alkaline phosphatase activity, expression of osteogenic marker genes and mineralization) were highest on the 4-layer PAH/PAA film and decreased with increasing layer numbers. On the other hand, the behavior of MG63 cells did not show any difference on the adjacent even and odd layers, except PEM4 and PEM5, i.e. the surface charges of the PAH/PAA multilayer films with over ten layers seem indifferent to osteoblastic functions. The results in this study suggested that the mechanical properties of PEM films may play a critical role in modulating the behavior of osteoblasts, providing guidance for application of PEM films to osteopaedic implants.

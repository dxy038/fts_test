DQDB +/- is an alternative MAC (medium access control) protocol to the one recommended in the IEEE 802.6 document. DQDB +/- improves both fairness and bandwidth use. The objective of the paper is to analyze the behavior of both protocols (DQDB IEEE 802.6 and DQDB +/-) when the avalanche of segments to the DQDB access nodes is contained and segments are delivered in a serial manner

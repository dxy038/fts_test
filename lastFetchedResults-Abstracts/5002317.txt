This paper described the design of multiple element of microstrip patch antenna array operating at 2.45 GHz for WLAN and 5.85 GHz for WiMAX applications. The design and development also focus on different type antenna such as rectangular and circular patch antennas. Microstrip antennas have the attractive features of low profile and light weight. However the antennas may be too large for practical applications at the lower microwave frequency range and may offer only a few percentage of bandwidth. Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio is used as an effective tool for 3D electromagnetic simulation of high frequency components. A parallel or corporate feed configuration is used to build up the arrays. In parallel feed, the patch elements were fed in parallel with the transmission lines. The transmission lines are divided into two branches according to the number of patch elements. The objective of this project is to develop the antenna that has high gain, directivity and efficiency. Each component of the antenna system is optimized to get the best results. Many factors are considered such as operating frequencies, bandwidth requirements and directivity, all of which affect its efficiency. The analysis on performance will be based on the obtained result especially in radiation pattern, bandwidth and return loss.

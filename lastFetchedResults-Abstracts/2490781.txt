Climate change has serious direct and indirect consequences on crop production and food security. The objective of this study is the simulation of future climate on rice phenology under different water-management practices in Caspian Sea area. The used data for this research includes the meteorological, soil and crop management data. Meteorological data include the collection of daily data of minimum temperature, maximum temperature, solar radiation and precipitation during 1981-2010 and monthly temperature and precipitation of global climate models during 1971-2000. The Soil and product management data have obtained from field experiment in the Iranian Rice Research Institute in Rasht, from 2006 to 2007. The stochastic weather generators (Lars-WG) are used for downscaling of global climate models outputs. Future climate has been done using of MPEH5 under scenarios of SRA1B, SRA2 and SRB1. CERES-Rice model was used for simulating of rice phenology in three irrigation regimes. Under climate change scenarios, Simulation results reveal that minimum and maximum temperature will increase and total precipitation will decrease during the rice-growing season. The panicle initiation day, a thesis day and physiological maturity day will shorten with temperature increase in the future. Also, the beginning of rice phenology will decline with temperature increase above 1?C even in continuous submergence.

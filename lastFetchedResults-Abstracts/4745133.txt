In the synthesis of control systems, the stability is not only the main objective. But also robustness to the effect of the disturbance is required. In this paper, robust H<sub>infin</sub> control design based on fuzzy observer by linear matrix inequality is carried out in order to achieve a disturbance rejection. In addition, using fuzzy observer, the unmeasured states such as angle of attack can be estimated. To test the effectiveness of this design approach, simulation results for stabilizing a launch vehicle are included.

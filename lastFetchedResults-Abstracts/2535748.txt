In this paper, a solution algorithm to fuzzy multiobjective integer nonlinear fractional programming problem (FMOINLFP) is suggested. The problem of concern involves fuzzy parameters in the objective functions. In order to defuzzify the problem, the concept of Î±-level set of the fuzzy number is given and for obtaining an efficient solution to the problem (FMOINLFP), a linearization technique is presented to develop the solution algorithm. In addition, an illustrative example is included to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed solution algorithm.

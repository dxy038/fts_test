Relative differences in QOL between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) are not clearly known. The objective of this study was to compare QOL between HD and PD patients in Emam Reza and Ghaem hospital dialysis centers. Materials and Methods
We compared 40 patients (17male and23 female) on PD with 40 matched patients (20 male and 20 female) on HD. Health related 36 item short form questionnaire (SF-36) were used to assess the quality of life. For the SF-36, eight domain scores (physical functioning [PF], role limitations as a result of physical problems [RP], body pain [BP], general health perceptions [GH], social functioning [SF], role limitations as a result of emotional problems [RE], vitality [VT], mental health [MH]) were calculated. We also calculated summary Physical Component (PCS), Mental Component (MCS) and total scores of QOL. Results
This study included 80 patients treated with HD and PD. The worst score was for RP dimension in both groups, and the best score was for RE in PD patients and BP in HD patients, SF-36 domains of GH, RP, VT and PCS were all significantly higher in the PD patients as compared to the HD patients. The only domain for which significant differences favoured HD patients was BP. (P < 0.05). Conclusion
This study provided evidence that patients in PD treatment modality were experiencing better quality of life in SF-36 domains of GH, RP, VT, PCS in comparison to HD patients

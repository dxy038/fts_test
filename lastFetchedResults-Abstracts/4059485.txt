A clock-deskew buffer using the delay-locked loop and the bidirectional technique has been developed. It needs only one wire to synchronize the clocks for a chip-to-chip system. It has been fabricated by a 0.35-&#956;m n-well CMOS process. Experimental results demonstrate that it can achieve the peak-to-peak jitter smaller than 100 ps through a two-meter coaxial cable while operating at the frequency of 120 MHz. The total power dissipation of the skew buffer is 218 mW for a 3 V supply. The core chip area is 980&#215;1700 &#956;m<sup>2</sup>

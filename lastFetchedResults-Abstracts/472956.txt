The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship of polymorphisms of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor gene with microalbuminuria in a group of young adults with essential hypertension. Essential hypertensives, less than 50 years old, never previously treated with antihypertensive drugs, and in absence of diabetes mellitus were included. Office blood pressure (BP), 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) measurements, and DNA analysis were performed. Polymorphisms of the angiotensin II AT1-receptor gene (A1166C and C573T) were studied by polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism techniques. One hundred eighty-three patients, 49 (27%) microalbuminurics, were included. Office and ambulatory BP values were significantly higher in the microalbuminuria group. No differences in the presence of microalbuminuria were observed among the genotypes of either A1166C or C573T polymorphisms of the angiotensin II receptor AT1 gene, or in the allele frequency of the A1166C or the C573T polymorphism. LogUAE was significantly different among genotypes of the C573T polymorphism [CC 1.30(1.15–1.45), CT 1.14(1.00–1.28), and TT 0.94(0.68–1.20), P< .05]. Both office and ambulatory blood pressure and the TT/C573T genotype were independently related to logUAE, and, at the same BP values, UAE was lower in subjects with this genotype. We have found that the C573T polymorphism is on linkage disequilibrium with A1166C, as the 573T allele is closely linked to the presence of the 1166A allele, but not vice versa. Haplotype analysis among subjects with the AA genotype for the A1166C polymorphism confirms the influence of the TT genotype of the C573T polymorphism on the UAE in hypertensives. The C573T polymorphism of the angiotensin II receptor AT1 gene seems to be a genetic protective factor for UAE in a population of essential hypertensives.

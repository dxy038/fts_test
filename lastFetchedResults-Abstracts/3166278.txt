Restoration of gated nuclear cardiac images by three noniterative and two iterative filters is evaluated and compared. Lowest root mean square error for a test image set is obtained with the constrained least squares filter and the Wiener filter. A method of estimating the regularization parameter by minimizing the cross validatory objective function is also shown to be effective.

This paper shows a complete description of a new EFT (electronic funds transfer) service over IP for the current payment terminals. These new EFT services carry all the electronic transactions from the POS (point of sale) terminals to the authorization centres (host) through an IP network with special TCP-X.25 gateways. These services establish a secure connection with the gateways to make the electronic transactions. This work presents two kind of solutions depending on the transmission technology used: GPRS (general packet radio service) or ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line). The security of the system has been the main objective of this investigation. This paper describes all the security algorithms implemented and it presents the results obtained in a real installation

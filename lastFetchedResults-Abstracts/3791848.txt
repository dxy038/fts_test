The problem of controller placements in large-scale linear systems is considered. Specifically, given a large-scale linear system it is desired to find the optimal number of linear controllers, the optimal locations in the system to place these controllers and the optimal feedback gain of each controller so that an objective function is optimised, and also so that other desirable properties of the controlled system, such as eigenstructure assignment, can occur. A formulation of the controller placement problem is presented. A general solution algorithm based on simulated annealing is developed for the controller placement problem. The solution algorithm can arrive at the globally optimal solution. The solution algorithm has been applied to an eleven-bay structure comprising a 132-dimension linear system with very promising results.

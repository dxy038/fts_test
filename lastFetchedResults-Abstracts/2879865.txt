In this paper, we present an original solution for RF to DC conversion with multiple antennas. The presented device operates at 2.45 GHz. It combines passive parasitic element antennas (PEA) and RF to DC converters. The proposed device collects the RF energy with six independent antennas and realizes the conversion and summation of the DC voltage. The objective is to perform a uniform coverage of a room with a gain superior to a single and omnidirectional antenna. The typical application can be energy harvesting or command unit in home automation. This last application is our goal and the interest of the solution has been demonstrated through an application that aims at reducing standby mode consumption of electronic devices. The paper focuses on the attention required to realize an efficient summation. The whole system has been designed and manufactured to work in rooms from 3 to 15 meters side. The measured performances have validated this solution.

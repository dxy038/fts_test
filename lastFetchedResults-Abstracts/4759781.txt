In the solution of image recovery inverse problem, the objective functional can often be modeled as the minimization of the sum of two (not necessarily differential) lower semicontinuous convex functional in a real Hilbert space. A decomposition method derived from Peaceman-Rachford splitting algorithm for monotone operator-splitting is proposed to solve this generic problem. Applications to image deblurring and non-Gaussian denoising in a tight frame are also presented. Finally numerical computations comparing with other classical methods are demonstrated.

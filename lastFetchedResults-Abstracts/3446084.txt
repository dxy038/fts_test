In the project of developing a method of transferring pictures from the high definition video system (HDVS) to 35mm motion picture film, a new audio recording method was sought which would match the quality of HDVS. This objective was achieved with a new system that produces a stereo sound track of the variable area type directly on the film by an electron beam.

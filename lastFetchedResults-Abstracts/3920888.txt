Fuzzy linear programming problems are discussed in which both constraints and objective functions are assumed to be fuzzy inequalities. The problem is to obtain a fuzzy solution such that the fuzzy inequalities hold. It is shown how to reduce this problem to the conventional linear programming problem so that it can be easily solved by the ordinary algorithms of linear programming.

The objective of this research is to maximize the channel profits with considering pricing and inventory management simultaneously. Two models have been developed with and without order synchronization in the channel. Numerical experiments are given to examine the feasibility and performance of the models. The results of the experiments indicate that the model with proper order synchronization is better in maximizing the profits for the supplier and the retailers.

The objective here is to develop a flat surface area measuring system which is used to calculate the surface area of any irregular sheet. The irregular leather sheet is used in this work. The system is self protected by user name and password set through software for security purpose. Only authorize user can enter into the system by entering the valid pin code. After entering into the system, the user can measure the area of any irregular sheet, monitor and control the system. The heart of the system is Programmable Logic Controller (Master K80S) which controls the complete working of the system. The controlling instructions for the system are given through the designed Human to Machine Interface (HMI). For communication purpose the GSM modem is also interfaced with the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The remote user can also monitor the current status of the devices by sending SMS message to the GSM modem.

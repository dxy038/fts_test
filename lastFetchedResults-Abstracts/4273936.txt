Based on some features in the lead-zinc sintering process, such as complex relations, multiple objectives, multiple constraints, firstly, the relational models of quantity-quality indexes parameters, process parameters and operation parameters are proposed, which synthesize a lot of techniques, including principal components analysis, neural network, grey relation analysis and so on. And objective functions of the coordination-optimization control in the overall sintering process are deduced. Secondly, the optimization parameters are calculated using multi-objective coordinated evolutionary algorithm. Finally, the fuzzy expert coordinating controller is designed to coordinate the overall sintering process, and the optimization guidance is introduced. The coordinating control techniques based on multi-objective intelligent optimization of the overall sintering process are efficient and practical in achieving the comprehensive production indices of high quantity and quality, and improving the effect of sinters in industrial practice.

As an emerging new electrical load, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)â€™ impact on the power grid has drawn increasing attention worldwide. An optimal scenario is that by digging the potential of PEVs as a moveable energy storage device, they may not harm the power grid by, for example, triggering extreme surges in demand at rush hours, conversely, the large-scale penetration of PEVs could benefit the grid through flattening the power load curve, hence, increase the stability, security and operating economy of the grid. This has become a hot issue which is known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology within the framework of smart grid. In this paper, a scenario of V2G implementation within regional smart grids is discussed. Then, the problem is mathematically formulated. It is essentially an optimization problem, and the objective is to minimize the overall load variance. With the increase of the scale of PEVs and charging posts involved, the computational complexity will become tremendously high. Therefore, a double-layer optimal charging (DLOC) strategy is proposed to solve this problem. The comparative study demonstrates that the proposed DLOC algorithm can effectively solve the problem of tremendously high computational complexity arising from the large-scaled PEVs and charging posts involved.

This paper presents a group search optimizer with multiple producer (GSOMP) for reactive power dispatch incorporating with flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices, which is formulated as a nonlinear constrained multi-objective optimization problem. The optimal location of multi-type FACTS devices and their control parameters are optimized by GSOMP to minimize the real power loss and also to improve voltage profile. The performance of GSOMP has been evaluated on the standard IEEE 14-bus and New England 39-bus test systems respectively. Simulation results show that the performance of the power systems is improved with multi-type FACTS devices optimally placed in the reactive power planning model.

Optimum ecological and thermal performance assessments of an Ericsson cryogenic refrigerator system are investigated in different optimization settings. To evaluate this goal, ecological and thermal approaches are proposed for the Ericsson cryogenic refrigerator, and three objective functions (input power, coefficient of performance and ecological objective function) are gained for the suggested system. Throughout the current research, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) and thermodynamic analysis are employed to specify optimum values of the input power, coefficient of performance and ecological objective function of an Ericsson cryogenic refrigerator system. Four setups are assessed for optimization of the Ericsson cryogenic refrigerator. Throughout the three scenarios, a conventional single-objective optimization has been utilized distinctly with each objective function, nonetheless of other objectives. Throughout the last setting, input power, coefficient of performance and ecological function objectives are optimized concurrently employing a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (GA) named the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). As in multi-objective optimization, an assortment of optimum results named the Pareto optimum frontiers are gained rather than a single ultimate optimum result gained via conventional single-objective optimization. Thus, a process of decision making has been utilized for choosing an ultimate optimum result. Well-known decision-makers have been performed to specify optimized outcomes from the Pareto optimum results in the space of objectives. The outcomes gained from aforementioned optimization setups are discussed and compared employing an index of deviation presented in this work.

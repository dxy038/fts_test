This paper treats implementation and signal processing aspects concerning the Iterative Regression Tuning (IRT). Use is made of a conventional control system (CS) structure with PI controller to control a class of second-order servo systems with an integral component. Steps towards the optimal design of the PI controllers in terms of a new IRT algorithm are done to minimize the objective functions defined as the weighted sum of overshoot and rise time. A case study dealing with the angular position control of a DC servo system with backlash is included. The improvement of CS performance indices due to IRT is illustrated by real-time experimental results.

Inroduction & Objective: MS is an autoimmune disease and inflammation in the central nervous system. Kellussia odoratissma as a traditional medicinal plant has been used as anti-inflammation is some area of Iran. Vitamin B12 properties are regulators of the immune system. This study aimed to determine the effect anti-inflammatory of Kellussia and B12 on Lysosomal enzymes and tissue maker enzymes in Rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Material and Methods:50female Rats (180-200gr) divided to 5 groups. EAEwas induced in 40 Rats. Kellussia odoratissma(300 mg/kg) and B12 were Intraperitoneal administered for 10 days to EAE animals. The anti-inflammatory  activity was assassed by measuring clinical conditions, levels of lysosomal enzymes, tissue marker enzymes. Results were expressed as MeanÂ± S.D. and statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, to determine significant differences between groups.
Results: Treatment of EAE rats with Kellussia odoratissma extract and B12 led to significant decreased of clinical conditions, levels of lysosomal enzymes and tissue marker enzymes(p < 0.05).
Conclusion:Kellussia odoratissma extract and B12 can reduce marker of inflammation and have property anti-inflammation.

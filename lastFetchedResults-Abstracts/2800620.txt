Energy and reliability optimization are two of the most critical objectives for the synthesis of multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs). Task mapping has shown significant promise as a low cost solution in achieving these objectives as standalone or in tandem as well. This paper proposes a multi-objective design space exploration to determine the mapping of tasks of an application on a multiprocessor system and voltage/frequency level of each tasks (exploiting the DVFS capabilities of modern processors) such that the reliability of the platform is improved while fulfilling the energy budget and the performance constraint set by system designers. In this respect, the reliability of a given MPSoC platform incorporates not only the impact of voltage and frequency on the aging of the processors (wear-out effect) but also on the susceptibility to soft-errors - a joint consideration missing in all existing works in this domain. Further, the proposed exploration also incorporates soft-error tolerance by selective replication of tasks, making the proposed approach an interesting blend of reactive and proactive fault-tolerance. The combined objective of minimizing core aging together with the susceptibility to transient faults under a given performance/energy budget is solved by using a multi-objective genetic algorithm exploiting tasksÂ´ mapping, DVFS and selective replication as tuning knobs. Experiments conducted with reallife and synthetic application graphs clearly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach.

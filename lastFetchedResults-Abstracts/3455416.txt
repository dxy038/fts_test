Fast arithmetic circuits are key elements of high performance computers and data processing systems. In the majority of these applications, multipliers have been a critical and obligatory component in dictating the overall circuit performance when constrained by power consumption and computation speed. Compressors are a critical component of the multiplier circuit, which greatly influence the overall multiplier speed. The authors propose two novel high performance 5 : 2 compressor architectures. The main objective of their designs is to limit the carry propagation to a single stage, thereby reducing the overall propagation delay. The designs are compared with the best one in the literature in terms of delay and are found to have lower values. The analytical techniques use the node capacitances in the signal delay paths to identify the worst delay path. The architectures are implemented with various XOR-XNOR circuits to identify the best one in terms of power and delay. The simulation results of the proposed architectures show lower power and 25% improvement in speed compared to the best architecture reported in the literature for supply voltages ranging from 1.5 V to 3.3 V

Objective; This article reviews the development of studies about the relationship between language and brain as well as of studies on how the language is organized in the brain. Method: This is a review article. The study on the relationship between brain and language are now a day known as neurolinguistics and clinical linguistics. This article is going to discuss the viewpoints on the relationship between language and brain. Results & Conclusion: Four main viewpoints are explained. In ancient viewpoints, language was a psycho-spiritual phenomenon. Later on, language was considered as an organic activity, with the tongue as an organ in the mouth being responsible for it. More recent viewpoints regard language as a sensor motor activity, which is connected to the sensory and motor areas in the brain. In modern viewpoints, language is a complex and multidimensional activity, which not only has relationship with different areas of the brain but also has effect on the structure and function of the brain. These viewpoints mainly rely on clinical and pathological evidences. In addition to these evidences, modern technology (such as fMRI) has provided the thinkers and scientists the opportunity to study the relationship. There still remain many unknowns and secrets about the nature of organization and processing of language in the brain.

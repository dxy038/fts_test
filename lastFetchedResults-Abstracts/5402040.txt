In a previous paper presented at CEC´2011, we reported the implementation of a chess engine based on evo- lutionary programming with a selection mechanism that relied on grandmaster´s chess games. The objective was to decide the virtual players that would pass to the following generation. Here, we use these same techniques to adjust a larger number of weights (29 in this work instead of the 5 used in the previous one). The aim was to improve the rating of our chess engine. We also introduce here the use of a local search scheme based on the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, which is adopted to adjust the weights of the best virtual player obtained in the evolutionary process. As our results indicate, this produced a further improvement in the rating of our chess engine. As in our previous work, the material values of the additional pieces considered here are similar to the values known from chess theory.

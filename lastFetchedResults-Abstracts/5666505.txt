A novel two-level scheme for designing protocols for optimal traffic routing in large communication networks is presented. Major strong points of the scheme are: (i) it is adaptive to changes in load and network topology, (ii) permits consideration of multiple objective functions in performance optimization, and (iii) combines elements of flow control and routing for an effective control of traffic congestion.

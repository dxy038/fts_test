A position measurement system using CCD cameras is designed for large-gap magnetic suspension applications. White dots are placed on a magnetically suspended model, which is then scanned by CCD cameras against a black background. A real-time hardware system is applied to detect the coordinates of these white dots and generate corresponding attitude data for the suspended model by the lookup-table method. Circuit hardware is designed and implemented with efficient algorithms to accomplish the objective. The purpose of the real-time measurement system is to detect the position and attitude of the magnetically suspended model and to feed this information to the control circuit. System analysis and test results are presented

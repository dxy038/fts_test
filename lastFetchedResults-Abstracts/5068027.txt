The paper presents a predictive models management system called DeVisa that offers online services such as: scoring, model composition, model comparison, search and statistics. For the purpose of interaction between the consumer applications and the DeVisa system a XML-based language called PMQL is defined. The paper focuses on the scoring service as an online knowledge provider, analyzes the challenges in achieving this objective and the solutions that were found. From a technological perspective DeVisa uses a native XML database system for storing the predictive models expressed in PMML and an XQuery library for processing the models. All the functionality is provided via Web Services.

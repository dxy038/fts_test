Land use based on its capability and production potential, and preparation of economically affordable and applicable allocation plans is one of the proper management factors in maintaining of Irreversible natural resources such as water and soil. The purpose of this study is to obtain different allocation plans for Cheragh-Veis watershed and to select the most economical and suitable of them by using the economic factors in regard to economic-social conditions of watershed residents. In order to perform the land allocation process, quantitative -comparative and multi objective land allocation methods were used, which after the evaluation and determining of land abilities by merging the maps in the GIS environment and prioritizing the land uses, two allocation maps were obtained. For economical evaluating of these two logistics projects, economic indexes: establishment costs, gross margin and benefit-cost ratio were calculated. The results showed that the benefit-cost ratio index for obtained allocated plans from the quantitative -comparative and multi objective land allocation methods were 4.043 and 1.54, respectively. With regard to once a watershed plan will be economically applicable that its benefit-cost ratio index is greater than 1, therefore both logistics projects economically affordable and is applicable.

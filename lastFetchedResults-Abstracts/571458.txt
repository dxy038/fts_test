Objective(s): A critical study of the result of the scientific researches is one of the most well known and useful methods to make the scientific theories accurate and the development of knowledge in the present scientific society. Social engineering is used in the west for some time to improve the social problems and to manage the institutions of the society better. " Quran and social engineering" has been presented in Iran at a previous time by Dr Soleiman Khakban in order to localize social engineering based on the principles of Islam religion and its use at the service of the Islamic republic of Iran. In my opinion the article has some ambiguities that I examine
them in the present article.
Methods: My method in this article is critically. in other worlds, critical discourse analysis. I examine the article critically. It seems that it needs a scientific operation.
Conclusion: If social engineering becomes localized properly it can remove the social difficulties
and it makes the management of the social institutions in Iran better. And finally it can notably
help the development and the honor of the Islamic system. But for this purpose it is necessary to remove that propounded ambiguities and "social engineering with Quranic tendency" should be explained and then the way of starting and using of this knowledge should also be defined precisely.
Key words: social engineering- social engineering with Quranic tendency- localization- scientific
review.

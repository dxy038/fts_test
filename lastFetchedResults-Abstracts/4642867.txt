Main objective of this research proposal is to develop ruggedised Communication System. The research work is undertaken after adopting integrated approach to meet the stringent requirements of equipment design methodologies and compatibility for EMI/EMC, ESS, Environmental test conditions, Ingress protection, Corrosion and Mould growth protection standards. The different EMI methodologies are explored and some of them are implemented. The ruggedised EMI enclosures using Aluminum HE-30 cabinets, conductive gaskets and Copper foil with conductive adhesives are designed for Global Positioning System (GPS) based Vehicle Tracking System (VTS) Transmitter and Receiver boards. The boards with enclosures are tested in national EMI test laboratory. The measured radiation level could be restricted to around 20 dB &#956;V/m in horizontal and vertical directions. The radiation levels are also checked with the help of Agilent Spectrum Analyzer E4411-B and close field EMI Probes 11940A / 11941A with and without enclosure. From the observed radiation in dbm, Field strength (E), Field Strength (H), and Power Density (S) are calculated and compared with standard MIL-STD-461E. By the implementation of enclosure, the radiated emission reduced by around 30dB to 50dB. The enclosure meets compatibility requirements for radiated emission as per MIL-STD-461E.

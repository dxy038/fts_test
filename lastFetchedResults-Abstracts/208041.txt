The objective of present study was to investigate the effects of various levels of vitamins E and C
in milk and tris extenders on Atabay ram semen characteristics in liquid condition. Semen was
collected from 6 rams and mixed together at once. Semen samples received different treatments in
milk and tris extenders. Spermatozoa characteristics including percentage of motile and viable cells
were assessed. This experiment was carried out in 3x3x5 factorial arrangement with the use of
completely randomized design. Treatments were included various levels of vitamin E (0, 30 and 60
ug/rnl), vitamin C (0, 150 and 300 ug/ml) and different storage times (0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hour). Results
showed that the effect of vit, E on motility and viability percentage of spermatozoa in milk and tris
extenders were significant (P<O.OI). The effect of vit. C on motility percentage of spermatozoa in tris
extender was significant (P<0.05). The effect of different storage times on viability and motility
percentage of spermatozoa in milk and tris extenders were significant (P<O.OI). Mean comparison on
the basis of Duncan test showed that the highest motility (%69.42) and viability (%71.62) of
spermatozoa were obtained in tris extender containing 30 ug/ml vit. E. Therefore, use of vitamins E
and C in tris extender and use of vitamin E in milk extender is recommended for storage of Atabay
ram semen in liquid condition.

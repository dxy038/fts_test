The objective of the study was to assess the impact of fugitive particulate emissions from a cement plant on a nearby community. High volume samplers were used for the determinations of total suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations at representative assessment points situated nearest to the cement site at three existing residential houses. Furthermore, dust impact arising from cement plant on the three existing residential houses was predicted using an air quality model (fugitive dust model, FDM). The emission rates of dust from various activities of the cement plant were estimated by using the emission factors technique. The measured (high sampler) and predicted (FDM) values of dust concentration were compared. The results of the study showed that the agreement between the 24-h average predicted and measured dust concentrations were excellent. Although the model under-predicted slightly the measured dust concentrations, yet the FDM was adequate for application at the cement plant. Furthermore, the spatial isopleths of TSP concentration for cement plant and its surrounding environment indicated that the predicted ground level of dust concentrations, close to the cement plant, exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value of 120 Î¼g/m3. This study was invaluable for locating areas nearby the cement plant that are at risk of approaching or exceeding guideline TSP concentrations.

Results: The structural modeling analysis indicated that self-efficacy and perceived instrumentality had a direct and significant impact on academic achievement, and the result indicated that relationship between self- efficacy and perceived instrumentality was mediated by self-regulating learning. Conclusion: In this model, all regression weights were statistically significant and predictors explained %54 variance of academic achievement. In general, the results indicated the direct and indirect impact of self-efficacy and perceived instrumentality (through mediation of self- regulating learning) on academic achievement.

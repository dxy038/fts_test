Acute or chronic myocardial ischemia may develop in patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and right ventricular-dependent coronary circulation. In such cases an aorta to right ventricle shunt may be used to reverse this ischemia. This report summarizes our experience with the placement of an aortic to right ventricular shunt in 5 patients. The shunts were made of Gore-Tex and ranged from 4 mm to 8 mm. Associated procedures were bidirectional Glenn (n = 2) and Fontan (n = 2). All 5 patients survived the procedure with documented early graft patency and no evidence of ischemia.

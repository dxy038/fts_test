Cognitive radio (CR) wireless parameter optimization is a typical multi-objective optimization problem. In order to design wireless parameters, a multiobjective immune genetic algorithm is presented based on non-dominated sort in this paper. Comparative studies are performed between the proposed algorithm and NSGA-II by the use of four typical multi-objective functions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the multi-objective optimization problems and has a more obvious advantage than NSGA-II. We design a control module using the proposed algorithm and simulate the optimal design of CR parameters based on the IEEE 802.11a physical platform. The simulation results show that the algorithm is effective.

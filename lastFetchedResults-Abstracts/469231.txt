Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate B vitamins and homocysteine as risk factor for offspring with spina bifida.
Study design
Blood samples from 45 mothers and their children with spina bifida and from 83 control mothers and their children were obtained to determine the levels of serum and red blood cell folate, serum vitamin B12, whole blood vitamin B6, and total plasma homocysteine.
Results
In the case mothers, the vitamin B12 concentration was 21% lower (95% CI, 8%-33%) compared with control mothers. Unlike folate, vitamin B6, and homocysteine, a vitamin B12 concentration of â‰¤185 pmol/L was associated with a 3.5-fold (95% CI, 1.3- 8.9) spina bifida risk. In children, no differences in folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and homocysteine concentrations were observed after adjustment for the child's age.
Conclusion
A marginal maternal vitamin B12 status increases the risk of an offspring with spina bifida.

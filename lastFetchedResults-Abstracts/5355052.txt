Despite the success of implantable batteries as commonly used in pacemakers, implantable neural prosthetic devices typically have power requirements that exceed the capability of reasonably-sized implantable batteries. Therefore, transcutaneous magnetic coupling remains the method of choice for powering implanted neural prostheses. Using the same inductive link for transfer of power and bidirectional telemetry is an attractive solution to powering and communicating with implanted devices thus avoiding percutaneous plugs, wires, or conduits. The Class-E power oscillator has been identified as a highly-efficient transmitter circuit for use as a means of transferring power to an implant. Although the high-Q nature of this topology makes rapid modulation difficult, it is feasible to use synchronous frequency-shift-keyed (FSK) modulation of the Class-E circuit thereby combining an efficient power transmitter with a highspeed data link. Using this method, the transmitter can be modulated on a cycle-by-cycle basis with little to no additional power loss. Within an implanted device, demodulation of the FSK transmitted carrier can be accomplished using a novel demodulation circuit.

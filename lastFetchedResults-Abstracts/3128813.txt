Axis-symmetric component is regarded as the research objective in this paper. Based on a model of phase heat transfer coefficient and a Box-Behnken experiment with five factors and three levels, the experiment results are fitted by stepwise regression method and response surface methodology. The response surface formulas are established, that fitted deformation degree, average equivalent residual stress of surface, standard deviation of equivalent residual stress, average surface hardness and standard deviation of surface hardness. And, the four response surface formulas are taken as the objectives and multi-optimization mathematical model is built. Based on improved grey absolute incidence, hybrid discrete multi-optimization with equal probability chaotic genetic algorithm is put forward and the program is compiled. After optimization five items of evaluation objectives are improved. The quenching quality using technical parameters after optimization is much better than before optimization.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Capsanthin is a main carotenoid pigment of hot (red) pepper with some therapeutic effects similar to capsaicin. This study was done to determine its effect as an ointment contained capsanthin and comparison of its effects with such effects of diclofenac gel in treatment of osteoarthritis.
METHODS: This double- blind clinical trial was performed on 34 patients referred to rheumatology clinic. Patients were divided into three groups. Effective material of red pepper (capsanthin), diclofenac gel and ointment base (as placebo) were used in first (9 persons), second (15 persons) and third (10 persons) groups, respectively. Patients were evaluated regarding functional pain, resting pain and swelling of knee joint of baseline before and after two weeks of treatment. The severity of pain and swelling were assessed by Lickert scale from 0 (no pain or swelling) to 4 (severe pain and swelling). Data were provided by examination and filling in questionnaire.
FINDINGS: Compared to baseline values, diclofenac gel and placebo were effective in reducing functional pain and resting pain (p<0.05). Whereas, only pepper ointment was effective on resting pain. No treated groups showed any significant difference in joint swelling. Comparison of each group in efficacy showed that the efficacy of diclofenac and pepper on joint swelling was not more significant than placebo, but diclofenac was significantly more effective than red pepper on functional pain (p<0.02). The efficacy of each treatment group and placebo on resting pain was not significant.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed no preference in efficacy of red pepper ointment (capsanthin) to diclofenac gel or placebo on functional pain and resting pain of knee osteoarthritis.

The objective of this study was to assess the combined effects of drought stress and foliar application of zinc and manganese on seed quality of red bean 
(Naz variety) during the accelerated aging test. An experiment was carried out as split factorial arrangement based on randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications at the research farm of Shahrekord University during 
2010-2011. Drought stress levels (irrigation after 50, 70 and 90 mm evaporation from class A evaporation pan) were as the main plot, factorial combination of zinc and manganese foliar application (0, 100, 200 and 0, 150, 300 g ha-1 for zinc and manganese, respectively) were as sub-plots. After harvesting the seeds and preparation of composite samples, seeds were evaluated through the accelerated aging tests with four replications. The results showed that drought stress didnâ€™t have any significant effect on germination indices. Mn foliar application increased germination rate, seedling dry weight and vigor indices (I and II). Among, Mn foliar application treatment, 150 g ha-1 Mn had the highest germination indices. Among Zn foliar application levels, maximum seedling length, dry weight and vigor indices (I and II) were obtained for application of 100 g Zn per hectare. Based on the results of this study, drought stress with application of low concentration of Zn and Mn improves seed quality during the accelerated aging test as well as the seed storage capabilities.

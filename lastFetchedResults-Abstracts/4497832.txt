Summary form only given. The interest in OPOs have been renewed last years because of advances in solid-state pump lasers and new nonlinear-optical materials. The use of the OPO concept in industrial compact systems such as range-finders or gas detectors require the reduction of pump laser size. The objective of the work was to use a Q-switched Nd:YAG microchip laser to pump an OPO and thus to obtain a Q-switched high-frequency all-solid-state light-source emitting between 1.3 /spl mu/m and 4 /spl mu/m.

This paper discusses about a multi-port solid state transformer (SST) which can be used as an inter-grid power flow controller. The objective of the converter is to integrate renewable energy sources with the existing grid along with controlled power flow between the grids. As an example, this paper describes a three terminal isolated SST with an integrated battery bank connected to it. The energy extracted from the renewable energy sources can be stored in the battery bank or can be directly fed to the utility grid. A suitable converter structure is chosen to activate bidirectional power flow between the energy sources. The extracted energy can also be used to supply the local demand. A laboratory prototype of the converter has been built and the functionality of the converter is validated with detailed experimental results.

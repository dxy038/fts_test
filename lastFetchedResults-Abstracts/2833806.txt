Dependence on the prior magnetic map become one of the key problems which restrict the development of the geomagnetic navigation. This paper inspired from the animal navigation behavior which dispense with the priori geomagnetic map. First, we generalize the bio-inspired navigation process as a multi-objective problems. Then, present a stress evolution search AUV navigation model for the particularity of geomagnetic navigation, which make multi-objective problem solving search combine with navigation movement to achieve the purpose of navigation. Finally, compared the present model with a gradient descent model with part priori geomagnetic map. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm allows the AUV to navigate efficiently using geomagnetic information without prior map. The proposed algorithm offers insights into the research and application of the biologically inspired geomagnetic navigation.

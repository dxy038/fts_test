The hybrid approach of active and passive filter combination is used to eliminate the harmonics in non-linear load is presented in this paper. The objective of the proposed work is to mainly concentrate on reduction of load current harmonics and power factor improvement. The active filter is used to eliminate low order high amplitude harmonics, which is not an economic solution. Even though the passive filters are accepted as cost-effective solution, there is a chance for occurrence of resonance in the system. In this condition, the combination of filters may help to improve filtering characteristics. This strategy improves the passive filter compensation characteristics without depending on the system impedance and avoiding the resonance problem. The combined hybrid filter is designed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The performance is analyzed, compared with various conditions, and results are presented.

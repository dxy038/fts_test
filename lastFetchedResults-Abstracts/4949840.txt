The parallel existence of different transport technologies in todayÂ´s networks is a challenging aspect for network planning and operation. Due to the grooming and multiplexing possibilities at multiple layers, the routing complexity increases dramatically. We develop a network model and an integer linear program (ILP) formulation to compute the optimal network design. The novel ldquopath over pathrdquo concept maps traffic demands into grooming flows that are provisioned as transparent lightpaths. This approach enables scalability of the problem size by limiting the number of eligible grooming configurations and transparent lightpaths. The optimization objective is to minimize the overall capital expenditures with respect to the deployed network equipment. Case study results show that the cost relation transponders/muxponders and restrictions on the equipment have a significant impact on the routing and network configuration.

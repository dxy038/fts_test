The objective of this paper is to provide an novel solution to construct an ultra compact transceiver module to achieve cost saving and weight reduction goals required for a large aperture phased array. The idea is to utilize variable periphery amplifiers to modulate the magnitude of the in-phase and quadrature component of the input signal. The phase of the combined signal then can be varied in a similar fashion to an IQ modulator. The advantage of the approach is the realization of an amplifier with built-in phase shifting capability. The typical performance degradation associated with the phase shifter in the conventional design can then be avoided.

Field research on step–pool channels has largely focused on the dimensions and sequence of steps and pools and how these features vary with slope, grain sizes and other governing variables. Measurements by different investigators are frequently compared, yet no means to identify steps and pools objectively have been used. Automated surveying instruments record the morphology of streams in unprecedented detail making it possible to objectively identify steps and pools, provided an appropriate classification procedure can be developed.

ieve objective identification of steps and pools from long profile survey data, we applied a series of scale-free geometric rules that include minimum step length (2.25% of bankfull width (Wb)), minimum pool length (10% of Wb), minimum residual depth (0.23% of Wb), minimum drop height (3.3% of Wb), and minimum step slope (10° greater than the mean slope). The rules perform as well as the mean response of 11 step–pool researchers who were asked to classify four long profiles, and the results correspond well with the channel morphologies identified during the field surveys from which the long profiles were generated. The method outperforms four other techniques that have been proposed. Sensitivity analysis shows that the method is most sensitive to the choice of minimum pool length and minimum drop height.

ed bed scans of a step–pool channel created in a flume reveal that a single long profile with a fixed sampling interval poorly characterizes the steps and pools; five or more long profiles spread across the channel are required if a fixed sampling interval is used and the data suggest that survey points should be located more frequently than the diameter of the step-forming material. A single long profile collected by a surveyor who chooses breaks in slope and representative survey points was found to adequately characterize the mean bed profile.

This book gives a clear, practical, and self-contained presentation of the methods of electrical communications theory. The book concentrates on the general theories and circuit designs that form the backbone of all communications systems. The authorsÂ´ objective is to help students, as well as established scientists and engineers, to develop the skills necessary to analyze the problems that they encounter in their work. The presentation is aimed at teaching the insights that are most useful for approaching new problems. This book assumes only a basic knowledge of differential equations and Laplace transforms.

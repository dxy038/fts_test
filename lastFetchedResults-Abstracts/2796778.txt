We focus on the problem of efficiently integrating wireless users in future Information-Centric Networks (ICN), where communication is based on publish-subscribe primitives. The current host-centric Internet paradigm is abandoned in favor of information-oriented, rendezvous-based communication, where multicast data delivery is the norm. However, Wi-Fi, the predominant means of local wireless connectivity today, but also 3G and 4G technologies, are known to suffer from poor multicast performance. Data destined to a broadcast or multicast address are typically transmitted at lower rates to increase reliability for clients with poor signal conditions, causing unfavorable delays for high-rate users. One approach to this problem is to designate a subset of the clients as relays who re-broadcast packets for other clients at a higher rate. Given that different types of content have different performance requirements, we exploit content-awareness, inherent in our environment, to optimize for different criteria on a per-content basis. For this purpose, we provide a multi-objective optimization formulation for the problem of relay selection and rate assignment, which can capture the tradeoff among reliability, performance and energy cost.

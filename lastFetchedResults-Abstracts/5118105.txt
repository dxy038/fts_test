Slave servo clocks have an essential role in hardware and software synchronization techniques based on Precision Time Protocol (PTP). The objective of servo clocks is to remove the drift between slave and master nodes, while keeping the output timing jitter within given uncertainty boundaries. Up to now, no univocal criteria exist for servo clock design. In fact, the relationship between controller design, performances and uncertainty sources is quite evanescent. In this paper, we propose a quite simple, but exhaustive linear model, which is expected to be used in the design of enhanced servo clock architectures.

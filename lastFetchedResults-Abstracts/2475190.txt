The objective of the paper is twofold: (i) to present a new statistical model for predicting the transport and dispersion of the particulate phase (particles and bubbles) in turbulent flows and (ii) to examine the performance of this model in channel flow emphasizing the effect of particle accumulation. The model presented is based on a kinetic equation for the probability density function (PDF) of velocity distribution and covers the entire range of the particle-to-fluid density ratio (from heavy particles in a gas to bubbles in a liquid).

Power converters systems aimed at renewable energy applications have become a common option for sustainable electricity and distributed generation, since their performance has improved, and prices have steadily been reduced in the last years. However, there are still several drawbacks that hinder their widespread installation, such as the simultaneous minimization of cost and volume, efficiency maximization, size reduction, etc. Quite often, accomplishing these goals requires dealing with complicated optimization problems, which are difficult to solve by classical methods. Metaheuristic techniques provide a viable alternative to solve complex intricate optimization problems, such as those encountered in the development of power electronics converters. This paper presents a comprehensive coverage of metaheuristic methodologies applied in the area of power converters. The review includes a classification of the methodologies and main objective functions in each paper surveyed. An aim for this paper is to highlight the importance of the optimization tools, and the many benefits they provide to tackle the challenges encountered in the design, operation, and control of power converters.

In this paper, adaptive output feedback control strategy is proposed to deal with a class of nonholonomic systems in chained form with strongly nonlinear disturbances and uncertain parameters using output signals only. The objective is to design adaptive nonlinear output feedback laws such that the closed-loop systems are globally asymptotically stable, while the estimated parameters remain bounded. The systematic strategy combines the input-state-scaling and backstepping procedure. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

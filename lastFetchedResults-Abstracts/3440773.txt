The Science Research Council has approved plans for building a 2 GeV electron storage ring at the Daresbury Laboratory specifically for producing beams of synchrotron radiation and so provide a continuing research facility when the electron synchrotron, NINA, is phased out. The initial objective will be to achieve the maximum current obtainable (0.37 A) using a single 250 kW, 500 MHz klystron to provide the RF power. This will produce high fluxes of photons down to 1 &#195;&#133;, initially along three beam lines feeding six experiments. User requirements have dominated the design considerations. Later developments proposed include the addition of a second klystron which will allow the beam current to be increased to 1 A and also provide excess power to supply the additional requirements when special superconducting ´wiggler´ magnets are installed to extend the usable wavelength range down to O.1 A. The number of beam lines is expected to increase to about ten.

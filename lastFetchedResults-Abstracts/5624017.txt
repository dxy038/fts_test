Network reconfiguration in distribution systems is realised by changing the status of sectionalizing switches and is usually done for loss reduction. The distribution reconfiguration belongs to a complex combinatorial optimization problem. This is because there are multiple constraints, which must not be violated while finding an optimal or near-optimal solution to the distribution network reconfiguration problem. An exhaustive search can definitely find the optimal solution but is computationally intensive. Moreover, solution produced by other heuristic search techniques often produce local optima. Consequently, to solve the problem with implementation simplicity, computation efficiency, solution feasibility and optimality, an improved method based on a modified genetic algorithm (GA) with real valued genes and an adaptive mutation rate is used. The distribution network reconfiguration (DNRC) model, in which the objective is to minimize the system power loss, is presented in this paper with application to 16-bus, 33-bus systems and a real distribution network of Mauritius.

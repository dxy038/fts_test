Stereotypes are frequently associated with negative emotions, beliefs and actions against some social groups with different culture, ethnicity, language or race. Stereotyping reflects certain negative feeling as weakness against not only a person but the whole group which that person belongs to. Researches on authoritarian personality show that the formation of stereotyping attitude has its root in the families with excessive emphasis on certain values and disciplines. Family tight control and overseeing of children also produce stereotyping personality. The main objective in this research was to examine the validity of above mentioned findings.

Energy assessment of MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks is generally based on the times of transmit, receive and sleep modes. The switching energy between two consecutive states is generally considered negligible with respect to them. Although such an assumption is valid for traditional wireless ad hoc networks, is this assumption valid also for low duty cycle wireless sensor networks? The primary objective of this work is to shed some light on relationships between node switching energy and node duty cycle over the total energy consumption. In order to achieve the target, initially, we revisit the energy spent in each state and transitions of three widespread hardware platforms for wireless sensor networks by direct measurements on the EYES node. Successively, we apply the values obtained to the SMAC protocol by using the OmNet++ simulator. The main reason for using SMAC is that it is the protocol normally used as a benchmark against other architectures proposed

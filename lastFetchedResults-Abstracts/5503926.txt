The efficacy of four powerline interference suppression methods was tested for application in high-resolution electrocardiogram (ECG). The goal was minimal distortion of the original signal micro-potential waveform, combined with maximum noise reduction. Simulated low amplitude His-bundle potentials were used for the evaluation. Several objective parameters were measured, such as mean square error and mean absolute error. The methods were applied for His-bundle potentials recovery from real surface ECG signals. Synchronous intracardiac signals with well expressed His potential were recorded and used for reference. Modified time-domain subtraction and regression subtraction methods were found superior to notch filters and spectral interpolation.

Background: In context of increasing traffic noise in urban India, the objective of the research study is to assess
noise due to heterogeneous traffic conditions and the impact of honking on it.
Method: Traffic volume, noise levels, honking, road geometry and vehicular speed were measured on national
highway, major and minor roads in Nagpur, India.
Results: Initial study showed lack of correlation between traffic volume and equivalent noise due to some factors,
later identified as honking, road geometry and vehicular speed. Further, frequency analysis of traffic noise showed
that honking contributed an additional 2 to 5 dB (A) noise, which is quite significant. Vehicular speed was also
found to increase traffic noise. Statistical method of analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirms that frequent honking
(p  <  0.01) and vehicular speed (p  <  0.05) have substantial impact on traffic noise apart from traffic volume and
type of road.
Conclusions: The study suggests that honking must also be a component in traffic noise assessment and to
identify and monitor “No Honking” zones in urban agglomerations.

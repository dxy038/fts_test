Tone mapping operators (TMOs) that convert high dynamic range (HDR) images to standard low dynamic range (LDR) images are highly desirable for the visualization of these images on standard displays. Although many existing TMOs produce visually appealing images, it is until recently validated objective measures that can assess their quality have been proposed. Without such objective measures, the design of traditional TMOs can only be based on intuitive ideas, lacking clear goals for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a substantially different tone mapping approach, where instead of explicitly designing a new computational structure for TMO, we search in the space of images to find better quality images in terms of a recent objective measure that can assess the structural fidelity between two images of different dynamic ranges. Specifically, starting from any initial image, the proposed algorithm moves the image along the gradient ascent direction and stops until it converges to a maximal point. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm reliably produces better quality images upon a number of state-of-the-art TMOs.

WPP(Wind Power Penetration) is an important indicator to ensure wind power system security. There were two types of method to calculate WPP in the past. One type of the methods which is used maximum load to calculate WPP is fast but unable to get practical result. Another type of method using stochastic simulation to calculate WPP could get practical result but is slow in calculating speed. To solve these problems, the optimal load is proposed in this paper to calculate WPP. Firstly, a new multi-objective optimization model is given in the paper. Then, two fuzzy weigh coefficients are used to simplify the model. At last, credibility expectation is used to process the fuzzy weight coefficient. Based on a typical wind power system and actual statistical value of load power, simulation results show obvious significance of optimal load calculating method given in this paper.

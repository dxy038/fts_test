Objective (s): Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common condition among women. The aim of this study was to determine quality of life of postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 313 post- menopausal women with urinary incontinence were participated. The data were collected using the Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis (QUID), the Incontinence Severity Index (ISI) and the Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (I-QoL).
Results: The mean QoL score was 46.18 Â± 19.91. Most women (48.6%) reported that suffering from mixed UI and this group had the lowest QoL score. There were significant differences in quality of life score among women suffering from different types of UI (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: The findings indicated that QoL was impaired in women with UI. It seems that health professionals should educate patients and make them aware of available treatments.

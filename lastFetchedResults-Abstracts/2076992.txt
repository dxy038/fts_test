Background: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) may play a role in the development of glioma disease that is one of the most common brain tumors.
Objective: The aim of this study was to detect human CMV in patients with glioma in Imam Khomeini hospital, Tehran.
Methods: This experimental study was conducted on paraffin-embedded tumor samples of 18 patients referred to Imam Khomeini hospital in 2012. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed with monoclonal antibody specific for HCMV PP65 protein and the samples were assessed using a light microscope.
Findings: Of 18 patients, 13 (72.2%) were positive for HCMV PP65 protein and four of them expired. 
Conclusion: With regards to the results, more comprehensive studies are recommended for detection of HCMV in patients with glioma using different diagnostic methods.

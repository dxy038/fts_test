Objective
This study was undertaken to assess training availability, methods, and plans for future practice of invasive procedures for maternal fetal medicine (MFM) fellows.
Study design
A survey was sent to all MFM fellows registered with the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology in March of 2001.
Results
Of 91 surveys, 55 (60.4%) were returned. All respondents were trained in second-trimester amniocentesis and planned on performing the procedure after fellowship. Of the 55 respondents, 53 (96.4%) were trained on continuing pregnancies. Despite 82% of training institutions performing chorionic villus sampling (CVS), only 24 of 45 (53%) fellows had availability for training. Of those 24, 14 (58%) initiated training on pregnancies that were undergoing termination. Median number of procedures performed by fellows (continuing pregnancies and before termination) was 3 (range 0-120), with 40 procedures (range 0-140) expected to be performed before completing fellowship. Twenty-eight fellows planned on performing CVS after training.
Conclusion
The number of centers training MFM fellows in CVS and the number of procedures performed in the United States is limited.

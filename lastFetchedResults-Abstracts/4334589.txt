The present work investigates the dynamic behaviour of a mixed system consisting of a wind farm and a diesel group supplying a load, under different disturbances. In this regard, dynamic models and control systems that enable the generation part to support the grid are needed. The objective of this work has been also the implementation of the diesel group model and its afferent control system into Matlab-Simulink and to demonstrate their use by evaluating the response in time of the electric parameters.

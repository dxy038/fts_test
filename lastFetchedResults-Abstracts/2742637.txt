Mobile robots in field environment travel not only on even terrain but also on uneven or sloped terrain. Practical methods for preventing tip-over on the mobile robot are essentials since this operational condition is very perilous, more when the robotics systems will require that their manipulator perform operations while being carried by moving vehicles near human operators. This paper propose and make a computational probe of a fuzzy controller that modifies the position of the arm on mobile platform to change the gravity center of the set using the concept of Minimal Distance Vector, the objective is improve the cuasi-estatic stability of the robot at low velocities and reduce the computational cost for the controller.

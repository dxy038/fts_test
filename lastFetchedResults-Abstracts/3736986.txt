This note addresses the problem of enforcing generalized mutual exclusion constraints on a Petri net plant. First, we replace the classical partition of the event set into controllable and uncontrollable events from supervisory control theory, by associating a control and observation cost to each event. This leads naturally to formulate the supervisory control problem as an optimal control problem. Monitor places which enforce the constraint are devised as a solution of an integer linear programming problem whose objective function is expressed in terms of the introduced costs. Second, we consider timed models for which the monitor choice may lead to performance optimization. If the plant net belongs to the class of mono-T-semiflow nets, we present an integer linear fractional programming approach to synthesize the optimal monitor so as to minimize the cycle time lower bound of the closed loop net. For strongly connected marked graphs the cycle time of the closed-loop net can be minimized

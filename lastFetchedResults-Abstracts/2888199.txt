Though considerable research has been carried out into capacitive touch sensing, the geometrical layout of sensors and its effects on accuracy and noise sensitivity have not been explored. This paper examines the sensor patterns and interpolation algorithms used in current touch screens. Its main aim is to evaluate sensor patterns using image processing techniques, thereby providing a methodology for objective comparison that lends itself to easily testing new designs. The paper presents results comparing the accuracy and reliability of three sensor patterns from the patent literature in combination with four well-known interpolation algorithms.

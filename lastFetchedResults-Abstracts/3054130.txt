The objective of this study is creating a vegetable product forecasting system that uses an adaptive genetic algorithm as a method to find out a parameter set for objective function to predict vegetable product weight in the future. The system is installed in a personal computer (Intel Pentium 4 and main memory 512 MHz.) that is implemented with Borland Delphi 6 and MS Access 2000. The system is tested by 5 types of vegetable, an error of an experimental result with tested data isnÂ´t more than 10 percent with 0.05 level of significance, this is clear that the system can be applied to forecast the actual vegetable data.

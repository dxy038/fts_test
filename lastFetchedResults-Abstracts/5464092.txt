The huge bandwidth of optical fibres is exploited through wavelength division multiplexing technology, which introduces new complexities in the routing problem. In this context, the wavelength converter allocation problem has become a key factor to minimize blocking. The wavelength converter allocation problem has been treated as a mono-objective problem minimizing the number of wavelength converters or minimizing blocking; however, both criteria are in conflict with each other. Therefore, the wavelength converter allocation problem is studied here in a pure multi-objective optimization context for more appropriate decision making. This work proposes a multi-objective optimization approach based on an evolutionary algorithm which simultaneously minimizes blocking and the number of wavelength converters. Extensive simulations on three real optical networks show promising results in the sense that our algorithm generates the trade-off curve between blocking and the number of converters needed, and outperforms a recently proposed approach.

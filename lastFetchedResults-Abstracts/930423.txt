Organisms of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (TBC) are responsible for tuberculosis, a chronic disease which represents a serious public health problem in the world. The most common means of contracting the disease are through inhalation of aerosols, drinking of unpasteurised milk from an infected cow and the sharing of common water or feed sources.
In this study a rapid, sensitive and reliable PCR-based method for specific detection of the Mycobacterium TB complex directly from raw milk samples was developed. The DNA extraction method was effective and able to remove inhibitors and allowed the isolation of amplifiable DNA. The procedure demonstrated the presence of the TBC mpb70 gene in 36/50 (72%) of Albanian milk samples tested. The study highlights the need to screen extracommunitarian milk to define an epidemiological background and to guarantee the quality of the raw milk in countries lacking a suitable TB-infection control plan.

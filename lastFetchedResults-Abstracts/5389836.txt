In this paper we provide a solution to the mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H <sub>&#8734;</sub> problem for linear time-varying systems in terms of the solvability of differential linear matrix inequalities, including a discussion of how to construct a controller. Immediate specialization lead to a solution of the mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> problem for linear parametrically varying systems and for linear time invariant systems. For the latter system class we show how one can incorporate nominal asymptotic tracking or disturbance rejection as an additional objective

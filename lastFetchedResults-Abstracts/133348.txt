
Low moisture mozzarella or pizza cheese is a prominent member of the pasta filata, or stretched curd cheese that originated in Italy. Pasta filata cheese are distinguished by a unique plasticizing and kneading treatment of the fresh curd in hot water. In recent years this cheese is produced in Iran in amount far less than processed or the so called "pizza cheese". Low moisture mozzarella cheese is traditionally produced using a mixed thermophilic starter culture, However, it is also produced by direct acidification in some countries, using an organic acid. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of two types of organic acid (Lactic and Citric acid) at three pH levels (5.3,5.6,5.8) on yield and chemical (calcium), rheological (elastisity) and sensory (taste and flavor) properties of cheese in comparison with traditional mozzarella cheese at pH=5.3. A factorial experiment in completely randomized design was used for statistical analysis. Results indicated that the type of acid and pH used for initial pH adjustment had a significant effect on yield, chemical properties and elastisity (p<0.01). The interaction of acid type and pH had a significant effect on calcium and elastisity (p<0.05) but had no effect on yield (p>0.05). Type of acid and pH significantly affected taste and flavor (p<0.05) but the interaction of pH and acid type had only a significant effect on stretchability (p<0.05) but had no effect on taste and flovor (p>0.05).The results of sensory evaluation revealed that traditional cheese and cheese made with citric acid at pH=5.3 and pH=5.6 ,respectively scored higher values than other samples.

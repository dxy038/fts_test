We present a stochastic model for evaluating distributed generation investment under uncertainty. The objective is to estimate the break-even price and its probability distribution. The model is developed based on the probabilistic influence diagram technique and the main uncertain variables are explicitly represented by probability distribution functions. We use our model to study a photovoltaic generation project.

In these days automobile industry, the request for ultra-compact electric vehicles has been increasing in Japan. Unlike conventional automobiles, such ultra-compact electric vehicles may frequently travel on roads of poor condition, such as narrow and unpaved roads. These roads have bumps and many small obstacles, and therefore, the ride comfort of the vehicles is expected to deteriorate. Therefore, it is concerned regarding lack of visibility and the head protection functions. We suggest active seat suspension to improve the ride comfort by the disorder road run as a high value-added product. The active seat suspension carried voice coil motor (VCM) which is a kind of a linear motor as actuator. The objective of this study is to inspect utility and the effectiveness of the active seat suspension. In this paper, we focused on the neck electricmyogram and seat acceleration when fall from the bump.

Objective quality measures play important roles in fast image and video quality assessment (VQA). In the paper, a Fast Structural Similarity (FSSIM) index algorithm, which modifies Structural Similarity (SSIM) to achieve a high speed of execution, is used to assess the quality of real-time video application. The experimental results show that the FSSIM index algorithm not only has competitive performance with normal SSIM for assessing video quality, but also has much lower computational complexity.

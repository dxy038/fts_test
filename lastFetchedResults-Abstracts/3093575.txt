Three quantitative and non-invasive techniques were used to monitor angiogenesis in KaposiÂ´s sarcoma patients: thermography, laser Doppler imaging (LDI), and near-infrared spectroscopy.

These three techniques are objective, easy to perform, and appear to be very sensitive in assessing changes in the lesions upon administration of therapy

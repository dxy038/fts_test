In this paper we describe a class of resource allocation problems with a min–sum–max objective function. We first discuss practical applications of the problem. We then present a result on the computational complexity of the problem. We propose an implicit enumeration procedure for solving the general case of the problem, and report on our computational experience with the solution procedure.

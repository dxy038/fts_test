For fiber to the home applications (FTTH), a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) is a promising light source, because of easy fabrication and low cost. We have successively developed two novel VCSEL bidirectional (BiDi) triplexers with 200 Mbps data rates in small form factor pluggable (SFP) structures. The new optical sub-assembly structures are realized with satisfactory coupling efficiency and total passive alignment processes without any lens system. As a consequence, the VCSEL BiDi triplexers would be expected to be cost-effective optical transceivers for active optical network (AON) FTTH systems.

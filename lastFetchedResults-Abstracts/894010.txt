The aim of this study is to determine the relationships of yield-capacity-risk
in a multiple reservoir system. In this study, yield, capacity and risk have been dened
as the average energy production, storage volume of reservoir and obtaining the same
yield with lower capacity, respectively. Then, an optimization model, using Dynamic
Programming with Successive Approximations (DPSA) for a multi-reservoir system for
energy production, has been developed. The objective function used in the model has the
objective of maximization of the total energy. A multi-reservoir system in the Munzur
River Basin of Turkey has been selected for the application. The results of the proposed
approach have been evaluated with regard to the relationships of yield-capacity-risk. As a
result, the capacity was increased when the yield was raised, and the same yield has been
obtained in a dierent capacity by reducing the capacity under a certain yield risk. The
yield risk has been raised in the direction of the yield coordinate of the yield-capacity-yield
risk curve.

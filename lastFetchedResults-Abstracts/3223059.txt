A typical DC microgrid is investigated in this paper. Two unidirectional DC/DC converters for photovoltaic (PV), and two bidirectional DC/DC converters for batteries are included in the proposed DC microgrid system embodying multiple renewable energy sources and energy storage devices. In order to manage the system operation, a fully autonomous power management strategy, namely adaptive DC bus voltage signal, is proposed. In the proposed control algorithm, the DC microgrid system can operate in islanding mode, DC source-connection mode, featuring seamless transitions between these two modes. Experimental results verify that the proposed power management strategy can be applied to a DC microgrid stably and achieve good performance.

This paper proposes plug-in hybrid electric vehicles bidirectional charging/discharging and state of charge (SoC) control for a microgrid frequency stabilization using a multiple model predictive control (MMPC). The MMPC is the improved version of a model predictive control (MPC) for working with multiple operating condition of the system. The MPC is an effective model-based prediction which calculates the future control signals by optimization of a quadratic programming based on the plant model, past manipulate, and control signals of the system. By optimization of an electric vehicle power control signal at each time instant, as well as changing the MPC by electric vehicle battery SoC, the proposed MMPC is able to improve the frequency stabilization of the microgrid effectively.

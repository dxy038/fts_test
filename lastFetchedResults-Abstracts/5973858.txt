A new type of articulated steering mechanism that adopts a special dual-joystick is introduced, and its structural type, working principle and performance parameters are also analyzed. A heavy vehicle with this articulated steering mechanism is used as a certain study object, and the virtual prototype of the steering mechanism hinge point parameters is set up by the CAE software ADAMS. By using the &#8220;DESIGN STUDY&#8221; method, the changes of the steering performance parameters as well as the design variable of the approximate sensitivity are obtained, and further the hinge points with the greatest relevance degree have gotten. By using OPTDES-SQP optimization model and hereafter setting the objective function, the optimization design model whose optimization objective is set as the comprehensive steering performance optimal, is established. After optimization, the change rate of arm difference is &#8722;74.6%, and the increase of steering angle is +2.22%. Through the practical application, in the process of steering, the vibration and shock of steering hydraulic steering system is reduced, and the stability of the system is increased, and force transfer efficiency is improved. With these good results achieved, the necessary basis can be provided for the control and operation of articulated steering system.

The main objective of the present descriptive-correlational study was to determine factors affecting the improvement of  in-service training programs for primary school teachers and educators in Shahinshar, Iran. The statistical population of the study included 392 primary school teachers and educators in Shahinshahr. A sample of 50 respondents was selected through cluster sampling method. A researcher-developed Likert type questionnaire containing 39 five-points close-ended items was the research instrument. Its reliability calculated by Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0/88.  Descriptive statistical techniques (e.g. percentage, mean‚ frequency‚ standard deviation) along with inferential statistics (e.g. t-test) were employed to analyze data.  The findings revealed that teaching method, needs analysis, ongoing evaluation, application of encouragement and punishment, and supervising instruction could affect teachers’ in-service-training quality above  average.

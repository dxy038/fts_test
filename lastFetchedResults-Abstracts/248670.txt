A methodology for computationally e¦cient formulation of the tangent sti¤ness matrix consistent with
incrementally objective algorithms for integrating Þnite deformation kinematics and with closest point
projection algorithms for integrating material response is developed in the context of Þnite deformation
plasticity. Numerical experiments illustrate an excellent performance of the proposed formulation in
comparison with other algorithms. Copyright

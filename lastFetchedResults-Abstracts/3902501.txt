Presented is a model that integrates three data types (numbers, intervals, and linguistic assessments). Data of these three types come from a variety of sensors. One objective of sensor-fusion models is to provide a common framework for data integration, processing, and interpretation. That is what our model does. We use a small set of artificial data to illustrate how problems as diverse as feature analysis, clustering, cluster validity, and prototype classifier design can all be formulated and attacked with standard methods once the data are converted to the generalized coordinates of our model. The effects of reparameterization on computational outputs are discussed. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed model affords a natural way to approach problems which involve mixed data types

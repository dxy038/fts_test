In this paper, inspired from virus evolutionary, by redefining mating operator and breeding operator we presented a new honeybee swarm optimization algorithm for multi-objective optimization. The test results show its performance in conducting an extensive search in the entire search space and the high potential of the proposed algorithm to solve multi-objective optimization problems.

In allusion to the multi-piece leaf springs of a truck, its standard multi-objective optimization model was established. Taking multidisciplinary optimization software iSIGHT as a platform, using the non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) based on Pareto optimal concepts, seek for the optimal structural design scheme for multi-piece leaf springs of the minimum total quality and minimum relative stiffness is found, and the Pareto Optimal Solution set is obtained. The analysis method in the paper can effectively solve the problems of multi-parameter and multi-objective optimization for complex structures.

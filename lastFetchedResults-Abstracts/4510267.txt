This paper presents a single-phase input-output common bus line UPS circuit topology using six in one IGBT module, which incorporates a bidirectional chopper-linked battery bank with specific current-mode control strategy. The steady-state operating principle of the UPS topology mentioned above and its new control strategy are described herein including conventional UPS. The feasible experimental results of cost-effective and high-performance small scale UPS topology with two quadrant chopper-fed battery link are illustrated for the developed 3 kVA-UPS and discussed as compared with conventional UPS topologies from a practical point of view. The UPS also utilises an active AC/DC half bridge PWM converter and a half bridge PWM inverter

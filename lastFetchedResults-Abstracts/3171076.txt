A power-compensated, 3&#215;3 reconfigurable bidirectional multiwavelength optical cross-connect (B-MOXC) device for dense wavelength division multiplexing networks is proposed using strain-tunable fiber Bragg gratings and optical circulators. The B-MOXC characteristics are verified by measuring inter-channel and intra-channel crosstalks, as well as signal-to-noise-ratio. The signals are reconfigurable by control of the fiber Bragg gratings. The selective B-MOXC device could provide more reconfigurability, flexibility and survivability in WDM networks.

Pointing to the diversity measurement of Pareto solutions in particle swarm optimization algorithm, the maximin fitness function including additional warp is put forward. This algorithm named IMPSO has some very desirable properties with regard to multi-objective optimization. There is no additional niche technique, since the maximin fitness of a solution can tell us whether a solution is dominated. Then, the optimizer can automatically delete those non-dominated solutions whose distances are too close, which ensure the speed of convergence, and not influence the integrality of the Pareto-optimal front. Finally, it was applied to missile effectiveness optimization, and its efficiency was proved

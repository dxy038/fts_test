Severe allergic reactions during specific immunotherapy may occur In the treatment of
hymenoptera sting allergy. The objective of the present study was to examine the
characteristics of allergic reactions during specific immunotherapy in patients with allergy
towards hymenoptera venom in the Iranian population.
A prospective study was performed using the clinical reports of 27 patients with
anaphylaxis to bee venom (Apis melifera, Geupes vespula and Geupes Polites). Ten patients
treated with Cluster protocol during 2002 and 2006
After diagnosis of hymenoptera sting allergy according to history and intradermal tests,
the patient were treated with Cluster protocol immunotherapy. The protocol lasted 6 weeks
with an increase in the concentration of venom from 0.01 [J. g/ml to 100 [J. g / ml. None of
the patient received premedication. All patients with hymenoptera venom allergy received
120 injections. Anaphylactic reactions were classified according to the Mueller-classification.
The frequencies of systemic reactions during Cluster protocol were 8.33% and 5% for
yellow jacket and honey bee venom respectively. No patient experienced severe systemic
reaction.
Cluster protocol for hymenoptera immunotherapy is a reliable method for the treatment
of anaphylactic reactions to bee venom, It is safe with low cost and do not need

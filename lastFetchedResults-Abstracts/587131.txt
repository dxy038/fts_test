Objectives: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death
in both the industrialized and developing countries globally. The
economic evaluation of MI is undertaken to rationale the allocation
of scarce healthcare resource. The objective is to review costeffectiveness
analysis of MI with medications.
Methods: We searched PubMed using the key words: “cost effectiveness
analysis” and “myocardial infarction”. After applying the
selection criteria, eight articles were selected for the present study.
Results: Out of eight articles, five had studied thrombolytic
agents. All of these papers clearly explain the costs and benefits of
different drugs for MI. ICER was assessed in six out of the eight
articles to compare the costs and health effects between alternative
medications. ICER was expressed in different effect units.
Conclusions: This study found that various medications including
thrombolytic agents, ACEI and heparin are administered to treat
MI in many countries. It is also found that five of eight studies
focus on thrombolytic therapies. It implies that thrombolytic is
generally very cost effective for MI to the whole society.

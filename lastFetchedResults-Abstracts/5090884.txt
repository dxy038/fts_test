The key objective of the work presented in this paper is to gain improved and updated understanding of the flicker performance of the latest lighting technologies. The work presented in this paper summarizes the detailed testing that has been performed to characterize the response of modern lighting to voltage fluctuations in the supply. The test plan was devised to capture the flicker response over a broad frequency range from 5 to 25 Hz. The modulation signal parameters were also varied to allow the study of the impact of amplitude and wave shape. Then, the impact of the operation of dimmers on the flicker performance of dimmable lighting technologies was evaluated. Finally, the impacts of excessive voltage fluctuations on other sensitive low voltage (LV) equipment were also investigated. The information in this paper should prove useful to decision makers in industry standard groups.

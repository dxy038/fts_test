The objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of a power generation unit consisting of a micro gas turbine and a solid oxide fuel cell that operates at atmospheric pressure. Due to the important role of the fuel cell in the introduced system, complete chemical and thermal analyses are performed for the cell.Contrary to the majority of previous investigations, the cell temperature is computed for all the working conditions of cell. In the economic analyses carried out in this research, the simple economic model of Lazaretto and the total revenue requirements (TRR) method have been used and the results of these two methods have been compared. The performance analysis of the hybrid system indicates that the increase of the system working pressure and the inflowing air-to-fuel ratio, because of the cell temperature reduction, causes the electrical efficiency of the system to drop and the price of electricity generation in the system to rise. The obtained results indicate that the price of electricity generated by the unit is about 12.2 cents/kWh, based on the simple Lazaretto model, and about 19.5 cents/kWh, based on the complete economic model of TRR. Also, the procurement and installation cost of the hybrid system has been estimated at about 1798 $/kW of electricity.

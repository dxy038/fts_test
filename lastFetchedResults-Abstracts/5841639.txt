While talking about Bandwidth Management for WDM EPONs it is required to be noted that it takes the evolutionary advantage of number of available optical transmission channels that are available in spectrum and explore this problem for the evolutionary up-gradation of WDM EPONs. The problem is the efficient utilization of the wavelengths in a given EPON in a dynamic manner. From the provided and supported optical transmission channels in a given scenario we have to assign a specific channel for upstream traffic by catering the two major subproblems. The subproblems are; grant sizing problem (how long to assign the channel) and grant scheduling problem (when and on which available supported channel we can transmit). Then we discuss different frameworks like online, offline and Just-in-time online scheduling frameworks with the idea of multichannel support We analyze the comparison of the frameworks on the bases of the average queuing delays that are incurred while EPON in operation, and get the idea that JIT online scheduling framework is better than the other two frameworks. Then we discuss some of the different scheduling policies for above mentioned three frameworks that can be used to solve our scheduling problem. In the end it is concluded by an idea of having a more complicated scheduler comparatively than the existing ones for multichannel support as the future direction we should be focused on for the further work. The major objective to achieve is, to design a scheduler for WDM EPON having maximum wavelength utilization and lower queuing delays.

The water resource in the lake along South-to-North Water Transfer (SNWT) Project includes water diverted from Yangtze River and rain water, in order to distinguish the priority of different water, this article choose the lake along the project as research object, established multi-objective model of water allocation of lake based on Multi-objective decision-making theory. Then put the method of Simulated Annealing into Genetic Algorithm and format Hybrid Genetic Algorithm combined the characteristics of model. Finally, the model is validated by demonstration analysis and the conclusion that this model can be applied to water allocation of lake in SNWT Project is concluded.

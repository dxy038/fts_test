The possibilities and the limits of texture analysis by NMR imaging using automatic discrimination algorithms, were investigated. The authors tried to identify objective descriptors of tissue textures by means of computerized analysis of gray level geometric properties. The algorithms were able to distinguish different tissues without reference to their anatomic location. Tissue structure could be characterized even before a clear macroscopic derangement has occurred

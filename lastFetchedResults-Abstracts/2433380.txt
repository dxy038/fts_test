This paper considers how to conduct the efficiency measurement and ranking problem of the tutorial system of some higher education institutions (HEIs) in Taiwan more convincingly and persuasively. Measuring the efficiencies of tutors and rewarding the outstanding tutors are conducted once each academic year and have become an important part of the administration practices. The current performance evaluation methods consider only the output factors inhered in vagueness, while the input are neglected. In order to better reflect the actual situations that different tutors consume various amounts of input to produce various amounts of outputs, an IDEA (imprecise data envelopment analysis) model is proposed to measure the efficiencies of tutors under different possibility levels by incorporating the current methods to serve as output factors and additionally considering the input factor. The proposed evaluation approach, which contains efficiency measurement, ranking guide and ties broken rule, can be applied easily to obtain objective and fair results of the addressed problem. A numerical example is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed approach.

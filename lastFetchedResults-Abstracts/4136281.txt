A multi-objective optimization problem for LoneyÂ´s solenoid consists of the determination of the current system which produces a uniform magnetic field within a domain of finite extent inside the solenoid and a low stray field outside it. In order to solve the multi-objective problem, four different approaches have been utilized and compared. In all cases evolution strategy (ES) techniques are utilized for the minimization procedure

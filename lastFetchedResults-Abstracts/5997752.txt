The paper presents a simulation study of effect of interface localised fixed charges on the performance of the Metal Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MESFET) for different materials (Si, GaAs and GaN) . The objective of the present work is to study the effect of hot carrier induced fixed charges at the interface of semiconductor and interfacial layer which is always present in any practical metal semiconductor contact. Also the circuit reliability issues of the device are discussed in terms of the performance degradation due to localized interface charges.

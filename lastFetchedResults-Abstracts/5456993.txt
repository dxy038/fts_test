The harmonic filter planning in distribution systems is presented as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is solved using microgenetic algorithms. The optimization of filter sizes and localizations on radial system with distributed linear and nonlinear loads has been considered. The minimization of voltage total harmonic distortion and active power losses has been used as an objective function. The harmonic levels of system are obtained by current injections method and the load flow is solved by the iterative method of power sum, which is suitable for the accuracy requirements of this type of study. It is shown that total voltage harmonic distortion and active power losses are minimized simultaneously. The simulation results for a 15 bus radial system show that the proposed method is efficient for solving the presented problem.

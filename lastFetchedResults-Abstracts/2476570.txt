This paper presents an adaptive nonlinear predictive control design strategy for a kind of nonlinear systems with output feedback coupling and results in the improvement of regulatory capacity for reference tracking, robustness and disturbance rejection. The nonlinear system is first transformed into an equal time-variant system by analyzing the nonlinear part. Then an extended state space predictive controller with a similar structure of a PI optimal regulator and with P -step setpoint feedforward control is designed. Because changes of the system state variables are considered in the objective function, the control performance is superior to conventional state space predictive control designs which only consider the predicted output errors. The proposed method is tested and compared with latest methods in literature. Tracking performance, robustness and disturbance rejection are improved.

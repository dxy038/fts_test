The objective of this work was to produce an immobilized form of lipase from Burkholderia cepacia (lipase PS) with advantageous catalytic properties and stability to be used in the ethanolysis of different feedstocks, mainly babassu oil and tallow beef. For this purpose lipase PS was immobilized on two different non-commercial matrices, such as inorganic matrix (niobium oxide, Nb2O5) and a hybrid matrix (polysiloxane–polyvinyl alcohol, SiO2–PVA) by covalent binding. The properties of free and immobilized enzymes were searched and compared. The best performance regarding all the analyzed parameters (biochemical properties, kinetic constants and thermal stability) were obtained when the lipase was immobilized on SiO2–PVA. The superiority of this immobilized system was also confirmed in the transesterification of both feedstocks, attained higher yields and productivities.

Summary form only given. The peniotron interaction has been proven capable of yielding extremely high electronic conversion efficiency. Efficiency has been demonstrated as high as 75% (Ishihara et al, 1999) and greater than 80% has been predicted. This inherently high efficiency is due to the nature of the interaction. In the peniotron, the electrons move forward in phase by 360&#176; with each cyclotron orbit. Therefore, the electrons see the transverse component of the resonant wave as a "DC" electric field, experience E&#215;B drift, and lose their transverse energy to the wave. This interaction is optimal for an axis encircling electron beam and for a well designed device (with a high quality beam), the transfer of transverse energy can approach 100% for all electrons in the beam. While high conversion efficiency has been demonstrated, practical application of the peniotron requires that high power be efficiently extracted from the device while immunity from competing gyrotron modes is maintained. The objective of the UCD harmonic peniotron is to achieve high overall device efficiency while insuring stability through the use of a fundamental mode interaction with the second cyclotron harmonic of an axis-encircling beam generated by a Northrop Grumman Cusp gun.

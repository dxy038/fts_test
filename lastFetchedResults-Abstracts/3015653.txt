A fuzzy decision-making system, which is developed from a fuzzy decision-making method and an autonomous functional architecture, for multi-objective robots motion planning and control is described. The system is applied to an omni-directional mobile robot with active stereo cameras capable of panoramic viewing. The mobile robot can be commanded to move to a target point through an unknown environment while satisfying multiple goals and constraints. The advantages of the proposed system are confirmed by simulation experiments.

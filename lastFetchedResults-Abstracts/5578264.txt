The mixed performance and robustness of control problems have been the object of much attention. These various objective problems are rarely encompassed by a single synthesis criterion. While some tracking and robustness are best captured by the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> criterion noise insensitivity is more naturally expressed in H<sub>2</sub> terms, and transient behaviors are easily tuned in terms of L<sub>1</sub> norms or closed loop damping. We present a methodology for designing mixed L<sub>1</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controllers for MIMO systems through linear matrix inequalities (LMI) techniques. These controllers allow for minimizing the worst case peak output due to disturbances and noise, and acquire robust pole placement by satisfying multi-objective criteria. A physically motivated example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mix-controller for mix performance and robustness.

<p><strong>Objective:</strong>To assess and compare the nutritional status of children aged 5-14 years in arsenic exposed and non- exposed areas.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong>It was a cross sectional study conducted on 600 children of age 5-14 years from arsenic exposed and non-exposed areas in Bangladesh. Designed questionnaire and check list were used for collection of data. To estimate BMI necessary anthropometric measurements of the studied children were done. Dietary intakes of the study children were assessed using 24-hours recall method.<br /><strong>Results:</strong>The difference of socio-economic conditions between the children of exposed area and non-exposed area was not significant. On an average the body mass index was found to be significantly (p &lt; 0.01) lower among the children of arsenic exposed area (49%) in comparison to that of children in non-exposed area (38%). Stunting (p &lt; 0.01), wasting (p &lt; 0.05) and underweight (p &lt; 0.05) were significantly higher in exposed group in comparison to non-exposed group. No significant difference of nutrition intake was found between exposed and non-exposed children as well as thin and normal children.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong>In this study children exposed to arsenic contaminated water were found to be suffered from lower nutritional status.</p>

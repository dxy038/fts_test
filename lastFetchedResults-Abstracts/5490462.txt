There are many educational contents in digital format and it would be very good if they could be reused in mobile contexts. This paper seeks to achieve this objective by providing access to educational contents packaged in SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model). In this way user can reuse in any context the educational contents that already exist using mobile devices to access them. SCORM is a set of standards and specifications to share, reuse, import and export learning objects. Its main objective is to enable sharing and reusing educational contents between different systems. In this paper we propose an application which allows access SCORM objects from the mobile. This application is being used in real environments for several companies of e-learning.

To achieve economic and environmental benefit for the stand-alone microgrid consisting of diesel generators, wind turbine generators, photovoltaic generation system and lead-acid batteries, a multi-objective stochastic optimal planning method and a stochastic chance-constrained programming model are presented. In the model, the optimal objective is to simultaneously minimise the total net present cost and carbon dioxide emission in life cycle; the type and capacity of distributed generation units have been selected as the optimal variables; the loss of capacity is adopted as probability index constraint; the coordinated operation strategies between diesel generators and battery, the multi-unit operation constraints of diesel generators and the reserve capacity have been considered in the hard-circle operation strategy. Considering the uncertainties of wind speed, clearness index and load demand, Markov process transition probability matrix is adopted to synthesise those time series data. Optimal planning for an island microgrid system has been carried out by the planning system for microgrid (PSMG), a self-developed optimal planning software based on the multi-objective stochastic optimal planning method for stand-alone microgrid system.

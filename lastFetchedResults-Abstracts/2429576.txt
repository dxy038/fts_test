<div><p class="Abstract"><strong>Objective:</strong>To compare the maternal and umbilical cord serum selenium concentrations in Low and normal birth weight neonates.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong>A case-control study was carried out in Vali-Asr and Akbarabadi Hospitals (Jan. to Dec. 2013). Two groups; case group; 91 mothers who delivered a low birth weight (LBW) neonate and control group; 86 subjects who delivered a normal birth weight neonate were selected. Immediately after birth, 5 ml of maternal blood and umbilical cord blood were collected, and sent to laboratory to assay Se concentrations. To compare both groups' blood Se concentration, data were analyzed in SPSS 16.0.<br /><strong>Results:</strong>Eighty six (48.6%) mothers with normal birth weight neonates and 91 (51.4%) mothers with low birth weight infants entered the study. Mean maternal mothers' age and mean maternal blood Se were 28.55+5.90 years and 79.3756+26.46915. A significant association was seen between maternal blood and cord blood Se level in control and case group (P value&lt;0.0001, r = 0.69) and<br />(P value&lt;0.001, r = 0.79). On the other hand no differences were seen between 2 groups' maternal blood Se level (P Value = 0.65). Umbilical Cord blood Se concentration was not also different between case and control group (P value = 0.46).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong>We found that maternal and umbilical cord blood Se concentrations were not different in low and adequate birth weight infants, however; umbilical cord Se concentrations were positively correlated with maternal blood Se concentrations.</p></div>

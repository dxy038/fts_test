In total knee replacement surgery, also known as total knee arthroplasty, prosthetics are implanted in the knee joint as treatment for progressive diseases such as arthritis or trauma. In this paper, we aim to recover the 3-D shape of bones and prosthetic devices in patients who have undergone total knee replacement. Such an objective is addressed using a collection of 2-D X-rays acquired from multiple viewpoints. Then, both bone and prosthetic shape recovery are formulated as a multi-view reconstruction process through the minimization of an objective function. The objective function is designed to recover 3-D surfaces, which once projected to 2-D images, minimize edge-based and region-based criteria. The calculus of variations and gradient descent are used to obtain a surface with minimum cost through a 3-D level set implementation. Promising results are given for real X-ray data.

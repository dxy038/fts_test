The execution of services in intelligent networks (IN) and the problem of service interactions are investigated. A model of IN that incorporates the basic service and the IN services is developed. This model suggests a formal approach to the problem of service interactions. The authors argue in favor of using state transition diagrams (STDs) for the detection and analysis of service interactions. The proposed strategy achieves the objective of rapid service introduction or service modification. The services can be designed in steps (modularity) and can be placed in different physical locations for execution purposes, but for design purposes the different services must be integrated in a conglomerate STD in order to resolve the interactions

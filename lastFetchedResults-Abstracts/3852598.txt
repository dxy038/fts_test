Many years ago, George Friedman analyzed this problem and developed what was, in essence, a blueprint for designing an adaptive neural control circuit for mobile robots based on natural selection. Friedman\Â´s objective was to investigate the possibility of borrowing from nature to develop goal-seeking machines. He noted that in a constant environment, natural evolutionary processes lead to a series of individuals that converges on a type that is more appropriate ("better fitted") for survival

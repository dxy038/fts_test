ABSTRACT: The main goal of civil engineering is anthropocentric development. From road network to residential buildings the civil engineering industry has its footprints on all human efforts to dominate nature and natural systems. The built environment serves as a dynamic interface through which the human society and the ecosystem interact and influence each other. We know sustainable indicators from different areas such as economics, water, and management. The objective of this paper is to identify possible indicators to evaluate civil engineering works that involves geotechnical techniques. In other words, we want to find theindicators of sustainable geotechnical engineering. In addition, we develop an evaluation model to summaries and illustrated the indicators performance.

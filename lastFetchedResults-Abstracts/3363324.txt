For optimal microgrid (MG) operation, one challenge is the supply of cooling and electricity energy is a coupled co-optimization issue when considering the combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) units and ice-storage air-conditioners. Another challenge is the inherent randomness of renewable energy within the MG should be accommodated by MG itself. In Part I of this two-part paper, the partial load performance of CCHPs and the performance of ice-storage air-conditioners are modeled, and the cooling and electricity coordinated MG day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatching models are established. In day-ahead scheduling model, the uncertainty of wind and solar power is represented by multi-scenarios and the objective is to achieve the minimal expected MG operation cost. In real-time dispatching model, the different time-scale dispatch schemes are respectively applied for cooling and electricity to smooth out the fluctuations of renewable energy supply and to follow the variations of cooling and electricity demands by the fine dispatching of the components within MG such that the impact of MG to the connected main grid is minimal. The proposed MG multi time-scale cooling and electricity coordinated schedule achieves an integrated optimization for multi energy-type supply, and makes the MG be controllable as seen from the main grid.

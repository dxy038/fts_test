Objective Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
is a common, complex and highly heritable disorder,
characterised by inattentive, impulsive and overactive
behaviour. Evidence for the heritability of ADHD measures
in twin population samples has come from the analysis of
total scores that combine inattentive and hyperactive–
impulsive symptoms subscales. This study investigated, in
a community sample, the aetiology of ADHD-like traits and
the aetiological overlap between the two dimensions that
define the ADHD disorder.
Materials and Methods Parents of 6,222 approximately
8-year-old twin pairs from the Twins Early Development
Study (TEDS) population sample completed the two
subscales of the Conners’ 18-item DSMIV checklist, a
screening instrument for ADHD symptoms.
Results Both subscales were highly heritable (hyperactive–
impulsive: 88%; inattentive: 79%). Bivariate genetic modelling
indicated substantial genetic overlap between the two
components; however, there were significant independent
genetic effects.
Conclusions These findings suggest that many genes associatedwith
the hyperactivity–impulsivity dimension will also be
associated with the inattentive dimension but that there is
significant genetic heterogeneity as well. These results
provide genetic support for combining the two behavioural
dimensions that define ADHD, but also suggest that some
symptom-specific genes will also be identified.

promastigotes. Monoclonal antibodies are useful in characterization of Leishmania spp. both amastogotes and promastigotes. Objective: Comparing the characterization of Leishmania spp. promastigotes with immunoperoxidase test (Avidin-Biotin) techniques and an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA). Methods: Application of specific monoclonal antibodies for characterization of different Leishmania species. Immunoperoxidase tests (Avidin-Biotin) and indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) were employed for characterization of different Leishmnia promastigotes from culture. Five monoclonal antibodies including LXXVIII-2E5- A8 (D2) specific for L.donovani:L. infantum, IS2-2B4 (A11) specific for L. tropica, XCIV-H2- AB (T10) specific for L. tropica, XLVI-5B8- B3 (T1) specific for L. major, and T7 reactive to both L. major and L. tropica as well as an anti GP63 mAb were used. Results: The best result was obtained with the dilution of 1:50 for both mAb and conjugate. One hundred percent sensitivity and specificity was achieved for characterization of Leishmania promastogotes with both methods. Conclusion: As immunoperoxidase method needs less equipments compared to IFA technique, it would be a preferred method for characterization of promastigotes

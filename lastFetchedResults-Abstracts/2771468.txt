This letter proposes a novel framework for designing photonic crystal waveguides (PCWs), in which three components optimize and analyze the structure of PCWs. The proposed components are a multi-objective formulator, a multi-objective optimizer, and a multi-objective analyzer. A ring-shaped hole PCW is chosen as the case study, but the proposed framework is applicable to designing any kind of PCW. The results show that the proposed framework is able to find a significantly wider range of optimized designs and reveals the physical behavior of PCW structure.

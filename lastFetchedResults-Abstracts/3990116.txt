An actively clamped bidirectional flyback converter is proposed. The converter´s operation is examined in detail. All switches in the converter have zero-voltage-switching characteristics. A low-frequency behavior model and small-signal transfer functions are derived. It is found that the flow of current is directly under the control of the duty cycle, and that the transformer´s leakage inductance has a significant effect on the control characteristic of the converter. It is expected that such bidirectional converters will find wide applications in the interconnection of multiple sources of DC power to a common bus (e.g., in a DC uninterruptible power supply). Simulation and experiment results are also presented

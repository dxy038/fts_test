We consider systems on chips that can be designed and produced in five to ten years from today, with gate lengths in the range 50-100 nm. We address the distinguishing features of a design methodology that aims at achieving reliable designs under the limitations of the interconnect technology. Specifically, we consider energy consumption reduction, under guaranteed quality of service, as a main objective in system design.

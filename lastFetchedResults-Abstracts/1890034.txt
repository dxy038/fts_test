Background and Objective: Sinusitis is one of the most common hygienic problems and a
large part of the budget has been allocated to its diagnosis and treatment yearly. In this study, the
presence of cytomegalovirus in sinuses of patients, undergone operation for treatment, with or
without sinusitis, was studied.
Materials and Methods: This study was an applied and case-control study, which had been
performed on 44 HIV negative patients in ENT clinic of Shahid Mostafa Khomeini Hospital in
Tehran during 4 months in 2005. Biopsy specimens were taken from left and right of uncinet process
mucosa of middle meatus of 22 patients with chronic sinusitis and 22 patients without sinusitis
undergo operation for nasal septal deviation. After purification of DNA, PCR test was done for
replication of early gene in cytomegalovirus DNA by two kits, which was purchased from Cinnagen
Co. and Gen Fanavaran Co.
Results: After the electrophoresis of PCR product on agarose gel, neither of samples has shown
DNA band same the positive control enclosed in kits. Therefore, all specimens were considered
negative for cytomegalovirus DNA.
Conclusion: Cytomegalovirus has not been detected in sinunasal mucosa of patients with chronic
sinusitis and without sinusitis. Test with more specimens and other diagnostic procedure are
recommended for prove of absence of cytomegalovirus in sinunasal mucosa.

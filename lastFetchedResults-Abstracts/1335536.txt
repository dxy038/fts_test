Conventional Kolsky bar data evaluation method is based on the assumption of stress equilibrium within the specimen during testing. When the objective is to generate stressâ€“strain diagrams up to failure, damage initiation and evolution within the specimen should be taken into account. In that case, stress wave attenuation would take place and the assumption of stress equilibrium would not be valid. In this study, the data evaluation method is revisited and analytical expressions considering possible damage are presented. The revisited method gives higher specimen strain rate and strain compared with the conventional method. Both methods give the same specimen stress.

To be effective for large-scale power system simulation, the bus voltage representation has several issues to be resolved. The selected method must be able to handle a large amount of information effectively. For that purpose, each element must be simple and small, easy to identify and to discern in any environment. This is the principal objective of the authorsÂ´ research, and of this article. They detail how their representations use a scale of carefully chosen colors based on characteristics of human visual perception and mental models of color usage in the power industry

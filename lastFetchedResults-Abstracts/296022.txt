Objective
We have spent 7 years to investigate the method of applying porcine acellular dermal matrix (ADM) on deep partial thickness burn wound until the wound heals without dressing change. Known as “Feng's pig skin method” by our hospital, the method appears to encourage rapid re-epithilization with minimum scarring.
Method
The deep partial thickness burn wound was rinsed cleanly under anesthesia when the patient admitted. ADM was applied on the wound after the detached epidermis was thoroughly removed, wrapped and fixed by sterile gauze and bandages. The dressing was removed within two weeks and the wound completely healed. The outcome of the treatment was analyzed by using the modified Vancouver Burn Scar Assessment Scale.
Result
All the wounds healed with one dressing within 2 weeks, and the time of wound re-epithelialization shortened to 7–12 days. Scar hyperplasia did not occur, or it was greatly ameliorated compared with traditional treatment after a followed-up period of 3 months to 2 years. The Scar Index was significant lower than that of the traditional exposure method.
Conclusion
Using ADM to cover deep second degree burn can preserve maximally residual dermal tissue and epithelium, help accelerate the regeneration of epithelial and stem cells, thus shorten the healing time, remodel the skin structure, and consequently has the effect of controlling hypertrophic scar at inception.

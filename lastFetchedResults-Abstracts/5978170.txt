Conventional teaching methods, based on lectures, static written materials, laboratories, etc., have become rather difficult at all levels of MST (microsystems technologies) education, recently. To supply this field with well-educated engineers with interdisciplinary knowledge, it is necessary to teach them basic sciences, technology, applications, and designing aspects (reliability, packaging, etc.) belonging to the topic of MST. Also the knowledge of user engineers should be upgraded-possibly in a form of distance learning. The main objective of the described project here is the development of a multimedia supported education material that teaches/overviews the theoretical background, manufacturing, as well as practical application of microelectronics, microelectro/opto/mechanical systems and their packaging technologies in order to prepare experts for designing next generation intelligent micro/nanointegrated systems in the new century. The new approach tries to exploit all advantages of multimedia computer aided teaching not only for keeping the competitiveness but also in order to overcome the specific difficulties of the particular area. The modern educational software tool can secure up to date information, easy-to-understand visualisation of the 3D MEMS structures and interactive examples of the subject. The course material will be available both on the Internet and on CDs for the technical community, for other university professors for teaching, and also will continuously be developed.

We demonstrate an optoelectronic tweezer (OET) integrating with a lensless, ultra wide-field imaging system for real-time interactive optical manipulation over a large field of view. This system enables, for the first time, simultaneous on-chip detection and optical manipulation of individual 10-mum microparticles, size of average mammalian cells, over an area of 6.55 times 4.92 mm<sup>2</sup>, a field of view 100 times larger than a typical 10times objective lens used in OET manipulation.

The primary objective of this project was to develop orally active cefotaxime sodium (CS) in Eudragit S100 polymer using a pH-sensitive nanoprecipitation method. An aqueous dispersion of the particles was administered orally to fasted Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats against control. Plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters within 6h post-dosing were better for the nanoparticles. To evaluate the lymphatic targeting ability, CS nanoparticles were administered in the stomach and compared against an aqueous suspension of free drug. Comparison of the CS concentration detected simultaneously in intestinal lymph with the one detected in plasma revealed that the produced CS nanoparticles promoted the lymphatic transport of CS in the intestinal lymph.

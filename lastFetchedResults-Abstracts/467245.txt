Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the progress that has been made toward meeting the educational challenges in obstetrics and gynecology that were made at an Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology special forum in 1986. Study Design: We placed the five major issues and specific problems that were identified within the context of developments that have occurred in medical education, the Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the specialty over the last 15 years. We used the medical education literature and the accomplishments of the members of the Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology to measure progress. Results: Many of the challenges that were raised at the original forum remain. Significant progress, much of it spearheaded by the Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology, has been made in the areas of teaching methods and skills, evaluation techniques, faculty development, computer usage, teaching recognition, counseling for the fourth-year student, and an integrated curriculum in women's health. Conclusion: Progress has occurred within the context and demands of a changing health care system that constricts the time and funding that are available for medical education.

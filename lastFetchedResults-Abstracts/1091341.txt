Experiments were carried out to study adsorption/desorption of volatile organic compound (VOC) on the activated carbon fiber (ACF) under dynamic conditions. The primary objective was to experimentally demonstrate the suitability of ACF in effectively adsorbing VOCs from inert gaseous stream under varying operating conditions, and compare its performance vis-à-vis that of the other commercially available adsorbents, such as granular activated carbon (GAC), silica gel, and zeolites. The adsorption experiments were carried out in a fixed tubular packed bed reactor under various operating conditions including temperature (35–100 °C), gas concentration (2000–10,000 ppm), gas flow rate (0.2–1.0 slpm) and weight of the adsorbent (2–10 g). A mathematical model was developed to predict the VOC breakthrough characteristics on ACF. The model incorporated the effects of the gas-particle film mass transfer resistance, adsorbent pore diffusion and the adsorption/desorption rates within the pore. The experimental data and the corresponding model simulated results were compared and found to be in good agreement. The ACF repeatedly showed a good regeneration capability following desorption by DC electrical heating.

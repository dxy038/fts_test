Background and objective: In recent years, consuming of fish and marine products has increased in IRAN. Through these products, consumption of smoked fish is traditional in the north of country. Pollution possibility exists to infectious agents such as Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp while these products improved by traditional manner and insufficient cooked. Aim of this study, survey of microbial scale and smoked fish pollution has been to these bacteria.

Materials and methods: 102 samples of smoked fish (58 samples of Caspiolosa Kessleri fish and 44 samples of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix fish) have gathered immediately after finishing of smoking by traditional manner. Then, these samples transported to laboratory by FDA and APHA gold standard and total number of bacteria and pollution are studied.

Results: Number of aerobic bacteria varied from 2*10 cfu/g to 6*10 cfu/g. Listeria monocytogenes was separated from 35 samples (34.31%), and amount of pollution was determined 63.6 and 12.16 for Hypophthalmichthys molitrix fish and Caspiolosa Kessleri fish. No pollution to salmonella was confirmed in studied samples.

Conclusion: In all world country, microbial marine products are controlled similar to other foods. Results of other studies in different countries and this study confirmed smoked fish pollution improved by traditional manner. Utilization of new and correct manner and sufficient heat for cooking will affect in preventative of infectious disease or food poison.

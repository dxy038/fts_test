The main objective of this work is the functionalization of bentonite from the Amazon (region) by the grafting of propyl sulfonic acid groups to catalyze the esterification reaction of acetic acid and 1-propanol. Functionalization was accomplished by anchoring, oxidation and acid activation of (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane, (MTPS). The procedure gave acid properties to the raw bentonite. This material, acting as a catalyst, increased the reaction speed and improved the yield by about 12% compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. The functionalized bentonite was characterized by XRD, TG/DTA, FTIR, N2 adsorption/desorption at 77 K and XRF, and the surface acidity was determined by titration.

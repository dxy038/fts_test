Background and Objective: The end result of chronic kidney disease, irrespective of the type of kidney disease including progression to kidney failure and its complications as cardiopulmonary disease. The evidence show that recognition and treatment of this disease is often preventive and delay some complications of the disease and prevent the incidence of end stage renal failure. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of complications of chronic kidney disease in children in Mofid hospital between 13921393.





Methods: A crosssectional study was performed on 104 children between 2 months to 17 years old who were admitted in nephrology ward of Mofid hospital. They were evaluated by history taking, physical examination, blood and urine analysis, ultrasound, nuclear scan, and in some cases kidney biopsy according to the glomerular filtration and KDOQI instruction. Patients were divided into 5 groups: results were expressed using descriptive statistics with p0.05 was considered statistically significant.





Results: Of the 104 cases, 56 patients (45%) were male and 48 (46%) were female. The age range was 4.9 plusmn; 6.86. 37.5% of patients had high systolic or diastolic blood pressure, anemia was seen in 74%, 70% had bone disease and 63% had failure to thrive. The most common etiology of chronic kidney disease was neurogenic bladder and reflux nephropathy in 27.8% and 16.34%, respectively. 40% of patients were at stage 4 and 5, 17% at stage 3, 24% at stage 2, and 20% were in stage 1. 31.7% of patients had a glomerular filtration less than 15 at the time of diagnosis and 11.53% of patients treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT). During the study, 4.8% of patients were treated with a kidney transplant.





Conclusion: It seems that complications of urinary system is high in neurogenic bladder, and the most common complications are urinary tract infections, urinary reflux disease, and end stage renal disease. Troublesome complications, anemia, bone disease, growth failure and hypertension are significantly increased and endanger the lives of children. Therefore, it increases the mortality and morbidity.

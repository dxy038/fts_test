This research work targets presenting a new methodology enabling usage of generation surplus from industrial users with resource generation potential or in-house sources known as distributed generation. The main objective is to develop a technique to support energy contracting decisions in relation to the strategic utilization of distributed, with a view to reducing the risk of penalties and/or excess contracting from power distribution utilities. This form of generation will be used in power supply deficit situations that may eventually result from adverse events in the distribution system or to postpone investments in network expansion. The research will also show the current regulation scenario for contracting distributed generation and how this can be incorporated in the energy contracting strategy in a regulated environment. The study intends to obtain knowledge of the entire distributed generation availability in the concession area of Bandeirante Energia, both existing generation, registered at the regulatory agency or not, and the effective generation potential.

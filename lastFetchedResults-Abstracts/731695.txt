Background.The objective of this study was to evaluate the reach of mass mailings of heart health education print materials in a low-income, urban community. Materials included a monthly newsletter and a self-help behavior change kit, both distributed to all 12,789 households in the study community.

Methods.Recall, use, and self-reported impact of the materials were measured in a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 345 adults conducted 2 weeks after distribution of the kit and 18 months after delivery of the first newsletter.

Results.Over one-third of the subjects (38.6% recalled the newsletter and 27.9% had read one or more newsletters; 21.7% recalled the kit and 10.8% had read it. Few subjects had read both materials. Female gender and older age were independent correlates of having seen and read the newsletters. Older age, being widowed/separated/divorced, and infrequent physical activity were correlates of having seen and read the kit.

Conclusions.Although the newsletter and kit formats might appeal to different segments of the population, mass mailings of heart health education print materials in a low-income urban community can reach large numbers of individuals. The cost effectiveness of repeated mailings of short, simple newsletters might be higher than a single mailing of a more complex behavior change kit.

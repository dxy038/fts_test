The objective of nanocomposite coatings combining hard and lubricant phases is the development of advanced multi-functional protective thin films showing abrasion resistance, and simultaneously, low friction. Up to now, no clear relation between constitution, microstructural properties and performance of such nanocomposite coatings based on dry lubricants like carbon or MoS2 has been evaluated. Deposition techniques, constitution, properties and performance of magnetron-sputtered nanocomposite coatings in the TiCî—¸C system are presented. The Vickers hardness could be optimized to values of polycrystalline TiC thin films, and at the same time, low friction coefficients against steel, similar to diamond-like amorphous carbon, could be realized. The mechanical properties and the tribological behavior of these thin films are related to the chemical composition and the microstructure of these advanced materials, characterized by electron microprobe analysis, Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy.

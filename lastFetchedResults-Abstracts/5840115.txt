In this paper, a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm namely Turbulent Crazy Particle swarm Optimization (TRPSO) is introduced to solve multi-constrained optimal reactive power dispatch in power system. Optimal reactive power dispatch problem is a multi-objective optimization problem that minimizes bus voltage deviations and transmission loss. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for IEEE 30-bus system and it is compared to other well established population based optimization techniques like conventional PSO, general passive congregation PSO (GPAC), local passive congregation PSO (LPAC), coordinated aggregation (CA) and Interior point based OPF (IP-OPF). A comparison of simulation results indicates that the proposed algorithm can produce better solution than other optimization techniques.

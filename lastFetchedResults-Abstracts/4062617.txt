Conservation of materials by getting the most out of existing equipment will be the particular objective as an aid to the war effort for the AIEE national technical meeting to be held in New York, N. Y., January 25&#8211;29, 1943. On Thursday, January 28, the Institute of Radio Engineers will hold a meeting concurrently in both morning and afternoon. In the evening a joint AIEE&#8211;IRE meeting will be held, at which there will be an address on &#8220;Ultrahigh Frequencies&#8221; by Doctor G. C. Southworth of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. Both meetings will be held in the Engineering Societies Building. In accordance with AIEE wartime policies (EE, Sept. Â´42, p. 477) all programmed social activities have been omitted. It is hoped, however, that there will be opportunities for members and guests to get together during the meeting.

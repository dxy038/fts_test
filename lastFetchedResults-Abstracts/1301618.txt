The purpose of this study was to study the effect of wining and losing with respect to objective direction on 60 football players who randomly participated in this study. With respect to the direction aim, the players were divided into ego orientation and task orientation groups. After and before the game, the data were collected using self-esteem and direction aim questionnaires. Independent and dependent T-test indicated no significant difference in self-esteem between task and ego orientation groups before the match and after wining and losing. Average mean of self-esteem in task and ego orientation groups did not significantly change after losing and winning.

We prove that noise can speed convergence in the backpropagation algorithm. The proof consists of two separate results. The first result proves that the backpropagation algorithm is a special case of the generalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for iterative maximum likelihood estimation. The second result uses the recent EM noise benefit to derive a sufficient condition for backpropagation training. The noise adds directly to the training data. A noise benefit also applies to the deep bidirectional pre-training of the neural network as well as to the backpropagation training of the network. The geometry of the noise benefit depends on the probability structure of the neurons at each layer. Logistic sigmoidal neurons produce a forbidden noise region that lies below a hyperplane. Then all noise on or above the hyperplane can only speed convergence of the neural network. The forbidden noise region is a sphere if the neurons have a Gaussian signal or activation function. These noise benefits all follow from the general noise benefit of the EM algorithm. Monte Carlo sample means estimate the population expectations in the EM algorithm. We demonstrate the noise benefits using MNIST digit classification.

The ability of noncrop plants to compete with white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) seedlings for applied fertilizer N is not well understood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of fertilizer N uptake using 15N by planted white spruce seedlings and understory vegetation. Double 15N-labeled NH4NO3 was broadcast in 1-m2plots for control, disc-trenched, and disc-trenched + manual brushing treatments. The fate of applied 15N in white spruce and noncrop plants was determined at the end of the first two growing seasons. The major competitors for fertilizer 15N were Populus tremuloides Michx. and grasses during the first growing season, and Populus tremuloides, Epilobium angustifolium L., and Achillea millefolium L. during the second growing season. Disc-trenching plus manual brushing significantly increased the fertilizer use efficiency of white spruce seedlings by limiting competition; however, <1% of the applied fertilizer 15N was utilized by the spruce seedlings after two growing seasons. The ability of competing vegetation to absorb broadcast fertilizer N suggests that alternative fertilizer types and placements be investigated to increase N uptake by white spruce seedlings planted in the boreal mixedwood forest.

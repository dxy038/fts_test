The scalability of large degradable homogeneous multiprocessors is analyzed. The objective is to assess the limitations, imposed by reliability considerations, on the number of processors. The analysis of the mean-time-to-failure and the mission-time shows that, for a given value of the coverage factor, there exists a value of the number of processors at which these measures are maximal. As the system size is increased beyond this value, the reliability of the system becomes a rapidly decreasing function of the number of processors. For computations with linear speed-up, the amount of reliable computational work is constant for large system-sizes. When the speed-up is not linear, this amount is a decreasing function of the number of processors. Therefore, for large system-sizes and same technology, increasing the number of processors results in a decrease of the average amount of reliable computational work the system can deliver. Graceful degradation in large fault-tolerant systems is not scalable

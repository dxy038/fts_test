The Bahı´a Blanca Estuary (38   500 S, and 62  300 W) presents salt marshes where interactions between the local flora (Sarcocornia perennis)
and fauna (Chasmagnathus granulatus) generate some kind of salt pans that alter the normal water circulation and condition its flow and course
towards tidal creeks. The crabevegetation dynamics in the salt marsh presents variations that cannot be quantified in a reasonable period of time.
The interaction between S. perennis plant and C. granulatus crab is based on simple laws, but its result is a complex biological mechanism that
causes an erosive process on the salt marsh and favors the formation of tidal creeks. To study it, a Cellular Automata model is proposed, based on
the laws deduced from the observation of these phenomena in the field, and then verified with measurable data within macroscale time units.
Therefore, the objective of this article is to model how the interaction between C. granulatus and S. perennis modifies the landscape of the salt
marsh and influences the path of tidal creeks. The model copies the basic laws that rule the problem based on purely biological factors.
The Cellular Automata model proved capable of reproducing the effects of the interaction between plants and crabs in the salt marsh. A study
of the water drainage of the basins showed that this interaction does indeed modify the development of tidal creeks. Model dynamics would
likewise follow different laws, which would provide a different formula for the probability of patch dilation. The patch shape can be obtained
changing the pattern that dilates.

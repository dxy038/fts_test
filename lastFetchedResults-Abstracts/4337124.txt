Beyond 3G wireless systems will be composed of a variety of radio access technologies (RATs) with different, but also complementary, performance and technical characteristics. To exploit such diversity while guaranteeing the interoperability and efficient management of the different RATs, common radio resource management (CRRM) techniques need to be defined. This work proposes and evaluates a CRRM policy that simultaneously assigns to each user an adequate combination of RAT and number of radio resources within such RAT to guarantee its QoS requirements. The proposed CRRM technique is based on linear objective functions and programming tools.

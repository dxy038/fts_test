A novel method based on optimal nonuniform subarray configuration and optimal subarray´s excitation is proposed to study low sidelobe beamforming with millimeter wave conical phased array. This method employs multi-objective evolutionary algorithms following two procedures. Firstly, sampling is made in scanning space and then conformal array patterns are formed. Secondly, two multi-objective functions which realize low sidelobe patterns inside scanning space anywhere are introduced for constraining these patterns at sampling points. By optimizing subarrays´ configuration and their excitations with the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, the sidelobe level can be suppressed effectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

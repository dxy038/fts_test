The author describes how an international team of marine and rocket engineers is combining advanced oil platform technology with a Cold War rocket system into a novel means of launching satellites at sea. The objective is to heave telecommunications satellites from the equator, the best launch latitude on the planet, into geostationary orbit, the most marketable territory in space. The paper details how marrying an agile Soviet rocket design with the best oil platform technology may provide an altogether new means of getting big satellites into orbit

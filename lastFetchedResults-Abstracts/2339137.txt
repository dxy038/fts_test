Objective
Febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common neurological disorder observed
in the pediatric age group. The present study provides information about
epidemiological and clinical characteristics as well as risk factors associated
with FS among Iranian children.
Materials & Methods
On the computerized literature valid databases, the FS prevalence and 95%
confidence intervals were calculated using a random effects model. A metaregression
analysis was introduced to explore heterogeneity between studies.
Data manipulation and statistical analyses were performed using Stata10.
Results
The important viral or bacterial infection causes of FSs were; recent upper
respiratory infection 42.3% (95% CI: 37.2%–47.4%), gastroenteritis21.5%
(95% CI: 13.6%–29.4%), and otitis media infections15.2% (95% CI: 9.8%-
20.7%) respectively. The pooled prevalence rate of FS among other childhood
convulsions was 47.9% (95% CI: 38.8–59.9%). The meta–regression analysis
showed that the sample size does not significantly affect heterogeneity for the
factor ‘prevalence FS’.
Conclusion
Almost half of all childhood convulsions among Iranian children are associated
with Febrile seizure.

Warehouse management system (WMS) has been introduced and widely used to increase the competitiveness that provides better control on the warehouse operations since the last decade. However, most of the WMS do not support planning and monitoring the use of warehouse resources but only focus on managing the warehouse operations. The management of warehouse resources planning with incoming customer orders are solely relied on the knowledge of warehouse experts. Decision making process becomes difficult to handle with complex orders. In this paper, a concept of warehouse resources management (WRM) is introduced to the typical WMS by extracting qualified order attributes from WMS for completing the operations with suitable resources. Through the use of rule-based reasoning (RBR) technique, the research objective is achieved to effectively fulfill the customer orders with appropriate resources, thereby achieving better customer satisfaction and increase the warehouse operation efficiency.

<p align="left"><strong>Objective:</strong> To assess the association between intrapartum intrathecal opioid use and breastfeeding and weight gain following cesarean section.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> The prospective double-blinded study was conducted on term pregnant women, undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. They divided into two groups. In the first group, intrathecal Morphine was used to achieve analgesia during or after the operation. The remainder divided into two subgroups, those who did not receive any opioid or those received systemic opioids. Following labor breastfeeding accessed in a follow-up, two month latter.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> There was no difference between the demographic variables of the mothers and newborns APGAR score and weight at the time of birth. Breastfeeding rate was similar in intrathecal group in compare with other patents (P value = 0.518). While, the infantsâ€™ weight at the end of second month was lower in spinal opioid group (P value = 0.036).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The present study was the first to suggest that spinal (intrathecal) opioids do not have any impact on breastfeeding. However the relationship between spinal anesthesia on weight gaining needs more investigation.</p>

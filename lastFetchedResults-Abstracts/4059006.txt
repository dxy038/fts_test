This letter suggests a two-stage isolated/bidirectional dc/dc converter with three bridges. Two bridges are used for electrical isolation and constant gain, and the bidirectional control is accomplished through only a single bridge. RMS currents in the high-voltage source and link capacitor can be alleviated by capacitor division and synchronizing operation of both stages. This structure provides a simple control scheme and removes snubber circuitry, so a high efficiency can be obtained under a high switching frequency regardless of operational modes.

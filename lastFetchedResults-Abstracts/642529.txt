Objective
To understand the status of total parenteral nutritional (TPN) composition and the TPN line used for home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in Japan and to investigate how adequate nutritional support should be in HPN, we conducted a questionnaire survey.
Methods

From February to March 2004, questionnaires were sent by mail to the members of the Japan Society for Home Therapy Research. With the content of the questionnaire, we surveyed 1) the types of medical staff who are involved in HPN, 2) the status of the preparation of TPN fluid and its place of preparation, 3) use of the TPN line and final filter, and 4) administration of lipid emulsion and All-in-One.
Results

The major survey results from 66 respondents were that the 50% of the medical staff who are involved in HPN have more than 10 y of experience; however, the number of patients who used HPN and were treated by 78% of the medical staff was fewer than 50. With regard to TPN fluid, 50% was prepared in-house and 12% was prepared by home care service providers. In addition, 58% of institutions were infusing lipid emulsion from the side port of the TPN line or through a peripheral route because they used a final filter and closed system infusion line.
Conclusions

Because the final filter and closed system infusion line for HPN management is standard practice, lipid emulsion is not adequately used in Japan. Therefore, the All-in-One system including lipid emulsion is not used.

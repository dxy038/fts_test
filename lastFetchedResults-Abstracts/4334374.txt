The article examines the transverse profiles of the electric field in the core of a waveguide loaded with a matrix of dissipative character. Transverse filling of the guide may be uniform or otherwise. The main objective is to define the operating conditions (filling factor and dielectric characteristics of the loads) minimising the transverse and longitudinal gradients of electric field in the waveguide core in order to ensure uniformity of heat treatment

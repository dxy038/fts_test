High penetration of photovoltaic (PV) inverters in low voltage (LV) distribution network challenges the voltage stability due to interaction between multiple inverters and grid. As the main objective is to provide more power injection from VSC-based PV inverters, grid stability, reliability and power quality must be maintained or improved by adding cooperative control features to the grid-connected inverters. This paper first gives an overview of bilateral impacts between multiple distributed generations (DG) and grid. Regarding of these impacts, recent advances in static grid voltage support functionalities to increase penetration level are compared considering voltage rise limitation. Steady-state simulation study is realized in PSCAD/EMTDC and the results are discussed in terms of total generation efficiency.

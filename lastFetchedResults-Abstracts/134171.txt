Background: Disorder in diffusion of blood gases almost always is clue to collection of secretion in respiratory airways. So protecting the airway, correct suctioning to remove the secretion and maintenance of air way potency are necessary interventions in patient with end tracheal tube. Objective: To determine and compare arterial blood gas in patient with open heart surgery with and without use of normal saline in suctioning end tracheal tube. Design: The study was a single group clinical trial. The end tracheal tube of each subject were suctioned once with normal saline and once without it. The arterial blood gases were compared before and after each suctioning.
Sample: 40 patient with open heart surgery were selected according to research purpose. Result: Instillation of normal saline bolus prior to end tracheal tube suctioning has an adverse effect on oxygen saturation (p=0.01) but its effect on paO2 and paco2 was not significant. Conclusion: Use of normal saline in suctioning of end tracheal tube may cause disorder in gas exchange and tissue oxygenation. It is recommended that normal saline be used in low dose and only when there is a need for stimulation of cough reflex.

The objective of the current work was the synthesis of sulphonated core-shell nanolatices and to investigate to which extend it is possible to control the final surface charge of such latices. For this purpose differently sized polystyrene seed latices with average diameters in the size range between 30 and 80 nm were synthesized by emulsion polymerization. To obtain the final latices, a sulphonated comonomer was incorporated in the outer surface shell of the particles by further reaction of the seed latices with styrene and sodium styrene sulphonate (NaSS). In a first test series the seed latex surface was modified with four different amounts of NaSS. In a second test series four different seed latices were reacted with the same amount of NaSS. In the last set of reactions the seed latices were reacted with different amounts of NaSS and in these reactions the ratio of added NaSS to the specific surface area of the seed latex was kept constant to obtain differently sized latices of the same surface charge density. The yield of sulphonic acid groups in the particle shell was found between 57 and 74% after an intensive cleaning step by ion exchange. The results show possibilities for a reproducible synthesis of small sulphonated latex particles with a desired surface charge density.

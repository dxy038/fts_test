OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the relationship between birth weight and perinatal outcome among women with gestational diabetes mellitus.
STUDY DESIGN: The relationship between perinatal outcome and birth weight was analyzed for 821 pregnancies of women with gestational diabetes mellitus attended in a tertiary hospital and receiving intensive metabolic therapy (normocaloric diet, self-monitoring of blood glucose level and individually tailored insulin regimen when needed). The Mantel-Haenszel test was used to adjust for preterm delivery.
RESULTS: Seven percent of neonates were small for gestational age, 85% were appropriate for gestational age, and 8% were large for gestational age. After adjustment for preterm delivery the rates of adverse fetal outcome, low 1-minute Apgar score, and hypoglycemia were greater among small for gestational age neonates than among appropriate and large for gestational age infants (odds ratios 3.08, 2.51, and 3.17, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Among women with gestational diabetes mellitus who are receiving intensive therapy, perinatal outcome is worse for small for gestational age neonates than for appropriate and large for gestational age neonates. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:481-5.)

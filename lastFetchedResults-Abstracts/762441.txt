Background & Objective: Self-directed learning readiness scale (SLRS) proposed by Fisher et al. (2001) is a self-evaluation tool containing 50 questions. The aim of the present study was to standardize SLRS for use among Nursing and Midwifery students.
Methods: The statistical population of this descriptive psychometric study included all undergraduate students of Nursing and Midwifery of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (N = 550). Study samples were 224 students (27% males and 73% females). The research instrument was self-directed learning readiness scale. Validity was confirmed by determining content validity and construct validity (exploratory factor analysis) and reliability was confirmed by calculating the coefficient of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha).
Results: Three factors of self-management, willingness to learn, and self-control were extracted from the SLRS that could explain 34.5% of the total variance. Cronbachâ€™s alpha for the entire questionnaire and the mentioned factors were respectively 0.92, 0.88, 0.82, and 0.79. The t-test results showed no significant difference between male and female students in regard to the total score. In addition, multi-variant ANOVA demonstrated no significant difference between male and female students in regard to self-directed learning factors. Mean and standard deviation of self-directing for all students were 176.99 and 25.41, respectively.
Conclusion: Results showed that self-directed learning readiness scale has the required validity and reliability to identify self-directed learning capabilities in Nursing and Midwifery students.

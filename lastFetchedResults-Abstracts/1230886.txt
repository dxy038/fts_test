The axial crushing and crashing of thin-walled high-strength steel tubes is performed using 3D-shell finite elements and an implicit time integration scheme. The calculated results are compared with published experimental data and results obtained using explicit time integration. The objective is to show that, while for such analyses generally explicit time integration is used, with the current state of the art also an implicit time integration solution should be considered, and such solution approach can provide an effective alternative for a simulation.

OBJECTIVE: A select group of Escherichia coli strains known as uropathogenic cause pyelonephritis in nonpregnant individuals. We investigated whether Escherichia coli from gestational pyelonephritis represent a random population or possess common uropathogenic characteristics. STUDY DESIGN: Repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction, plasmid profiles, hemolysin, and O serotypes were assayed from Escherichia coli isolates of 57 pregnant patients with acute pyelonephritis at different gestational ages. RESULTS: The majority of the first trimester isolates fell primarily into repetitive element sequence-based patterns 1 and 3 and O6, O15, and O75 serotypes. Second-trimester isolates had multiple patterns, with high-frequency repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction patterns 1 and 5 and an unknown (OX) serotype. Pattern 3, predominantly O75 serotype, was found primarily among third-trimester isolates. CONCLUSION: It is likely that Escherichia coli associated with acute pyelonephritis during different trimesters of pregnancy represents nonrandom closely related isolates, and some of these strains may be characteristic in pregnant patients only.

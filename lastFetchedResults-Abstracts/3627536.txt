The problem of tightly bounding and shaping the frequency responses of two objective functions <e1>T</e1><sub>i</sub>(<e1>s</e1>)( <e1>i</e1>=1,2) associated with a closed-loop system is considered. It is proposed that an effective way of doing this is to minimize (or bound) the function max {||<e1>T</e1><sub>1</sub>(<e1>s</e1>)|| <sub>&#8734;</sub>, ||<e1>T</e1><sub>2</sub>(s)||<sub>&#8734;</sub>} subject to internal stability of the closed-loop system. The problem is formulated as an <e1>H</e1><sup>&#8734;</sup> control problem, and an iterative solution is given

High performance, compact, and low-cost up/down-converter modules utilizing self-heterodyne detection scheme for 60 GHz WPAN applications have been designed and implemented using CPW-connected unit circuit blocks. The implemented up-converter module provides the gain of 13 dB and the output P<sub>1dB</sub> of +8 dBm with an IF frequency of 140 MHz and an LO frequency of 58 GHz. The down-converter module provides the gain of 40 dB with an RF input power of -42 dBm. These converter modules have been used for the demonstration of bidirectional real-time data transmission of 25 Mb/s.

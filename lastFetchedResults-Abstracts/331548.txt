Objective
The objective of this study was to enhance the mechanical strength of glass-ionomer cements, while preserving their unique clinical properties.
Methods

Copolymers incorporating several different segments including N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) in different molar ratios were synthesized. The synthesized polymers were copolymers of acrylic acid and NVP with side chains containing itaconic acid. In addition, nano-hydroxyapatite and fluoroapatite were synthesized using an ethanol-based sol–gel technique. The synthesized polymers were used in glass-ionomer cement formulations (Fuji II commercial GIC) and the synthesized nanoceramic particles (nano-hydroxy or fluoroapatite) were also incorporated into commercial glass-ionomer powder, respectively. The synthesized materials were characterized using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Compressive, diametral tensile and biaxial flexural strengths of the modified glass-ionomer cements were evaluated.
Results

After 24 h setting, the NVP modified glass-ionomer cements exhibited higher compressive strength (163–167 MPa), higher diametral tensile strength (DTS) (13–17 MPa) and much higher biaxial flexural strength (23–26 MPa) in comparison to Fuji II GIC (160 MPa in CS, 12 MPa in DTS and 15 MPa in biaxial flexural strength). The nano-hydroxyapatite/fluoroapatite added cements also exhibited higher CS (177–179 MPa), higher DTS (19–20 MPa) and much higher biaxial flexural strength (28–30 MPa) as compared to the control group. The highest values for CS, DTS and BFS were found for NVP-nanoceramic powder modified cements (184 MPa for CS, 22 MPa for DTS and 33 MPa for BFS) which were statistically higher than control group.
Conclusion

It was concluded that, both NVP modified and nano-HA/FA added glass-ionomer cements are promising restorative dental materials with improved mechanical properties.

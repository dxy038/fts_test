The objective of this study is to evaluate efficiency of routing protocols between Dijkistra´s and Kruskal´s algorithm. The application of routing protocols is presented. It is used to compute complicated routing paths and the efficiency of routing algorithms. Extensive simulations are being carried out with two different algorithms. The network loads in the performance plots are characterized by two important parameters (a number of vertices) - 9 nodes and 10 nodes. The simulation results showed that the performance of Dijkistra´s algorithm is better than Kruskal´s algorithm when the network loads are increased from 9 nodes to 10 nodes. In this simulation, Dijkstra´s algorithm provides the shortest path among the nodes.

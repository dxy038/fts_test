The objective of this study was to solve a decision-making problem for breeding target character with data shown as interval number. A new comprehensive evaluation method was proposed based on similarity-difference theory and interval number theory. The data from Winter Wheat Group I Variety Regional Test in Henan Province in 2009-2010 were analyzed using the proposed method. The results showed that Zhou 99233 was good variety, Yuxhan No.7, An 05-28, Xun K8, Jinyumai 378 and Zhoumai 18 were better ones, 08 luo 36,and Xuke 718 ordinary ones, and others worse ones. Based on this finding, the feasibility of the method was discussed. It was shown that the proposed method had several merits, such as simple arithmetic, operation convenience, flexibility for practical application, fast and effective calculation. Application living example was indicated that its evaluation effect was satisfactory. Consequently, the application prospect of the method was vast.

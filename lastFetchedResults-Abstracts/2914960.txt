Work is now underway in North America to select a system for terrestrial and cable transmission of advanced television (ATV) pictures. The process, initiated by the FCC in the United States, with the participation of the Department of Communications in Canada, involves objective and subjective assessments of six candidate systems. The Advanced Television Evaluation Laboratory (ATEL) was established for the purpose of conducting subjective assessments of the picture quality available from the candidate systems. The particular challenge at ATEL has been to establish a consistent and repeatable high level of quality in the day-to-day operation of the laboratory, so that the results of the subjective testing procedure are not influenced by plant-related factors, and can be attributed specifically to the systems under test. The paper describes the technical resources incorporated within ATEL, and discusses the methods established to ensure consistency in daily operations

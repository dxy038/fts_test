In this paper, collusion cooperation game theory is applied to optimize a linear passive vehicle suspension model with eight DOF, including six vertical and two rotation motions. Comprehensive considering road surface damage and ride comfort, taking stiffness and damping of seat and suspension system as design variables; and taking seat acceleration RMS, tire´s relative dynamic load and suspension´s maximum dynamic stroke as objective functions, we establish tri-objective optimization design model and present the optimal methods. Taking tri-objective as three players, by calculating the affecting factors of the design variables to objective functions and fuzzy clustering, the design variables are divided into different strategic spaces owned by each player. Adopting collusion cooperation game model and obeying &#8220;you´re within me and I´m in yours&#8221; protocol, the absolute gains and relative gains are combined as the payoff functions of players. Each game player takes its payoff as mono-objective to optimize its own strategic spaces and obtains the best strategy to deal with the others. All the best strategies are combined as a game strategy set. By multi-gaming, the final solution meeting given convergence of criterion is obtained. From practical calculation example, tri-objective game design, the results prove this algorithm is effective.

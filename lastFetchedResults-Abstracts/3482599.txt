The authors present the development of a technique which uses a `multi objectiveÂ´ genetic algorithm for the structural synthesis of combinatorial VLSI circuits by employing one or more cell-based design libraries. Throughout, the genetic evaluation circuits which are optimal with regard to different criteria at various levels within the design hierarchy are sought. The genetic algorithm succeeds in manipulating a highly complex solution space of circuit structures and provides solutions in a relatively small number of generations. The structural cell-based GA implemented, the circuit synthesised, and the results obtained, have not been reported in the literature so far

Objective
and chronic mental stress and many psychiatric disorders have been accepted as a cause of cardiovascular disease. Panic disorder, a subtype of anxiety disorder, has been associated with increased risk of fatal myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in epidemiological studies. Carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV) is currently the gold standard measurement of arterial stiffness. CF-PWV is a well-recognized predictor of an adverse cardiovascular outcome with higher predictive value than classical cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of our study is to measure PWV as the surrogate of arterial stiffness and vascular involvement in patients with panic disorder.
s
two patients with PD, and 30 control participants were included in the study. Patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or the history of any cardiovascular disease were excluded from study.
s
ne characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups, except carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (PD vs. control; 7.51 ± 2.02 vs. 6.24 ± 1.09 m/s, p = 0.001), heart rate, and smoking status. Additionally, CF-PWV positively correlated with age (r = 0.250, p = 0.034), heart rate (r = 0.284, p = 0.017), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.393, p = 0.001 and r = 0.286, p = 0.015, respectively) significantly. However, only the presence of panic disorder was independently related to PWV (βeta: 0.317, p = 0.011) in the multivariate analysis including age, heart rate, smoking status and blood pressure measurements.
sion
sed pulse wave velocity in patients with panic disorder may justify the associated risk as documented in previous studies, and may be useful in identifying the patients with higher risk of future cardiovascular complications.

Objective: To determine the pattern of early complications following modified radical mastectomy with axillary clearance for established cases of early carcinoma of breast.Material and Methods: This descriptive study was carried out in the Breast Clinic, Surgical "A" Warn, Lady Reading Hospital, Pesha war, from January 01, 2004 to March 31, 2005. The study included female patients with the established diagnosis of early carcinoma of breast (stage I, stage II) and undergoing modified radical mastectomy with axillary clearance. These patients were followed for postoperative complications up to one month in the Breast Clinic on out patient basis.Results: During the study period, 154 patients underwent modified radical mastectomy with axillary clearance as per inclusion criteria. Average age of the patients was 47.32 + 13.53 SD. Early complications were evaluated. Seroma formation was most common complication that occurred in 59 (38.3%) patients followed by edema of arm observed in 40(26%) patients. Wound infection was noticed in 19(12.3%) patients, paraesthesia due to damage of the intercostobranchial nerve in 15(9.7%) patients, haemorrhage in 6(3.9%) patients, haematoma in6(3.9%) patients and skin flap necrosis was observed in 6(3.9%) patients. Seratus anterior muscle paralysis and Latissmus dorsi muscle paralysis were found in 3(1.9%0) patients.Conclusion: Seroma formation, wound infection, edema of arm, paresthesia due to intercostobronchial nerve involvement, haematoma, skin Hap necrosis and muscular paralysis of seratus anterior are early complications of modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection that may be detected early through proper postoperative care.

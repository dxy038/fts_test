Abstract
OBJECTIVE: Despite safety precaution legislation, needlestick injuries (NI) continue to occur among hospital workers (HW). Prospective studies suggest the incidence of NIs may be as high as 839 per 1000 HWs per year, significantly higher than that reported through passive surveillance. We reviewed the economic and humanistic burden of NIs to inform policymakers of the need for and value of interventions aimed at reducing that burden.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature synthesis on the economic and humanistic burden of NIs in the United States from 1990 to 2003.

RESULTS: Twelve formal economic studies reporting the cost of NIs were identified. Depending on methodology and infection control protocol, the medical costs of a NI range from $51 to $3,766. These figures exclude the cost of expensive long-term complications (e.g., HIV, hepatitis), work time lost from seeking and receiving care, and legal liability. In addition, HWs experience significant fear, anxiety, and emotional distress following a NI, at times resulting in occupational and behavioral changes. In contrast, the cost to prevent a NI using safety devices ranges from $1,186 to $2,571. This is consistent with estimates of what HWs and society are willing to pay to avoid sharps injuries.

CONCLUSIONS: A NI carries significant economic and humanistic costs. While preventing NIs requires investments in safer technologies, it is economically warranted, especially when considered within the context of other commonly accepted injury-prevention interventions. Continued efforts should be pursued to decrease the incidence of NIs, especially among those at higher risk of serious injury.

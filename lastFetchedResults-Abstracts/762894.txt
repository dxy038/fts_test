Objective:Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) analysis is the most importantmethod for detection and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Due to difficulty and problems of this method for determination of glycemia in diabetic patients, recently the use of Fasting Salivary Glucoseas a simple and non-invasive method to evaluate FPGhas came into significant considerationof specialists. The aim of this study was the presentation of a new method to evaluate FPG by salivary glucose measurement
Material and Methods:This was a cross-sectional study which was done on 52 diabetic patients (test group) and 47 non diabetic patients (control group). After collection of saliva and blood samples, The FPG level was measured by GOD-PAP method and FSGlevel was measured by Glucose oxidase/peroxidase method. The statistical significance was calculated by T-Test and regression test for quantitative variables and Chi-square test for qualitative variables.
Results:The average FSG in diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 11.43mg/dl and 5.2mg/dl, respectively. Also the correlation coefficients between FPG and FSG in diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 0.835 and 0.583 respectively (p-value=0.0001).
Conclusion: This study showed that there is a significant linear relationship between FPG and FSG. Therefore, FSG amounts can be used as a non-invasive method to detect FPG.

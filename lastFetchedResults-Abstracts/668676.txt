The objective of this work is to discuss the links between Cleaner Production (CP) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) practices, within the perspective of the principal European legislation on these matters, which will become operational in 1999. The discussion is centred on the main opportunities and institutional problems to be faced in bringing these practices together, with a particular emphasis on the EIA practices which have been developed in the UK. A proposed procedure is outlined which brings CP and EIA practices closer together, establishing a formal link between them so that companies develop preliminary CP proposals within the EIA process.

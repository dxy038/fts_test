Several methods are presented for the objective speech quality evaluation of narrowband LPC vocoders, based on a framework that we proposed at the 1976 ICASSP conference. In each method, the error in short-term spectral behavior between vocoded speech and the original is computed once every 10 ms. These errors are appropriately weighted and averaged over an utterance to produce a single objective score. Several short-term error measures, and time-weighting and averaging techniques are investigated. We evaluate the objective methods by correlating the resulting objective scores with formal subjective speech quality judgments. High correlations obtained indicate the usefulness of these methods.

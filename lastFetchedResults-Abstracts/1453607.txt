Balancing the distribution of flow through a die to achieve a uniform velocity distribution is the primary objective and one of the most difficult tasks of extrusion die design. If the manifold in a Coat-hanger die is not properly designed, the exit velocity distribution may be not uniform; this can affect the thickness across the width of the die. Yet, no procedure is known to optimize the coat hanger die with respect to an even velocity profile at the exit. While optimizing the exit velocity distribution, the constraint optimization algorithm used in this work enforced a limit on the maximum allowable pressure drop in the die; according to this constraint we can control the pressure in the die. The computational approach incorporates three-dimensional finite element simulations software Rem3DÂ® and includes an optimization algorithm based on the global response surfaces with the Kriging interpolation and SQP algorithm within an adaptive strategy of the search space to allow the location of the global optimum with a fast convergence. The optimization results which represent the best die design are presented according to the imposed constraint on the pressure.

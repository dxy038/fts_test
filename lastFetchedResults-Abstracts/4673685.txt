In this work we seek optimal transmission policies for multiaccess fading channels with AWGN, under a network layer quality of service constraint. We consider M unbuffered variable bit rate (VBR) sources sharing a link with the objective of minimizing the rate of bits lost. We consider a fluid as well a packet model for the arrival process. Under very general conditions on the joint arrival and joint channel gain processes, we obtain the optimal rate and power allocation policies as functions of the arrival and channel gain vectors.

Objective
Neurocognitive problems that were observed in a number of breast cancer survivors treated with adjuvant chemotherapy initiated a series of EEG studies to examine the neurophysiological basis of these deficits. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of various regimens of adjuvant chemotherapy on the N1 and P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP) in breast cancer patients 3â€“6 years after treatment.
Methods
Fifty-three breast cancer patients treated with various chemotherapy regimens were compared to 23 stage I breast cancer patients not treated with chemotherapy. An auditory oddball task was used to study the amplitude, latency and structure of the potential field of the N1 and P3.
Results
Patients treated with chemotherapy showed lower P3 amplitudes than patients not treated with chemotherapy. Differences were also observed in P3 latency between patients treated with different chemotherapy regimens.
Conclusions
Our results indicate a general effect of all chemotherapy regimens under study on P3 amplitude and a more specific chemotherapeutic effect on P3 latency.
Significance
The present study provides evidence for the notion that different chemotherapy regimens have different effects on brain functioning.

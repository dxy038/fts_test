With slim and legless body, particular ball articulation and rhythmic locomotion, a nature snake adapted itself to many terrains under the control of neuron system. Based on analyzing the locomotion mechanism, the main functional features of the motor system in snakes are specified in detail. Furthermore, a bidirectional cyclic inhibitory CPG model is firstly applied to imitate the pattern generation for the locomotion control of the snake-like robot, and its characteristic is discussed particularly for the generation of different kinds rhythmic locomotion. Besides, we introduce the neuron network organized by the bidirectional cyclic inhibitory CPGs connected in line with unilateral excitation to switch automatically locomotion pattern of a snake-like robot under different command from high level neuron, and present the necessary condition for the CPG neuron network to sustain a rhythmic output. The validity for the generation of different kinds of rhythmic locomotion modes by the CPG network are verified by the dynamic simulations and experiments. This research provided a new method to model the generation mechanism of the rhythmic pattern of the snake.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the ketogenic diet on the growth parameters of the children with resistant epilepsy.

Materials & Methods

A total of 36 children with resistant epilepsy who were 2 to 7 year old were put on the ketogenic diet. Their growth and biochemical parameters were studied at the beginning of the study and after 3 months.

Results

Weight decreased in all patients. Serum levels of hemoglobin, calcium, and blood sugar decreased significantly but remained in the normal range. Creatinine did not change, but BUN showed a significant increase.

Conclusion

We can lower the complications of ketogenic diets by using more unsaturated fat, more water, and more minerals.

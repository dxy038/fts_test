This paper presents the fuzzy controller design of a bidirectional converter based on T-S fuzzy model. The topology circuit of this bidirectional is a combination of a buck converter and a boost converter. The T-S fuzzy model of the bidirectional converter operated on buck mode and boost mode are derived respectively. The state-feedback gains are obtained by using Lyapunov stability theorem. Experimental results demonstrate the T-S fuzzy approach is better than the perturbation and observation method.

We examine the potential for applying the literate programming approach to end-user development problems in which explicit knowledge capture and sharing is an objective. Research results from the literate programming literature are presented to support this concept, and recent work addressing previously recognized shortcomings of literate programming technology is highlighted. A prototype system and early experiences with an end-user literate programming are briefly described.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study effects of vibroacoustic stimuli on electrocortical activity and heart rate changes in fetal sheep in utero. STUDY DESIGN: Seven chronically instrumented near-term fetal sheep were repeatedly stimulated by an electronic artificial larynx for 32 seconds during periods of rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. Responses to vibroacoustic stimulation were obtained by spectral analysis of the electrocorticogram (fast Fourier transform) and by assessment of changes in fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability. RESULTS: During non-rapid-eye-movement sleep vibroacoustic stimulation led to electrocorticogram desynchronization that consisted of a marked reduction of delta and theta band power (p  < 0.05). A concomitant fetal heart rate decrease and fetal heart rate variability increase were also noted (p < 0.05). During rapid-eye-movement sleep vibroacoustic stimulation induced a significant increase in alpha and beta band power (p < 0.05) and a slight deviation in basal fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Vibroacoustic stimulation of fetal sheep provokes reproducible changes in fetal electrocortical activity and heart rate patterns. These changes, which are not easily identifiable in gross polygraphic assessments of the fetal behavioral state, are indicative of fetal arousal. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:66-71.)

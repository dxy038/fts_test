Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) has been proposed as a means of increasing spectrum utilization by sharing between frequency agile and static radios, but the low number of field tests relevant to DoD scenarios has hampered the transition of DSA enabled systems into radio programs of record. This paper details the field testing of multi-transceiver DSA radios operating in the presence of a legacy system. The DSA radios dynamically access spectrum to provide suitable performance for each system. The objective of the test was to establish confidence in the coexistence capability of DSA-enabled solutions. The experiment provides a detailed, quantitative assessment of the spectral and network behavior of tactical DSA-enabled systems across a diverse range of operational scenarios. A key aspect of this experimentation is the correlation of the spectral observations with actual radio performance as the DSA-enabled radios make operating decisions in response to changes in spectrum occupancy. The equipment and experimental setup used to make spectrum and packetized data-traffic measurements are described. The scenarios and methods are explained with special attention placed on the importance of synchronizing all aspects of the tests to achieve viable correlation across the dispersed environment. The data collection and analysis aspects of the experiments are presented, as are the conclusions and recommendations for future extensions to such testing. The results of this effort are intended to inform, guide, and accelerate the transitioning of DSA based radios from the science and technology phase into active deployment across DoD.

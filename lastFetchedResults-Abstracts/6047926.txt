The EU 20-20-20 objectives and liberalization of the market are major challenges for European transmission system operators (TSO). Especially German TSOs have already to deal with a proportion of renewable energy generation greater than the EU goals. The resulting power transits affects to every TSOs´ system operation. The required grid extension projects often run into protests and opposition from local communities. Due to national project progresses are lagged far behind their business plans. Smart Grids are one possible solution for supporting the real time operation. However, its components cannot directly controlled by TSO and falls in the DSO responsibility. For evaluating the impact of different Smart Grid approaches on TSO´s real time operation a model is required. The objective of this paper is to outline and validate such a model for the TSO´s real time operation.

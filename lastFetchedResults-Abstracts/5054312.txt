A thermal imaging microscope differs from thermal imagers and visible microscope by some peculiarities]. The array of photosensitive elements in the IR camera is spaced at = F (F is the focal length of the objective) and the object is at a large distance &gt; 10F from the objective. Thermal imaging microscopy have wide possibilities for scientific and technical applications.

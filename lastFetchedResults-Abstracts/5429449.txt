This paper addresses the problem of efficient planning DVB-H networks assuming that the existing broadcasting and cellular infrastructure can be used in the network deployment. The planning objective consists in deciding which existing cellular sites should be used jointly with the broadcasting towers in a minimum cost deployment. A multi-objective genetic algorithm has been utilized to seek minimum cost network configurations as a function of the area coverage level. We investigate the achievable cost savings offered by a hybrid infrastructure compared to using only the existing broadcasting towers and the cellular sites separately

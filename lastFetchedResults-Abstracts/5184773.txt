In this paper, we propose an efficient deinterlacing algorithm which is an edge dependent interpolation based on edge direction refinement. The conventional edge dependent interpolation algorithms have a visually better performance than any other Intra-field deinterlacing algorithms. However they are very sensitive to noise due to the failure of estimating edge direction. In order to exactly detect edge direction, our method detects edge direction of around interpolated pixel and refines the edge direction using weighted median filter. Simulation results have shown the efficacy of the proposed method with significant improvement over the previous methods in terms of the objective PSNR quality as well as the subjective image quality.

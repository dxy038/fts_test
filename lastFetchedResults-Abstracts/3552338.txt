The evolution from simple discrete component to integrated circuit transmitters is currently feasible. The availability of commercial sources for IC chips in easy-to-handle packages coupled with a modest hybrid facility now make this possible. While the work of our laboratory traditionally encompasses system design and fabrication as well as physiologic applications, this paper has presented only the former without reference to its application studies. The latter involves reproductive tract smooth muscle activity, pressure measurements, and cardiovascular dynamics. It has been the objective herein to describe a hybrid transmitter to which a resistive transducer, either as a single element or several bridge circuit elements, may be mated. Further, a wide latitude of input resistance is available and fabrication in hybrid form is possible within a modestly equipped facility. The system will operate with two channels of 1,000 ohm input at 145 ??A, transmitting about 10 feet when implanted. Higher input resistance or larger silver oxide cells will extend the life.

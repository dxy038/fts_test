Objective
otodynamic therapy (PDT) is an alternative method to suppress oral pathogens by the activation of a photosensitizer with laser light. The aim of this study was to investigate the phototoxic effect of three ruthenium-based photosensitizers on Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis.
s
s in vitro study F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis were incubated with three photosensitizers: (i) a hydrophobic tris-(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)-ruthenium(II)-dication (RD3), (ii) a hydrophilic tris-[(1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-diyl)-bis-(benzenesulfonato)]-ruthenate tetra-anion (RSD3) and (iii) a lower hydrophilic tris-(2,2′-bipyridine)-ruthenium(II) dication (RBY). The subsequent irradiation was done with blue-band halogen light (450–485 nm) for 20 s using a conventional polymerizer. Control samples consisted of bacterial cell suspension irradiated and non-irradiated in the absence of photosensitizer or incubated with the photosensitizer without irradiation. Bacterial inactivation was determined by the numbers of colony-forming units (cfu/ml) after anaerobic cultivation.
s
3 photosensitizer reduced the viability of F. nucleatum by 4-log 10 and of P. gingivalis completely after irradiation for 20 s. The viability loss correlated significantly with the concentration of the RD3 photosensitizer and reached a peak at a concentration of 12.5 μM (p &lt; 0.05). The RSD3 and RBY photosensitizers had distinctly lower phototoxic effects in comparison to RD3.
sion
3 photosensitizer showed a phototoxic effect on F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. The results suggest that the application of the RD3 photosensitizer under visible light may be helpful as an adjunct treatment approach to the inactivation of periodontopathogenic bacteria.

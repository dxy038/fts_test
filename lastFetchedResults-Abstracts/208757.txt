Commonly in designing hydroelectric Jams and in the level of consulting engineers, for
determining the hydroelectric potential of an storage, the analyze is done based on an RBS
(Reliability Based Simulation) model with an obvious operation policy.In this paper the effect of optimizing release rules instead of using a fixed and know release policy,
like what it is adopted in an RES model, was explored through developing a dynamic programming
(DP) optimization model and Karoon 5 dam was used as a case study. DP evaluates energy
potential while maximizing total annual energy generated as its objective function. In the case
where no reliability constraint is considered, DP presents such results having lower reliability in
meeting energy demands and lower vulnerability index with a slightly improved firm and total
annual energy, compared to RES results. The DP model was then completed as a reliability DP.
This reliability model can control the reliability level in meeting energy demands like what it is
done in RES model. Comparison between reliability DP and RES models showed that DP results
are better than RES results in term of finn and total energy generated and installed capacity.
However, as the reliability level increases, the out performance of DP over RES model decreases.
This is because by adopting a more strict reliability constraint, the optimization problem will get
more and highly constrained and there is little room left in this case for optimizing an objective
function.

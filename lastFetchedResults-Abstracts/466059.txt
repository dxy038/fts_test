Objective: Our purpose was to determine whether proximal tubal cauterization is an effective method of reversing the decreased pregnancy rates seen in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization–embryo transfer with hydrosalpinges present. Study Design: We studied a group of 94 patients with tubal factor infertility. Sixty patients had hydrosalpinges documented by either hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy, or both. Forty-five had surgical treatment of hydrosalpinges by salpingectomy or by proximal tubal cauterization. In vitro fertilization–embryo transfer was performed within 3 months after surgery. Pregnancy and implantation rates were compared. Results: Patients with hydrosalpinx had significantly decreased clinical pregnancy and implantation rates per cycle (14% and 8%, respectively) compared with those of patients undergoing proximal tubal cauterization before the in vitro fertilization cycle (73% and 36%, respectively). These pregnancy and implantation rates are comparable with those found in patients with tubal factor infertility without hydrosalpinges (53% and 22%, respectively), as well as in salpingectomy-treated patients (46% and 24%, respectively). Conclusions: Proximal tubal cauterization is effective in reversing the adverse effects of hydrosalpinges. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:367-71.)

Background and Objective: Nowadays, the use of CBCT is expanded due to its benefits to conventional radiographies in evaluation of maxillofacial region. The aim of this study was the evaluation of appearance, location and course of the mandibular incisive canal with Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT).
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 100 CBCT examinations. The examinations were taken using the planmeca promax 3D unit and exposure setting of 84 kVp, 12mA. The acquired images were processed with the Romexis software (version 2.8.1). Three oral radiologists evaluated the visibility of the incisive canal, independently. The distances of the incisive canal to the buccal, lingual and lower border of mandible and canal length were measured in right and left side in origin and terminal point of incisive canal. Data were analyzed by t-test, chi square test and Cohenâ€™s kappa correlation.
Results: The mandibular incisive canal was definitely visible approximately in 84% of the CBCT images. The mean distances from the buccal, lingual and inferior border of the mandible in original point of canal were 2.02mm, 4.04mm and 8.96mm, respectively. These were 3.02mm, 3.68mm, 7.86mm in terminal point of canal, respectively. The mean length of the canal was approximately 8.7mm. The canal was running from the mental foramen toward the symphyseal region in downward and lingual direction.  
Conclusion: CBCT imaging is recommended for evaluation of mandibular incisive canal in anterior region of mandible before surgical procedures such as insertion of implants and bone graft.

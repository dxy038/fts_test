Currently, three-dimensional (3D) video is gaining increasing popularity by providing immersive user experience. Compared against conventional 2D video, 3D video excels at bringing a &#8220;live&#8221; scene closer to the users, and/or trying to place the users in the environment of the displayed content. However, streaming 3D video sequences over the IP networks is challenging due to the impact of dynamic network conditions on user quality. Accurate objective 3D video quality assessment is critical for advanced real-time video streaming adaptation solutions. Most state-of-the-art objective 3D video quality metrics are reference-based and require access to the original 3D video sequences, which is not possible for the real-time applications. This paper proposes the extended No-reference objective 3D Video Quality Metric (eNVQM) for real time 3D video quality assessment. eNVQM establishes a correlation between network packet loss and stereoscopic 3D video quality and was tuned according to extensive subjective testing results. Performance of eNVQM is studied in comparison with two state-of-the-art objective video quality metrics: structural similarity index (SSIM) and video quality metric (VQM).

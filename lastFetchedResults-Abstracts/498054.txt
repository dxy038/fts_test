Background and objective: Umblical vessel catheterization ( UVC ) often used for care of critical neonates in neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU). Risk of infections associated with UVC is height and increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of present study is comparison empiric treatment of Ampicilin plus gentamycin with Ampicilin plus Amikacin on the tip of UVCs.

Material and methods: This clinical study conducted in NICU of Amirkola children hospital, BaboL Iran. 104 neonate conducted in this study, 50 neonate with UVC in gentamycin and 54 in Amirkacin group. The tip of catheters were cultured after removal on biphasic medium B.H.I agar made in Kusha far avarghity co (Iran). At he end, the result of culture were comparison together.

Results: At Baseline the weight (2.55± 0.9 vs, 2.42 ± 0.7 kg, p.v - 0.69) and day of catheter remain in umbilical vessels (4.7± 0.7 vs, 5.6 ± 3.7 day, p.v = 0.72) of two group were not significant different. The result of culture in gentamycin group were significant more than Amikacin group (16% vs 10%, p.v = 0.013). The bacteria were enterobacter (2.9%) staphilococcus coaglualase nagative (1.9%), staphilococcus aureus (1%) and Ecoli (1%) respectively.

Conclusion: This study showed that empiric therapy of Amikacin plus Ampicilin,Significantly reduced the bacteria grown on top of UVC than gentamycin plus Ampicilin group.

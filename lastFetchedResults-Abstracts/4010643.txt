Research into a novel class of distributed amplifiers which have a high isolation bandstop response in the reverse gain direction is described. These devices may be used as duplexer/circulator or bidirectional amplifier elements which, for many applications, can perform the function of ferrite isolator and circulator elements. The authors detail the design of such an amplifier, working in the S-band, and gives measured test data

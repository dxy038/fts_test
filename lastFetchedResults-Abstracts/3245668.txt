The introduction of Web and mobile technologies has recently improved research endeavors such as research planning, literature searching, or data gathering. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to an adaptation of mobile technology into research support systems. We argue that it is viable to extend the applicability of current mobile technology to research support systems by analyzing research activities and mobile support systems. The objective of this research is to integrate and introduce the mobile technology in building effective research support systems. Architecture of Mobile Research Support Systems (MRSS) is proposed along with a design of a research support system especially for literature review.

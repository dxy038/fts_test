Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the body fat parameters in individuals with and without metabolic syndrome using an objective method.
Materials and methods: This case-control study was performed in Tehran and consisted of 105 individuals with age range of 20 to 55 years. All participants were overweight and obese. NCEP ATP III criteria were used for identifying subjects with metabolic syndrome. Waist circumference, weight and height were measured by an expert person and with non-elastic tape measure, balanced beam scale and standing stadiometer, respectively. Fat mass was measured using BIA (model: Tanita BC 418).
Results: Mean age of total participants, case group, and control group were 35±14, 35.85±6.9 and 34.98±8.1 years, respectively. Mean BMI in case group was higher than control group (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between case and control groups for total body fat, right hand fat, as well as right and left leg fats. But there was significant difference between the two groups for trunk and left right hand fats, before controlling of confounding factors. After controlling confounding factors this observed difference was disappeared. One unit increase in BMI raised the development odds of metabolic syndrome by 1.14% (95%CI: 1.02-1.27).
Conclusion: We found that BMI is a more accurate predictor of MetS rather than body fat mass. However, other predisposing factors especially at molecular levels are needed to clarify underlying mechanisms of this syndrome.

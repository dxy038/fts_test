Background & Aims: It was aimed to determine the relation between pathological size of renal cell carcinoma on microscopic pathological parameters of radical nephrectomy specimen.
Material & Methods: In a retrospective study, we reviewed pathological finding of 76 patients that underwent radical nephrectomy during 2006-2011. We studied the relations between pathological size of tumor with nuclear grade, lymph nodes involvement, lymphovascular invasion, tumor thrombus in renal vein, pyelocaliceal involvement, surgical margin and adrenal involvement.
Results: There are significant relations between pathological size of renal cell carcinoma with nuclear grade, lymph nodes involvement, lymphovascular invasion, tumor thrombus in renal vein, pyelocaliceal involvement, and adrenal involvement but not with surgical margin.
Conclusion:  There is relation between pathological size and pathological parameters of renal cell carcinoma. Further studies need to show that these parameters can play a role in staging of renal tumors.

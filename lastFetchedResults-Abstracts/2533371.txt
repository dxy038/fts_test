Raeini breed is the most productive Cashmere goat in Iran. Helminthes infections cause major economiclosses globally to the livestock industries and farming communities. The objective of this study was todetermine the seasonal prevalence and intensity of Eimeria and gastrointestinal helminth parasitic infectionsin Raeini goats in Iran. A total of 438 faecal sles were randomly taken from clinically healthy goats inRaeini Goats Research Center of Iran. Faecal sles were collected from each goat once and eggs per gram of faeces (EPG) and faecal oocysts counts (OPG) were estimated using the modified McMaster technique. Oocysts were found in 391 (89.27%) goats. Five species of Eimeria including, E. arloingi, E. parva, E. ninakohlyakimovae, E. christenseni, E. faorei and one Eimeria spp were identified in faecal sles. E.arloingi (92.07%) predominated in all categories and was followed by E. parva, E. ninakohlyakimovae andE. christenseni. Trichuris spp. egg was the only nematode egg which was found in 196 (44.75%) faecalsles. The prevalence of gastrointestinal helminthes infections during autumn and winter weresignificantly higher than summer (P<0.05). The association between the prevalence of Eimeria oocysts andgastrointestinal nematode infection and the age or sex categories was not significant (P>0.05).

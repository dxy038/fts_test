In this paper, analysis and control design of ac-dc converter, normally non-linear time-varying system, using sliding mode controller to achieve fast output voltage response, disturbance rejection and robust system in the presence of load variation are demonstrated. The objective of this method is to develop methodology for output voltage to be constant and input current sinusoidal that results in nearly unity power factor, respectively. In addition the converter can be also bidirectional power flow. Simulation result using Matlab/Simulink and experimental result show the effectiveness of sliding mode control system compared with linear feedback controller to guarantee enhanced PF&lt;0.98, THD&gt;5%, and ripple output voltage is less than 2% at the maximum output power.

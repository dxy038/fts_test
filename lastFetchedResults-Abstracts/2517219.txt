Economic power dispatch (EPD) is one of the most important tasks for improving power systemâ€™s efficiency and reliability. The EPD problem determines the optimal generation level of units. Over the last years, due to public awareness about the environmental issues, considering the emission objective functions in convemntional EPD problem is necessitated and as a result environmental and economic power dispatch (EEPD) is proposed. In this paper, a modified charged system search (MCSS) algorithm is proposed and applied to solve the multiobjective EEPD problem. The proposed model is tested on the IEEE 30-bus test system and the results compared with seven different approaches presented in literature. The obtained results show effectiveness of the proposed MCSS approach.

Boron removal is a critical issue in the production of drinking water and of ultra-pure water in the electronics industry. Boron rejection in a RO process is typically in the range of 40â€“60%. The objective of this study was to distinguish the factor contributing to enhanced boron rejection in reclamation of a spent rinse stream from a plating operation. The effects of different known components used in the feed on boron removal were investigated in the laboratory. The results indicated that glycolic acid and antifoulants could not individually enhance boron rejection in a RO process. A high boron rejection of 95% was achieved as the concentration of iron in the feed was 10 times higher than that of boron, which might be due to formation of a complex between iron oxide and boron. The finding was confirmed in a pilot study.

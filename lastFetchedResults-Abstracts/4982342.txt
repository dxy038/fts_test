An integrated converter is a synthesized converter based on the overall system integration, which is simplified by the system objective and can implement the system functions similar to the discrete converters. An integrated converter consists of converter sets; each converter set has a special function defined by the designer. A family of DC/DC buck boost based integrated rectifier with two active switches can be derived by the integration concept. In this paper, buck boost + forward integrated converter is proposed and fully explained. Five different operating modes, formulation, waveforms, output/input voltage ratio characteristics, small-signal models, transfer function, simulation results, and experimental verification are presented in detail

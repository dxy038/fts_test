Two control schemes are proposed to control dynamic plants with time delay and double integrators. One adopts the H<sub>2</sub> optimal controller, whereas the other utilises a conventional derivative controller for the setpoint tracking in an open-loop control manner. Both of the proposed control schemes are of the two-degree-of-freedom control structure and use an identical disturbance estimator to construct the closed-loop between the plant input and output for load disturbance rejection. In consequence, the setpoint response is decoupled from the load disturbance response. The disturbance estimator is obtained by proposing a desired closed-loop complementary sensitivity function according to the H<sub>2</sub> optimal performance objective. The closed-loop robust stability is analysed and corresponding sufficient and necessary conditions are also provided in the presence of the plant multiplicative uncertainty. Consequently a rule-of-thumb for tuning the single adjustable parameter of the disturbance estimator is presented. Finally, illustrative examples are included to show that a good performance can be obtained using the two proposed control schemes, especially the proposed closed-loop for the load disturbance rejection, which can also be successfully utilised to reject ramp-type load disturbances in industrial and chemical processes with one integrator.

Computational advancement impacts directly on the technology of image processing. Image Quality assessment (IQA) is an area where almost all image processing researchers are impressed and publishing their research work frequently. Since the image processing required sophisticated computation and analysis in both the cases of task oriented images and non task oriented images, several algorithms and their analysis were required. In this paper, a survey of existing objective IQA literature review was presented and some discussion on available database has been reported. Paper also works on development of database using three types of variation and four types of distortion in each variation. As a result twelve varieties of images and one original were studied in this paper. Authors selected eleven objective image quality algorithms and evaluated index of image quality of above generated database. Simulation results and tabulation of evaluation are also presented in this paper. A comparative studies of algorithms in respect to speed and index performance were presented.

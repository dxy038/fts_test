In this paper, we propose a channel and queue aware cross-layer algorithm for allocating power and sub-carriers to users in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) networks. Our algorithm uses utility to build a bridge between the physical layer and upper layers and also to balance the efficiency and fairness of the radio resource allocation. The objective is to develop a method based on two practical assumptions for allocating resources to users. The first assumption is the fact that the OFDMA system operates with a limited No. of bit rates and the second one is the fact that the users which are scheduled for transmission, may not have enough data to transmit. We further study the performance of the proposed algorithm through simulations. Comparisons with similar approaches are also conducted which are indicated significant performance improvement.

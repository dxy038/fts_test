Vulvodynia is a term used to describe chronic burning and/or pain in the vulva without objective physical findings to explain the symptoms. The terminology and classification of vulvodynia continue to evolve, and much remains to be understood about the prevalence, patho-genesis, natural history, and management of this distressing condition.
Starting point

James Aikens and colleagues showed that chronic vulval pain (vulvodynia or vulvar dysaesthesia) is associated with worse depressive symptoms (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003; 189: 462â€“66). However, the increased scores for depression in this case-control study were attributed to sexual disinterest and experience of chronic pain rather than to features of depressive disorder. These results lend weight to the increasing need for better understanding of the pathogenesis of vulval pain and how to manage it appropriately.
Where next?

The aetiology of vulvodynia and effectiveness of treatments need further study. Appraising the available literature, we have formulated a useful approach to patients with chronic vulval pain. There is a pressing need for further case-control studies of potential causes of vulvodynia and for randomised trials of interventions.

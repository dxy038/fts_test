Recent developments have been made in the fabrication of doping superlattice solar cells. Two main fabrication methods are presented, which demonstrate progress towards the objective of an optimized contacting method for lateral carrier selective contacts. The work presented here discusses contact formation via diffused junction and higher bandgap epitaxial regrowth, and the changes made to achieve 9.0% efficient solar cells through epitaxial regrowth. To date GaAs regrowth is the most robust fabrication method, however InGaP<sub>2</sub> regrowths show the potential of increased V<sub>OC</sub> while diffused junction devices show potential if the diffusion process can be optimized.

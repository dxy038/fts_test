We optimize the disaster backup in multi-datacenter (multi-DC) cloud systems and design disaster-aware algorithms to realize rapid backup with the objective of minimizing the backup window for all the DCs in the network. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is first formulated to optimize the backup processes of all production DCs jointly. We then develop three heuristics that use the one-step or two-step approaches for the selection of backup DCs and the calculation of backup routing paths. Simulation results show that the Two-Step algorithm can achieve the shortest backup window with the lowest operation complexity.

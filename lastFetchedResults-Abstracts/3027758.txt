A three-dimensional Galerkin model is used in feedback design to regulate the perturbation kinetic energy in the flow around a cylinder. The objective may vary from stabilization in order to reduce drag to mixing enhancement. The Landau model [H.K. Khalil, 2002] includes an oscillatory state pair and a shift mode, exchanging energy with the mean flow. Given the model´s simplicity, it is essential to maintain closed-loop dynamics close to the system´s natural dynamic range which is represented by an invariant manifold and a natural frequency, adding a design constraint addressed in this note.

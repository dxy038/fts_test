In order to estimate the quality of degraded speech processed by communication networks, conventional objective speech quality assessment methods require the source speech signal, which has been applied to the networks, as well as the processed speech. The paper presents a new paradigm in objective speech quality assessment. In contrast to previous objective models, the proposed auditory non-intrusive quality estimation (ANIQUE) model estimates the quality of speech without using the source speech information. ANIQUE is a perceptual model which simulates the functional role of the human auditory system at both peripheral level and central auditory level. The performance of ANIQUE is demonstrated using 19 different subjective MOS databases.

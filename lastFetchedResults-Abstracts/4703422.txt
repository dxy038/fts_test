Constraints are classified as subjective and objective. Fuzzy equality constraints are represented by fuzzy intervals. Each fuzzy equality constraint is equal to the combination of two other fuzzy inequality constraints. An expression is proposed from which the complete fuzzy solution set can be conveniently studied. When all subjective constraints are represented by linear membership functions, the complete decision set can be conveniently obtained with the aid of parametric linear programming. Application of the SFLP technique to a simple refinery problem has been demonstrated

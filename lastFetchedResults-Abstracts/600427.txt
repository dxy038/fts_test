Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of ACL reconstruction using a cross- pin femoral fixation system and hamstring autografts. Methods: The study included 49 men and one woman (mean age: 27.4 years; range: 15 to 44 years) with chronic ACL ruptures operatively treated between 2003 and 2006. Involvement was in the right knee in 27 patients, and the left knee in 23. There were no professional athletes included in the study. Patients with chondral lesions of the knee treated by microfracture or drilling or operated previously were excluded from the study. All patients had an ACL recon¬struction with an autogenous four-strand hamstring graft. Thirty-five patients received treatment for other meniscal pathologies. All patients followed a similar accelerated rehabilitation program after surgery. Final evaluations were made using the Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring systems and the Tegner activity rating system in the final follow-up. Results: Mean follow-up time was 43.9 (range: 29-57) months. Lysholm scores were good or excellent for 47 patients. IKDC scores were either Grade A or B for 48 patients. The mean Tegner activity score was 5.9 (range: 4-9) in the preoperative and 5.4 (range: 2-9) in the late post¬operative period. Conclusion: Reconstruction of the ACL using four-strand hamstring tendons and cross-pin femoral fixation may be a safe and effective method, resulting in considerably high success rates.

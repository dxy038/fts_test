Sustainable manufacturing aims to increase efficiency and offset negative impacts throughout the life cycle of products. A myriad of standards pertaining to various aspects of a productÂ´s life cycle exist; however, it is often difficult for non-experts to navigate and comprehend these standards. The objective of this paper is to describe a classification system for capturing the requirements, concepts and terminology from those standards at the intersection of life cycle and manufacturing process domains. The classification is implemented as an ontology using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We then use an ontology visualization tool we have developed, to help users navigate and understand the information in these standards more easily. Such an ontology can support life cycle assessment activities or sustainability decision-making in the life cycle stages, such as replacing energy consuming processes and equipment with sustainable practices. In addition, the ontology can support the development of new life cycle and manufacturing standards. The ontology provides a holistic picture of the requirements to enrich comprehension of and compliance to the growing number of sustainable manufacturing standards.

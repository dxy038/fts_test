In a multiobjective optimal load flow study (MOLF) two objectives (cost of generation and transmission losses) have been considered for minimisation. A weighting method has been used to formulate the problem. An attempt is made to obtain the relation between the range of each objective, i.e. cost of generation and transmission losses, and the weight associated with each of them. If the range of an objective function is large, a small weight has to be associated with it. If the decision makers follow this relation, then appropriate weights will be elicited. The `optimal weight´ is derived on the basis of the maximum range of each objective function. If the `optimal weight´ is attached to the multiobjective function consisting of cost of generation and transmission losses, the target point is achieved in a single step, thereby saving much computational effort

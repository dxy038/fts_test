Miniature pigs have been recognized as valuable experimental animals in medical research. However, porcine models related
to gene knockout of human diseases are not widely available. The objective of this study was to establish Mx1-Cre pigs using
somatic cell nuclear transfer. In this study, we created transgenic pigs using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Transfer of
210, 230, 250 and 215 zygotes to four surrogates produced 10 piglets. The Cre recombinase expression in transgenic pigs was
studied using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Mx1-Cre swine were shown to harbor the Cre gene
in their genomic DNA using the PCR. In conclusion, Mx1-Cre transgenic piglets were successfully produced by SCNT. These
transgenic swine, in conjunction with inducible systems for controlling Cre expression and function, are likely to have a
profound impact on the study of human diseases.

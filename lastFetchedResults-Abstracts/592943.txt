Objective: CatSper is a voltage-sensitive calcium channel that is specifically expressed in the testis and it has a significant role in sperm performance. CatSper (1-4) ion channel subunit genes, causes sperm cell hyperactivation and male fertility. In this study, we have explored targeting of the extracellular loop as an approach for the generation of antibodies

with the potential ability to block the ion channel and applicable method to the next generation of non-hormonal contraceptive.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, a small extracellular fragment of CatSper1
channel
was
cloned
in
pET-32a
and
pEGFP-N1
plasmids.

Then,
subsequent
methods
were
performed
to
evaluate
production
of
antibody:
1)
pEGFP-N1/CatSper
was
used

as
a
DNA

vaccine to immunize Balb/c mice,  2) The purified protein of pET-32a/CatSper was used as an antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western- blot, and 3) The serum of Balb/-c mice was used as an antibody in ELISA and westernblot.
The
statistical analysis was performed using the Mann Whitney test.  
Results: The results showed that vaccination of the experimental group with DNA vaccine caused to produce antibody with (p <  0.05) unlike the control group. This antibody
extracted
from
Balb/c
serum
could
recognize
the
antigen,
and
it
may
be
used

potentially
as a male contraception to prevent sperm motility.
Conclusion: CatSpers are the promising targets to develop male contraceptive because they are designed highly specific for sperm; although, no antagonists of these channels have been reported in the literature to date. As results showed, this antibody can be used in male for blocking CatSper channel and it has the potential ability to use as a contraceptive.

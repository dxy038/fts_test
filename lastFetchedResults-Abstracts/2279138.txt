An experiment was performed over a period of 5 weeks with 576 one-day-old cockerels (Cobb 500), which were randomly divided into 6 experimental groups (12 replicate cages with 8 birds/cage). The objective of the experiment was to estimate whether different grain types (wheat, rye or triticale) and exogenous xylanase inclusion influence the performance and the gastrointestinal ecosystems of broiler chickens as regards intestinal viscosity, pH as well as the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactic acid (LA). The rye-based diets resulted in the poorest production results followed by wheat and triticale-based diets. Ileal viscosity decreased in the range: rye (140 cps), triticale (6.1 cps) and wheat (2.5 cps). Xylanase supplementation reduced ileal viscosity significantly only in birds fed with rye. The cereal type influenced the fermentation process in the broiler gastrointestinal tract more than the xylanase supplementation. The total concentration of organic acids was highest in the caeca, followed by the crop, ileum and gizzard. Lactic acid concentrations were highest in the content of the crop followed by ileum, gizzard and caeca. Propionate was only detected in caecal contents, whereas butyrate was also found in small amounts in the contents of the crop of birds from all treatments. The concentrations of acetate, butyrate and total organic acid concentration in caecal contents of chickens receiving the rye-based diets were lower than in birds fed the other cereals (P&lt;0.001). Enzyme supplementation reduced the relative weight of the caeca in rye-fed birds (P=0.001).

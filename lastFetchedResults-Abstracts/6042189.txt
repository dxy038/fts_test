While extreme programming (XP) relies on certain principles, it requires an extensive set of tools to enable an effective execution of its practices. In many companies, putting stories on the board may not be sufficient for managing rapidly changing requirements. The objective of This work is to report the results from a study where a requirement management tool - the Storymanager - was developed to meet the needs of a XP project team. The tool was used in a case project where a mobile application for real markets was produced. The tool was dropped by the team only after two releases. The reasons of the process improvement failure are addressed in This work. The principal results show that the tool was found to be too difficult to use and that it failed to provide as powerful a visual view as the paper-pen board method. The implications of these findings are addressed for both the practitioners and researchers in the field.

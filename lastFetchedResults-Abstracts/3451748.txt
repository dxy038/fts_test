In rehabilitation medicine, it is necessary for medical staff members to recommend the suitable computer input device for each patient with a spinal cord injury. This paper describes a measurement and evaluation system to determine the computer input ability of patients with tetraplegia. The authors will define a measurement procedure, a set of objective parameters, and a graphical representation of the parameters. They measure the position locus of the mouse cursor when a patient operates a computer using a computer input device. Using the representation, the medical staff can evaluate the patient´s computer input ability and understand the characteristics of the patient´s computer operation

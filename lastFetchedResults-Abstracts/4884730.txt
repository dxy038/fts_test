The paper presents an assessment of the performance of transputers and Occam in the simulation of a third order nonlinear system. The primary objective of this study is to establish a framework for the development of a low-cost software-based real-time simulator for nonlinear multivariable systems. The choice of the electromagnetic suspension system as the `demonstratorÂ´ is based mainly on its open-loop instability, its nonlinearity, and the detailed knowledge of the design requirements

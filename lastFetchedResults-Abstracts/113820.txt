The tuned liquid damper (TLD) is increasingly being used as an economical and effective dynamic vibration absorber to mitigate the dynamic response of structures. The ability to design a TLD to operate in two directions simultaneously is particularly attractive. In this paper the results of bidirectional (2D) structure-TLD tests are reported on. These include the free-surface motion, the resulting base shear forces, and the work done by bidirectional tuned liquid dampers (2D TLD) attached to simple structures and response displacements and accelerations of 2D structure-TLD systems. The importance of this experimental study is that it examines 2D structure-TLD behavior over a range of excitation amplitude values covering the practical range of serviceability accelerations for buildings subjected to wind loads. Experimental results are subsequently used to verify the applicability of a unidirectional structureTLD numerical model to 2D structure-TLD analysis. Findings indicate that the structure-TLD model is capable of describing the structure-TLD response within the range of system response amplitudes experimentally tested.

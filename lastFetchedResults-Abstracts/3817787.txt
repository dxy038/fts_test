The optimised characteristics of a wavelength-locked Fabry-Perot laser diode (FP-LD) have been analysed and demonstrated experimentally using remote seeding continuous wave (CW) optical source at central office (CO). The important issues of mode partition noise (MPN) of an FP-LD and Rayleigh backscattering arising from the same wavelength bidirectional transmission are investigated. The Q factor, sidemode suppression ratio (SMSR), and power penalty of a wavelength-locked FP-LD against signal-to-backscattering-power ratio (SBR) were measured. They can be optimised for the SBR range between 22 dB and 31 dB. From the measurements, both the MPN and Rayleigh backscattering can be controlled well owing to remote seeding of an FP-LD and hence use feasibly a wavelength-locked FP-LD in a wavelength division multiplexing-passive optical network (WDM-PON) optical link.

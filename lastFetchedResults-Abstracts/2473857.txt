The objective of this study was investigating the effect of monensin and vitamin E supplementation on nutrients degradability characteristics of diet with high content of oilseed using in situ technique. For this purpose two ruminal fistulated sheep were used. Experimental treatments were: a) treatment with 20% whole cottonseed without monensin and vitamin E supplementation, b) treatment with 20% whole cottonseed and 500 IU of vitamin E and c) treatment with 20% whole cottonseed and 24 mg of monensin/kg DM. The incubation times were 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 h. The obtained data was analyzed using SAS program as completely randomized design With ANOVA procedure. 2 h after incubation, the treatment with monensin had the highest DM disappearance among treatments (P < 0.05). The treatment with monensin for 48 h ruminal incubation had the highest (71.17%) DM disappearance and treatment without additive had the lowest (50.51%) DM disappearance (P < 0.05). Supplementing monensin and vitamin E to the diet with high level of oilseed increased DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF digestibilies in rumen (P < 0.05). The results indicate that monensin and vitamin E supplementation to diet with high level of cottonseed may improve ruminal function and cause increase in rumen nutrients degradabilies.

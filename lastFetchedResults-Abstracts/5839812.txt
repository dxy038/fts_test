In this paper we consider the problem of finding optimal parameters of the two mass model that represents vehicle suspension systems. The analysis of the problem is based on finding analytical solution of the system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). Such a technique allows us to generate optimization problem, where an objective function should be minimized, in accordance with ISO 2631 standard formula of admissible acceleration levels. That ensures maximum comfort for a driver and passenger in a moving vehicle on the considered highways.

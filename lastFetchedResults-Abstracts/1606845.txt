The objective of this research was to evaluate the rhizospheric effects of wheat on phosphorus (P) release kinetics in 10 calcareous soils under rhizobox conditions. The kinetics of P release in the bulk and the rhizosphere soils were determined by successive extraction with 0.5 M NaHCO3 in a period of 2 to 840 h at 25 ± 1°C. The results of kinetics study showed that mean of released P after 840 h of extraction period in the rhizosphere soils (192 mg/kg) was significantly lower than the bulk soils (207 mg/kg). A plot of cumulative amount of P released from both the rhizosphere and the bulk soils showed a discontinuity in slope at 168 h. Thus, two equations were applied to segments of the total reaction time (2 to 168 and168 to 840 h).  Release kinetics of P from the rhizosphere and the bulk soils conformed fairly well to parabolic diffusion, simplified Elovich, power function and first order models in two segments. The correlation results showed that P released after 168 and P release rate constants of simplified Elovich, parabolic diffusion and first order equations in the rhizosphere and the bulk soils were significantly correlated (p?0.05) with wheat plant indices. In second segment, P release rate constants of Elovich, and parabolic diffusion equations in the rhizosphere and the bulk soils were significantly correlated with wheat plant indices (p?0.1). The results of this research indicated that wheat rhizosphere caused decrease of the P release rate and P release amount and release rate of P are important factosr in supplying available P to plants.

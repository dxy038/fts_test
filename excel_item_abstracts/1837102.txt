A 5.5-year-old girl with renal cell carcinoma and chromosomal abnormalities is described. Morphology was diagnostic of an adenopapillary renal cell carcinoma. The karyotype was 57,XX,+X,+2,+3,+4,+7,+12,+13,+16,+17,+20,+21[8]/58,idem,+17[17]. This karyotype has not previously been described in the rare cases of childhood renal cell carcinoma. It is similar to the karyotypes described in adults of the same morphologic subtype. This poses the question whether different types, from a genotype point of view, of renal cell carcinoma exist in childhood.

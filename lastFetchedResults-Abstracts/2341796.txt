Diamond cutting tools are often the only choice for the machining of high-strength and highly abrasive non-ferrous alloys. During machining, a complex interaction of different wear mechanisms takes place on the tools. This interaction considerably hinders a purposeful detection of specific wear mechanisms. Therefore, the objective is to systematically analyze the wear processes that occur when machining a hypereutectic aluminum silicon alloy with CVD-diamond tools. The main wear mechanisms are identified and the limits for the use of various CVD-diamond tools are indicated. The findings gained will serve in the further development of these high-performance cutting materials.

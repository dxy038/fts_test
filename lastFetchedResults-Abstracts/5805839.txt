During the last decade, the needs for exploitation of distributed generation (DG), including renewable energy such as photovoltaic, wind turbine, fuel cells, etc., has been growing. In spite of many economic and technical advantages of DG, high penetration of DG in distribution systems would cause some negative impacts on distribution network operation such as increase of fault current level, false tripping, etc. In this paper, the impacts of DGÂ´s on protection coordination and operation of distribution network are analyzed including increase of the level of fault current, malfunctioning of protective devices and protection coordination of CB-reclosers. And Test of directional recloser and directional distribution automation FRTUs is also carried out to validate the directional elements and fault indication function of these bidirectional devices using real-time power system simulator. These directional overcurrent elements and fault indication of bidirectional devices are tested and is validated in various fault condition in distribution network with distributed generation using real-time power system simulator.

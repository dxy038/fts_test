The problem of ground truth generation is fundamental for many approaches of computer vision and image processing. In order to test algorithms for object segmentation, object tracking, object interactions, it is necessary to have image sequences in which the ground truth is determined in an objective way. In the context of visual surveillance where many people moves in the scene occluding each other, it could be very complex and hard the work of generating for each image the position of all the moving objects and maintain this information for all the period in which they remain in the scene. In this paper we propose a semi-automatic system that generates an initial ground truth estimation, and then provides a user-friendly interface to manually validate or correct the track results. The proposed system has been tested on some soccer video sequences that have been published on-line for being available to the scientific community, but it can be used also in other surveillance contexts.

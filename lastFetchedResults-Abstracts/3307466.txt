The present authors recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs) from subjects viewing four types of line drawings of body part, tetrapod, home appliance, that were presented on a CRT. The authors investigated a single trial EEGs of the subject precisely after the latency at 400 ms, and determined effective sampling latencies for the discriminant analysis to some types of images. They sampled EEG data at latencies from 400 ms to 900 ms at 25 ms intervals by the four channels such as Fp2, F4, C4 and F8. Data were resampled -1 ms and -2 ms backward. Results of the discriminant analysis with jack knife method for four type objective varieties, the discriminant rates for two subjects were more than 95 %.

Background and Objective: There is no report on the effect of exercise on purkinje cells in cerebellum of by pentyleneterazole (PTZ) induced epileptic rats. Purpose of this study was to determine the effect of physical exercise on cerebellum purkinje cells in epileptic rats.
Materials and Methods; Forty adult male rats were randomly divided into four equal groups) n=10)including: (1-PTZ+ without exercise, 2- Control+ without exercise, 3- PTZ + exercise, 4- Control + exercise groups). Kindling was done by PTZ ( 40 mg/kg). After 6 week rats were anesthetized and cerebellum dissected out and fixed in formalin. After tissue processing and sectioning, the sections were stained by routine and especial method. Data were analyzed using ANOVA test. 
Results: The results showed significantly increased the mean number of purkinje cells in cerebellum of the group PTZ+ exercise compared to the PTZ without exercise group. Furthermore, the mean normal cells of purkinje in cerebellum were significantly increased in control + exercise group compared to the control group. The obtained results showed increase Program cell death of of purkinje in the PTZ group of cerebellum compared to the other groups.
Conclusion: Decreased number of normal  purkinje cells in cerebellum of epileptic rats  would be   probably  related with increase in  rate of   purkinje cells  apoptosis  , whereas exercises has positive effect on  delaying  the  apoptosis of purkinje cells.

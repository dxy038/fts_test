The paper presents the development of a rule-based fuzzy logic speed controller for a permanent magnet (PM) DC motor fed by MOSFET chopper. The use of this controller is motivated by the system parameters uncertainty and the unknown nonlinear load characteristics over a wide range of operating points. The objective of the controller is to manipulate the motor terminal voltage in such a way that makes the rotor speed follow a specified trajectory with minimum deviation. To validate the robustness of the controller, simulation and experimental results of the proposed controller are compared with those of the classical PI controller. The results indicate that good dynamic speed response can be achieved

With the increase of traffic demand, urban traffic problems become more and more serious. Owing to the complexity of traffic system, the fuzzy control theory demonstrates powerful advantage. In this paper, taking the signal control problem of the intersections group as objective, we provide a distributed control system, which comprises some local fuzzy controllers and a special case controller. Each local fuzzy controller controls the traffic flows at its designated intersection according to the traffic flows of related intersections in addition to its own. When the current traffic situation is beyond the ability of local traffic controller, the special case controller will be activated. By adopting the designed simulated annealing algorithm, the special case controller optimizes the green time extension of all the intersections in the road network. In this algorithm, success index is given to evaluate the efficiency of each feasible solution taking the system optimization into account. Finally, to evaluate the performance of this system, it is compared with a general fuzzy control system, and its availability is validated by system simulation.

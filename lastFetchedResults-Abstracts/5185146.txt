Given a plant, together with an exosystem generating the disturbances and the reference signals, the problem of asymptotic tracking and regulation is to find a controller such that the to-be-controlled plant variable tracks the reference signal regardless of the disturbance acting on the system. If a controller achieves this design objective, we call it a regulator for the plant with respect to the given exosystem. In this paper we formulate the asymptotic tracking and regulation problem in the behavioral framework, with control as interconnection. The problem formulation and its resolution are completely representation free, and specified only in terms of the plant and exosystem dynamics.

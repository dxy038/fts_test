Background and Objective: A wide range of molds (e.g. Aspergillus sp. Penicillium sp.
Fusarium sp. are enable to produce fungal toxins (Mycotoxins) such as Aflatoxins, Fumonisins,
Zearalenones, Ochratoxins and etc with harmful effect on human health. Information on the
fungal contamination of consumed rice in Iran is limited and this kind of contamination is
important for food hygiene and safety and therefore, a survey was undertaken to determine the
fungal contamination of consumed rice of East Azarbaidgjan.
Materials & Methods: A total of 150 samples were obtained using standard 20 em collection
sond from local silos, whole sail store and stores in different part of East Azarbaidgjan. Samples
were cultured in yeFA medium and incubated at 25"e for maximum 3 weeks and a screening
survey for positive samples was carried out
Results: 137 (90%) out of total 150 samples had fungal contamination more than 10' colony
forming units/gram (cfu/g). Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Fusarium sp.. Alternaria sp.,
Mucoracae, Helminthosporium sp., Cladosporium sp., Rhodotorula rubra, Derchslera sp.,
Paecilomyces sp., Candida sp., Trichotecium sp., Gliocladium sp., and Acremonium SP., were
the most frequently detected microorganisms throughout the survey.
Conclusion: The presence of moulds such Penicillium ,'p., Aspergillus sp., Fusarium sp.,
Alternaria sfJ., Mucoracae, and... in rice can lead to the presence of mycotoxins produced by
these moulds and then could result in serious toxicity and illness in humans. As the fungal
contamination has a strong influence on the ultimate quality of rice, rice end products and food
safety, more attention to the quality of consumed rice are necessary.

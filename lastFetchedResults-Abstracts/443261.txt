Background
Our objective was to predict endoscopic performance in a cadaver model using basic performance resources (BPRs) measurements.
Methods
Medical students (n = 16) underwent intense ureteroscopic training on a virtual reality ureteroscopy trainer and were rated on performing ureteroscopy on a cadaver. The medical students also underwent 13 validated BPR measurements. Urology residents also performed cadaveric ureteroscopy and BPRs. A predictive model built from urology residentsâ€™ (n = 16) BPRs and performance assessment was used to predict medical student cadaveric ureteroscopy performance based on their BPRs alone.
Results
The predictive model built with urology residents predicted the ureteroscopic performance of 10 of 16 medical students within 15% of their rated ureteroscopic performance on the cadaver.
Conclusions
A predictive model built with urology residents can moderately predict the ureteroscopic performance of medical students from BPRs. Additional in vivo evaluation is required.

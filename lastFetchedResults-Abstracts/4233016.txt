The on-line generation of carrier based gating signal for pulse width modulation-current source inverter (PWM-CSI) extends the duality between VSI and CSI. Accordingly, feedback control strategies with voltage source inverter, (VSI) such as vector control technique can be applicable with CSI. Moreover, the problems encountered with VSI and its effect on the machine can be avoided. The objective in this paper is to get the benefits from intrinsic advantages of multiphase CSI when engaged with the multiphase induction machine. A vector controlled five-phase PWM-CSI induction motor drive is introduced to study the performance of such system.

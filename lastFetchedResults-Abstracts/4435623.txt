Taking full advantage of limited number of trains to obtain the best transport efficiency is the foremost question in Urban Rail Transit (URT) operation. The paper analyzes the deficiencies in current theory of URT train running program, and then puts forward its objective: comparing and optimizing the operating projects according to average passenger waiting time and total trainload. Firstly, the paper establishes a platform-train-passengers interchange model, set up corresponding real-time arithmetic for average waiting time and total trainload. Secondly, this article advances a double-target optimum model for URT train running program, and then figure out the optimum solution by using artificial intelligence technique. Finally, an example is given to validate the optimum method.

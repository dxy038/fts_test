Survivability of traffic grooming problem for optical mesh networks is employed in WDM mesh networks. A typical connection request may require bandwidth capacity which is lesser than the wavelength channel capacity of an optical fiber network, and it may also require protection from link failures of the network, typically fiber cut. As higher layer electronic ports, such as transceivers and optical splitters are dominant cost factors of an optical network, it is essential to reduce their number of use when grooming the multicast traffic into high bandwidth light-trees. This paper, provides an near optimal cost design of WDM networks with survivable multicast traffic grooming under static traffic demands. In this paper, we have proposed a heuristic approach called Multicast Traffic Grooming with Survivability (MTGS) at light-tree level for grooming a connection request with segment protection. In this segment protection scheme, backup paths use the network resources (such as transceivers, optical splitters and wavelengths), as long as their working paths are failed simultaneously. In our proposed approach, working paths and backup paths are groomed separately and protecting each specific link when two links failed simultaneously. The main objective of this approach is to minimize the cost of the network which is associated with network resources. We have compared our work with existing approach called logical-first sequential routing with single-hop grooming (LFSEQSH) and logical-first sequential routing with multi-hop grooming (LFSEQMH) algorithms. In the existing multicast traffic algorithms, we add survivability with traffic grooming in static traffic environment. The results, thus obtained by comparison depict that our proposed approach yields better performance in term of network cost than existing algorithms.

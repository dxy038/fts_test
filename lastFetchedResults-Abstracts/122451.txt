Objective: This project was designed to determine the frequency of documented procedures by nurses and to compare their correlation of that with indicators: kind of ward, measure of personnel works hours, work shift and number of patients of confined to bed.
Materials and Methods: We studied in a cross-sectional design with the aim of frequency determination of documented nursing procedures and the relation to the selected indexes .Nursing procedures are included the whole of nursing performances that were related to nursing job. These procedures can include types of dressing, injections, serum therapy, and sampling, care designs and etc. Document able procedures (95 procedures) were determined by coordination of head nurses and nurses of research environment. 978 discharged files were analyzed which recorded the performance nursing procedures had recorded in them, in the course of two months by nurses.
Results: Performance of 93 procedures was documented 82638 times. The most of samples (238 files) have taken in men cardiac ward but generally procedures have documented greater in ward, which its personnel are women (P=O). There was no significant correlation between measure of personnel work hours, numbers of confined to bed patients and measure of procedures documentation. The most of procedures numbers have documented in morning shift and the least have documented in evening shift (P=0).
Conclusions: some of measured indexes don't have any relation with frequency of documented nursing procedures, but quantity of nursing procedures is measurable by cooperation of nurses continually. in addition using of this method recommends for evaluation of nursing servants.

This paper presents effective solution strategy to solve the real time economic dispatch problem including the network security constraints such as line flow limits and emission limits using augmented Lagrangian method. It formulates the problem with quadratic objective function and linear constraints goal programming technique is used in the problem formulation which guarantees the best feasible solution in emergency condition. In order to relieve the constraint violations in real time, emergency control variables such as load shedding and transaction curtailments are used in second phase dispatch. The proposed strategy has been tested on 10 bus model power system

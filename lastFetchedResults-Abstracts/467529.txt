Objective: The purpose of this study was to present our experiences of an innovative surgical approach for vaginal agenesis with the use of Interceed absorbable adhesion barrier (Ethicon) to achieve a satisfactory neovagina. Study Design: The current study involved 10 subjects who were diagnosed with vaginal agenesis. After the creation of a vaginal tunnel, a mold that had been wrapped with Interceed was placed in the neovagina. Results: No operative and postoperative complications were encountered. The duration of the operation was â‰¤30 minutes, and blood loss was minimal. The postoperative hospital stay was only 2 days. Epithelialization of the neovagina was achieved 1 to 4 months after the operation, and all patients were satisfied with the outcome. The neovagina that was created with this procedure was not much different from the normal adult vagina as far as histologic and physiologic conditions are concerned. Conclusion: This innovative surgical procedure may be a potential alternative approach for the therapy of vaginal agenesis with the use of the absorbable adhesion barrier Interceed with excellent results.

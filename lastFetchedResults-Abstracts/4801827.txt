This paper proposes a design approach for a self-organizing self-tuning fuzzy logic controller, and is applied to the design of a field oriented drive system. The basic structure of a fuzzy logic controller is outlined and the design problems associated with the conventional trial-and-error schemes are addressed. The suitability of the genetic algorithm optimization technique as a means to determine and optimize the fuzzy logic controller design is discussed. In the proposed approach normalization factors and/or membership function parameters and/or the controller policy, are translated into bit-strings. These bit-strings are processed by the genetic algorithm and if the selection process as well as the objective function are chosen properly, a near-optimal solution can be found. To examine the efficiency of the proposed approach, a self-tuning and self-organizing fuzzy logic controller for an indirect field oriented induction motor drive is designed in both a sequential and a concurrent manner. A particular objective function (i.e., a performance index) is chosen to achieve a high dynamic performance. The simulation results demonstrate a significant enhancement in shortening the development time, and improving system performance over a manually tuned fuzzy logic controller

The objective of this paper is to develop a new algorithm for numerical solution of dynamic elastic–plastic strain hardening/softening problems, particularly for the implementation of the gradient dependent model used in solving strain softening problems. The new algorithm for the solution of dynamic elastic–plastic problems is derived based on the parametric variational principle. The gradient dependent model is employed in the numerical model to overcome the mesh-sensitivity difficulty in dynamic strain softening or strain localization analysis. The precise integration method, which has been used for the solution of linear problems, is adopted and improved for the solution of dynamic non-linear equations. The new algorithm is proposed by taking the advantages of the parametric quadratic programming method and the precise integration method. Results of numerical examples demonstrate the validity and the advantages of the proposed algorithm.

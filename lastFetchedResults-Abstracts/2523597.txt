Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease that starts in the early life and usually persists by the end of life in 20% of cases. The disease shows multiple periods of relapse, and significantly affects the patientâ€™s quality of life. The etiology of this disease is unknown, yet recent studies have reported incidence of immunological disorders and mutation in the filaggrin gene as the major causes. In some cases, concurrent incidence of infection with these inflammatory lesions reinforces the significance of treatment. Various methods of treatment such as emollients, corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors are applied to manage this disorder. Traditional and complementary approaches may also help to control the disease. This disease is not usually easily controllable, thus requires full awareness of physicians on the underlying prospects of this disease. This review paper deals with the important aspects of the clinical perspectives and presents an integrative therapeutic approach for treating atopic dermatitis.

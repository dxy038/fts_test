Objectives/Hypothesis To compare subjective and objective voice-quality parameters between asymptomatic paradoxical vocal fold motion dysfunction (PVFMD) patients and healthy individuals. Study Design Prospective. Methods A total number of 12 patients with PVFMD and 12 healthy control subjects had voice evaluations by means of laryngostroboscopy, acoustic analysis (jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio [HNR]), aerodynamic measurements (maximum phonation time [MPT], s/z ratio), and perceptual analysis (Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenicity, and Strain Scale [GRBAS] and Voice Handicap Index-10 [VHI-10] scales). Evaluations were conducted when all the patients were asymptomatic. Results False vocal cord adduction, anteroposterior constriction of the supraglottic larynx, decreased amplitude, and decreased mucosal wave were observed in the great majority of the PVFMD patients during laryngostroboscopy. Mean jitter and shimmer rates were significantly high in PVFMD patients and there was no significant difference in mean HNR between groups (Pآ <آ 0.05). Mean MPT was significantly long in control subjects (Pآ <آ 0.05) and mean s/z ratio was nearly equal between patients and control subjects. There was a statistically significant difference between groups about GRBAS and VHI-10 scales (Pآ <آ 0.05). Conclusions Based on the subjective and objective voice parameters, voice quality is significantly impaired in asymptomatic PVFMD patients when compared with the healthy control subjects.

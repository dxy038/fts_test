Polymeric nanoparticle aqueous suspensions have been proposed as drug carriers to improve the efficacy of medicines. Considering those nanocarriers, nanocapsules are vesicular structures containing an oil core surrounded by a polymeric wall. Recently, we proposed the supramolecular model for a new kind of nanocapsule prepared with triacylglycerol, sorbitan monostearate (SM), polyester and polysorbate 80. Varying the proportions of the raw materials in the organic phase, different kinds of colloids could be obtained. So, our objective was to formulate exclusively lipid-core nanocapsules (LNC) in aqueous suspensions. In this way, the analytical approach to verify the quality of the different formulations was based on light scattering measurements (dynamic light scattering, multiple light scattering and laser diffractometry) and density gradient. The increase in the SM concentration showed a slight tendency of both sedimentation and creaming, while the increase in the oil concentration resulted in creaming. For the latter, size distribution as function of time indicated the presence of nanoemulsion simultaneously with LNC. Finally, density gradient showed an exclusive band for formulations prepared using 1:4.1:2.6 (w/w) of SM, medium chain triacylglycerol and polyester, respectively.

Background: Highly variable results of topical immunotherapy with diphencyprone (DPC) in the treatment of alopecia areata have been reported so far.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of DPC in the treatment of severe and chronic alopecia areata.
Patients	and Methods: Twenty-eight patients (16 female and 12 male, 10-35 years old, mean age 25 years) with chronic and/or extensive alopecia areata were enrolled in an open-label clinical trial. After sensitization with 2% DPC, progressively higher concentrations beginning at 0.001% were applied weekly for 6 months to one side of the scalp. The maximum concentration of DPC was 2%.
Results: Twenty-seven of 28 patients completed therapy. The overall response rate was 81.5% (22 cases). Complete response (90% -100% terminal hair re-growth) was
was observed in 66.7% (18 cases) of these patients after 6 to 12 months of follow up. Conclusion: Topical DPC treatment for alopecia areata is an effective therapy with a relatively high relapse rate.

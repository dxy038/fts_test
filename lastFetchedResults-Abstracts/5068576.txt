Device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks brings significant benefits to resource utilization, improving userÂ´s throughput and extending battery life of user equipments. However, the allocation of radio resources and power to D2D communication needs elaborate coordination, as D2D communication causes interference to cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a novel joint radio resource and power allocation scheme to improve the performance of the system in the uplink period. Energy efficiency is considered as our optimization objective since devices are handheld equipments with limited battery life. We formulate the the allocation problem as a reverse iterative combinatorial auction game. In the auction, radio resources occupied by cellular users are considered as bidders competing for D2D packages and their corresponding transmit power. We propose an algorithm to solve the allocation problem as an auction game. We also perform numerical simulations to prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

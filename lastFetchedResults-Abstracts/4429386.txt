In this paper, a new approach to managing the reliability of the network is proposed, it takes into account the various aspects of the system, a new formulation of the problem is proposed, the objective function is derived and limitations. Explicit analytical expressions for the optimization of a distributed network based on their performance, which in contrast to the well-known optimization of reliability problem formulation, take into account many parameters, costs for the system, the reliability, the profit from the operation of the network, penalties for delays.

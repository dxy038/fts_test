Abstract
Inroduction & Objective: Migration and engraftment have a vital role in tissue regeneration and transplantation and CXCR4 is a known chemokin receptor in making and increasing homing and engraftment of cells into damaged tissue or wounds. CXCR4 expresses in low level on human MSCs, but we show here that CXCR4 expression by hBM MSCs up-regulates through exposure to TNF-? in a dose and time dependent manner.
Materials and Methods: Cultured hBM MSCs were divided into 9 groups. One group was un treated and the others treated with 1 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml TNF- ? in 2, 10, 24 and48 hours. Total mRNA was extracted and cDNA synthesized. Then rate of CXCR4 expression compared with housekeeping gene (B-actin) by Real Time PCR.
Results: In untreated hMSCs CXCR4 expressed in low level. In treated hMSCs with 1ng/ml TNF-? in 2, 10, 24 and 48 hours CXCR4 expression was increased respectively 32, 64, 256,32 fold and with 10ng/ml increased 16, 32, 512, 32 fold. The highest level of CXCR4 gene expression found after treatment with 10ng/ml TNF-a in 24h was highly increased(2-??Ct  = 512 ). 
Conclusion: These finding indicate that in vitro control of both dose and time factors may be important in future-stem cell transplantation therapies.

Modeling machining processes, especially turning, is the subject of a large number of studies today. The objective is to optimize cutting conditions and improve tool lifetime as well as the quality of the pieces produced. However studying various phenomena such as tool wear requires simulating very long machining times in order to reach the stabilized state, among other things. These stationary simulations require a very good calibration of the limit conditions representing the experimental reality. In particular, the thermal contact resistance of the insert/tool-holder body contact plays a very significant part in removing the heat generated. The aim of this article is to propose an experiment/simulation procedure to calibrate this resistance. Based on laser heating and temperature measurement, a numerical sensitivity study has made it possible to estimate the value of this resistance in the case of a non-coated insert and a carbide body.

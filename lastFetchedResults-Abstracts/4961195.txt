In this paper, the design of an automatic carrier landing system (ACLS) is accomplished using H-infinity techniques, in which the single input/output design specifications were translated into the weighting functions of the H-infinity synthesis problem. The objective of the design is to improve the ACLSÂ´s path precision under the worst-case condition of a vertical gust during carrier landing. The design yields a satisfactory response

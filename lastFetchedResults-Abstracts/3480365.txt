A laboratory demonstration of two uniwavelength bidirectional transmission systems, one at 780 nm and another at 1300 nm, multiplexed on a standard single-mode fibre is described. Based on experimental results, a duplex-quadruplex system for the subscriber loop is possible, which again doubles the information carrying capacity of the fibre system.

A new bidirectional DC-DC converter with multiple switched-capacitor (SC) cells is presented in this paper. This device provides voltage conversion ratios from double-mode versus half-mode to n-modeversus 1/n -mode by switching the solid-state relay(SSR) into various numbers of switched-capacitor cells and power MOSFET switches. In addition, the output inductor proposed to construct the voltage conversion ratio of the converter can be adjusted by controlling the switch duty ratios. The converter working principle is described in the detailedconverter topology analysis. Simulation and experimental results are carraied out verify and validate the proposed converter performance in different operation modes.

In this paper, a simple method to reduce the Cross Polarization Level (XPL) of a millimetre-wave microstrip antenna array is presented. Objective of this work is to design a compact vertical array which radiates a RF wave with vertical polarisation over 1 GHz bandwidth in Q band. The surface currents in the antenna have been studied to reduce the cross polarization component. With this method, normalized XPL has been reduced from -5 dB to -12 dB with few modifications of return losses.

This paper proposed an adaptive tracking algorithm for dynamic time-varying control of extra and ultra high voltage magnetically controlled shunt reactor (MCSR), based on the extensional model and linear regression algorithm, the output of controlled system will track the control objective, then both of the optimal static and dynamic characteristics can be got. The structure principle of MCSR magnetic circuit was analyzed, the linear regression equation in dynamic time-varying parameters was created according to the theory of dynamic parameter tracking, considering the relevance of power system and MCSR, least squares theory was used to construct the parameters tracking formula, the gain-adjustment adaptive system was formed accordingly, In the processing of data collection, the memory limit principle was used to avoid data saturation, stressing the innovation amendment to the model parameters. The controller can meet the demands of tracking the expected order, fast rapidity of initial convergence and high accuracy of convergence. Computer simulation results used in practical operation parameters confirmed the effectiveness and validity of control algorithm. The electromagnetic transient modular of PSASP has contained the controller model by program, it has the advantages of novel, practical, accuracy, fast-tracking and reliable, which provides the necessary implement for voltage control of extra and ultra high voltage magnetically controlled shunt reactor, also opens a new way to conduct the study of controller design for nonlinear element in power system.

Objective
gh patients with transient left ventricular ballooning syndrome (TLVBS), also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, improve rapidly and recover left ventricular systolic function, the long-term prognosis is not well-known. This study investigated the clinical features of TLVBS, and its in-hospital and long-term (in-hospital plus postdischarge) mortality.
s and Results
luated 87 patients diagnosed with TLVBS. The median follow-up was 42 months (interquartile range, 19 to 72 months). During follow-up, no recurrences were reported, but 20 (23%) patients died. Two nonsurvivors (2%) were suspected of dying from sudden cardiac death. The in-hospital total mortality rate was 9%, but the in-hospital cardiac mortality rate was 0%. Most deaths were associated with underlying noncardiac diseases. Baseline characteristics were mostly similar between survivors and nonsurvivors. However, nonsurvivors were older, and more likely to be smokers compared with survivors. Underlying noncardiac diseases were the only independent predictors of long-term mortality (hazard ratio, 3.954; 95% confidence interval, 1.369 to 11.422; P = .011). There were no significant differences in long-term mortality, according to the preceding stress events or ballooning patterns.
sions
gh a substantial number of patients with TLVBS die, the long-term cardiac mortality is low. The severity of heart failure owing to TLVBS may influence in-hospital mortality, whereas underlying noncardiac diseases have a more significant correlation with the long-term prognosis than does TLVBS itself.

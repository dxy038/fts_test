The paper presents a novel media access control (MAC) protocol called DCBMA (dual-channel bidirectional multiple access) for multi-hop ad hoc networks. Dual channels and appropriate handshake are employed to avoid collision in data transmission and to solve the hidden terminal, exposed terminal and intruding terminal problems. The use of bidirectional data transmission also increases the channel utilization. The throughput performance of the DCBMA protocol is analyzed and evaluated in heavy traffic networks. A comparison with an RTS/CTS based protocol is given. The results show that in a multi-hop ad hoc network, the DCBMA protocol has a better performance.

In a restructured power system, the problem of maintenance scheduling is different from the traditional centralized power system. This paper is demonstrated how GENCOs (generating companies) in a competitive environment prepare the maintenance schedule of their facilities. Taking into account that in the new structure the main purposes of GENCOs are selling electricity as much as possible and making higher profit, the model is setting up. The model consists of an objective function and related constraints, e.g. maintenance window, generation capacity, load and network flow. We apply the branch-and-bound optimization methodology on a GENCO and finally make a discussion about the simulation results.

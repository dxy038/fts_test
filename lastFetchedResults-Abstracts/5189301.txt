The proposed in-building portable telephone system has been developed for business activities in large buildings. The system incorporates many features, including an extended range of mobility with an <e1>m</e1>:<e1>n</e1> relationship of base and handset units, and higher function and adaptation to systematization and network building, through a number of technical improvements such as dispersion of controls, multiplicity of location registration, and handover control. In order to comply with the requirements, adapted techniques of decentralized control architecture, use of the high-speed signal for the common control channels together with the out-band signal for the voice channels, plurality of receivers in both the fixed radio stations and portable telephones, and plurality of location registration control are adopted. This proposed system was implemented in a building, and the results of evaluation tests have verified the objective functions

Objective This study investigated the
association between antisocial personality disorder
(APD), childhood trauma history, and dissociative
symptoms in a sample of Turkish recruits. Methods A
total of 579 male patients diagnosed with APD were
examined in a military hospital setting. An age and
gender matched control group of 599 normal persons
with no known medical or psychiatric disorder were
also chosen among military personnel. The subjects
were evaluated with an assessment battery using a
semi-structured interview for socio-demographic
characteristics, APD section of SCID-II, an adapted
version of the Structured Trauma Interview, and
Dissociative Experiences Scale. Results Childhood
sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, and early separation
from parents were significantly more common
among antisocial subjects than among controls. APD
group reported significantly more dissociative symptoms
and 50.4% of them reported pathological level of
dissociation. Overwhelming childhood experiences of
all four types were significant predictor of the APD
diagnosis. Analyses also showed that childhood
traumatic events and comorbid psychopathological
features relevant to antisocial personality were significantly
associated with pathological level of dissociation.
Conclusion These results revealed the
importance of inquiring about patientâ€™s history of
childhood traumatization and dissociative experiences
when diagnosed with APD

In this paper, the effects of tapering and introducing axisymmetric indentations on the crash performances of thin-walled tubes are investigated. The crash performances of the tubes are evaluated using two metrics: the crush force efficiency (CFE, the ratio of the average crushing load to the peak load), and the specific energy absorption (SEA, absorbed energy per unit mass). The optimum values of the number of the axisymmetric indentations, the radius of the indentations, the taper angle and the tube thickness are sought for maximum CFE and maximum SEA using surrogate based optimization. In addition, multi-objective optimization of the tubes is performed by maximizing a composite objective function that provides a compromise between CFE and SEA. The CFE and SEA values at the training points of surrogate models (metamodels) are computed using the finite element analysis code LS-DYNA. Polynomial response surfaces, radial basis functions, and Kriging are the different surrogate models used in this study. Surrogate based optimization of the tubes showed that the tubes with indentations have better crush performance than tubes without indentations. It is found that maximum CFE requires large number of indentations with high radius, small thickness, and medium taper angle, while maximum SEA requires small number of indentations with low radius, large thickness and small taper angle. It is also found that the globally most accurate surrogate model does not necessarily lead to the optimum.

In this work, coordination of energy trading and unidirectional vehicle to grid services taking into account generation emissions is considered. The study has investigated the case of a Load Serving Entity (LSE) with owns a number of wind and thermal generation units and has to cater a certain amount of load with large concentration of a special controllable load, Electric Vehicles (EVs). The objective of the LSE is to simultaneously maximize its expected profits and minimize emission. A two level mixed integer stochastic programming (SP) is used to handle various uncertainties such as uncertain energy prices, balancing prices, stochastic availability of wind energy and demand. In addition, trading risks are accounted for using the conditional value at risk (CVaR). Simulation results show the benefits of coordinating V2G services with wind and thermal trading.

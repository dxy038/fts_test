The main objective of this project is to design a practical ECG simulator which can be used to perform the calibration and testing of ECG devices and can show various ECG signal with its graphic LCD screen. In this device microcontroller send the digitally stored ECG signals, to the DAC converter then to the terminal circuits where the ECG leads can be mounted, also in the real time the ECG signal is showed at the graphics LCD on the device. By this graphics LCD the user can be sure about the selected signal type and also the device can be used for education purposes. The digitally stored ECG signals are real signals so the user can be sure about the proper work of the device. To simplify the circuit a multiplexer is used between the DAC and the terminals circuits, by this way the microcontroller send the required information to each lead by using only one DAC component. Most of the devices can simulate only healthy ECG signals on the market but this device can also simulate abnormal ECG signals, and also the simple architecture made it relatively inexpensive.

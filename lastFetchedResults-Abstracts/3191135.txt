This paper presents an objective, flexible and expandable model of dealing with the risk of postponement (rop) of projects in the investment plan. The 3 factor (3F-) method is used to assess the general (risk group specific and experience based) and individual (project specific) postponement risk of every project. The result is a rop priority index for the investment plan as a quantified guide for project urgency.

The paper describes a new interactive visual communication set-top box for home entertainment exploiting a single-chip MPEG-2 codec LSI. The set-top box has been designed to achieve recent audio-visual compression technologies for consumer applications, especially very-low-delay and robust-error-tolerant ones dedicated to interactive visual communication. This set-top box, combined with a home television set, provides standard-TV-quality bidirectional video transmission via a commercially available FTTH-based IP broadband network.

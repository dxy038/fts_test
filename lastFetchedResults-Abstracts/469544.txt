Objective
This study was undertaken to determine whether side-on laparoscopic operating orientation alters time-to-skill mastery compared with head-on orientation.
Study design
One hundred thirty-one medical students were randomly assigned by operating axis (camera position to operating field) and completed 10 attempts at each of 5 previously validated laparoscopic skills stations. Time-to-completion was recorded for each attempt, generating an orientation and skill station learning curve. Statistical analysis was performed by using repeated measures analysis of variance and linear, polynomial, and logarithmic models with 95% CIs.
Results
Sixty-eight students were randomly assigned to head-on orientation and 63 to side-on orientation. Comparing median time-to-completion by station, head-on attempts were faster than side-on attempts for every station. Comparing learning curves by orientation, side-on learning curves were steeper than head-on learning curves for every station, except one. Asymptotes were reached in both strata by the tenth attempt.
Conclusion
Greater initial disorientation is seen with side-on orientation compared with head-on orientation. This can be overcome with practice.

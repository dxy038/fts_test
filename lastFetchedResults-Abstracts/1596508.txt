Efficiency and economy in the design and operation of a hydraulic system, as well as its safety, are objectives needing precise calculations of pressures and flowrates within the system. The calculations are typically very time-consuming and, depending on the characteristics of the system, very complicated and difficult to organize. A suitable mathematical modelling of the different ingredients in a hydraulic system is necessary to get useful results, which help fulfill those objectives. In this paper, the mathematical modelling used to develop a computer program to simulate hydraulic transients in a simple system is described. The program (DYAGATS), developed by the authors, is currently being used by organizations and consultancies to simulate and, consequently, analyze hydraulic transients in water systems. It makes use of the so-called elastic model, also known as waterhammer, to model the behavior of the fluid within the pipes. Also, lump models for the different elements that introduce, damp, modify, absorb, etc., perturbations in the systems are presented in a unified treatment. The main objective is to provide users with a powerful tool to devise the potential risks to which an installation may be exposed and to develop suitable protection strategies.

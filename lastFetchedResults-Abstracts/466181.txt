Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of digital cervical examination on maternal and neonatal outcomes among women with preterm rupture of membranes. Study Design: This analysis includes data from a previously reported trial of antibiotic treatment during expectant management of rupture of membranes at 24 to 32 weeks’ gestation in singleton and twin gestations. Patients from both the randomized trial (n = 299 in the antibiotic group and N = 312 in the placebo group) and the observational component (n = 183) are included in this analysis. The groups were divided into those with one (n = 161) or two digital cervical examinations (n = 27) and those with no digital cervical examinations (n = 606). Results: The gestational ages at enrollment were similar in the two groups (29 ± 2 weeks’ gestation for one or two examinations vs 29 ± 2 weeks’ gestation for no examinations; P = .85). There were no differences in chorioamnionitis (27% vs 29%; P = .69), endometritis (13% vs 11%; P = .5), or wound infection (0.5% vs 1%; P> .999) between the group with one or two examinations and the no-examination group. Infant outcomes were also similar in the two groups, including early sepsis (6% vs 5%; P = .68), respiratory distress syndrome (51% vs 45%; P = .18), intraventricular hemorrhage (7% vs 7%; P = .67), necrotizing enterocolitis (5% vs 3%; P = .19), and perinatal death (7% vs 5%; P = .45). A composite outcome made up of these neonatal outcomes was not different (56% vs 48%; P = .10) between the group with one or two examinations and the no-examination group. The time from rupture to delivery was shorter in the digital examination group (median value, 3 vs 5 days; P< .009). Multivariable analysis to adjust for antibiotic study group, group B streptococcal culture status, race, and maternal transfer did not modify these results. Conclusion: Performance of one or two digital cervical examinations during the course of expectant management of rupture of membranes between 24 and 32 weeks’ gestation was associated with shorter latency but did not appear to worsen either maternal or neonatal outcome.

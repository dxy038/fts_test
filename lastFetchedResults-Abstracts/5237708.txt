As power system restoration (PSR) is a multi-variable, multi-objective, multi-constrained nonlinear optimization problem, it is difficult to establish mathematical model. Hence, a new distributed model for PSR is proposed in this paper by combing multi-agent technology (MAT) with ant colony optimization algorithm (ACOA). The proposed model consists of a number of bus intelligent agents (BIAGs) and a single intelligent control agent (ICAG). These agents are co-operative and capable to interact with each other dynamically to gain local optimal solutions. Based on that, ACOA is utilized by ICAG to search for a global optimal solution. By the flexible interaction of agents and the heuristic search of ACOA, an optimal target of PSR is obtained. It is shown from simulation results that this model can reach an optimal target of PSR. In addition, the proposed model poses strong robust for the changes of electric network topology and has the flexibility of dealing with various problems during restoration

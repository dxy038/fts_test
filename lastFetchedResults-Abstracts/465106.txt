Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the prevalence of symptomatic yeast vaginitis caused by non-albicans species among patients attending a vaginitis clinic over an 8-year period.
Study design: A retrospective study of 1263 patients with symptomatic yeast vaginitis confirmed by culture techniques was performed.
Results: The prevalence of symptomatic fungal vaginitis caused by non-albicans species increased from 9.9% (10/101) in 1988 to 17.2% (36/209) in 1995 (x2 for trend=9.33, p=0.002). Non-albicans species were found more frequently in known human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients (23/102 vs 143/1161, odds ratio 2.07, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.46) than in seronegative subjects or subjects of unknown status for the virus. Recurrent vaginal candidiasis was an additional risk factor for vaginitis caused by non-albicans species (odds ratio 2.47, 95% confidence interval 1.72 to 3.52). The increase in non-albicans isolates during the study period was confirmed in stratified analysis and in the subgroup of self-referred patients with no history of either human immunodeficiency virus infection or recurrent vaginal candidiasis.
Conclusion: The prevalence of fungal vaginitis caused by non-albicans species has increased sharply in the setting of a vaginitis clinic. The characteristics of risk factors suggest that fungal cultures should be done routinely in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive subjects with suspected vaginal candidiasis and in patients with recurrent vaginal infection.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the potential of midtrimester fetal blood sampling to detect in utero human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. STUDY DESIGN: Ultrasonographically guided fetal blood sampling was performed before pregnancy termination in 28 women infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Mean gestational age was 22 weeks (range 15 to 29 weeks). Samples were tested for human immunodeficiency virus with undissociated p24 antigen and deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase chain reaction or viral isolation by cell culture. After terminations fetal thymuses were also tested for human immunodeficiency virus infection by polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction was also performed on maternal cells to confirm that the primer pairs used were able to detect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strains present. RESULTS: All fetal blood samples had negative results by p24 antigen and polymerase chain reaction or virus culture and all fetal thymuses were negative by polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Early in utero human immunodeficiency virus infection appears infrequent, supporting the hypothesis that mother-to-child transmission predominantly occurs late in pregnancy. Therefore midtrimester prenatal diagnosis is not currently of use to women in making reproductive decisions. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:489-93.)

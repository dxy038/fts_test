Information on the dynamics of sapling growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm), two dominant species in the interior of British Columbia, Canada, is incomplete and thus the objective of this study was to understand how light availability and sapling size interact to influence their growth and crown morphology. In an undisturbed forest, 360 saplings were randomly selected in three light classes 0-15, 1530, and >30% PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density). A number of morphological and growth parameters were measured, including height and lateral branch growth. Douglas-fir had a more plastic crown morphology than lodgepole pine with its leader to lateral branch growth ratio, live crown depth, and number of branches increasing with increasing light class. Sapling size had little effect on morphological characteristics, but larger saplings of both species had greater absolute height growth and lateral branch growth than did smaller saplings. Both Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine were able to survive up to 50 years and attain a height of 3 m at less than 5% PPFD. These results further suggest that shade tolerance is greater on drier sites, although the mechanisms for such increases in tolerance are unknown. The ecological implications of these findings are discussed in a forestry context.

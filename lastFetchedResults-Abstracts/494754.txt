BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Aggression is known as prevalent children's behavior problems. Storytelling is one of the methods used to decrease aggression. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of the two methods of storytelling (i.e., storytelling and storytelling with discussion) on decrease of aggression from parents point of view among a sample of boys aged 6-8 years old.

METHODS: Using a Quasi experimental design with pre-post test, 33 boys who had received scores 1 SD above the mean on Shahim's aggression questionnaire were randomly assigned into 2 experimental groups (storytelling^ 11 subjects and storytelling with discussion= 11 subjects) and control group (n=ll). Experimental groups participated on 11 sessions of storytelling and storytelling with discussion but control group received no interventions. After finishing the program and three months later physical, reactive and relational aggression was compared. FINDINGS: The post-treatment scores of the 3 subscales of reactive, rational and physical for storytelling group was 14.45±3.3, 13.55±2.1, 10.91±1.3, respectively; the post-treatment scores of the 3 subscales of reactive, rational and physical for storytelling and discussion group was 11.18±2.3, 10.18±1.7, 9.09±1.5, respectively. These results indicate that participants in storytelling and discussion significantly (p<0.05) scored lower than participants in storytelling group on the 3 subscales of reactive, rational and physical.

CONCLUSION: These results indicate that storytelling and discussion is an effective method in decrease of children's aggressive behavior and the method can be used in treatment of children suffer from aggressive behaviors.

Objectives With the increasing aging population, attention to their problems in society has found vast&nbsp;and new dimensions. The professional rehabilitation teams in day-care centers have aimed at providing&nbsp;services to the elderly to prevent their admission into residential boarding centers. To this end, the Welfare&nbsp;Organization has designed a special service package for the day-care centers. The main objective of&nbsp;this study was to compare the quality of life of older adults in a day center before and after receiving the&nbsp;rehabilitation module of the Welfare Organization.
Methods & Materials This is a descriptive-analytic study with 2 groups and pretest/posttest design. The&nbsp;study population consisted of all older adults referred to day-care centers for older adults. The study sample&nbsp;comprised 50 older adults in the Kahrizak Rehabilitation Center No.2, located in Mohammad Shahr&nbsp;Karaj, Iran in 2014-2015. They were selected through the convenient sampling method and by following&nbsp;the inclusion criteria. They were randomly allocated to the experimental and control groups with 25 older&nbsp;adults in each group. To observe the research ethics, the control group was put on the waiting list for&nbsp;receiving the services. The research instruments included SF-36 quality of life and demographic questionnaires.&nbsp;The SF-36 questionnaire was implemented before, 1 month, and 3 months after receiving the&nbsp;services in both groups. The data were analyzed using SPSS-20. Data analysis was performed using 1-way&nbsp;ANOVA with repeated measures.
Results In this study, the mean age of the control and experimental groups were 66.43 and 68.1 years, respectively.&nbsp;T-test showed that there was no significant difference between the control and experimental&nbsp;groups with regard to their ages (P=0.722). Furthermore, there were no significant differences between&nbsp;2 groups with regard to sex, education degrees, and history of hospitalization. The mean scores of quality&nbsp;of life in the intervention group at baseline, 1 month and 3 months after the study were 43.95, 56.30,&nbsp;and 74.38, respectively. The values for the same parameters in the control group were 44.74, 49.79, and&nbsp;57.82, respectively. The lowest score in the quality of life questionnaire was 24.72, and the highest was&nbsp;86.11. In addition, there was no significant difference between 2 groups with regard to mean scores of&nbsp;their quality of life at baseline (P=0.816); however, there were significant differences for 1 and 3 months&nbsp;after the study (respectively, P<0.001, P<0.015).
Conclusion The results showed that the day-care services significantly increased the quality of lives of&nbsp;older people. Therefore, it is hoped that these services can be used along with other conventional services&nbsp;as an effective method. Furthermore, the non-pharmaceutical interventional module can be used&nbsp;in promoting the quality of lives of older people. Rehabilitation services designed by the Welfare Organization&nbsp;for use in the day-care centers for older adults have a positive impact on the elders' quality of lives,&nbsp;and it can be considered as an efficient intervention in rehabilitating older adults.

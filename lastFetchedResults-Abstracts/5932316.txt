A new filter class for multichannel image processing is introduced and analyzed. The new technique of image enhancement is capable of reducing impulsive and Gaussian noise and it significantly outperforms the standard methods of noise reduction. In the paper, a smoothing operator, based on a random walk model and on a fuzzy similarity measure between pixels connected by a digital geodesic path, is introduced. The efficiency of the proposed method was tested on standard color images using objective image quality measures. Obtained results show that the new method not only outperforms standard noise reduction algorithms, but has some interesting features useful for segmentation of noisy color images

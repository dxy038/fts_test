The model-based radar target recognition requires the ability to simulate target signatures with adequate accuracy and computational speed. This paper proposes an entirely novel approach to utilizing readily available ray tracing software in the target characterization. The objective of the proposed approach is to give the target a compact description, from which arbitrary radar response can be simulated with efficiency. Certain essential computational aspects, such as ray density reduction and frequency-independency, are discussed. The simulated radar response is compared with a measurement, covering the case of a single frequency, high range resolution profiles, and inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

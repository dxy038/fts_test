An efficient and flexible algorithm is presented for finding a <e1>k</e1> shortest loopless path with distinct initial links from one node to each other node. Low-order polynomial bounds are established for the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm, showing it to offer a substantial improvement over applying known algorithms to the problem. The algorithm can incorporate various extensions, including the ability to handle an algebraic objective, which enhance its applicability to diverse network models. In addition, the <e1>k</e1> shortest path formulation and algorithm are proposed as a basis for network survivability measures where path length bounds exist

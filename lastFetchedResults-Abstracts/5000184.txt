Enhancement in total transfer capacity, Voltage stability and minimization of transmission line losses are treated as an interrelated, coupled composite problem. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is presented to mitigate this multi-objective and multi-criteria type composite problem. Simulation test is carried on the standard IEEE WSCC 3-Generator, 9-Bus system. The results indicate significant improvement in the three problems as well as economical justification is achieved through the application of the algorithm. The algorithm suggests using both SVC and TCSC at their optimal locations has significant impact in dealing the problem.

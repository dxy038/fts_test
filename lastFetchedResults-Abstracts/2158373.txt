Background and Objective: The belief that the effectiveness of patient care will improve through collaboration and teamwork within health care teams is providing a focus internationally for preparing health students through inter professional education. This study aimed to assess readiness of medical, nursing and radiology students of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences for interprofessional learning and examine its correlation with some demographic variables.
Materials and Methods:  This was a cross-sectional descriptive study in 2013-2014.Samples were recruited through convenience sampling method from of medical, nursing and radiology students of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Data were gathered through the Readiness for Inter Professional Learning Scale (RIPLS).
Results:  Three hundred and thirty students filled the questionnaires. Fifteen questionnaires were excluded due to lack of response to all questions. Finally 305 questionnaires were subjected to analysis. The mean score for nursing discipline was 72.19, for radiology was 72.84 and for medicine was 68.45. Also the standard deviation of students’ scores, respectively, was 36.9, 86.7 and 85.9. There was no significant relation between readiness for interprofessional readiness and contextual variables consisting of gender and discipline. There was no significant relation between interprofessional readiness of students in medicine and radiology and variables consisting of age, but it was significant for nursing students. 
Conclusion: Regarding the acceptability of (higher than mean score) students’ readiness, we suggest opportunities for development and expansion of interprofessional learning. Insignificant relationship between the students’ readiness and contextual variables implies the broad applicability of the interprofessional education. Nevertheless, future researches would be necessary to ensure applicability of this approach, and to explore factors influencing this process.

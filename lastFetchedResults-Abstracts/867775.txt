This paper introduces a new mathematical method for improving the discrimination power of data envelopment
analysis and to completely rank the efficient decision-making units (DMUs). Fuzzy concept is utilised.
For this purpose, first all DMUs are evaluated with the CCR model. Thereafter, the resulted weights
for each output are considered as fuzzy sets and are then converted to fuzzy numbers. The introduced
model is a multi-objective linear model, endpoints of which are the highest and lowest of the weighted
values. An added advantage of the model is its ability to handle the infeasibility situation sometimes
faced by previously introduced models.

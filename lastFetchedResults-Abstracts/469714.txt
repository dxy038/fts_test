Objective
This study was undertaken to develop a rabbit model of maternal exposure to Porphyromonas gingivalis and determine whether fetal or placental exposure occurs.
Study design
Subcutaneous steel chambers were implanted in 8 New Zealand White female rabbits. On day 7 of pregnancy, 4 rabbits were inoculated through the chamber with 5 Ã— 108 CFU/mL live P gingivalis, and 4 rabbits with broth (controls) and sacrificed at term. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect P gingivalis in maternal and fetal liver and placenta. Fisher exact test was used to compare P gingivalis detection between groups.
Results
Among exposed does, P gingivalis was detected in 33% of the maternal livers, 49% of placentas, and 34% fetal livers compared with none from controls (P< .001).
Conclusion
Chronic maternal exposure to P gingivalis results in systemic dissemination, transplacental passage, and fetal exposure. This model may be useful to study placental and fetal effects of this oral pathogen and to study microbial dissemination across the placenta.

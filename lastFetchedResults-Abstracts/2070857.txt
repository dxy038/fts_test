The objective of present papaer is assessing the
responses of alfalfa to lead and zinc when it is contributed
with mycorrhizal symbiosis in a precise condition, using
rhizobox system. Soil with low levels of Zn and Pb and soil
with high amounts of Zn and Pb have been considered as
media for mycorrhizal alfalfa. Mycorrhizal symbiois resulted
in 1.39 fold and 1.32 fold increases in the dry weight of roots
and shoots, respectively. Contrary to zinc, in all treatments
lead concentration in roots was more than shoots. It seems
that it is because of more mobility of zinc in comparison to
lead. Pollution and fungi inoculation and their interaction
significantly affected Pb concentration in roots. Zn and Pb
contamination and fungi inoculation and their interaction
had a significant effect on Zn concentration in roots
adjacency to rhizospheric soil and increased it to 104.87 ?g g-
1, although Zn concentration in other treatments of these
roots were 51.12, 30.87 and 29.37 ?g g-1 in polluted without
inoculatation, low amounts of metals, non- inoculated and
inoculared, respectively. Results showed that alfalfa can be
an eligible plant for accumulating Pb in their roots while
their shoots will be edible for animals. In highly
contaminated soils, alfalfa cannot be an important
accumulator for zinc, in addition zinc can transfer to shoots
and in toxic concentrations can enter animals and the human
food chain.

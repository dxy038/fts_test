In this paper, we describe a novel 3D shape retrieval method based on new features. The features are extracted for 3D points based on a 2D attribute space which consists of two bidirectional 3D shape attributes, one of which along the shape surface direction and the other along the shape content direction perpendicular to the former. We define this features as Point Bidirectional Features (PBFs), which can reflect not only the global shape but also the local content. For simplicity, we choose the geodesic distance (GD) and the shape diameter function (SDF) to construct PBFs. Given a database of 3D shapes and a query shape, the proposed retrieval method adopts a shape similarity measurement based on 3D points matching with PBFs to decide which is the most similar shape from the database. To reduce cost of computation and feature storage, a shape simplification algorithm is integrated into this method. Additionally, a simple but effective point correspondence mechanism with K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) assignment is designed for this retrieval method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed features and method.

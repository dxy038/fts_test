In this contribution, we describe an unified controller we implemented in order to simplify creating the common interactive behaviors that the robot may performs with human users. This controller is based on a multi-objective optimization technique allowing simultaneous achievement of different constraints and goals. The core of the developed algorithm is based on the particle swarm optimization technique (PSO). Through some examples, namely, a wheeled manipulator following human in populated and cluttered environments, and a humanoid robot reaching and tracking objects. we show how the PSO is effective in solving the given problems in flexible and generic ways. We detail in this paper the algorithm and give some results obtained from simulations and field trials.

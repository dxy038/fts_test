The objective of this work is to confirm the possibility of utilization of PolyVinyliDeneFlouride (PVDF) films in MEMS based microactuator for microjet applications. A membrane type microactuator is designed, developed, packaged and tested. The microactuator consists of PVDF film attached to thin Silicon diaphragm. As the voltage difference is applied across it, due to the piezoelectric behaviour, it deforms primarily in d<sub>31</sub> mode, which in turn deflects the diaphragm. Using finite element methods, coupled field analysis is carried out to optimize the dimensions of the actuator with respect to the output force and input voltage. A cavity with a square diaphragm of 1mm&#215;1mm&#215;5&#956;m is realized using standard microfabrication technique. 50&#956;m thick PVDF film, cut with special dicing saw, is glued inside the metalized cavity using low stress, conductive, room temperature cured epoxy. The 3mm&#215;3mm&#215;0.675mm actuator die is packaged using Chip-On-Board technique in conjunction with low temperature soldering for taking the connections. The micro-actuator is tested in both actuation and sensing mode. The developed actuator is proposed to use with micro nozzle to study the utilization in drug delivery system.

This study reports on experiences with EMC testing of strong active transmitters in a reverberation chamber (RC). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of disturbing or even destroying equipment under test in a reverberation chamber. For this reason several equipments with various frequency ranges, from 100 MHz up to 5 GHz, were integrated in an experimental system and IEC-61000-4-21 compliant EMC-tests were performed. This study showed that active transmitters have to be operated with care in a reverberation chamber and can even be destroyed when operated with nominal power.

This paper is a case study that describes a hybrid system integrating fuzzy logic, neural networks and algorithmic optimization for use in the ceramics industry. A prediction module estimates two quality metrics of slip-cast pieces through the simultaneous execution of two neural networks. A process improvement algorithm optimizes controllable process settings using the neural network prediction module in the objective function. An expert system module contains a hierarchy of two fuzzy logic rule bases. The rule bases prescribe processing times customized to individual production lines given ambient conditions, mold characteristics and the neural network predictions. This paper demonstrates the applicability of newer computational techniques to a very traditional manufacturing process and the system has been implemented at a major US plant.

Inroduction & Objective: This study attempts to evaluate the effect of using Choline supplement on free fatty acids changes and B-hydroxybutyrate of plasma and subsequently on fat metabolism during a prolonged exercise session in elite triathlete men. 
Materials and Methods: Nine elite triathlete men were chosen for this purpose and in a one blind, cross over design; they fulfilled two 120 min running exercise session on treadmill at intensity of 59-64 % Vo2max. One hour before first exercise, subjects were received placebo and one hour before second exercise they were received choline bitarate supplement. For measuring free fatty acids and B-hydroxybutyrate of plasma, sampling from subject's blood was done before and after each exercise and colorimetric method was used to measure these characteristics. For analyzing data, repeated-measures ANOVA was used in a meaningful level (p <  0.05).  
Results: The results from comparing two exercises shows that free fatty acid level of plasma at the end of exercise by using choline supplement was meaningfully lower than the analogous amount in exercise by placebo. On the other hand, amount of B-hydroxybutyrate at the end of exercise by using choline supplement was meaningfully more than the analogous amount in exercise by placebo. Findings show that using choline supplement increases free fatty acid uptake from plasma and increases B-hydroxybutyrate level of plasma at the end of exercise.
Conclusion: These changes can indicate the increase of fat oxidation in prolonged exercise session.

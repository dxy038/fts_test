The objective of the paper is to present a statistical approach to modelling dispersion and preferential concentration of inertial particles suspended in the turbulent fluid. This approach departs from kinetic equations for the one-point and two-point probability density functions of particle velocity distributions in turbulent Gaussian fluid flow fields. Preferential concentration of particles in sheared as well as in isotropic turbulent flows is analysed from a unified viewpoint, and an analogy between both phenomena is discussed.

Visible light communication (VLC) has been considered as a promising technique for broadband wireless access. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel high-speed LED based VLC local area network to provide beyond 10Gb/s optical wireless access for massive users based on star topology architecture. Fiber link is used as the bidirectional transmission backbone of the VLC network and directly connected to the LED lamps. Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is used for the downlink, while for the uplink, we respectively utilize FDM and time division multiplexing (TDM) as the uplink access schemes. A full-duplex VLC network for 4 users has been successfully demonstrated with the overall throughput of 4Gb/s. The measured bit error rates (BERs) of downlink and uplink for all the users are under 7% pre-forward error correction (FEC) limit of 3.8&#215;10<sup>-3</sup> over 25km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) and 65cm free space, clearly validating the promising potential of the proposed VLC network architecture for future 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s wireless access.

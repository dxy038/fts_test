The polyurethane material is the main component of the new material polyurethane–cement composites (PUC) as a new material can be used for different structural purposes. The objective of this research was to explore the fundamental mechanical properties of the new material (PUC). The utilization of PUC material is a repairing material such as strengthening old bridge. Experimental tests were performed to evaluate the properties of PUC composite such as compressive strength, flexural bending tensile strength, stress–strain relationship, and bonding strength and compared with those of conventional concrete. Compressive strength, bending tensile strength and bonding strength after 28 days curing age showing highly improvement and excellent bonding and adhesive property with concrete. The PUC material considered as light weight material with highly strength due to less density comparing with normal concrete. The increment values of compressive strength was from 5 MPa to 60 MPa of PUC with density 400 kg/m3 density and 1650 kg/m3 respectively, while the flexural tensile strength was increased from 3.3 MPa to 44.3 MPa of PUC with 400 kg/m3 and 1650 kg/m3 density respectively indicating highly improvement in compressive and bending tensile strength compare with conventional concrete. To simulate behaviors of the PUC material, theoretical analysis, finite element analysis was performed on the prism models. The FEM package Abaqus/standard version v6.10 was used in this research, and the results showing good agreement

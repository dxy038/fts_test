The algorithm of a real time application focused to limit the active power of wind farms in the region of the Istmo de Tehuantepec, Oaxaca Mexico, is reported in this paper. This application has two main objectives. The first, the active power limitation of the wind farms providing a constraint due to specific network topologies preventing the primary equipment not operate overloaded and ensure the power system integrity. The second objective is that the wind farms contribute to frequency regulation in coordination with the AGC (Automatic Generation Control) in secondary and tertiary regulation. A steady state and a time domain analysis are developed to evaluate the algorithm behavior.

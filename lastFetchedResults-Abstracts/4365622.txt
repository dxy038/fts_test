We consider the rate control problem with the objective of maximizing the total user utility. It takes into account the possible differences in user requirements, and also provides a framework for achieving a wide range of fairness objectives. We propose a simple algorithm for achieving the optimal rates for this problem. The algorithm can be implemented in a distributed way and does not require the network to know the user utility functions. In our algorithm, the network communicates to the user the number of congested links on the userÂ´s path, and the user (end-host) adjusts its rate accordingly, taking into account its utility function and the network congestion feedback. We show through analysis and experimentation that our algorithm converges to the optimum rates

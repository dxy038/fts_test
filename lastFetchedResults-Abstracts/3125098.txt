The self-similarity of complex networks has broad practical backgrounds, yet the self-similarity of network has been rarely studied. One of the problems is to explore the origination of self-similarity in real networks. For this purpose, we proposed the information transfer model in network. The volume dimension integrating the information transfer model is given to analysis the self-similarity of complex networks. But the volume dimension measured the self-similarity of network has some shortage, hence, the information dimension also is given to summarize the self-similarity. The two methods statistics the self-similarity of complex network using the box counting. However, the information dimension has some certain objective in measured self-similar compared to the volume dimension.

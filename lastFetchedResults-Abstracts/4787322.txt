We present the tests results of the first phase of a multi-phase study to combat deteriorating adolescent fitness, reflected in the growth in adolescent obesity rates, by creating a fitness game deployed on mobile devices. The objective of this first phase was to test an initial mobile fitness prototype´s efficacy in generating positive attitudinal changes towards fitness activity using strong socialization components within the game. The basic premise being that game play with a strong social aspect is an attractive support mechanism for sustained interest and providing positive reinforcement to users within our fitness application. Such sustained interest and positive reinforcement is vital for producing long-term fitness improvements. Our mobile fitness game prototype included 13 exercises with functionality to socialize with friends regarding exercise progress and collaboration. A subject pool of 12 adolescents aged 15 to 17 used the prototype for a six week period. Results indicate that the application´s socialization features were able to improve subjects´ views on fitness activities. Increasing online social networking tendency correlated with improving views on the fitness exercises that were most often engaged in with the application.

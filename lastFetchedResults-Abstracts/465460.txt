Objective: The goal was to study the effects on uterine contractility, blood pressure, and heart rate of thyrotropin-releasing hormone given antenatally in combination with glucocorticoids to accelerate fetal maturation. Study design: A placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed involving 30 women whose pregnancies were followed up at the University Hospital Gasthuisberg in 1994 and 1995. Results: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone induced a significant mean increase of nearly 6 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and approximately 5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure. The duration of this raise was <20 minutes. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone had no significant effect on maternal heart rate or uterine contractility: 4.2 ± 1.6 contractions per hour before versus 4.7 ± 1.7 contractions per hour after treatment. Conclusions: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone induces a small (mean <6 mm Hg) and brief mean (<20 minutes) increase in blood pressure but appears to have no clinically detectable effect on uterine contractility.

Objectives. To determine the prevalence of systemic venous collaterals after the bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis and the factors associated with their development.

Background. Systemic venous collaterals have been found after cavopulmonary anastomosis.

Methods. Cardiac catheterization was performed in 103 patients before and after  bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis.

Results. After surgery, 51 venous collaterals were identified in 32 patients (31%). Collateral development was associated with an abnormal superior ven caval connection (56% incidence vs. 26% with  single right superior ven cava, p = 0.01) and postoperative factors including pulmonary artery distortion (53% incidence vs. 22% without distortion, p = 0.002); increased superior ven caval mean pressure (14 ± 5 mm Hg versus 11 ± 4 mm Hg with no collaterals, p = 0.0002); increased pulmonary artery mean pressure (13 ± 4 mm Hg vs. 11 ± 4 mm Hg with no collaterals, p = 0.02); lower right atrial mean pressure (5 ± 2 mm Hg vs. 6 ± 3 mm Hg with no collaterals, p = 0.04); and increased mean gradient between superior ven cav and right atrium (8 ± 3 mm Hg vs. 5 ± 4 mm Hg with no collaterals, p = 0.0002). Using multiple logistic regression, only this last factor was independently associated with collateral development with an odds ratio per 1 mm Hg of 1.33 (95% CI 1.12–1.58, p = 0.001) for their presence.

Conclusions. Systemic venous collaterals occur frequently after  bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis and are found postoperatively when  significant pressure gradient occurs between cav and right atrium.

The objective of YushanNet is to provide a reliable and robust system for hiker tracking in Yushan National Park, Taiwan. The aggregated information can help national parks to provide various services to tourists, and the collected hiking traces can provide more precise information to professional rescue teams if there are hikers lost in the mountains. YushanNet is a delay and disruption tolerant system. In the system, each hiker is required to carry a matchbox-size device, which consists of a ZigBee-based mote and a GPS receiver, and the device records its hiking trace, along with encounter information with other devices. Then, the recorded data is disseminated in the network in a store-carry-and-forward fashion, until it reaches one of the base stations along the trail. In this demo, we will present the design, implementation, and deployment of the YushanNet system, and we will demonstrate the system using a small-scale network scenario.

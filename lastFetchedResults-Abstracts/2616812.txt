The objective of This study was to evaluate the effect of different levels of tape
irrigation and bush density on water use efficiency in corn (zea maize) with one and two
row caltivation methods , The study was conducted on the research farm of seed and
plant improvement research institute in Karaj during 1 year. The experimental design
was Randomized Complete Block in a Strip Spilt Plot design with 3 replications and 24
treatments.The treatment were 4 irrigation levels (50%،75%،100% and125% ET) and 3 bush
density( 65000،75000 and 85000) in 2 rows. The results showed that the highest grain
yield (13920 kg/ha) produced by using125% ET and the lowest grain yield (435 kg/ha)
obtained by treatments 50% ET.The treatment 85000 plants/ha and 125%ET with 2 rows
had the highest water use efficiency (WUE). Ky factor ranged 1,25 to 1,6. there was no
significant difference between the most of the tested parameters with row cultivation
and bush density treatments.

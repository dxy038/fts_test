The objective of paper is to propose a design technique with a new economic dispatch analysis. This analysis used the combined hierarchical approach and nonlinear programming. There are three different energy sources which can be used to feed a remote area in the Egypt desert: wind source, PV and diesel engine. The two subsources are considered here as: batteries and water basin. The load demand is to feed the suitable electric energy for this area model for irrigation and domestic services. The optimization problem is composed of multiobjective functions system. By using the developed technique, we can transform the complicated stochastic system into a simple deterministic one, The method also gives greater flexibility in the selection of constraints

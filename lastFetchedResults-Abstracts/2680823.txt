                                                                            Given the importance of natural childbirth and emphasis on the normal vaginal delivery, and since important causes of having a C-section are lack of response to induction of labor with SyntocinonÂ® injection and the fact that the cervix is unfavorable for labor.
                                                                                                        Objective
                                                                            The present study aims at achieving the best method of cervical ripening for pregnancy termination to reduce the C-section rate, labor duration, economic burden, and labor pain.

                                                                            In this regard, the current study examined the effect of hyoscine-N-butylbromide (HBB) on the progression of cervical ripening in normal vaginal delivery. In the current prospective double-blind controlled clinical trial, 60 pregnant females referred to Valiasr hospital (with the mean age of 27.2 years) were randomly divided into 2 groups of experimental and control; HBB and normal saline (placebo) were intravenously administered in the active phase of labor.
                                                                                                        Results
                                                                            The pain reduction in the patients, the duration of drug action until the cervical dilatation, the number of drug use for the full cervical dilatation, the time of the onset of the first, second, and third stages of labor, the length of hospitalization until the delivery, the drug effect on the fetus and mother, and the delivery method were evaluated in both groups. HBB significantly reduced the duration of the first stage of labor; however, it did not affect the second and third stages. Moreover, no negative effects were observed on the mother and fetus health.
                                                                                                        Conclusion
                                                                            According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that the intravenous injection of HBB can be applied as an effective drug for labor progress; however, further clinical studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm these findings.

For a wireless local area network (WLAN), we propose an algorithm based on power management of access points (APs) to improve load distribution and provide an improved channel assignment. We formulate an algorithm that adjusts the transmitted power of the beacon packets of the most congested access point (MCAP). The transmitted power of the data packets is not altered thus avoiding auto-rating. The algorithm then determines a user assignment that distributes the load efficiently. Finally, we apply a channel assignment algorithm to each AP with the objective of minimizing the total interference over the WLAN. Results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of significantly reducing the congestion at the MCAPs, providing better load distribution, and enhancing channel assignment.

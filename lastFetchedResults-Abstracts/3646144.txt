The authors feel the term "electronic power converter" needs some definition. The object may be to convert power from direct current to alternating current for direct current (dc) power transmission, or to convert power from one frequency into another,or to serve as a commutator for operating an ac motor at variable speed,or for transforming high-voltage dc into low-voltage dc. It is thus evidently not the objective but the means that characterizes the electronic power converter. The emphasis is on electronic means and the term is limited to conversion of power as distinguished from electric energy for purposes of communication. Thus, the name is a definition. The authors provide a istory and evolution of the electronic converter, its use in the suppression of electronic faults and in the single-conversion frequency changer. Finally a description is given of the dc transformer and the adaptability of the electronic converter.

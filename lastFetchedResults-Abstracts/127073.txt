History and Objectives:
Ascites is defined as fluid accumulation in peritoneal spaceand is one of the critical symptoms for background disorders. Considering its causative factors and lack of information in this respect, this study was performed on hospitalized patients admitted to Shaheed Beheshti hospital during the years 1993-2000.
Materials and Methods:
This study was conducted on existing data of patients with ascites. For this purpose, their medical records were extracted and studied. Then, the characteristics including age, gender, diagnosis, ascites/serum albumin gradient and protein concentration were determined and recorded.
Results:
A total of 17 cases out of 117 patients were excluded from the study because of death prior to diagnosis, early leave, and absence of coordination for paracentesis. The studied patients had an average age of 55.8 Â± 18.4. ,noitidda n144% of them were female and 56% of them were male and most of them had an age greater than 60 years. The major causative factors included cirrhosis (66% in total, 80.4% for males and 47.7% for females), malignancy (20%), heart failure (9%), tuberculosis (1%), and mixed factors (4%). Furthermore, in 36 out of cases with ascites as a result of cirrhosis (97.1%), the albumin gradient was greater than 1.1. This value was 100% in patients with ascites due to cardiac disorders and its sensitivity was 92.8%.
Conclusion:
It is concluded that the most common cause of ascites is hepatic cirrhosis and it is recommended to evaluate cirrhosis and determine albumin gradient for diagnostic goals.

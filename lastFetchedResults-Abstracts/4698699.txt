We can resolve the emergency logistics scheduling problems in two steps. Firstly, determining the shortest path between the save point and the disaster point. Secondly, choosing the optimal transportation solution from the save point to the disaster point. By these two steps, the model based on dynamic optimization of the shortest path method and model based on multi-objective emergency linear programming of multi-rescue could be established. Then, the validity and reference of the models could be sufficiently proved by getting the estimating solution simply, fast and accurately by the inverse method and simplex method respectively, or by using the LINGO, and listing examples.

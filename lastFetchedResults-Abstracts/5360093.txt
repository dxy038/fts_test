The PWM converter which provides a suitable excitation current for the generator is one of the key components of double fed wind power generation system. This paper takes the rotor-side converter in double fed wind power generation system as the research object. The control objective of the grid-side converter is analyzed in this paper. Based on the control objective, the key issues of realizing the control objectives are discussed in this paper. Then a new DSP-based implementation method of the rotor-side converter is proposed. The mt-coordinates mathematical model of rotor-side converter is established in this paper. Based on the mathematical model and the control objective, control strategy for rotor side PWM converter is proposed, including voltage control strategy pre-grid and PQ decoupling control strategy in grid-connected operation mode. At last, the control strategy is realizing by DSP. Simulation platform for 11 kw double feed wind power generation system is built for experimental research on the rotor-side converter. Experimental result has fully proved the validity of control strategies and satisfactory control performance has been achieved. Experimental waveforms are given in the paper.

This paper outlines the three year Electronics Engineering Technology program at Mohawk College of Applied Arts and Technology in Hamilton, Ont., Canada. It can be assumed that it represents Electronics Engineering Technology programs across Canada as other Provinces have similar programs. The objective is to provide enough detail about the program to allow a comparison of the Canadian approach with approaches taken in other countries. A description of the difference between the graduate engineer and graduate technologist is included to orient the reader. Placement examples of the three year technologist further assist in clarifying the capabilities of the graduate technologist. In summary the paper illustrates how a three year technologist is used in Canadian industry.

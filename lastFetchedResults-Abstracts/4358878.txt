The problem of textile quality control is addressed. The basic objective is to detect faults in woven fabrics. A set of statistical modules is implemented and integrated to detect the faulty textiles. The modules are divided into preprocessing modules (normalization, and median filtering) and processing modules (smoothing, and variance). The algorithms are experimented with a set of images of fault free and faulty textiles and output results are analyzed

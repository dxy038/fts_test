Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the production of 2 types of heat shock protein 70 in the organs of neonatal rats during an episode of mild hypoxic stress that was insufficient to produce histologic changes. Study Design: Seven-day-old rats were subjected to hypoxia (inspired gas of 8% oxygen and 92% nitrogen) at 33Â°C for 2 hours (n = 5), 3 hours (n = 5), and 4 hours (n = 5). Control rats (n = 5) inspired room air for 4 hours. The brains, hearts, and livers were removed after 4 hours of recovery. The levels of heat shock protein 70 and heat shock cognate protein 70 messenger ribonucleic acid were measured by Northern blot analysis. Arterial pH, Pao2 , PACO2 , and brain temperature were measured before, during, and at 4 hours of hypoxia in another 16 animals. Histologic examinations were carried out in these 16 animals 7 days after hypoxic stress. Results: PaO2 , PACO2 , and brain temperature decreased during the hypoxic stress and returned to prehypoxic values at recovery time. Arterial pH did not change. No histologic changes were observed in any areas of the brain. Heat shock cognate protein 70 messenger ribonucleic acid was normally expressed in the brain, heart, and liver and was further induced after hypoxia in the brain and the heart. There was, however, no additional increase of heat shock cognate protein 70 messenger ribonucleic acid in the liver. there were no increments of the stress-induced form of heat shock protein 70 messenger ribonucleic acid in these organs. Conclusion: Mild hypoxia selectively induced messenger ribonucleic acid of heat shock cognate protein 70, which may play an important role in protecting the brain and the heart against stress.

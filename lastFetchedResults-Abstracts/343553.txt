We hypothesized that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) enhances tryptophan (TRP) flux through the kynurenine (KYN) pathway because oxygen is a substrate for four pathway enzymes. Our objective was to compare the biosynthesis of KYN pathway intermediates by rat brain and liver slices with air or HBO as the gas phase. One-millimeter thick liver and brain slices were obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats and incubated individually in chambers containing Hanks’-HEPES- buffer with 3H-TRP (30 Ci/mmol) for 2 h (37°C) in either room air or oxygen (1.2 or 5.2 atmospheres absolute [ATA] oxygen). After incubation, tissue was snap-frozen and analyzed for protein content while medium was extracted for high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Radiolabeled nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was produced by brain and liver; liver (with air as the gas phase) also produced quinolinic acid (QA). HBO at 1.2 and 5.2 ATA caused increased QA and NAD from liver slices. HBO did not affect KYN metabolism in brain slices, although there was decreased production of NAD during high oxygen. We conclude that rat brain and liver contain the complete KYN pathway and that HBO enhances KYN flux in liver tissue.

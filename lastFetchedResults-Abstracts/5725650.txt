This paper will focus on the application of a breakthrough in telemedicine as applied to real time, bidirectional audio, video and data communication in mobile emergency situations. This is facilitated by a new head-mounted mobile computing system, scheduled for 2012 release by Motorola, and a complimentary software suite developed by IPS combined with multi-modalities for provisioning the communication channels. This system has the potential of bringing great value in addressing a long-standing industry goal: augmenting the capabilities of EMTs in the field with real time access to remote experts (doctors in trauma centers and emergency rooms), in a manner that conforms to all the requirements of this most demanding environment. IPS will discuss the unique challenges of this application in detail (centered around the two-way, real-time audio and video sharing of rich content and communications while not intruding on the delivery of critical patient care), how IPS plans to address them, and the many technology, communications, and human factors innovations made along the way as well as opportunities for future technology extensions. IPS believes that these will have the potential to transform not just this particular application area, but many others in health care and beyond.

In many practical cases for active noise control (ANC), the online secondary path modeling methods that use auxiliary noise are often applied. However, the auxiliary noise contributes to residual noise, and thus deteriorates the noise control performance of ANC systems. Moreover, a sudden and large change in the secondary path leads to easy divergence of the existing online secondary path modeling methods. To mitigate these problems, this paper proposes a new online secondary path modeling method with auxiliary noise power scheduling and adaptive filter norm manipulation. The auxiliary noise power is scheduled based on the convergence status of an ANC system with consideration of the variation of the primary noise. The purpose is to alleviate the increment of the residual noise due to the auxiliary noise. In addition, the norm manipulation is applied to adaptive filters in the ANC system. The objective is to avoid over-updates of adaptive filters due to the sudden large change in the secondary path and thus prevent the ANC system from diverging. Computer simulations show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

We present a review of several column generation formulations for the Routing and Wavelength Assignment (rwa) problem with the objective of minimizing the blocking rate. Several improvements are proposed, together with a comparison of the different formulations with respect to the quality of their continuous relaxation bounds and their computing solution ease. Experimental results are presented on several classical network and traffic instances.

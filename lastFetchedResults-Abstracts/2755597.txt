By properly designing the magnetic fields on top of the target surface, more target atoms can be sputtered and smoother depositions onto the substrate surface can be achieved of a dc magnetron sputter (MS). Based on detailed 3-D field information and appropriate emulation process, the argon ion bombardments to the target surface and collisions to those sputtered target atoms can then be thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, from TaguchiÂ´s method and feasible structural compositions, the optimization objective of designing adequate refinement parts for dc MS can be conveniently achieved. From the experimental measurements, by both the thickness gauge and atomic force microscopy, the enhanced performances of the existing dc MS systems can then be confirmed.

This paper presents two new time-frequency distributions based on kernels with compact support (KCS) namely the separable CB (SCB) and the polynomial CB (PCB) TFDs. The implementation of these distributions follows the method developed for the Cheriet-Belouchrani CB TFD. The performance of this family of TFDs is compared to the most known quadratic distributions through tests on multi-component signals with linear and nonlinear frequency modulations (FMs) considering the noise effects as well. Comparisons are based on the evaluation of an objective criterion namely the Boashash-SucicÂ´s normalized instantaneous resolution performance measure that allows to provide the optimized TFD using a specific methodology. In all presented examples, the KCS TFDs have been shown to have a significant interference mitigation, with the component energy concentration around their respective instantaneous frequency laws being well preserved giving high resolution measure values.

Redundancy is the key notion to bring robustness in the highly dynamic environment of the ad hoc network. Traditionally, the reactive MANET routing protocol brings repair process after a route failure, on the contrary, the multipath routing protocol proposes redundancy on a prefailure scheme so that repair of a route is done by on-the fly replacement. Another way to improve the communication resiliency is the multi-homing mechanism managed by the transport level. It is a network access redundancy that establishes multiple network accesses for a same communication. The objective of the paper is to formally prove that the integration of multihoming and multipath improves the communication reliability. At the first, we precise the ad hoc network dependability framework, and analyze the way to integrate the two levels of redundancy, at the second we evaluate the gain in communication reliability.

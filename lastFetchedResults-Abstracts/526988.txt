This study was conducted in the Cukurova University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Field Crops in between 1993 and 2003 in Turkey. The objective of this research was to breed high yielding whitefly (Bemesia tabaci Genn.) resistant soybean cultivar. Soybean cultivar S.4240 and Williams was crossed in 1993. Individual plant selection was made according to single-seed descent selection method in the segregating materials. The F2 seeds were planted and one random F3 seed (pod) was taken from each F2 plant. This process was repeated until the plants were considered sufficiently true-breeding F5 generation. All the F5 seeds were planted as a second crop and 200 individual plants were selected among the F5 plants according to breeding objectives at the harvesting time in 1998. The selected seeds plants were planted in separate rows in 1999 and 2000. Nine rows (lines) were selected according to breeding objectives at the end of 2000 growing season. The replicated yield test was repeated in 2001 (with 9 soybean lines), 2002 (with 7 soybean lines) and 2003 (with 7 soybean lines) seasons with selected soybean lines under double cropping conditions. At the end of 2003 growing season, three breeding lines (SW-3, SW-7 and SW-11) were determined as cultivar candidates.

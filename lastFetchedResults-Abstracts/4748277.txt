This work presents an adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer to an ultra wide band (UWB) radiofrequency physical layer developed at the CSEM in the framework of a European project called URSafe (stands for "Universal Remote Signal Acquisition For Health"). A hardware demonstrator based on a low power technology has been realized for supporting different test applications, the final objective being to realize a body-worn wireless personal area networks (WPAN) for telemedicine applications.

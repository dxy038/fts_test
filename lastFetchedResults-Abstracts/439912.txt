Background. Classically, most complications observed after operations for aspergilloma occurred in patients with sequelae of tuberculosis. Because the incidence of tuberculosis has declined over the past two decades, aspergilloma is expected to develop with increasing frequency in patients without previous tuberculosis. Therefore, our hypothesis was that operative outcome should have improved during the most recent years in comparison with our previous experience.

Methods. Operative outcome of 12 recently accrued patients was evaluated and compared with a historic control group of 55 patients, previously reported by the same center.

Results. As expected, only 17% of patients of the present series had a history of tuberculosis, compared with 57% in the former series. Postoperatively, there was no mortality. Major morbidity has decreased, although this difference is not statistically significant: bleeding decreased from 44% to 9% of patients; space problems decreased from 47% to 18%; and prolonged hospital stay (>30 days) decreased from 32% to 9%.

Conclusions. Our results support a trend toward improved postoperative outcome of operations for aspergilloma owing to a decreased incidence of aspergilloma growing in tuberculous cavitations.

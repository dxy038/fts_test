The objective of the MONARC project is to identify baseline computing models that could provide viable solutions meeting the data analysis needs of the LHC experiments. A powerful and flexible set of simulation tools has been developed to model the performance of distributed computing resources for a set of reconstruction and analysis tasks. In this paper we report the validation of the simulation tools using the testbed environments with Objectivity/DB over LAN and WAN connections. A simple and effective way to parameterize and evaluate the concurrent database access over network has been established.

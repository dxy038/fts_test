Taking customer water quality and electricity consumption of pumping station as objective function, a direct optimal operation model of water supply network was established and solved by using particle swarm algorithm in this paper, then the model determined the optimal running scheme of network when satisfying hydraulic constraints and boundary condition. Comparing the optimal operation model with experience operation, the result showed that the optimal operation model was much better, and particle swarm optimization was feasible to solve the problem in optimal operation of water supply network.

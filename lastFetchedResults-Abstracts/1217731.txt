Background and Objective: Patients with risk of myocardial infarction (MI) has prodromal signs like chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue or restlessness, tachycardia, syncope, and other informal signs. Recognizing the patients with prodromal signs is necessary, but determined rarely. Early diagnosis is important for emergency intervention and treatment results. This study was a descriptive-analytical study to determine the prodromal symptoms in patients with MI in cardiac care unit (CCU) of Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib hospital in 2012 in Rafsanjan, Iran.
Materials and Method: The subjects included 175 patients with acute myocardial infarction and selected in simple manner. For data collection (from July 2012 to February 2013) questionnaire was used, which included demographic data, risk factors for heart disease, and prodromal symptoms. For data analysism descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency distribution and percentage) and chi-square test and Pearson coefficient were used.  
Results: According to the results, the majority of patients were males (76.6%) and middle-aged (53.1). Of 175 study subjects, 132 (75.4%) had warning sign two weeks before the cardiac event and 43 (24.6%) were without symptoms. The most common cardiac signs were chest, epigastria, and hand pain, in gastric signs loss of appetite, vomiting, in respiratory signs, dyspnea and in systemic signs exhaustion, decrease of daily activity and perspiration. There was no significant difference between the demographic variables and prodromal symptoms (P  >  0.05).
Conclusion: The majority patients in the days before a heart attack have warning symptoms; most of them did not pay attention to the signs and did not refer to medical centers. Those who had warning signs, after acute myocardial infarction symptoms, were admitted to the hospital later. So increasing population knowledge via mass media is recommended.

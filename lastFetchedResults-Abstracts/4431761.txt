Channel allocation schemes in a mobile computing (wireless) environment can be either static or dynamic. Static allocation offers negligible channel acquisition time and zero message complexity and works well at a low system load; the performance steadily decreases as system load increases since many calls are dropped; in case of even temporary hot spots many calls may be dropped by a heavily loaded switching station even when there are enough idle channels in the interference region of that station. On the other hand, dynamic schemes provide better utilization of the channels at higher loads albeit at the cost of higher channel acquisition time and some additional control messages. Our purpose is to propose a combined channel allocation scheme that each switching station can tune to its own load independent of other stations in its interference region; the objective is to minimize the call drop rate and at the same time maintain a minimum average channel acquisition time and minimum control message complexity

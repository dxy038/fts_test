Objective
We tested a rubber ring catheter (the Jacobi ring) in the treatment of Bartholin's abscesses and compared it with the Word catheter in a controlled trial.
Methods
Emergency department patients presenting with Bartholin's abscesses who consented to participate were randomized to treatment with either the ring catheter or a Word catheter. Physicians rated the ease of placement at the initial visit. Patients returned for follow-up at 3 weeks, when the catheters were removed, and were asked to indicate their satisfaction with the device. The recurrence rate at 6 months was determined by telephone follow-up. The primary outcome was successful placement of the catheter and resolution of the abscess. Secondary outcomes included ease of insertion, patient satisfaction, and recurrence at 6 months.
Results
A total of 38 patients enrolled in the study, 25 were randomized to the ring catheter and 13 to the Word catheter. All patients had successful placement of the catheter and resolution of the abscess. No patient had a recurrence at 6 months. Ease of insertion was similar for the 2 devices. Patient satisfaction was higher in patients treated with the ring catheter.
Conclusion
The Jacobi ring is effective in treating Bartholin's abscess and may be better tolerated than the Word catheter.

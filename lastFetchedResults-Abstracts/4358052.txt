In recent years, Grid Computing has become a key technology in resource integration and sharing, thus improving scientific collaboration among different institutions. While some applications need access databases spread across the participants of the grid, OGSA-DAI is middleware that enables database integration and sharing from different vendors.By using replication techniques, this work aims to provide a higher level of availability and reliability when using databases exposed to the grid. It defines an architecture for systems that want to offer replication to the grid and we implemented extensions to the OGSA-DAI middleware in order to achieve this objective and prove the concepts of the proposed architecture. This paper presents the results obtained in the implementation and an initial study of its application in a Health Care Information System.

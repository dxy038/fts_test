This paper proposes a dynamic analysis approach developed for the verification of avionics software. The objective is to formally verify temporal properties on execution traces. The approach consists of three steps: computation of the necessary observation points in the program using static analysis, execution of the program and generation of the execution trace, verification of the temporal property on the trace. The approach has been implemented in a tool.

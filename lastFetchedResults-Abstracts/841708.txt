Sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence and global exponential stability of a unique equilibrium of a class of two-layer heteroassociative networks called bidirectional associative memory (BAM) networks with Lipschitzian activation functions without assuming their boundedness, monotonicity or differentiability and subjected to impulsive state displacements at fixed instants of time. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

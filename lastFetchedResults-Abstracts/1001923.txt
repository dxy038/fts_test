The current study aims to investigate the effect of market orientation and internal
marketing on job satisfaction based on the structural equations model in the
Kermanshah food and pharmaceutical distribution enterprises. The study method is
applied in terms of objective, and consisting of a descriptive and correlative type in
terms of data collection, and also the study is based on the structural equations
model using Amos software. The statistical community is composed of marketers
and marketing supervisors in food and pharmaceutical distribution enterprises which
the volume of its sample is 280. The sampling method is stratified random sample
with the sample size of 165. To gather data, Narver & Slater (1990), Donavana &
Hocutt (2001) questionnaire was used which its nominal and content validity was
confirmed by 5 university professors. Also, the overall validity of the questionnaire
is 0.821. The findings indicate that correlation coefficient between market
orientation and job satisfaction is 0.526, and also the regression coefficient between
market orientation and job satisfaction in the final model is 0.81, and the regression
coefficient between internal market orientation and job satisfaction in the final model is 0.6. In the model studied, the
values of fitting indices (NFI=0.909 and CFI=0.916) show the suitability of the model.

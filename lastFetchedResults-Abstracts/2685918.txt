The study presents a non-isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter, which has simple circuit structure. The control strategy is easily implemented. Also, the synchronous rectifier technique is used to reduce the losses. The voltage gain of the proposed converter is the half and the double of the conventional bidirectional DC-DC buck/boost converter in the step-down and step-up modes, respectively. Therefore the proposed converter can be operated in wide-voltage-conversion range than the conventional bidirectional converter. The voltage stresses on the switches of the proposed converter are a half of the high-voltage side. In addition, the operating principle and steady-state analyses are discussed. Finally, a prototype circuit is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed converter.

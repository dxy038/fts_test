Diabetes and periodontitis are common chronic diseases in the world, and abundant epidemiological evidence implies a bidirectional relationship between the two diseases. It appears that diabetes is a risk factor for greater periodontal destruction, whereas managing periodontitis can also contribute to better glycemic control. The underlying regulatory mechanisms are also bidirectional. The hyperglycemic status may directly alter subgingival microbial compositions, impair cellular function, and change collagen metabolism. The formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) can further modify the extracellular matrix, and establishment of cellular receptor binding can amplify inflammation. Moreover, periodontitis also induces hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance. This cyclical relationship converges via overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. Thus, this article highlights the importance of maintaining periodontal health to eliminate systemic complications and meticulous metabolic control to prevent further periodontal destruction. From a systemic aspect, targeting proinflammatory cytokines or receptors of AGEs could be a potential modality for treating periodontitis.

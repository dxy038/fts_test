Objective: Determine the Association between Nursing and Midwifery Students’ Learning Styles and their Academic Achievements, Based on Kolb's Model
Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 176 nursing and midwifery students in Shahid  Beheshti School of Nursing and Midwifery, were selected by census and completing  standard questionnaire of Kolb's Learning Styles .The average grade of all students was considered as indicators of their Educational progress. We used K2 test, t- test and Pearson's correlation to assess determining power of changeable variables of learning in Educational progress.
Results: The average of learning style indicates that priorities of learning style in all students were convergent (35.5±6.7) and assimilator (35.2±6.5). There wasn’t a significant difference between two groups of students. The average grade of nursing students was(15.46±1.6)and midwifery students was(14.81±6.1).There wasn’t a significant difference between learning styles and Educational progress of respective students.
Conclusion: Since the majority of students had convergent and assimilator learning styles, it is recommended to apply Learning Environments proportionate to these styles such as emphasis on practical application of the topics  and encouraging students to pursue problems analysis in their leaning habits.

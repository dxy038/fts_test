Advanced nuclear power plant (NPP) concepts and technologies are currently under development rapidly, which make the traditional probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) framework appears some inapplicabilities. The objective of this paper is to illuminate this problem and seek redress. The discussion begins with traditional LWR NPP&#194;&#191;s PRA framework, and then points out its cause of formation and limitations. Secondly, a new integral PRA framework is suggested based on the safety characteristics of the advanced NPP. Finally, a case study shows the structure of the renewal PRA framework.

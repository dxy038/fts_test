Alternative configurations based on cryogenic extractive distillation were proposed and simulated by using Aspen Plus 7.0® coupled to a multi-objective stochastic optimization procedure (differential evolution, DE). The evaluation of the performances of the proposed configurations was focused on the ethane–carbon dioxide azeotrope separation considering different liquefied hydrocarbon fractions as entrainers. The design alternatives were compared to the conventional chemical absorption system.

oposed sequences were simultaneously Pareto optimized by minimizing the total annual cost (TAC) and maximizing the acid gas removal. Complementary studies regarding the theoretical control properties, the thermodynamic efficiency and the greenhouse gases generation were conducted for several representative operating conditions obtained from the Pareto optimized fronts. The proposed cryogenic extractive distillation sequences realized the higher carbon dioxide removal together with the lower TAC compared to the conventional chemical absorption system.

Objective
ument values, attitudes, and beliefs that influence behavior change among a diverse group of patients post-angioplasty.
s
ive and maximum-variation sampling were used to assemble a demographically diverse patient cohort (N = 61) who had been successful or unsuccessful at post-angioplasty multibehavior change. Semistructured interviews and grounded theory methods were used to collect and analyze qualitative data.
s
 showed the following: a) Patients reported surviving a life-threatening event and feared disease recurrence and death; b) the perception of a turning point and self-determination facilitated behavior change; c) social support and spiritual beliefs promoted coping with the uncertainty of living with heart disease; and d) unsuccessful behavior change was related to physical limitations, a sense that “nothing helps,” and the belief that angioplasty “cures” heart disease.
sion
yle interventions should be culturally relevant and adapted to physical abilities. Fostering self-determination and social support may promote successful behavior change.

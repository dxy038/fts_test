Distributed Space Missions (DSMs) are gaining momentum in their application to earth science missions owing to their unique ability to increase observation sampling in spatial, spectral and temporal dimensions simultaneously. This paper identifies a gap in the angular sampling abilities of traditional monolithic spacecraft and proposes to address it using small satellite clusters in formation flight. The science performance metric for the angular dimension is explored using the Bidirectional Reflectance-distribution Function (BRDF), which describes the directional variation of reflectance of a surface element. Previous studies have proposed the use of clusters of nanosatellites in formation flight, each with a VNIR imaging spectrometer, to make multi-spectral reflectance measurements of a ground target, at different zenith and azimuthal angles simultaneously. In this paper, a tradespace of formation flight geometries will be explored in order to optimize or maximize angular spread and minimize BRDF estimation errors. The simulated formation flight solutions are applied to the following case studies: Snow albedo estimation in the Arctic and vegetation in the African savannas. Results will be compared to real data from previous airborne missions (NASAÂ´s ARCTAS Campaign in 2008 and SAFARI Campaign in 2000).

How to realize supply chain collaboration is a core objective of supply chain management. Self-organization is the theory that reveals how a system achieving to an orderly state, it can help to reveal the basic process of supply chain collaborative evolution efficiency. This article keeps Synergetics as the theoretical basis, it start from the perspective of the general system operation, systematically analyzed the basic principles and the general evolutionary process of self-organization, and creatively built a supply chain collaborative architecture model based on the specific operation mode of supply chain systems. Through this architecture model explained the three basic processes of the supply chain system how to achieve from disorder to order synergies by self-organization, and revealed the general principles of the supply chain through the process of self-organization evolution to achieve the synergy target.

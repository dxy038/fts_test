This paper presents a learning system (LS) which offers Greek Sign Language videos in correspondence to every text in the learning environment. The system is designed notably for deaf adults for the purpose of their lifelong vocational and educational training. In the LS, the special needs of Deaf learners are satisfied, e.g. bilingual information (text and sign language), high level of visualization, interactive and explorative leaning, and the potential of learning in peer groups via video conferencing. In this environment, for the first time, Greek signers are able to learn in their own language, the sign language. In addressing the above context, the LS is adapted to the specific learning problems of the target group, i.e. deaf adolescents and young adults. The provided content is bilingual. Bilingual experiments (spoken and signed language) in schools of the deaf and hearing impaired have shown that the use of sign language in the classroom enhance reading competence significantly. The basic objective of the present e-learning environment is the support of the equal rights of Deaf people for their access and real attendance in the vocational and educational training. The development of LS and this paper has been supported by Leonardo Da Vinci Framework Program, "DELFE" project, of European Union.

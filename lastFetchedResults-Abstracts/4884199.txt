The resource mean square deviation of network planning is selected to measure the balance of resource. By setting the mean square deviation of resources to objective functions, and by the 2-norm is being introduced into the objective space, a function used for evaluating the balance optimization of multi-resource network planning is established, so the issue of multi-objective optimization is transferred into a single objective optimization. The global optimal solution of an evaluation function can be found from the perspective of probability by applying simulated annealing with the help of random searching technique. The simulated annealing is an effective global optimization algorithm which is verified by an example. It overcomes those defects of traditional algorithms which are over dependent on the initial solution and are inclined to be involved in local optimal solution, so the optimal and satisfied plan can be found out in balance optimization of multi-resource network planning by applying the simulated annealing.

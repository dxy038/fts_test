Objective
Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition
to generate seizures. Infectious agents are mentioned in its etiology. With
identifying and appropriate treatment of these infectious agents, preventing their
secondary outcomes, including seizure is possible. This study was conducted
to determine frequency of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies (IgG, IgM) and antiToxocara
antibody (IgG) in epileptic patients.
Materials & Methods
Study sample consisted of 141 epileptic patients and 144 healthy people. After
obtaining informed consents and completing demographic questionnaire, serum
samples were taken from participants. The diagnostic test of Toxoplasma IgG &
IgM and Toxocara antibodies was performed under the same conditions using
ELISA method in a qualified private laboratory. Samples from patients and
control groups with positive ELISA test in terms of anti-Toxocara antibody were
also used for confirmatory Western blot test.
Result
According to ELISA results, 28 (19.85%) epileptic patients and 2(1.38%) of
healthy people had anti-Toxocara antibodies (P < 001), while 39 (30.46%) of the
control group people and 14.18% of patients had anti-Toxoplsma antibodies
(P=0.001).
Conclusion
Frequency of anti-Toxoplasmagondii is lower in epileptic than healthy individuals
and this result is contrary to investigations that have reported higher levels of
this antibody in such patient groups. ELISA results for Toxocara showed that
the frequency of anti-Toxocara antibody in epileptic patients might empower the
probability that this parasite may cause central nervous system damage. Western
blotting has high specificity and is a proper confirmative method for diagnosis
of toxocariasis.

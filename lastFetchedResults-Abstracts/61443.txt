This paper presents the analysis and design of a new low-loss auxiliary circuit for three-level pulsewidth-modulation singlephase full-bridge inverters which achieve soft switching at all semiconductor devices. The active auxiliary commutation circuit (AACC) is composed of an LC circuit and two bidirectional switches, where one auxiliary switch commutates under zerovoltage switching condition and the other under zero-current switching condition. The AACC dispenses with the use of auxiliary voltage sources. Low reactive energy is added to the converter, resulting in low RMS current stresses at the main switches and, consequently, higher efficiency is achieved. Auxiliary circuit design procedures and experimental results are presented to prove the operation principle.

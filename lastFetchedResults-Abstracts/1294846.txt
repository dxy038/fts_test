In DEA, there are typically two schemes for measuring efficiency of DMUs; radial and non-radial. Radial models assume proportional change of inputs/outputs and usually remaining slacks are not directly accounted for inefficiency. On the other hand, non-radial models deal with slacks of each input/output individually and independently, and integrate them into an efficiency measure, called slacks-based measure (SBM). In this paper, we point out shortcomings of the SBM and propose four variants of the SBM model. The original SBM model evaluates efficiency of DMUs referring to the furthest frontier point within a range. This results in the hardest score for the objective DMU and the projection may go to a remote point on the efficient frontier which may be inappropriate as the reference. In an effort to overcome this shortcoming, we first investigate frontier (facet) structure of the production possibility set. Then we propose Variation I that evaluates each DMU by the nearest point on the same frontier as the SBM found. However, there exist other potential facets for evaluating DMUs. Therefore we propose Variation II that evaluates each DMU from all facets. We then employ clustering methods to classify DMUs into several groups, and apply Variation II within each cluster. This Variation III gives more reasonable efficiency scores with less effort. Lastly we propose a random search method (Variation IV) for reducing the burden of enumeration of facets. The results are approximate but practical in usage.

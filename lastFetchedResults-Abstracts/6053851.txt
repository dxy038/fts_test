The adaptation and robust sensing capabilities of living organisms remain envy to engineers. Several research efforts have been started to mimic these capabilities and exploit them in technical devices, and systems. Embedded systems for sensor applications, comprise of irreplaceable analog and mixed signal components. The considered electronics and sensors themselves are prone to numerous static and dynamic influences and mismatches. Precise design methodology, trimming/calibration is mandatory to restore the functionality. Recent block level granular approaches using field programmable analog array and the more recent approaches from evolutionary electronics providing transistor level granularity using field programmable transistor array offers considerable extensions. In our work, we started on a new medium level granular approach called field programmable medium granular mixed signal array (FPMA) providing basic building blocks of heterogeneous array of active and passive devices to build established circuit structure which are adaptive, fault-tolerant, bio-inspired, and dynamically reconfigurable i.e., trimmable. FPMA also supports rapid prototyping. Our design objective is to create cells of clear compatibility to that of industrial standards having predictable behavior and maintaining quality along with the incorporation of design knowledge. In this paper, measurement results of our first dynamic reconfigurable operational amplifier in an extrinsic fashion are presented. Specific generic configurable cells under the control of optimization techniques are considered. The aspired embedded system architecture will be illustrated and finally the summary of results will be furnished

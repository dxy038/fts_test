The present survey aims at examining the relationship between family, school, training patterns and societal security. To achieve this objective, a statistical community (N=200) pupils (boys and girls) were randomly in «Share-Kord» selected to respond to the survey tools. 

At the first stage, 52 questions designed and after assessing their reliability and stability and screening the questions, some questions omitted and 30 selected. The data was analyzed through using Pearson's correlation coefficient and simultaneous regression, gradually. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between subscales: family, school, training patterns and societal security (P<0.05).

The objective of this work is to investigate the interlaminar fracture and damage behavior of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) woven laminates loaded in a mixed-mode bending (MMB) apparatus at cryogenic temperatures. The finite element analysis (FEA) is used to determine the mixed-mode interlaminar fracture toughness of MMB specimen at room temperature (RT), liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) and liquid helium temperature (4 K). A FEA coupled with damage is also employed to study the damage distributions within the MMB specimen and to examine the effect of damage on the mixed-mode energy release rate. The technique presented can be efficiently used for characterization of mixed-mode interlaminar fracture and damage behavior of woven laminate specimens at cryogenic temperatures.

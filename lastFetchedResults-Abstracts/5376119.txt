In previous work, we designed a distributed AAA framework for MANETs for which we defined a simple and robust AAA authentication and authorization protocol whose specification carries some implementation latitude. The protocol, therefore, offers several options. In this paper, we propose some of the possible implementation options for which we conducted an analytical study and computationally intensive simulations to evaluate their performances. The objective is to provide guidelines for a fine tuning of this protocol.

The objective of Synchronization In wireless sensor network is to synchronize the various sensor nodes which are distributed as well as moving in a network. Synchronization is an important problem in communication networks especially for real time applications. There may be one base station of 1000 sensor nodes moving in the network. Synchronization is considered a particularly difficult in wireless sensor networks due to its decentralized structure. Synchronization can be done in different layers of the ISO model. The proposed study is about how to search the sensor nodes and synchronize them with smallest time. Recent advances in technology have made low cost, low power wireless sensors a reality. The proposed technique does not introduce collisions between synchronization messages, nor does it require costly digital signatures. Recent advances in miniaturization and low-cost, low power design have led to active research in large-scale networks of small, wireless, low-power sensors and actuators.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess breast-feeding education, knowledge, attitudes, and practices among resident and practicing obstetrician-gynecologists.
STUDY DESIGN: A mailed survey was administered to a national sample of resident and practicing obstetrician-gynecologists.
RESULTS: Response rates were 64% for residents and 69% for practitioners. Residency training included limited opportunity for direct patient interaction regarding breast-feeding, 60% of practitioners recommended that training devote more time to breast-feeding counseling skills. Only 38% of residents reported that obstetric faculty presented breast-feeding topics; more common sources were nursing staff and other residents. Practitioners rate themselves as more effective in meeting the needs of breast-feeding patiens than were residents; prior personal breast-feeding experience was a significant influence on perceived effectiveness. Almost all respondents agreed that obstetrician-gynecologists have a role in breast-feeding promotion, but significant deficits in knowledge of breast-feeding benefits and clinical management were found.
CONCLUSION: Residency training and continuing education programs shoudl create opportunities to practice breast-feeding promotion skills and emphasize management of common lactation problems.

Objective
ry veterans experience a high prevalence of psychopathologies such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Relationships between physical and psychological health are increasingly recognised. This study investigated associations between PTSD and hypertension in male Australian Gulf War veterans.
s
0–02, 1456 veterans underwent medical and psychological assessments. Medical practitioners rated self-reported medical conditions as probable diagnoses, possible, unlikely or non-medical. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) assessed psychological symptomatology present in the 12 months preceding evaluation, and lifetime prevalence. Odds of hypertension among those with and without PTSD were calculated for each timeframe using logistic regression.
s
is was restricted to the 1381 veterans for whom CIDI and medical data were available. Hypertension was considered probable in 100 subjects (7.2%). Adjusted odds ratios of hypertension were 2.90 (95% CI 1.19–7.09) amongst veterans with PTSD in the past 12 months and 2.27 (95% CI 1.01–5.10) for lifetime prevalence, compared with those without PTSD. Hypertension was over seven times more likely amongst veterans with PTSD alone than those with no mental illness in the past 12 months.
sions
ns with a history of PTSD had increased odds of having hypertension. Given the array of disabling psychosocial associations of PTSD, and the numerous potential clinical sequelae of hypertension, co-existence of these conditions may have implications for prevention and management at the individual, clinical, and public health policy and practice level. Early identification of PTSD in military samples may help to ameliorate longer-term adverse physical health outcomes.

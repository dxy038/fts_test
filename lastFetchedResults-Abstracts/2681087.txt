Maintaining the health of people during and after a disaster is one of the most
important issues in disaster management. Blood products are among the essential
items needed to save the human life and the lack of them may lead to significant
losses in human health. In this paper a comprehensive mathematical model of
blood products supply chain is presented to respond the need for blood products in
disaster situations. The proposed model is a bi objective mixed integer
programming model and with respect to the unstable conditions during the disaster,
uncertain parameters are modelled by fuzzy numbers. An interactive possibilistic
programming approach is applied to handle the uncertainty. The developed model
is implemented for the earthquake disaster case study in mega city of Tehran using
blood transfusion network data. The results show the ability of the proposed model
in generating effective solutions under earthquake conditions.

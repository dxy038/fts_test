Seedlings production of native fruits is
important for its sustainable commercial exploitation. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the development of
aça? seedlings as affected by application of powdered basalt
to the substrate. The treatments consisted of five doses of
basalt powder (0.42, 1.04, 2.08, 4.17 and 8.33 g kg-1), two
particle sizes, plus a control with five replications. The
substrate was composed of 20% vermicompost and 80% soil,
dystrophic Yellow Latosol (Xanthic Hapludox). The
substrate was incubated for 90 days. At six months, height,
stem diameter, number of branches, and dry biomass of
shoots and roots, and the concentration of leaf nutrients were
measured. The basalt powder presented potential to be used
as fertilizer in the production of aça? seedlings. Increased of
powder in soil promoted the increase of macro and
micronutrients in the shoots of seedlings, which explains the
better development of the seedlings. The dose between 6.0
and 6.3 g dm-3 of basalt powder, 0.05 mm particle size is
recommended.

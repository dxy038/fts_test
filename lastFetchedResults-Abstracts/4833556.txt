A simple and efficient technique for view synthesis from a pair of rectified stereo views is presented here. Depth and colour information from the stereo pair is used to generate an intermediate view and its corresponding disparity map at any given position along the horizontal baseline. Holes in the generated view and disparity map are filled by using the disparity values to separate the hole positions into those present in the foreground or background layers. The results obtained are evaluated using objective quality measures and are compared with other state of the art methods. The high quality intermediate images generated here can be used in applications such as multiview autostereoscopic displays and free-viewpoint television.

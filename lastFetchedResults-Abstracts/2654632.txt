The cumulative count of a conforming (CCC) control chart is used for high quality
processes.The CCC ? r chart is an improvement of the CCC chart that is based on the
cumulative number of items inspected until observing r non-conforming ones. This
paper aims to propose a new approach for manufacturerâ€™s decision making according
to the criteria among the available options. The objective function of the proposed
model is to minimize three criteria simultaneously, including expected cost per
hour(C), modified producer risk (PR) and modified consumer risk (CR). The solution
method for the proposed model is designed by using AHP technique. A case study is
showed in numerical illustration section. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed
to illustrate the impact of input parameters on the optimal solutions of the proposed
model.

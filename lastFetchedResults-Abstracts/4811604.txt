A detailed modeling of semiconductor ring lasers is briefly reviewed and applied to the investigation of bidirectional regime. By a powerful model, a novel stability criterion has been derived to find the bidirectional regime of any semiconductor ring lasers, depending on the backscattering and any linear and non-linear effect in the active region.

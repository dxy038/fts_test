The liberalisation of the electricity market, combined with the need to reduce CO2 emissions, lead to future electricity grids with a large fraction of distributed renewable energy generation. The dispatch of renewable distributed energy sources at present is performed in such a way that, when implemented at very large scale, their intermittency can impact on the grids, what leads to concerns in terms of power quality and of security of supply. The objective of this work is to analyse the benefits of a storage system in domestic PV (Photovoltaic) grid- connected installations. The paper explores how micro- storage could minimize some distribution problems for the end-user (micro cut-off, black-out) and could allow injection into the grid with dispatch strategies that combine deferred PV generation and demand-side management of domestic loads. The main objectives of this innovative concept can be summarised as: - Study the distribution grid quality to get a picture for introduction of distributed generation devices - Estimation of market potential for small distributed generation and grid stabilization systems in Europe - Analysis of the typical load profiles in order to identify the consumption peaks - Technical requirements for the system, including all its functionalities, especially for the grid interface and the storage system - Demand side management strategies

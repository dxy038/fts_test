This paper describes a sample syllabus for the undergraduate course whose main objective is the design and implementation of quadrotor helicopter system. The class is intended to provide the students with both theoretical and practical knowledge in the areas of mechanical engineering and design, system integration, hardware programming, and control system design and implementation. The class has the objectives which are very clear for the students, and gaining practical skills in such a blend of several unrelated technical fields at the same time can give the students unique experience of system design and integration, which can prove to be very useful in their future career.

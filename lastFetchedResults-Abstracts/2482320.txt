Objective: To compare the effectiveness and safety of the methylphenidate produced in Iran (Stimdate®)
with its original brand (Ritalin®) in children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Methods: In this double-blinded randomized clinical trial, 30 patients with ADHD who were 6 to 16 years
old, were divided into two groups: 15 in Stimdate® and 15 in Ritalin® group. The two groups were compared
for side effects profile, Conner?s Parent?s Rating Scale-Persion version (CPRS-R), Child Symptom Inventory-4
(CSI-4), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), and Children?s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), at baseline and at
the 4th and 6th weeks.
Results: The subjects showed significant decreases in the CPRS-Rand CSI-4 scores and significant increase
of CGAS scores during the follow-up, but there were no significant difference between Stimdate® and Ritalin®
group, regarding the pattern of changes observed. The mean therapeutic dose and the number of side effects were
not significantly different between the two studied groups.
Conclusions: Both Stimdate® and Ritalin® had comparable clinical efficacy and safety in children with
ADHD.
Declaration of interest: None.

Planning for the point pollution sources control around the river bank is complicated with both macro and micro factors. According to these characteristics, a model-centered methodology, based on multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) and water quality simulation, is developed for controlling the multi-pollutants simultaneously, considering the nature of the riverÂ´s hydrology, the arrangement of pollution sources and pollutant diffusion process. Then, the model-centered methodology is applied in the case study to control the COD and NH4-N of 6 pollution sources around the Minjiang river bank of Yibin section, and to analyze the management level of all pollution sources and the variation of their contribution to Minjiang River. The results show that the order of importance of all pollution sources control is as follows: 1st outfall&gt;;2nd outfall&gt;;5th outfall&gt;;3rd outfall&gt;;4th outfall&gt;;6th outfall. And the 1st, 2nd and 5th outfalls can be viewed as the most crucial pollution sources in the future controlling. Moreover, with defining the largest emission concentration of COD and NH4-N and the corresponding annual emissions of the pollution sources, the quantitative requirements of controlling the pollution sources were raised, which offer the basis for the total allocation of the emission and the water environmental management of the whole area.

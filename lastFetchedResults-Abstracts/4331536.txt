In this paper the spectral filtering technique is deployed for soliton control. The objective of the work is to evaluate the performance of amplified soliton systems for application in long haul and/or high-speed transmissions. A numerical model based on the split-step Fourier solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is used for extensive simulations in realistic conditions. Eye diagrams are used to assist in the analysis of the results, and indicate new features of the sliding-frequency filters that appear to have been overlooked in the literature.

The basic requirements for transmit/receive(T/R) modules of active phased array radar systems are small volume and light weight with excellent microwave performance and uniformity. The objective of this study was to employ new interconnecting techniques to develop high density, integrated T/R modules. Many advanced interconnecting methods were applied to increase the package density and improve the electric performance. High density, integrated T/R modules with good microwave performance and uniformity were manufactured successfully. These techniques are very useful to many types of modern active phased array radar systems

This paper describes an optical fiber transmission system to transmit two-way multi-channel FM video signals for video conferencing applications. A two-way optical fiber signal transmission system is built using a pair of optical distributors and a single optical fiber of 1 km for bidirectional communications. A pair of LEDs were used as light sources at 1.3 &#956;m and the bandwidth of the optical fiber transmission system was 300 MHz

In this paper we analyze energy-efficiency and packet-loss trade-off at physical and medium access control layers. The trade-off can be tuned by proper setting of packet length, transmission power and maximal number of allowed transmissions per packet. Our approach is multi-objective without decision making preferences. We show how energy-efficiency vs. packet-loss Pareto Frontier can be determined. We present numerical results for the case when CC1000 transceiver is used. Contrary to intuition, we find that Pareto Frontier is not a continual locus, meaning that energy-efficiency and packet-loss can not be traded continually in Pareto Optimality sense.

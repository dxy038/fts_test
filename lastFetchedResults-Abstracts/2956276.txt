Deals with the issue of weighting decision-makers in a group decision context as well as the issue of obtaining a group ranking. We argue that decision-makers´ weights are a combination of two factors: a subjective factor, which is based on subjective beliefs and an `objective´ factor, grounded on individual preferences. An approach, based on outranking indexes, to elicit the latter factor is proposed. In the second part of the paper, dominant degrees of strength and weakness are figured out and a final preorder, corresponding to the intersection of two preorders, is obtained

This article shows a new electronically tunable filter bank. The main characteristics are: wide frequency range, 6 to 18 GHz, compact size and fast response within the temperature range of -40degC to 75degC. To achieve these objectives the filter bank is built using HMIC and MMIC technology. The purpose of the system is to act as a fast tunable system in communications, avionics and EW systems. The design proposed maintains a compact size for these applications, but keeping the capability of handling the objective spectrum with an adequate instantaneous bandwidth

The main objective of this paper is to present a generic meso-scale probability model for a large class of random anisotropic elastic microstructures in order to perform a parametric analysis of the Representative Volume Element (RVE) size. This new approach can be useful for a direct experimental identification of random anisotropic elastic microstructures when the standard method cannot easily be applied to anisotropic elastic microstructures. Such a RVE is used to construct the macroscopic properties in the context of stochastic homogenization. The probability analysis is not performed as usual for a given particular random microstructure defined in terms of its constituents. Instead, it is performed for a large class of random anisotropic elastic microstructures. For this class, the probability distribution of the random effective stiffness tensor is explicitly constructed. This allows a full probability analysis of the RVE size to be carried out and its convergence to be studied. The procedure of homogenization is based on a homogeneous Dirichlet condition on the boundary of the RVE. The probability model used for the stiffness tensor-valued random field of the random anisotropic elastic microstructure is an extension of the model recently introduced by the author for elliptic stochastic partial differential operators. The stochastic boundary value problem is numerically solved by using the stochastic finite element method. The probability analysis of the RVE size is performed by studying the probability distribution of the random operator norm of the random effective stiffness tensor with respect to the spatial correlation length of the random microstructure.

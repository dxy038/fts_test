Objective
Quantitative assessment of gene expression in stem cells is essential for understanding the molecular events underlying normal and malignant hematopoiesis. The aim of the present study was to develop a method for precise quantitation of gene expression in small subsets of highly purified CD34+CD38− stem cell populations.

Materials and Methods. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantitate housekeeping and drug resistance gene expression in cDNA obtained from 300 CD34+CD38− cells without cDNA amplification or nested PCR techniques.
Results

Validation experiments in cell lines showed efficient, representative and reproducible gene amplification using 300-cell real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Sensitivity was confirmed in dilutional experiments and by detection of the low-copy gene PBGD. GAPDH was found to be a useful reference gene in normal and leukemic CD34+CD38− cells. In contrast, 18S rRNA content varied 100-fold to 1000-fold in these populations. Moreover, expression of 18S rRNA was significantly lower in leukemic CD34+CD38+ cells compared to normal CD34+CD38+ cells (p = 0.002). Expression of MDR-1 (18-fold, p < 0.0005), MRP-1 (3.8-fold, p < 0.05), and LRP (1.8-fold, NS) was higher in normal CD34+CD38− compared to CD34+CD38+ cells.
Conclusions

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR is a valuable tool for precise quantitation of gene expression in small subsets of hematopoietic cells. Using this method, we showed the inappropriateness of 18S as a reference gene in these progenitors and the down-regulation of drug-resistance–related genes early in hematopoiesis.

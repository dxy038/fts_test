Abdominal tuberculosis is one of the most prevalent forms of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Various regions of gastrointestinal tract including cecum, terminal ileum, peritoneum, lymphatic system, and solid viscera can be affected by tuberculosis. Here we report a 33-year-old woman presented with fever, chills, and a history of abdominal discomfort. Lymphadenopathy was detected on physical examination. Contrast computed tomography of chest and abdomen showed patchy densities and thickening of the ileocecal wall respectively. Histological
studies of the biopsy samples documented the existence of tuberculosis.

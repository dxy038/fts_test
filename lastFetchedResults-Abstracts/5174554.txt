In this paper a modified neighbor aware medium-access control protocol is proposed designed for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks are generally comprised of battery powered nodes. These nodes are densely deployed in an ad-hoc structure. The main objective for sensor networks is low power consumption while latency is less important. This leads different MAC layer design for wireless sensor networks compared to conventional ad hoc protocols. In this paper we propose a neighbor aware medium access control to reduce power consumption. This protocol is derived from modified distributed mediation device (MDMD) protocol and uses useful properties of this protocol while improves the performance of this protocol especially in dense environments. We add a neighbor aware dynamic scheduling scheme to MDMD protocol to reduce power consumption. We compare this modified protocol with sensor-MAC (S-MAC) and MDMD protocol

This paper is concerned with the mixed H/sub /spl infin///D-stability synthesis. In general, multi-objective synthesis problems are difficult to be solved theoretically. This is because in most cases they are not convex programming problems. In this paper, we propose an exterior-point method for obtaining a sub-optimal solution of the mixed H/sub /spl infin///D-stability synthesis problem. The key idea of our algorithm is to construct a controller sequence from the infeasible region to the feasible one. The effectiveness of our algorithm is shown by numerical examples.

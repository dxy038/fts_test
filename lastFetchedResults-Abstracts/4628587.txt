The objective of this study is to assess the interaction between brain activity for cognitive and emotional processing and stress states in the healthy adults. The brain activities of thirty-three healthy adults divided into stress and non-stress groups according to their stress responses were assessed during emotional audio-visual stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results showed that a significant correlation was found between the profile of mood states (POMS) subscale scores for Fatigue and the right inferior parietal gyrus in the Relaxed stimuli (r=-0.359), and POMS subscale scores for Depression-Defection and the right inferior parietal gyrus in the Unpleasant stimuli (r=-0.371). These results suggest that the beginnings of stress states, especially the depression or fatigue states, represent deficits in the attention process.

Background and objective: Stroke is prevalent among adults. The fall is most common balance and motor impairments that affects the quality of life in stroke patients. This study was performed to investigate the factors affecting the motor recovery in stroke patients treated with occupational therapy and predicted balance status in patients with a Hurdle regression model.

Materials and Methods: In a longitudinal study of 9 months with non-random access sampling on a total of 30 stroke patients, the score test of balance was measured every two weeks. Because of many zeros in the number of falls, regression Hurdle model was fitted to data using Sas Software (version 9.2).

Results: The frequency of falls in women was more than men. The relative performance improvement was achieved with a minimum of 50 sessions. Stroke duration and length of patient follow-up significantly improved motor function in stroke patients) p < 0.05(. The odds of motor improvement in patients with chronic phase was 10 percent less than odds of patients with the acute phase.

Conclusion: Considering the factors involved in the promotion of motor function and doing combinational interventions with occupational therapy to prevent falls in stroke patients specially in women with chronic phase that were at higher risk of falls can be ventured to fast recover this group of patients to the community.

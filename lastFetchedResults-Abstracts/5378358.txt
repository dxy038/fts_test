A multi-objective plasma reflectarray/transmitarray antenna which reflects/transmits the incident fields radiating from a feed antenna in different directions have been introduced using a single structure. An electronic beam steering is achived using a DC applied voltage on the array elements. A 13&#215;13 unit-cell reflectarray/transmittarray antenna covering an area 13.52&#215;13.52 cm<sup>2</sup> is proposed. The dimensions of the unit cells are identical with different argon gas density according to the relative phases of the reflected/transmitted wave.. Each unit-cell consists of two plasma cylindrical ring tubes positioned along the top and bottom of a plasma square ground plane filled with argon gas. The reflectarray is designed for 19.39 GHz and the transmitarray is operating at 19.75 GHz using a single structure. The plasma frequency of the argon gas is varied by changing the applied ionizing DC voltage at both ends of the dielectric cylinder. The gain and frequency bandwidth for the new configuration are presented. An electronic beam steering plasma transmitarray antenna from -30&#176; to +30&#176; is introduced. The radiation characteristics of the reflectarray/transmitarray are investigated. A compromise between the reflectarray/transmitarray efficiency and the multi-objective operation of the single structure have been introduced. A Full-wave analysis using the finite integration technique (FIT) is applied.

Deficiency of iron, which plays an important role in oxygen transport and storage, may
lead to cerebral hypoxia and cognitive decline. This relationship which was studied in children and adults was not
evaluated in the elderly. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of iron deficiency on cognitive
function in the elderly. Design, Setting, Participants: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in a geriatric
medicine outpatient clinic of a university hospital. Consecutive 2009 patients admitted to Geriatric Medicine
outpatient clinic were examined and 622 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study.
Measurements: Comprehensive geriatric assessment, cognitive assessment and laboratory analysis including
blood count, iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were performed. Results: Mean
age of the study group was 72.5Â±6.5 and 439 (70.6%) were women. MMSE scores were moderately and
significantly correlated with iron levels (r=0.33, p<0.001) and transferrin saturation (r=0.32, p<0.001).
Transferrin saturation was significantly lower in the patients with dementia (p=0.040). It was found that patients
with iron deficiency had lower MMSE scores (p<0.001) and this relationship was also present in patients without
anemia (p=0.004). Conclusion: The results of this study revealed a negative influence of iron deficiency on
cognitive function and this influence was independent from the presence of anemia. As iron deficiency can be
easily diagnosed and treated, detecting its effect on cognitive function is of importance. Screening for iron
deficiency and initiating appropriate treatment should be a routine part of comprehensive geriatric assessment

The AM Council, as a leading industry body in Australia is currently developing an Asset Management certification program. The program will target all people at all levels involved with asset management (from a technical perspective) and work with other certification bodies operating in this area. The program is supported by international commercial companies as well as Australian industry, through a number of national bodies. This presentation will focus on the objective of the AM Council Program and our experience to date, putting together such an ambitious and challenging project.

The purpose of this study was to determine the criteria and quality of friendship among children and adolescents (girls).
A total of 171 girl students from 2 academic districts of Tehran were selected randomly. This selection was related to middle childhood (N=47), early adolescence (N= 68) and late adolescence (N=56).
The results indicated that the criteria of selecting friend change from external, observable and objective to more psychological and abstract specifications. Moreover, the physical proximity of friendship in late adolescence increases remarkably in comparison with middle - childhood. Also the friendship in late period is either more permanent and stable and more reciprocative than middle childhood and early adolescence. As a result the girls in each three developmental periods trust in their friends sufficiently and they satisfied with their relationships, but they are less self- disclosure with their friends.

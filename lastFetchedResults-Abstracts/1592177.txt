Objective: The effects of dietary fish oil on semen quality and sperm fatty acid profiles
during consumption of n-3 fatty acids as well as the persistency of fatty acids in ramâ€™s
sperm after removing dietary oil from the diet were investigated.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we randomly assigned 9 Zandi rams to two
groups (isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets): control (CTR; n=5) and fish oil (FO; n=4) for 70
days with a constant level of vitamin E in both groups. Semen was collected at the first week
and at the last week of the feeding period (phase 1). After the feeding period, all rams were
fed a conventional diet and semen samples were collected one and two months after removal
of FO (phase 2). The sperm parameters and fatty acid profiles were measured by computer
assisted semen analyzer (CASA) and gas chromatography (GC), respectively. The completely
randomized design was used and data were analyzed with SPSS version 16.
Results: Dietary FO had significant positive effects on all sperm quality and quantity parameters
compared with the CTR during the feeding period (p < 0.05). The positive effects
of FO on sperm concentration and total sperm output were observed at one and two
months after removal of FO (p < 0.05), whereas other sperm parameters were unaffected.
Before feeding, C14 (myristic acid), C16 (palmitic acid), C18 (stearic acid), C18:1 (oleic
acid) and C22:6 (docosahexaenoic acid: DHA) were the primary sperm FA. FO in the diet
increased sperm DHA, C14:0 and C18:0 during the feeding period (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: The present study showed not only manipulation of ram sperm fatty acid
profiles by dietary FO and sperm parameters during the feeding period, but also the persistency
of unique effects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids up to two months following its
removal from the diet. Also, we recommend that sperm fatty acid profiles should be comprehensively
analyzed and monitored.

In some telephony headsets the microphone is not close enough to the speakerÂ´s mouth due to size limitation. Thus the microphone captures background noise in addition to useful speech. There is a need to enhance the received signal in order to improve the voice quality in these systems. Among various enhancement methods, dual microphone methods are important for their low cost implementation and use of spatial properties. In this paper, we present a double microphone noise reduction method for nearby microphones. Our method is funded on a modified coherence based filter which reduces correlated noises using cross spectral subtraction. In our proposed method the amount of noise reduction is controlled in order to achieve an acceptable compromise between residual noise and speech distortion. The results evaluated using objective and subjective measures, confirm the superiority of the proposed approach.

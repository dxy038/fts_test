Gamma ray tomography experiments have been carried out to detect any spatial patterns in the porosity in a 0.6 m diameter
packed column. Three different sizes of stainless steel Pall rings (16, 25 and 38 mm) have been examined. The primary objective
is to detect spatial patterns and statistical information on porosity variation in packed distillation columns. Such data are needed
in the computational fluid dynamics simulators based on 6olume a6eraged equations. Horizontal scans, at different vertical positions
of the packed bed, were made for each size of Pall rings. A tomographic reconstruction algorithm has been used to calculate the
spatial variation over the column cross section. Radial porosity variation within the packed bed has been determined. The
variation of the circumferentially averaged porosity in the radial direction indicates that the porosity in the column wall region
is a somewhat higher than that in the bulk region, due to the effect of the column wall. The probability density function for
porosity variation has been constructed from the experimental data and it can be represented by a normal distribution.

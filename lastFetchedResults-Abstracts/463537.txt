Objective
This study sought to evaluate the impact on the quitline utilization and abstinence rates of increasing a free nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) benefit from 4 weeks to 6 weeks.
Methods

Intake data were utilized to assess the number of callers to the quitline during the time period in which 4 weeks of free NRT was provided (January–November 2006) and the time period of the enhanced NRT benefit (December 2006–June 2007). Abstinence rates at 3 and 6 months were calculated for people utilizing the quitline program during both time periods.
Results

The mean number of intake calls to the quitline increased from 397 (range 326–509) prior to the enhanced NRT benefit to 712 (range 592–1227) during the 6-week NRT benefit period. The 6-month tobacco abstinence rates were significantly higher among people receiving the 6-week NRT benefit compared to those receiving the 4-week benefit (OR=1.51; 95% CI=1.07, 1.66).
Conclusions

The findings suggest that the promotion of an expanded NRT benefit can increase quitline utilization and abstinence rates.

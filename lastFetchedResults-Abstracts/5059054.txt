Future earth orbiting, solar system and celestial body autonomous missions can benefit from spacecraft systems and instruments that have significantly lower weight and volume over current state of the art designs. Incorporating electronic traces or signal paths directly into the spacecraft or instrument structure can provide a significant savings in weight and volume. In addition, local computer processing power, increased operational speed and larger memory storage are achievable by using embedded or direct chip attach design methods. The objective of this technology development is to demonstrate the feasibility of electronic circuit boards that function as structural members within a subsystem. This dual functionality will be achieved by utilizing printed circuit board materials that demonstrate structural properties of strength and stiffness that can compete with current spacecraft structural applications that require the use of aluminum and titanium.

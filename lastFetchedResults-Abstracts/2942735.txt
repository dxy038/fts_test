This paper presents a new architecture for designing non-linear, critically decimated, perfect reconstruction filter banks. It is believed that such filters have a wide range of applications including that of still image and image sequence compression. Example filters are presented, for still image compression using a quincunx system. These filters are shown to out-perform other linear and non-linear methods, both in terms of subjective and objective image quality

<p><strong>Background and objective: </strong>Bhitarkanika is the mangrove ecosystem of Orissa, India. It was not explored before for occur  rence and distribution of <em>Streptomyces</em>. With the aim of isolation and characterization of special group of bacteria from this mangrove ecosystem, the present study has been made.<strong><br />Materials and Methods: </strong>Isolates of <em>Streptomyces </em>were obtained from plant, soil and water collected from Bhitarkanika mangroves on specific ISP media. Different isolates of Streptomyces were characterized for their colony characteristics, morphological properties, physiological and biochemical properties and were tentatively identified.<strong><br /></strong><strong>Results: </strong>105 isolates of <em>Streptomyces </em>belonging to 20 different species were isolated from 19 mangrove plants in different locations of Bhitarkanika  mangroves. According to physiological and biochemical data, all strains were taxonomically iden  tified to the genus <em>Streptomyces</em>. However, all the strains were morphologically varied and exhibited different extracellular activity. Maximum number of <em>Streptomyces </em>species was observed in the Khola region. <em>S. xanthochromogenes </em>was found to be most prevalent species followed by <em>S. exfoliates </em>and <em>S. auranticus.<strong><br /></strong></em><strong>Conclusion: </strong>We have confirmed occurrence and distribution of <em>Streptomyces </em>in the Bhitarkanika  mangrove environ ment. This is the first report of <em>Streptomyces </em>biodiversity in mangrove ecosystem of Bhitarkanika<strong>.</strong></p>

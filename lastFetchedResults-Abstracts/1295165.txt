The member selection problem is an important aspect of the formation of cross-functional teams (CFTs). Selecting suitable members from a set of candidates will facilitate the successful task accomplishment. In the existing studies of member selection, the individual performance concerning a single candidate is mostly used, whereas the collaborative performance associating with a pair of candidates is overlooked. In this paper, as a solution to this problem, we propose a method for member selection of CFTs, where both the individual performance of candidates and the collaborative performance between candidates are considered. In order to select the desired members, firstly, a multi-objective 0â€“1 programming model is built using the individual and collaborative performances, which is an NP-hard problem. To solve the model, we develop an improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (INSGA-II). Furthermore, a real example is employed to illustrate the suitability of the proposed method. Additionally, extensive computational experiments to compare INSGA-II with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) are conducted and much better performance of INSGA-II is observed.

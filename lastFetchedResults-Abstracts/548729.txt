Abstract
Aim: The objective of this study was to obtain a factor structure for the Approaches to Learning Scale (ATL) among Iranian students. Method: A correlation method was employed with a sample of 11th .grade students in public schools. Participants were 1371 junior year high school students in Tehran who were selected through random cluster sampling. They answered to the 32-item ATL scale. Data was analyzed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Exploratory factor analysis showed a four factor measurement model which was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. These factors were Learning goals, performance goals, future goals and perceived ability. Conclusion: clustering intrinsic valuing and learning goals items in one factor and extrinsic valuing and future goals in another factor (future) shows emergence of a new four factor model and stress the necessity of researchers' attention to the possible culture- dependence quality of achievement goals and also validating the appropriate cultural instruments that are made in other communities for achievement goals measurement.

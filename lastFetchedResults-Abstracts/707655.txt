Our objective was to assess parental expectations of diagnostic testing, time, and charges in a pediatric emergency department (PED) using a prospective survey-based study. Parents on arrival estimated the amount of testing, time, and charges expected to occur. A total of 266 of 294 (90.5%) of the questionnaires were completed and returned. Parents correctly predicted the need for radiographic evaluation in 185 of 258 (71.7%), laboratory evaluation in 179 of 257 (69.6%), and medication in 144 of 259 (55.6%). The average length of stay was 2 hours and 36 minutes and was correctly estimated within preset ranges by 86 of 253 (34.0%) and underestimated by 112 of 253 (44.3%). The mean total charge was $964 per visit and was correctly estimated within preset ranges by 91 of 260 (35.0%) and underestimated by 139 of 260 (53.3%). Despite being relatively accurate about the need for medications and radiographic and laboratory studies, parents are still more likely than not to underestimate the total charges and time associated with a PED visit.

Creative and methodologically sophisticated longitudinal
research on bidirectionality in parenting and child
behavior can shed important new light on the dynamics of
behavior-problem development. The articles assembled for
this Special Section are at the forefront of efforts aimed at
tracing the interplay of parenting behavior and child and
adolescent adjustment problems over time. In this commentary,
we provide a brief overview of thinking and
research on bidirectionality and then highlight key themes
and findings reported in these articles. We describe some of
the challenges in research on bidirectional processes and
offer some recommendations for future research in this area

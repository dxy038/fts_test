Recently, advanced information technologies have opened new possibilities for collaborative designs. In this paper a Web-based collaborative design environment is proposed, where heterogeneous design applications can be integrated with a common interface, managed dynamically for communicated with each other for intergrated muti-objective design. Conversing shipbuilding model, i.e. changing traditional series-wound design process to concurrent design process. The aim of converting shipbuilding mode is to enhance efficiency of shipbuilding, shorten production period and reduce cost. Through analysis of ship design features and demand, remote collaborative design system integration framework PDM-based is set up. In addition the further research work is put forward in this paper. In addition the further research work is put forward in this paper.

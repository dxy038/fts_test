Test of radiation pattern for on-board installed antennas is a difficult and very necessary. This paper by the testing method is the analysis of mission systems on the basis of actual needs and consideration to facilities, place, and other objective conditions, step by step, level by level test pattern of installed antenna. First, testing pattern of antenna in free-space, and then in the open field in semi-physical tests, the last based on the actual situation in the open field to complete the test of horizontal radiation patterns. From the results of the comparison and analysis, this method can meet the test requirements.

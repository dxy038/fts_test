The same crop shows possibly difference features in the different data sources (e.g. images) and different surrounding environments. And so, it is difficult to distinguish objective cropÂ´s spatial distribution only by one of methods, especially in monitoring the early rice planting area based on RS. This thesis describes some features of early rice and other confusing objects on images, in the case of early rice remote sensing monitoring for Hubei province, provides the different solutions to obtain the planting area of early rice based on RS. The result of the application presents that the approach is effective and efficient.

The objective of the present study was to analyze, by flow cytometry, changes in PBMC subsets in pigs having postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), a new condition associated to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection. Thirteen acutely PMWS affected pigs were selected from a farm seronegative to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and to Aujeszkyâ€™s disease virus (ADV); 11 clinically healthy pigs were selected from a high health farm with no history of PMWS and free of the major swine pathogens, and used as a control group. All pigs were necropsied, and tissue samples were fixed in formalin; blood with EDTA anticoagulant was used to perform the flow cytometric analysis. PBMC were incubated with mAb against porcine CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD45, IgM, SWC3, and SLA-Class II. Flow cytometric analysis showed substantial changes in leukocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of PMWS-affected pigs, which were characterized by an increase of monocytes, a reduction of T (mainly CD4+) and B-lymphocytes, and the presence of low-density immature granulocytes. Altogether, these changes would suggest an inability of acutely PMWS-affected pigs to mount an effective immune response.

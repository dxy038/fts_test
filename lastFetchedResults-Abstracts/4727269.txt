This work presents a method to extract polygonal surfaces from volumetric models created by artists, proposing a way of using voxel modeling tools to build B-Rep models. The volumetric data created by voxel editors usually contain topological features that do not describe solid structures. Hence, the main objective of this work is to solve the problem of extracting triangle meshes from volumes that contain these topological features. In order to extract surfaces successfully, a methodology was conceived to resample any volumetric model, in a way that it is possible to reconstruct a three-dimensional manifold that can be polygonized without generating a surface with gaps or topological problems. The meshes generated by this technique have good properties, satisfying some of the main criteria used to measure the quality of meshes, such as aspect ratio, smoothness and skewness.

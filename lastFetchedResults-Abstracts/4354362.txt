The objective of this paper is to study the impact of EEPROM cell geometry on the stored value. To do so, a Design Of Experiments (DOE) approach has been used, giving the variations of the threshold voltage of a memory cell as a function of geometric parameters. The inputs of this DOE are transient and static electrical simulations of an EEPROM cell. The simulations´ model is based on a MOS Model 9 transistor coupled with the charges´ neutrality expression in the cell. The outputs of the DOE are a set of equations describing the evolution of the threshold voltage of a virgin, an erase and a written cell. The sensitivity of the threshold voltage to the geometric parameters are then discussed from the results obtain with this set of equations.

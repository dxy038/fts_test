Fuel cell testing and standardization thematic network (FCTESTNET) was a Thematic Network funded by the European Commission under the Fifth Framework Program (FP5), which was comprised of 55 European partners. The project concluded in 2006 and the main output was the collection and compilation of agreed testing procedures for different fuel cell technologies (PEM, SOFC, MCFC), applications (stationary, portable, transport), as well as balance of plant.

Experimental validation of such testing procedures is the next necessary step for obtaining reliable harmonized testing procedures. The Joint Research Centre (JRC), Institute for Energy (IE) has started the validation process on selected PEM testing procedures. One of the FCTESTNET procedures applied at JRC-IE is the polarization curve for a PEM stack. Results show that the harmonization of some parameters, such as the acquisition and equilibrium time for each value of the current density, and the control of the stack coolant temperature, is a necessary action for an objective and trustworthy comparison of the performance data.

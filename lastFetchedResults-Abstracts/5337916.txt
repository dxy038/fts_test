In this paper, parameters of PID controller and bias coefficient for Load Frequency Control (LFC) are designed using a new approach. In the proposed method, the power system uncertainties and nonlinear limitations of governors and turbines, i.e. Valve Speed Limit (VSL) and Generation Rate Constraint (GRC), are taken into account in designing. Variations of uncertain parameters are considered between &#8722;40% and +40% of nominal values with 5% step. In order to design the proposed PID controller, a new objective function is defined. To optimize the new objective function, PSO algorithm is applied. In the two-area power system, simulation results of test system using the proposed PID and classic PID controller are compared.

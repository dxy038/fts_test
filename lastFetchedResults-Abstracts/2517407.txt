Background: Retard absorption of glucose by the inhibition of carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes is one of the therapeutic approaches to decrease the postprandial hyperglycemia. Commercial ?-glucosidase inhibitors exhibited some serious side effects. So a great deal of attention has been paid to natural products like plants, as a reliable source for bioactive compounds.
Objective: The aim of this study was to find new potent inhibitors for Alpha-glucosidase among plant extracts. 
Methods: Hexane extracts of 60 plants species were screened for their Alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/mL concentration. Alpha-glucosidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm on a Sunrise microplate reader (Tecan- Switzerland) by measuring the quantity of p-nitrophenol released from pNPG. Acarbose, dissolved in buffer, was used as a positive control. The assay was performed in triplicate. The concentration of the extract required to inhibit 50% of Alpha-glucosidase activity under the assay conditions was defined as the IC50value. The results are reported as %I ± SD. 
Results: Descurania sophia (L.) Webb & Berth, Fumaria vailantii Loisel, Ferula Haussknechti Wolf & Rech, Haplophyllum acutifolium (DC.) G.Don, Isatis cappadociaca Desv., Eremostachys laevigata Bunge, Silene aucheriana Boiss., exhibited more than 60% alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Among them, Descurania sophia, Fumaria vailantii and Ferula haussknechti exhibited significant alpha glucosidase inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.9 µg/ml, 24.55 µg/ml and 2.71 µg/ml, respectively. 
Conclusion: Because of its high inhibitory activity and low IC50, hexane extract of Descurania sophia would be interesting for further detailed studies to find and characterize any new inhibitor for Alpha-glucosidase.

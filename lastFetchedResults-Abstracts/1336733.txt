The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of gastric ulcers in horses involved in a university riding program. Researchers examined 80 riding horses engaged in hunt seat lessons, stock seat lessons, polo, and training (breeds included Morgans, Quarter Horses including crosses, Thoroughbreds, and other lineage). Gastroscopic examination was performed to determine the presence of gastric ulcers. Non-glandular ulcers present were scored using an accepted scoring system. Descriptive characteristics such as age, sex, breed, housing, use, and prior medication of horses were recorded. Nine (11%) of the horses had non-glandular ulcerations. Age and sex had a significant (P < .05) effect on non-glandular ulcers in this population. Horses that were 2 to 6 or 18 to 23 years of age and mares were most affected by non-glandular gastric ulcers. Non-glandular ulcer occurrence was lower in this population than in any previous studies focused on elite, heavy-use performance horses, show horses, racehorses, and recreational horses. Horses used predominantly in their home environment may suffer from a lower occurrence of non-glandular gastric ulcers than previously studied populations such as racing and show horses despite the frequency and intensity of their activities.

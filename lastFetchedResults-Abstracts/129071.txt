BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Less than 1% of pheochromocytoma account for hypertensive vascular diseases. The goal of this report is early diagnosis of this tumor since it is surgically treatable and preventive for lethal complication. In this study, two cases of patients with hypertension due to adrenal pheochromcytoma who were treated by surgical adrenalectomy, were reported.
CASES: The first patient was a 45-year-old female who presented with hypertension, headache, abdominal pain, sweating, weight loss and diabetic mellitus. An 8x6 cm' mass was reported in her left adrenal by CT scan. She was operated adrenalectomy. She immediately got a normal blood pressure and controlled diabetic mellitus. The second patient was a 61-year-old male who presented with hypertension and elevated level of 24-hour urinary cathacholasmine. He was surgically treated by adrenalectomy of right adrenal pheochromocytoma after a 7x6 cm' mass was detected on CT scan in his right adrenal as the same of first patient, he got a normal blood pressure and controlled diabetic mellitus immediately after operation.
CONCLUSION: Although pheochromocytoma is a rare cause of elevation of arterial pressure; it should be always considered as a cause of elevation of blood pressure. So after the diagnosis it was recommended administration of phenoxybenzamine as an irreversible a blocker, to prevent hypertensive crisis and cardiac arythmia, and for symptom relief of the patients before, during and after the operation, respectively.

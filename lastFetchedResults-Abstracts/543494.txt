Abstract1
In coarse-textured soils, because of possessing higher macropores, in general,
water and nutrient holding capacity is low. The objective of this study was to
investigate the effects of polyacrylamide (PAM), cattle manure (MR),
vermicompost (VC) and biological sludge (BS) as soil conditioners on hydraulic
and solute transport paramerers of a sandy loam soil. PAM (0.25 and 0.5 gkg-1 of
air dry soil), MR (12.5 and 25 gkg-1 of air dry soil), VC (2.5 and 5 gkg-1 of air dry
soil) and BS (1.7 and 3.4 gkg-1 of air dry soil) were mixed with soil and uniformly
packed in to plastic pans (50 cm diameter and 25 cm height) and PVC tubes (15 cm
diameter and 25 cm height) and then incubated in greenhouse at (0.7-0.8) FC
moisture content and temperature of 22Â±4 ?C for 6 months. Plastic pans were used
for soil sampling to construct soil moisture curves (SMCs) at 7, 30, 60, 120 and 180
days after start of incubation. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and
breakthrough curves (BTCs) were determined at the same times in PVC tubes. Van
Genuchten-? parameter was obtained from fitting SMCs to van Genuchten (VG)
model. Dispersivity (?) parameter was obtained from fitting BTCs data to
convection-dispersion equation (CDE). Van Genuchten-? parameter at both levels
of PAM and second level of MR and VC was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced. At
both levels of PAM, compared with the control and other conditioners, Ks
remained unchanged after 60 days of incubation relative to former times. All of soil
conditioners decreased dispersivity (?) parameter of CDE model. The findings of
this study showed that PAM and MR were more effective than other conditioners
at the used levels, in improving soil physical conditions.

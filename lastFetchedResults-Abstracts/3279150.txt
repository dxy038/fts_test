In this paper, our objective is dedicated to the detection of a deterioration in the estimated operating time by giving preventive action before a failure, and the classification of breakdowns after failure by giving the action of the diagnosis and / or maintenance. For this reason, we propose a new Neuro-fuzzy assistance prognosis system based on pattern recognition called "NFPROG" (Neuro Fuzzy Prognosis). NFPROG is an interactive simulation software, developed within the Laboratory of Automation and Production (LAP) - University of Batna, Algeria. It is a four-layer fuzzy preceptor whose architecture is based on Elman neural networks. This system is applied to the cement manufacturing process (cooking process) to the cement manufacturing company of Ain-Touta-Batna, Algeria. And since this company has an installation and configuration S7-400 of Siemens PLC PCS7 was chosen as a programming language platform for our system.

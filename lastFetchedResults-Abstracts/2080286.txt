Objectives
 is known about the effect of Cervitec®, a chlorhexidine-thymol varnish, on root caries. Our objective was to determine whether a 3-monthly application of Cervitec® over 1 year would limit the progress of existing root caries lesions and reduce the incidence of dental root caries in a group of dentate institutionalized elderly, as a complement to their usual oral hygiene practices.
s
le-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in 68 subjects (34 per group) in two residences in Almerيa (Spain). Twenty-one subjects with 60 root caries lesions and 25 with 65 lesions, in the Cervitec® and placebo groups, respectively, completed the study. Varnishes were applied twice in the first week, 1 month later, and every 3 months until the end of the study. Clinical parameters associated with established lesions were determined at baseline and after 6 and 12 months, as was the incidence of root caries lesions.
s
inical evolution of lesions was significantly better in the Cervitec® group as opposed to the placebo group in terms of width, height, color, and texture. The increase in root caries was significantly lower (p = 0.039) in the Cervitec® group.
sion
ing to these results, Cervitec® may help to control established root lesions and reduce the incidence of root caries lesion among institutionalized elderly.

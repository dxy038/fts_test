The objective of this study was to create a probabilistic model to assess changes in the levels and molecular weight (Mw) of β-glucan during the bread baking process using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Three different composite flours were formulated by substituting wheat flour (WF) with barley whole meal flour (BWMF), barley straight grade flour (BSGF) or barley fibre rich fraction (BFRF). The β-glucan level in the flour increased significantly (by approximately 10-fold) when barley was substituted for WF. The baking process resulted in approximately a 47–48% reduction in the β-glucan level in the baked bread (base-line model). The base-line model observed ∼25% and 7% reduction in high molecular weight (HMw) and medium molecular weight (MMw), respectively and a subsequent increase in low molecular weight (LMw). The analysis also showed the importance of various steps involved in bread baking, such as mixing time (Mt), fermentation time (Ft) and baking (BGloss), on the level and Mw of β-glucan in baked breads. A parallel experimental validation study provided confidence in model predictions of β-glucan levels. This study aids in optimising the various unit operations involved in the bread baking process to give a final product with increased nutritional qualities.

This paper sets up an optimization model of different types of consumers including commerce, residential unit and industry under different incentive mechanisms such as distributed energy source mechanism. Five effectiveness of DSM in the consumers´ and distributed utilities´ side are transferred to a constraint, an evaluation index and an objective function. Analysis of calculation examples is computational basis with load data of multiple consumers and implemented incentive mechanisms. Results of simulation show the preference of different consumers on the same incentive mechanism and the same consumer on different incentive mechanisms. This paper provides effective incentive mechanisms for widespread use of demand side management in different types of consumers. And by comparing different models, it is quantitatively proved that DR can make up the intermittent of DES.

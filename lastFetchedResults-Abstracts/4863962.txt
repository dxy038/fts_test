We conceive the problem of multiple semantic wide object (SVO) extraction as an issue of designing extensive operators on the lattice of partitions. As a result, we propose a framework based on spatial partition generation and application of optimal operators on the generated partitions. The first stage is obtained with a multivalued morphological spatial segmentation method that incorporates an edge-driven marker extraction algorithm and a growing method which integrates both color and edge information. For the second stage, we propose a new spatio-temporal regional maximum likelihood partition operator for extraction purposes. Subjective and objective evaluation of the experimental results obtained with our approach on several MPEG-4 test video sequences show that it accurately tracks multiple SVOs in several scenarios, while improving the SVO extraction precision compared to traditional watershed techniques

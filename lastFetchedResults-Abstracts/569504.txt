Objective: There has been a growing interest in finding plants with biological active ingredients for medicinal application. 
Materials and Methods: Three colors of petals of Althaea officinalis (A. officinalis) flowers, i.e., pink, reddish pink, and white were examined for total antioxidant activity and ?avonoids content. 
Results: The reddish pink flowers of A. officinalis have more antioxidant activity and the power of antioxidant activity was reddish pink  >  pink  >  white.

A novel foveation filter method is proposed in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain. For countering the blocking and ringing artifacts, we devise the tools measuring the signal gradient, the block signal variations in the DCT domain. Each measurement is properly applied to each enhancement region and smoothing region. The proposed method optimally adapts the enhancement factors to the characteristics of the underlying signals and so maximizes the enhancement performances with significantly suppressing the artifacts. The subjective and objective evaluations verify that the proposed method sustains producing the improved video qualities for various sequences.

A method of wavelet packet frequency decomposition was proposed, and it was used to analyze the vehicle interior noise signal and take feature extraction, the characteristic vector of total average statistical was constructed after feature extraction. Meanwhile the vector of sound quality calculated from the objective quantization mathematics model was also constructed. Then the correlation coefficient of them was calculated. The result is 0.9488, so the validity and feasibility of the algorithm proposed in the paper were proved theoretically. Meanwhile a new and effective method to study the sound quality of vehicle interior noise signal was provided.

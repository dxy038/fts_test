Background & Objective: Developments in science and technology together with rapid
obsolescence in findings and previous information necessitates a type of education in which students
are continuously engaged in learning and problem solving and enjoy interfacing changes. This study
was aimed to assess critical thinking in students of virtual and traditional education.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, two groups including 40 senior computer students from
Shiraz University (virtual education) and 40 ones from Islamic Azad University (traditional
education) participated. Data was collected using Watson Glaser Critical Thinking Test including 80
questions in five subscales including inference, recognition of assumptions. deduction, interpretation
and evaluation of arguments.
Results: The mean score (± SO) of critical thinking which was 36.77(± 3.59) in virtual education
happened to be higher than traditional education's mean score which was 35.l5(±6.94) while there
was no significant difference. In all five subscales of critical thinking, the mean score of
interpretation skill was significantly higher in virtual education (7.9) compared to 6.95 for
traditional education (p~O.OOOI).
Conclusion: Considering improvements of critical thinking in virtual education and according to its
multiple advantages like adding to one's self confidence, self esteem and independent learning, it is
suggested to use this type of education alongside the traditional method or as a replacement for
teaching theoretical lessons in university courses.

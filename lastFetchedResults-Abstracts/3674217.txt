The objective of this task force report is to provide a guideline for modelling and analyses of slow (low frequency) dynamics of electrical power systems based on the use of digital computer time-domain simulation methods. This report concentrates on small-signal torsional oscillations, large-signal (transient) torsional torques, turbine blade vibrations, and fast bus transfer. This report: (1) briefly explains the physical nature of each phenomenon; (2) identifies those power systems components which are either contributors or are adversely affected by the phenomenon; (3) provides time-domain simulation guidelines; and (4) provides sample power systems and typical time-domain simulation results.

This paper introduces an Intelligent Match Making Assistant `IMMAÂ´ as a preliminary work to be used during the Human Organ Transplantation Management &#8220;HOTM&#8221;. It is based on the modern Case-Based Reasoning &#8220;CBR&#8221; techniques which makes use of the Case Retrieval Nets &#8220;CRN&#8221; and the Spreading Activation Algorithm to search the patients waiting list and investigate the Donor-Recipient Compatibility during the HOTM. The work adapts the concepts of the Intelligent Catalogue used as part of the Open European Nephrology Science Center-OpEN.SC [1]. The proposed IMMA should assist the decision-makers during their search for the best Donor-Recipient Compatibility to enhance the overall HOTM systems efficiency and diminish the drawbacks of loosing an organ, allocating fairly or even face an organ rejection. Making use of CRN advantages and presenting the waiting list patients in a graphical context depending on its relevance and simulation arcs and thereby finding the best recipient, is a new technique not used before for the &#8220;best match&#8221; process. It promises an objective, transparent and trustable allocation system. The paper starts with the introduction and overview addressing the main problem generally. Section two is dedicated to the HOTM system phases, processes stressing on the match making process definition, criteria, characteristic and challenges. Following, section three introduces in details the CBR, CRN and its benefits. In section four the proposed IMMA will be presented and explained deeply, its structure, function and activation algorithm. The paper ends with the requirements, future work and conclusions.

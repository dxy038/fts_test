The objective of this study is to provide an alternative model approach, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) model, to predict the compositional viscosity of binary mixtures of room temperature ionic liquids (in short as ILs) [C<sub>n</sub>-mim][NTf<sub>2</sub>] with n=4, 6, 8, 10 in methanol and ethanol over the entire range of molar fraction at a broad range of temperatures from T=293.0-328.0 K. The results show that the proposed ANN model provides alternative way to predict compositional viscosity successfully with highly improved accuracy and also show its potential to be extensively utilized to predict compositional viscosity over a wide range of temperatures and more complex viscosity compositions, i.e., more complex intermolecular interactions between components in which it would be hard or impossible to establish the analytical model.

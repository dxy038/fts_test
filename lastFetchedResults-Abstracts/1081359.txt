The objective of AQUASOL project at Plataforma Solar de Almer√≠a (CIEMAT) is to develop and test a distillation system using multi-effect technique whose energy source is solar. In order to guarantee the optimization in the operation, it is important to control in an efficient and secure way different process variables, in addition to provide the operators signal information in a flexible and appropriate way. This article shows a description of the plant, a summary of the dynamic modeling works realized up to date and a scheme of the base control system. Simulation results of the control system behavior during operation of the plant are presented.

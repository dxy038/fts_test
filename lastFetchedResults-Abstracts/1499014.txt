The development of sustainable energy services like the supply of heating water may face a trade-off with a comfortable quality of life, especially in the winter season where suitable strategies to deliver an effective service are required. This paper investigates the heat transfer process as well as the thermal behavior of a flat plate collector evaluating different cover configurations. This investigation is performed according to a two-folded approach. Firstly, a complete model is formulated and implemented taking into account various modes of heat transfer in the collector. The goal is to investigate the impact of the number and types of covers on the top heat loss and the related thermal performance in order to support decision makers about the most cost-effective design. The proposed model can also be used to investigate the effect of the different parameters which may affect the performance of the collector. Secondly, a two objective constrained optimization model has been formulated and implemented to evaluate the optimality of different design approaches. The goal is to support decision makers in the definition of the optimal water flow and of the optimal collector flat area in order to give a good compromise between the collector efficiency and the output water temperature. The overall methodology has been tested on environmental data (temperature and irradiation) which are characteristic of TÃ©touan (Morocco).

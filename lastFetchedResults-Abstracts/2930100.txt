A methodology to support design synthesis is described which features intelligent search and generation of alternatives. The search is directed by degree of closeness of multiple responses to their known ideal and imprecise designer preferences. A key objective of the methodology is to minimize the number of probes of the design model which is assumed to be in the form of a simulation program. A multiprocessor system design problem with features representing typical design synthesis problems is presented to demonstrate application

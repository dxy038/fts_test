A new mesh-truncation technique is introduced for the frequency-domain (time-harmonic) solution of open-region radiation problems. The technique is based on the complementary operators method (COM), where two independent solutions are averaged to eliminate first-order boundary reflections. The dual complementariness in the frequency domain is achieved by introducing a discrete-domain operator that achieves the objective of &#8706;<sub>t</sub> in the original time-domain development of COM

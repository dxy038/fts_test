Objective: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered to be a worldwide health problem. In most cases, HCV infection becomes chronic and may proceed to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Many pathological effects in cells may occur by viral proteins. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the HCV core protein on cells to induction of the fibrogenesis process.
Methods: We use the LX-2 cell line that originated from hepatic stellate cells. Plasmid which expressed HCV core protein was transfected to the cells. After 72 h, RNA was extracted and treated with DNase, followed by synthesis of cDNA. Positive control cells were treated with the leptin fibrotic hormone. We used real-time PCR to measure and statistically analyze ?-SMA gene expression.
Results: The HCV core protein significantly increased ?-SMA gene expression (p < 0.05). There was more ?-SMA gene expression in cells treated with leptin compared to cells treated with the HCV core protein.
Conclusion: HCV infection is an impressive factor in the development of chronic hepatitis to hepatic fibrogenesis. The HCV core protein can induce a fibrogenesis process in HCV infection.

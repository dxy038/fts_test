The objective of this work is to analyze at a regional scale the hydrometeorological and hydrological characteristics of the Esteros del Ibera, a vast freshwater wetland located in NE Argentina. Since water is the main driving force in the inland wetlands and variations in water level impose conditions on the behavior of vegetation and animal populations, the knowledge of the main hydrometeorological variables that affect the hydrology is essential. Data correlation analysis makes it possible to evaluate the observed changes in the wetland and to infer its response to regional climatic change. As a first approach, the construction of a topo-bathymetric map provides a basic tool for developing a digital elevation model (DEM) using a geographic information system (GIS) and models that are based on a spatial scale.

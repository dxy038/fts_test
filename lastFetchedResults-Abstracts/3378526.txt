A simple and effective coarse wavelength-division-multiplexing metro access network architecture with unidirectional optical add-drop multiplexer (OADM) for automatic optical protection in a hub/access-node single-fiber ring is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. This physical-ring/logical-star architecture greatly simplifies the design compared with previous works requiring bidirectional OADM.

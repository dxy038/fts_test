In this paper, a no reference bit stream model for quality assessment of SD and HD H.264/AVC video sequences based on packet loss visibility is proposed. The method considers the impact of network impairments on human perception and uses the visibility of packet losses to predict objective scores. Also, a new subjective experiment has been designed to provide insight into the perceptual effect of degradations caused by transmission errors. The proposed algorithm extracts a set of features from the received bit stream. Then, the visibility of each packet loss event is determined by classifying the extracted features using a Support Vector Machines classifier. Finally, analytical expressions are developed to account for visual degradation due to compression and channel induced distortion based on the outcome of the visibility classifier. The evaluation demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.

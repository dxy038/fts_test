In this paper, a new problem is defined according to the actual project requirement. It is resource leveling problem under resource constrained condition. Unlike the single resource leveling problem, or the resource constrained scheduling problem, this new problem will consider not only resource usage evenness, but also the shortest project duration under resource constrained condition. A new objective function is designed and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented to solve this problem.

The vehicle-bridge system is simplified as a moving oscillator traversing a 1D elastic distributed parameter continuum. The control device is placed in parallel with spring and dashpot elements that comprise the suspending part of the vehicle. Three different control schemes are investigated, namely active control, semi-active control using ideal controllable damper and semi-active control using MR damper. The control objective is to suppress both the acceleration of vehicle and the deflection of bridge. The clipped optimal controller tracing the active optimal control law is selected for the semi-active cases. For the MR damper, an experimentally verified dynamic model is adopted, and the model can inversely predict the command voltage applied on the damper for control purpose. Numerical results indicate that the control efficiency is highly dependant on the initial condition of the vehicle, and the two semi-active dampers can well approach the performance of active control.

A new bidirectional nondissipative battery equalization scheme for the series battery strings is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme comprises a converter circuit with an energy transferring capacitor, which can be used to design the bidirectional nondissipative current diverter for the battery balancing system. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed battery equalization scheme can balance the voltage of the battery strings and increase the equalizing efficiency. Furthermore. the equalization scheme can be designed as a ripple-free converter for improving the input current distortion of the battery charging power system.

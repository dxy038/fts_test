A densely packed 2D phototransceiver array is an essential element in optical display and image processing applications. However, unlike the requirements of conventional lightwave WDM-based networks, very stringent power handling and dissipation requirements must be met. The pixel size can be limited to 100 /spl mu/m/spl times/100 /spl mu/m in a 100/spl times/100 or larger array. The objective is to detect, amplify and retransmit, possibly at a different wavelength, with input power /spl sim/1-5 /spl mu/W and electrical power consumption not to exceed 500 /spl mu/W. There is therefore a need to develop low-power phototransceivers. 2D arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), operating with ultra-low threshold current, large quantum efficiency, low-beam divergence and very low power dissipation can be used for this application. However, microcavity light emitting diodes (MCLEDs) provide very high wall-plug efficiency, comparable to VCSELs at low current levels (Deppe et al, 1999). The monolithic integration of high-sensitivity heterojunction phototransistors (HPTs) and MCLEDs in a phototransceiver is therefore very attractive for agile sensor technologies. We report here the design and performance characteristics of GaAs based multiquantum well HPT/MCLED low-power phototransceivers which offer the potential of large area uniformity and less sensitivity to temperature variations.

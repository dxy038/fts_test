The micromanipulator is a device to enhance robot accuracy by allowing small, fast position corrections to be introduced near the end effector of a standard industrial robot. The objective of this paper is to discuss global issues for the design, manufacture, and implementation of this module. The kinematic and dynamic modeling method of the parallel mechanism is presented. The optimum geometric parameters for performing a given task are synthesized, based on the modeling simulation. Internal force, local maximum stress, and the deflection analyses are performed for critical loading cases to allow design of the hardware components. Design principles which address local and global objectives for the design of a micromanipulator are discussed, from the optimization point of view. The concept of designing a flexural joint to have low stiffness, low inertia, low friction, and no backlash while maintaining a kinematically sound system is discussed in detail. Finally, to eliminate the need for an external force sensor, an integral 6 DOF force sensing system would be included in the final design

This paper presents group membership service for JXME (JXTA4J2ME) extended with single or bidirectional authentication. It is based on the trusted group membership service for JXTA described in our previous article [June 2004]. In this article we present a framework that we have developed. This framework allows wireless and remote peers, called in this article JXME Peers, to participate in JXTA network. JXTA relays are taking care of most tasks required to maintain the status of JXME peers allowing them to act as a full-rights member of a peer group. The proposed solution exploits certificates and PKI (public key infrastructure). All information about the systemÂ´s users is kept in the LDAP.

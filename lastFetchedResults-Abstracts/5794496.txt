MIMO is a model that tries to integrate some of the main current object models (SQL3, ODMG-93, UML), covering all the database development phases. It is defined in the framework of the ENEAS/BD project, that is being developed by the &#8220;Grupo de Bases de Datos Avanzadas&#8221; at &#8220;Universidad Carlos III&#8221;. An objective of ENEAS/BD is to allow the generation of ODMG-93 and/or SQL3 schemata from an object analysis in MIMO. Therefore, MIMO must integrate the object models of both standards. This paper summarises an approximation to the correspondence between the database standards SQL3 and ODMG-93 (mainly centred in their type systems) accomplished through the construction level of MIMO. A comparison among the type system of both standards and MIMO is also achieved

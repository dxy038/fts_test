The paper develops a numerical procedure based on
constrained optimization for evaluating the modal transformation
matrices of overhead transmission lines and underground cables.
In the method, the eigenvalueâ€“eigenvector equation is transformed
into an objective function which is then minimized for finding
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The method developed avoids
completely the problem of eigenvalue switching which causes the
discontinuities of eigenvectors encountered in the QR-method.
Initial values for starting the optimization at each frequency
are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors evaluated at the preceding
frequency. This technique leads to the set of smooth eigenvectors
that define the modal transformation matrices. The form of the
objective function derived in the paper for minimization together
with the sequential quadratic programming technique guarantees
that convergence to valid eigenvalues and eigenvectors is achieved.
Using the method, transformation matrices for a wide range of
frequency for representative double-circuit line and underground
cable are evaluated.

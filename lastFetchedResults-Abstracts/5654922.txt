The planning of regional bus timetable plays an important role in the transit dispatching. This paper suggests a multi-objective model to plan the regional bus timetable, where the average transfer waiting time for reducing the transfer time and passengerÂ´s dissatisfaction are explicitly taken into account. According to the specialty of the model, the Elitist Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm-&#928; (NSGA-II) is employed to search a group of Pareto optimal solutions for the model. Finally, a numerical example is conducted to verify the suggested model and algorithm based on the realistic traffic data. Numerical results show the validation and applicability of the model and algorithm.

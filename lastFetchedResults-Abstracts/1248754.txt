Well-trained staffs completed the questionnaire and measured students' weight and height. Malnutrition estimated the Z-score less than -2SD for underweight, stunting and wasting were calculated using the cutoffs from WHO references.
Results: Generally, malnutrition was observed in 3.20%, 4.93% and 5.13% based on underweight, stunting and wasting respectively. It was more common in girls than in boys and in Sistani than in other ethnic groups. The correlation between malnutrition based on underweight and stunting and ethnicity was statistically significant (P=0.001). Results of logistic regression analyses showed that the risk of malnutrition was in rural area 1.34 times more than urban area, in girls 1.17 times more than boys, in Sistani ethnic group 1.82 times more than Fars-native ethnic group, in low economic families 2.01 times more than high economic families.

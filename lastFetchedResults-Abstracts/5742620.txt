Objective In order to reduce the region of the tumor target´s breathing movement . Method This method adopts a set of inversely tracking system developed by us to inversely track the path of tumor target´s breathing movement, and we use the protel SE software to design a set of simulation circuit system to imitate the working principle of the inversely tracking system. Result The motor stepper which is used to drive the tracking couch to work can turn around synchronously and inversely relative to the phase of the input control sine signal . The input sine signal is assumed as the periodical regulation of the tumor target´s breathing movement. Conclusion In this way we can effectively reduce the influence on Radiation Therapy caused by tumor target ´s breathing movement. But what we should do is how to increase the accuracy of the motor stepper´s working in order to make the tracking couch offset the displacement of tumor´s breathing movement at largest extend.

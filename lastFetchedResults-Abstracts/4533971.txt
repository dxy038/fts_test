In conventional directional sensor networks, coverage control for each sensor is based on a 2D directional sensing model. However, 2D directional sensing model cannot accurately characterize the actual application scene of image/video sensor networks. To remedy this deficiency, we propose a 3D directional sensor coverage-control model with tunable orientations. In order to improve the efficiency of target-detecting, we develop a virtual potential-field based coverage-enhancing scheme to improve the coverage performance. Furthermore, we apply the simulated annealing algorithm for objective optimization. The extensive simulations show the effectiveness of our proposed 3D sensing model and coverage enhancing method.

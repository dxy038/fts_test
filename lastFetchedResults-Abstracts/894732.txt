We introduce a class of facility location problems and its solution. We concern about locating a set of facilities on a two dimensional space. The location of facilities is with respect to a set of dynamic demands known as evidence to the central decision unit. This policy also regards an objective of minimizing a total loss function. RA-DV-FS as which stands for Reactive Agent-Dynamic Voronoi-Diagram Facility Spread is the method's name. After mathematically studying this method in two distinct approaches, we exemplify it on two case studies; are report in a forest and a burglary and crime report in a small city. Afterwards, a narrow study will ponder the time complexity of our solution algorithm on the first method.

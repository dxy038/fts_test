Purpose
The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) in South Carolina (SC). ASDs are defined to include Autism, Asperger Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder–Not Otherwise Specified (PDD–NOS).
Methods

The study area consisted of the eastern half of SC (23 counties), and is part of a larger CDC-funded surveillance network of 16 sites in 18 states. The clinical, medical, and educational records of children who were born in the year 1992 were reviewed and abstracted for the purpose of this study. Final ASD status was assigned by expert reviewers using an objective and reliable coding system.
Results

Children with ASDs were 75% male, 25% female, 48% white, 39% black or African American, 12% not reported, and 1% other. Eighty-one percent of these children received school services based on the following federal disability categories: Autism, MR, Other Health Impaired, Specific Learning Disabilities, Emotional Disturbance. Eighty-eight percent of all ASD cases had a cognitive measure, and, of these, 64% had confirmed MR. Specific characteristics of ASDs presenting in greater than 10% of cases were: showing little or no interest in others (32%), movement preoccupation (17%), sensory preoccupation (15%), markedly restricted interests (15%), regression/loss of social or language skills (14%), absent or impaired imaginative play (13%), language primarily echolalia or jargon (12%). Eighty-five percent of ASD cases presented with the associated features of hyperactivity, short attention span, or impulsivity.
Conclusion

The ASD gender distribution in SC is consistent with that reported in other areas, and the racial distribution reflects that of the state as a whole. No single diagnostic feature emerged that reliably discriminated children with autism from other children, but this ongoing study will later address the potential clustering of features, as well as changes in ASD prevalence over time.

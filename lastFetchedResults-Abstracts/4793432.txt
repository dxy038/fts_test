Shunt active power filter is suitable to compensate current-type harmonics generated by nonlinear load. However which generates high frequency switching harmonic current into the power grid by using the pulse width modulation (PWM) technology. So the switching harmonic filter must be used to eliminate ripple current. Based on the analysis of the working principle of switching harmonic filter, the mathematical model of output filter in APF is constructed. A multi-objective optimization model of switching harmonic filter, where the compensation performance of APF and filtering performance of output filter are selected as objectives, is established via goal programming method. And optimization method based on genetic algorithm is presented. Optimized switching harmonic filter can not only eliminate switch harmonic effectively but also enhance the compensation ability of the APF.

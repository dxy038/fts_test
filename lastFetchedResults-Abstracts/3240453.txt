The research starts with the backbone skeleton by focusing on three types of backbone which is human backbone, dinosaur backbone and dolphin backbone to study the locking system of these backbones as well the form and method of stacking also the element that have in stacking the backbone. Thereby the objective of this research is to make a constructive artwork from the interpretation from the backbone structure as well to identified the suitable locking system that already exist in the backbone and the stylizations form the back bone to find the right technique using ceramic material in minimizing the defect problem for the right design especially for the back bone design. The method in proceeding this research is tostudy on the locking system and method on constructed the part towards the backbone structure as well the element that shows in each bone that forming the backbone. Study on art form whereas focusing on determining the element and principle that will be applied into artwork, solving the technical problem and the troubleshooting of some risky area in producing artwork. Forming process will be divided by two series which is twenty pieces per series. The size and measurement will decrease and increasing inch by inch for each bone from start to the end. Basically throwing method will be use to make base form for the artwork. For the first series, pulling technique will be use as boneÂ´s part, and press mould technique for the second series. At the end of the process, it expected to create a new constructive art form from the skeleton as well determining the locking system so it will be useful in the future for others student that have a similar field of study. At the end of the study, this research shows the right methods on working with constructive form using ceramic as main material by using skeleton as the subject.

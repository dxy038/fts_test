Introduction: Several different cell types have been identified morphologically in the epididymal epithelium in male mammals. They absorb luminal fluid and secret sperm-maturation glycoconjugates. Lectin histochemical method is useful for detection of glycocojugates with specific terminal sugars.
Objective: This study surveys the distribution of glycoconjugates containing terminal sugals in cells of different areas of epididym and its canal sperms by the use of lectins.
Materials and Methods: Sample of epididymal tissue was obtained from 30 adult male BALB/C mouse. After fixation and routine laboratory process, 5Âµm sections was prepared from paraffin blocks. Slides were exposed to lectins with lectin-histochemistry. Then the slides were assessed by light microscope and graded reaction intensity in different cells.
Results: Basal cells reacted to MPA, SBA and principal cells to all of lectins. Reaction intensity in essential cells was different as compared to various lectins and a special lectin in different areas of epididym. Narrow cells reacted to LTA, MPA and clear cells reacted to all of lectins. There wasn't any reaction in basal lamina and interstitial tissue except for MPA.
Conclusion: epididymis secrets many sperm-maturation related glycoconjugates. Different reactions in different Probably synthesieed glycoconjugates in basal cells due to inability to reach lumen and limited reaction in membrane, are used for repair and reconstruction of membrane. Faint or lack of reactions in caput of epididymis and appearance in corpus principal cells indicates that these cells in caput are involved in fluid absorption and/or glycoconjugates secretion in corpus. Epididymal sperm transit are accompanied with focuse content increasing and alternation in other terminal sugars.

This paper presents an approach to design a multi-objective static output feedback controller for active suspension. In the framework of the multi-objective static output feedback control, in order to obtain a H2/generalized H2 controller which has good disturbance attenuation performance and satisfies time-domain hard constraints, a new hybrid algorithm is proposed by combination of linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach and a hybrid algorithm of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE). The proposed algorithm is used to solve an optimization problem with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints. The PSO-DE hybrid algorithm was used to obtain a population of controllers, and LMI optimization was used to optimize a performance criterion of the system. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed approach can improve the riding comfort and handling stability of vehicles.

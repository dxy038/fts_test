Mining core group from a network community is significant for researches on information communication, since the core group impacts greatly on information controlling and information producing in network community. In this paper, we have an empirical study on DONEWS, and our approach to find out the core group involves the following considerations. First, the circumstances of internal link and external link are considered for the influence of the components in and out of the community. Second, the co-link of components is analyzed to give an objective sight on the relationship of the bloggers. Besides, the inter-link between each Blogger is mined to find out the interaction between Bloggers and the acceptance by other Bloggers. This paper mines the core group of DONEWS from various aspects and the conclusion is adoptable.

Fixed Series Compensation (FSC) employs capacitors to compensate the inductive reactance of transmission lines, being a highly effective and economical means of improving power transfer. A Fixed Series Compensation Monitoring System has as objective the knowledge of the actual physical state of this FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) system and diagnose the evolution of components damage, so that it is possible to foresee the need of intervention (supply interruption) and preventive maintenance in the monitored equipment. The main purpose of this paper is to present the FSC Monitoring System, a tool for preventive maintenance of the equipments that compose the FSC, minimizing risks of blackouts in a Power Transmission System.

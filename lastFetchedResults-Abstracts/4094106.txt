We demonstrated a Gigabit bidirectional transmission over a single step-index plastic optical fiber running at 20 m. The solution is attractive for potentially low-cost consumer electronic short-distance cabling at a high data rate requiring simple installation. In particular, thanks to the extremely small cable diameter (2.2 mm overall), it may find applications in brown-field installations that have to reuse existing ducts.

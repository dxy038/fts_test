Trust and trustworthiness apply to a wide range of applications in automation and human interactions. Their definitions and characteristics vary depending on the context and the situation. Nevertheless, they are significant because of risk, vulnerability, uncertainty, and confidence. In this paper we review past work to converge our understanding of Trust (human centric and subjective) and trustworthiness (hardware/software centric and objective) across fields including literature from psychological, sociological, economic, automation, and cyberspace perspectives of trust. We expect to create a more rigorous definition of trust and trustworthiness that leads to finding the appropriate metrics to measure trust and trustworthiness dynamically.

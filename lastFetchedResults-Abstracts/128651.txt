Objective: The main reason for hospitalisation of dialysed patients is due to high levels of blood pressure and fluid volume excess. The purpose of this study is determine the effects of applying continuous care model on blood pressure and weight control in Hemodialysed (HD) patients in Hamedan province in 2005.
Materials & Methods: This is a repeated measure design that thirty
eight HD patients were selected with simple randomized sampling
and were assigned in one group for the purpose of this research, which
were investigated over six months. Data collection tools include: demographic questionnaire and control check lists. In the first phase of the research performed orientation stage in control group and until the end of the period he completed the questionnaires and control check lists only. Immediately after this time the researcher started to have some manipulations over the same group that had been considered as case. The present researchers applied SPSS Software V (13), descriptive statistics, Paired t-test and Friedman statistical test to analyze the collected data. 
Results: Data analysis shows that with repeated measurement_ there is a significant relationship between applying continuous care model and amounts of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of HD patients (p--O/ 05). Repeated measurement Anova test showed, there is not a significant relationship between applying continuous care model and amounts of weight control of HD patients.
Conclusion: According to these findings, applying CCM causes significant difference in the levels of blood pressure of HD patients.

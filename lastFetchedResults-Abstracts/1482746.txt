The project objective was to determine the CLA content of three muscles (Longissimus lumborum, LD; Semimembranosus, SM; Triceps brachii, TB), in both raw and cooked states, in cattle finished on pasture or with grain supplements. Cattle were randomly assigned to one of four finishing regimens; pasture (n = 11), pasture with grain supplement (n = 11), pasture with grain supplement containing soyoil (n = 12), and feedlot (n = 12). In the raw state, TB had higher (P &lt; 0.05) CLA than LD or SM on a mg/g sample basis. Total CLA was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the soyoil diet when compared to the other three feeding regimes on a mg/g sample basis and when expressed as mg/g fat in both raw and cooked analyses. Pasture inclusion produced higher levels (P &lt; 0.05) of total CLA than the feedlot diet on a mg/g fat basis for cooked samples while maintaining acceptable eating quality.

This paper deals with the application of nonlinear &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> control techniques to a underactuted mechanical system, which is named as PPCar. A comparison between two nonlinear &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> control strategies is presented. The first one considers only the position and velocity errors in the cost vector. In the second one the integral position error is added with the objective to obtain the null steady-state error and a bounded linear velocity. The underactuted mechanical system formulation is extended here to the second controller. Simulation results are obtained to confirm that the proposed strategy improve the initial controller.

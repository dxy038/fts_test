Background and Objective: Arthrosis of the hip joint is one of the most common complications of patients and many efforts have been made to find its etiology. One of the subjects important for researchers is morphologic parameters of the hip joint and its relationship with osteoarthritis of this joint. Since these parameters themselves are affected by physical parameters of the body and the race, we made an endeavor to study these parameters in an Iranian population.
Materials and Methods: 300 normal anteroposterior radiograms of the pelvis were studied for anatomic parameters of the hip joint including: center edge angle of Wiberg, acetabular index, neck-shaft angle and head-neck ratio. Physical parameters of subjects including height, weight and body mass index (BMI) were recorded. The relationship between these parameters were studied using SPSS software.
Results: Mean center-edge angle was 34 degrees, mean acetabular index was 38 degrees, mean head-neck ratio was 1.4 and mean neck-shaft angle was 130 degrees. Center-edge angle was greater than 25 degrees in 4.7% of our population. With respect to correlation between anatomic parameters of the hip and physical parameters, neck-shaft angle and height, and also head-neck ratio and BMI had positive correlations with neck-shaft angle and BMI, but head-neck ratio and height had inverse correlation.
Conclusion: The mean parameters of hip joint in Iranian population are similar to other populations. In our population, 4.7% of asymptomatic hips had acetabular dysplasia.

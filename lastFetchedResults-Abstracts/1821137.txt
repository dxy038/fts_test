Objective
 the influence of salivary flow on physiological parameters of the stomatognathic system in patients who take beta-blockers or anxiolytic medications.

patients were divided into three groups based on the following criteria: Group 1, control (n = 20; no use of medication); Group 2, use of antihypertensive beta-blockers (n = 20); and Group 3, use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics (n = 20). Salivary flow was assessed by determining stimulated and non-stimulated flow/minute. The quantification of the sense of taste was determined on a visual analogue scale (VAS) using solutions of 0.9% NaCl (salty), 50% sucrose (sweet), 20% unsweetened coffee (bitter) and 4.2% vinegar (sour). The DMFT index (number of decayed/missing/filled teeth) was determined by a calibrated examination, following the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Masticatory performance was assessed with an Optosil comminution test and Rosim–Ramler equation.
s
sults did not reveal a significant correlation between salivary flow and masticatory performance (p &gt; 0.05). We observed significant decreased non-stimulated salivary flow for Group 2 (p = 0.05) when compared to controls. However, taste perception was not influenced by salivary secretion amongst groups. Furthermore, we observed a significant negative correlation between non-stimulated salivary flow and DMFT in Group 1 (p = 0.02; r = −0.52).
sions
ts under beta-blockers therapy presented reduced non-stimulated salivary flow when compared to controls, without influencing the sense of taste or masticatory performance. The use of anxiolytics did not affect salivary flow and taste perception in the studied sample.

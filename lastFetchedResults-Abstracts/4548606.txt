This paper discusses the integration of an inverted- F antenna with solar cells for power harvesting. The objective is to achieve a multi-source energy collecting system in order to improve the RF to DC conversion efficiency. The inverted-F antenna can be used either for communication or to scavenge the ambient RF energy when connected to the appropriate rectifying circuit. A prototype of the antenna is fabricated and tested as a proof of concept.

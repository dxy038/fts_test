A method for setting parameters of excitation systems is proposed in this paper. There are two steps in the method. Firstly, large signal performance is tested with some large signal objective indexes, and then parameters of the excitation system are identified. Secondly, the parameters of the excitation system are optimized through small signal performance test with the ITAE criterion. Several studied cases such as standard excitation systems of IEEE type AC1, AC2 and ST1 are presented. Simulation results show the method developed in the paper is effective in parameter setting of excitation systems.

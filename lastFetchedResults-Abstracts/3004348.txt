In real applications of the virtual enterprise, there are many lies when agents negotiate with each other about tasks and rewards. To resist the lies, a general evaluation and decision model and a correspondent method are proposed. Negotiation data are not always trusted but evaluated by means of fuzzy reasoning to decide whether and how much we should rely on it. Because fuzzy rules are obtained based on data mining in former evaluation and decision data, the method is objective. Experiments demonstrate that the model is suitable and the method is effective and reliable.

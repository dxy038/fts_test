An improved method of extracting the modeling parameters, small-signal equivalent circuit parameters, is proposed in this paper, including the approaches of determining all elementsÂ´ sensitivities to the sum of error functions, optimization sequence and direction of objective functions with eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hessian matrix, and approach of damping algorithm. The agreement is good between the calculated values and the measurement ones of MESFET.

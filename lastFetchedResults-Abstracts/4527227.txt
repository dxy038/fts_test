The objective of this presentation is to describe a general methodology for adaptive processing using conformal arrays for a single snap shot of data and without any statistical assumption on the noise and the interferences. The antenna elements in a conformal array can be unequally spaced and they need not be situated over a planar surface. In addition the antenna elements can have a directive gain. The goal is to present a signal processing methodology coupled with electromagnetic physics that can deal with non-uniformly spaced directive antenna elements over a conformal surface.

The main goal of this paper is to develop a time to line crossing (TLC) computation for onboard indicator development and control objective criterium. Different computational methods with increasing complexity are provided. For TLC computation, both straight and curved vehicle paths are considered. An observer is proposed for the estimation of the necessary variables. Finally some control methods, which used directly or indirectly the TLC as a control variable, are proposed.

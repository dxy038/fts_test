The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of sustained release of rhBMP-2, grafted to biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) based on osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem (BMS) cells. The release kinetics of rhBM-2 was linear with incubation time in the first two weeks. rhBMP-2 grafted NPs were as effective in inducing mineralization as the rhBMP-2 directly added to the culture media. rhBMP-2 grafted NPs had much higher expression of osteogenic markers osteopontin (OP) and osteocalcin (OC), compared to the protein directly added to culture media.

Vehicle ride comfort is a function of the frequency content of transmitted vibrations
to passengers from road irregularities. However, this frequency content varies with vehicle speed
fluctuations, which occur under real traffic conditions. The design of an adaptive active suspension system,
in order to simultaneously improve ride comfort and travel suspension under various traffic conditions,
is addressed in this paper. For this purpose, using a full-vehicle model, with eight degrees of freedom,
two separate fuzzy controllers are designed for front and rear suspensions. The parameters of the fuzzy
controllers are then tuned for various traffic conditions of a driving pattern, using a multi-objective
Pareto-optimal solution. The optimization objectives are: the ride comfort index, evaluated according to
the ISO 2631-1 standard, and the maximum suspension travel. Simulation results prove that the multiobjective
fuzzy controller conventionally tuned, based on the constant speed driving pattern, results in
simultaneous improvement of ride comfort, travel suspension and energy consumption. However, this
controller does not work optimally under all traffic conditions. On the other hand, the proposed adaptive
multi-objective controller not only results in optimal ride comfort and travel suspension under various
traffic conditions, but also leads to a considerable drop in active suspension energy consumption.

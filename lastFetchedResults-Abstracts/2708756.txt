A fast method for computing the action of shape-differentiated electric field integral equation (EFIE) system matrix to a vector is derived exploiting the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA). The proposed method is used in conjunction with the adjoint-variable method (AVM) to compute the shape gradient of arbitrary objective functions depending on shape of a metallic scatterer. The method is demonstrated numerically by optimizing the shape of a parabolic reflector illuminated with a half-wave dipole.

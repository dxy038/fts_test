In inland districts, fishponds cultured products are the main source of aquatic products in the market. Site selection is a key factor for environmental construction and aquatic products safety. This study makes use of the water quality and pollution source gained through determining, investigating, and integrating geographic information system (GIS) and multi-objective decision analysis to ensure the suitability index for fishponds construction. Based on the suitability index, the appropriate areas for fishponds construction were selected. All the areas are graded from 1 (the highest suitability) to 5 (the lowest suitability). By utilizing reclassification tool and the criteria weights of the candidate sites, the study areas are divided into `best´, `good´ and `unsuitable´ areas. `Best´ fish pond areas represent optimal sites; `good´ fish pond areas can be used as back-up candidate sites. This work offers a scientific methodology on the fishponds site selection for decision-makers, especially in the inland districts.

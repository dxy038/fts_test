The objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility of a high frequency AC link (HFACL) converter as a phase shifter in a power transmission system (PTS). The approach is to analyze its basic operation in a PTS and to develop a detailed model of the HFACL phase shifter for EMTP simulation study. The design method of the HFACL phase shifter and the control algorithm to implement a HFACL phase shifter as a power flow controller in the PTS are proposed. In the process of the simulation study, useful technical evaluations of the HFACL phase shifter are performed

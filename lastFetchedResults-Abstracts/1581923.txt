We consider the dividend payments of a self-financing firm in the stochastic Ramsey model. The firm invests in capital stock and its production technology is given by the Cobbâ€“Douglas function. Our objective is to maximize the expected present value of future real dividends subject to a positive constraint on the capital stock. We use the penalization method to obtain a solution for the variational inequality associated with the optimal growth problem and give a synthesis of the optimal dividend policy.

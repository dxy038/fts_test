Background and Objective: Inefficiency of deep cervical flexor muscles are correlated with chronic neck pain. The purpose of this study was to determine and to compare longus colli muscle dimensions between rest and maximum isometric contraction in patients with chronic neck pain and healthy subjects.

Materials and Methods: For this case-control study, 16 healthy matched subjects and 16 patients with chronic neck pain were recruited. Using ultrasonography, anterio-posterior, lateral, and cross-sectional dimensions of longus colli in resting position and during maximal isometric contraction of deep cervical flexor muscles were determined. Data were analyzed using paired and independent t-tests. 

Results: Cross-sectional area of longus coli muscle in patients with chronic neck pain in resting position and during contraction was 107.6±38.2 and 89.4±32.03 (p < 0.0001) and in healthy subjects was 89.31±32.97 and 75.94±29.43 (p < 0.0001) respectively. There was no significant difference between two groups regarding study variables in both resting position and contraction (p > 0.05). 

Conclusion: The results showed that cross-sectional area and lateral diameter of longus coli muscle in both patients and healthy subjects and anterio-posterior diameter only in healthy subjects during contraction are lower than resting position. However, anterio-posterior diameter of longus coli in patient with chronic neck pain during contraction was similar to resting position.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between serum calcium (Ca) and inorganic phosphorus (IP) values and urine pH of cows fed common rations without the addition of anionic salts in late pregnancy. One hundred and seven Holstein cows, having completed two or more lactations and with an expected calving date within the next seven days were selected from two herds. In order to determine levels of serum Ca and IP and urine pH, blood and urine samples were collected seven to one days before parturition. Of the 107 sampled cows, 17 developed recumbency after calving and were considered to be affected by milk fever. There were significant (p&lt;0.01) negative correlations between urine pH and serum Ca, IP and the ratio of Ca to IP, The urine pH, and levels of serum Ca and IP measured within 48 h prior to parturition differed significantly (p&lt;0.001) between recumbent and non-recumbent cows.

nsitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of urine pH test 48 h prior to parturition, using a cut off level of above pH 8.25, were 100%, 81%, 55%, and 100%, respectively. These signify that monitoring urine pH within 48 h prior to parturition is a sensitive method to assess the risk of parturient paresis. The results of this study emphasize the importance of acidâ€“base status of the animal in the pathophysiology of milk fever.

The result shows that cluster analysis is helpful to summarize the common understanding of experience including concept of syndrome differentiation, regulation of diagnosis and treatment, prescription characteristic, which based on FHDsÂ´ prevention and treatment of influenza (including A H1N1), viral hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Association rules greatly contributed to the judgment of relationship between etiology, syndrome, symptoms and herbal prescription of infectious diseases. In conclusion, DMT provides technical support for concise and inheritance of academic thought which originates from FHDs. DMT is of high application value in research of experience of FHDs and relevant literature, and is worth further discussion.

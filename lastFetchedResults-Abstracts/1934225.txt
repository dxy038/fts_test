The objective of this study was to assess the influence of temperature and time on the storage of fresh Steindachneridion parahybae oocytes. Two experiments were carried out: (1) the fertilization rates of oocytes exposed to temperatures of 5, 15, 28 (room temperature) and 35 °C were assessed 15 min (control), 115, 235 and 355 min after release; (2) the fertilization and hatching rates, as well as the percentage of normal larvae of oocytes exposed to 14, 17 or 20 °C, 20 min (control) were assessed 50, 80 and 110 min after stripping. In the first experiment, the highest fertilization rates (P &lt; 0.05) were obtained in the control treatment (15 min, 28 °C), with 74.34 ± 5.48% oocytes showing loss of viability over time. In the second experiment, there was a reduction (P &lt; 0.05) in the fertilization rates at the temperatures and times tested. The artificial fertilization of S. parahybae oocytes is recommended immediately after collection, and if storage is necessary, it should be conducted at temperatures between 17 and 20 °C.

Not So Cooperative Caching (NSCC) considers a network comprised of selfish nodes; each is with caching capability and an objective of reducing its own access cost by fetching data from its local cache or from neighboring caches. These nodes would cooperate in caching and share cached content if and only if they each benefit. The challenges are to determine what objects to cache at each node and to implement the system in the context of Information Centric Networking (ICN). This work includes both a solution for the NSCC problem and a design and implementation of an NSCC system in Named Data Networking (NDN), a large effort that exemplifies ICN. Our design applies NDN synchronization protocol to facilitate the information exchange among nodes, adopts group key encryption to control data access within the NSCC group, and offers an error checker to detect error events in the system. Our approach is validated by deploying the system we developed on PlanetLab.

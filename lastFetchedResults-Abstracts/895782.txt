Background: Given the wide range of microwave applications in human life, their effects on biological tissues are still controversial.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 950 MHz cell phone microwave radiation on morphometric changes of testis in rabbit. 
Methods: In this experimental study, 18 New Zealand male rabbits were randomly divided into control, 3 W and 6 W groups. Unlike the control group, the experimental groups were exposed to simulated 950 MHz and 3 or 6 W microwave radiation 2 hours a day for 2 weeks. After one week rest, the animals were sacrificed using anesthesia and microscopic slides were prepared from their testis. The seminiferous tubular diameter and spermatogonia, spermatocyte, spermatid and sperm counts were determined. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis. 
Findings: The number of spermatogonia cells in the 6 W group was decreased significantly compared to the control group and the 3 W group. There were no significant differences between the 3 W group and the control group in terms of the spermatogonia cell count. Spermatocyte cell count and spermatid cell count were found to be significantly different between 3 groups. Sperm count was significantly different between the 6 W group and the control group.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, it seems that the microwave radiation with 950 MHz frequency can lead to detrimental effects on rabbit spermatogenesis by changing the number of spermatogenetic cell line.

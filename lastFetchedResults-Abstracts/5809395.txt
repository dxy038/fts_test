Statistical propagation models for the combined effect of ionospheric scintillation and terrestrial multipath are derived. These models are used to determine the satellite link performance of the mobile user objective system (MUOS) under various operational conditions. The models are described by first order statistics in the form of probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). The PDFs include combinations of Rayleigh, Rician and lognormal distribution functions. The corresponding CDFs are used to assess satellite link performance and establish link margins. The degrading effect of combined ionospheric scintillation and terrestrial multipath fading on link availability is illustrated with a number of examples.

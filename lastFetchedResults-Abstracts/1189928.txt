The objective of this study is to design a fuzzy expert system for performance assessment of health, safety, environment (HSE) and ergonomics system factors in a gas refinery. This will lead to a robust control system for continuous assessment and improvement of HSE and ergonomics performance. The importance of this study stems from the current lack of formal integrated methodologies for interpreting and evaluating performance data for HSE and ergonomics. Three important reasons to use fuzzy expert systems are (1) reduction of human error, (2) creation of expert knowledge and (3) interpretation of large amount of vague data. To achieve the objective of this study, standard indicators and technical tolerances for assessment of HSE and ergonomics factors are identified. Then, data is collected for all indicators and consequently, for each indicator four conditions are defined as “acceptance”, “low deviation”, “mid deviation” and “high deviation”. A membership function is defined for each fuzzy condition (set) because an indicator cannot be allocated to just one of the above conditions. The expert system uses fuzzy rules, which are structured with Data Engine. Previous studies have introduced HSE expert system whereas this study introduces an integrated HSE and ergonomics expert system through fuzzy logic.

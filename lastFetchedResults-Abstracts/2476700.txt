In this paper, the problem of observer-based robust fault detection (RFD) for nonlinear networked systems with stochastic interval delay is investigated. By employing the information of probabilistic distribution of networked-induced time-varying delay, the observer-based fault detection filter as residual generator and a proposed performance index as objective function, the RFD of nonlinear networked systems is formulated as an optimization problem. The desired fault detection filter is constructed in terms of certain linear matrix inequalities, which depend on not only delay-interval but also delay-interval-occurrence-rate. Especially, the sub-optimal trade-off of strong robustness from residual signal to disturbance and parameter uncertainty, as well as high sensitivity to fault is obtained by a repeated application of a two-objective optimization algorithm. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed techniques.

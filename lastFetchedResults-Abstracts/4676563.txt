The character of reactive power in wind power integrated system affects active power losses and voltage level of the entire system. For the influence from the randomness of wind speed to entire system power flow, a reactive power optimization model based on Robust Optimization (RO) is presented firstly. With minimizing power losses as an objective, the uncertainty of the wind speed is taken as a random variable and demonstrated in a "box" uncertainty set for transforming the uncertain constraints into the certain form. The duality theorem is utilized to simplify the model to be general linear programming ones. IEEE30-node system is used as an example to test the model and method. The results show that the random wind speed is quantitated effectively, power losses are reduced, and even the voltage of entire system can be restricted within regular range. The reactive power optimization method with RO is simple, feasible and significant.

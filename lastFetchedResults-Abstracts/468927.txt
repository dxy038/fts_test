Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of celecoxib on prostaglandin, cytokine, and nitric oxide synthesis in the pregnant rabbit.
Study design
Pregnant rabbits received celecoxib from 13 to 20 days (celecoxib-A), from 13 to 28 days (celecoxib-B), or vehicle from 13 to 28 days by gavage. Blood and tissue were assayed for prostaglandin, cytokine, and nitric oxide oxidation products.
Results
Preterm delivery occurred in 4 of 11 controls, 0 of 9 in celecoxib-A, and 0 of 8 in celecoxib-B. Plasma prostaglandin F2α was reduced in both treated groups at 20 days and at delivery in celecoxib-B. Plasma thromboxane B2 was suppressed in celecoxib-B at 20 days and delivery. Cervical prostaglandin E2 was increased; uterine and cervical plasma thromboxane B2 declined in celecoxib-B. Celecoxib administration suppressed plasma nitric oxide oxidation products at delivery and cervical nitric oxide oxidation products in celecoxib-B. Uterine and cervical interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 were decreased, and uterine tumor necrosis factor-α increased in celecoxib-B.
Conclusion
Further studies are required to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors in the setting of preterm parturition.

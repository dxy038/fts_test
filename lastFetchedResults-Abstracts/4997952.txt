In the development of a real-time embedded control system it is necessary several types of professionals. The control engineerÂ´s tool is the functional block diagram, since it describes the mathematical models of the controller being designed. Many development tools that use block diagrams also automatically generate code. The objective of this work is to show how it is possible to evaluate, through an algebraic model, the timing behavior of the multitask system generated automatically by Simulink/MatLab, together with its real-time microkernel. This modeling allows the control engineer a better understanding of the timing behavior of the tasks, including the identification of delay and jitter problems

A message-passing multicomputer is presented, and its application to image processing and reconstruction is outlined. The multicomputer may be seen as a one-dimensional array of computing nodes with bidirectional shuffle and shift connections. The resulting shuffle-shift machine is well suited for tasks like image processing and image reconstruction. A sample shuffle-shift machine has been built using transputers. The hardware and software aspects of this implementation are described, and benchmark results obtained with a number of image-oriented algorithms are included. The shuffle-shift machine is compared with related parallel computer architectures, and a two-dimensional generalization is indicated

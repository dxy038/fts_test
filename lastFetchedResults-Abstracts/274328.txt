Distributed Point Source Method (DPSM) is a semi-analytical technique that can be used to calculate the ultrasonic
field (pressure, velocity and displacement fields in a fluid, or stress and displacement fields in a solid) generated by ultrasonic
transducers. So far the technique has been used to model ultrasonic fields in homogeneous and multilayered fluid
structures, and near a fluidâ€“solid interface when a solid half-space is immersed in a fluid. In this paper, the method is
extended to model the ultrasonic field generated in a homogeneous isotropic solid plate immersed in a fluid. The objective
of this study is to model the generation of guided waves in a solid plate when ultrasonic beams from transducers of finite
dimension strike the plate at different critical angles. DPSM results for a solid half-space problem are compared with the
finite element predictions to show the superiority of the DPSM technique. The predicted results are also compared with the
experimental visualization of the mode patterns of Lamb waves propagating in a glass plate obtained from stroboscopic
photoelastic method. Experimental and theoretical results show good qualitative agreement. The DPSM technique is then
applied to study the mode patterns in aluminum plates immersed in water.

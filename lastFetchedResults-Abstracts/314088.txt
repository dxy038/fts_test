The main objective of this research was to investigate the effects of postural threat on performance of three clinical balance tests. Thirty-one healthy young adults performed quiet stance, maximal reach, and one-leg stance tasks at two levels of postural threat, which was modified through the use of a hydraulic lift. Increased postural threat significantly affected postural control measures for both simple and dynamic balance tests. Physiological and state anxiety increased as a result of increased postural threat whereas ratings of perceived stability and balance efficacy were reduced as a function of increased postural threat. Efforts to diagnose balance disorders based on balance performance may be confounded by the influence of psychological factors.

Introduction: The problem that engaged obstetrics & gynecologists was causes of polycystic ovaries (PCO) and one of its important clinical complications is infertility. Laparoscopy has high value and precision in disease diagnosis.       
Objective: This study aims to survey the prevalence of  PCO in infertility  by laparoscopy and its relation to age, duration and type of infertility in patients referring to Al-Zahra  hospital from 2005-2009.
Methods:  This cross sectional study was conducted on 357 infertile women referring to Al-Zahra hospital in Rasht city during 2005-2009 who went through diagnostic laparoscopy. Data were collected from patientsâ€™ medical charts and analyzed by descriptive and Chi-square tests.
Results: Based on gathered data 47.1% of sample were 25-35 years old and mean age was 27.8 years. In 56.9% of samples the duration of infertility was less than 4 years. 311woman (87.7%) had primary infertility and 41 woman (11.5%) had secondary infertility. Findings based on laparoscopy showed the prevalence of left ovary 51%, PCO3.6% ovarian cyst, 4.5% adherence and 2.5% endometriosis from which 0.3% abnormal and 36.7% was normal. In right ovary PCO was 50.4%, 4.8% had ovarian cyst, 3.6% adherence, 1.4% endometriosis, from which 0.6% abnormal and 38.1% were normal. There was a significant  relationship between PCO and age and prevalence was higher in under 25 year olds (95.2%) compare to 26.8% in older than 35 years(P < 0.01) but no significant relation was shown with duration of infertility.
Conclusion: In attention to result, PCO had higher incidence in patients referring to this center than other similar studies which shows increase of disease in society. Therefore prospective studies with more samples are recommended which can be a big step toward diagnosis, early treatment and decreased costs which will help economy.

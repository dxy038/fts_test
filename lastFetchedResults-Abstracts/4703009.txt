The main contribution of this paper is a new algorithm for dynamic routing of bandwidth guaranteed tunnels. The algorithm is a generalization of the &#8220;minimum-interference&#8221; based algorithm presented in Kodialam and Lakshman (2000). The routing objective is to satisfy as many potential future requests as possible in an environment where requests arrive one-by-one, and there is no knowledge of future arrivals other than their potential ingress-egress points. An application of these algorithms is for the routing of MPLS bandwidth-guaranteed label-switched paths (LSP). The presented algorithm performs better than the previous scheme, and other previously proposed algorithms, on several metrics like the number of rejected demands and successful re-routing of demands upon link failure. Also, the new algorithm is more robust in performance to implementations where most requests are routed with a shortest-path computation, and the computations required for determining &#8220;minimum-interference&#8221; are performed only infrequently

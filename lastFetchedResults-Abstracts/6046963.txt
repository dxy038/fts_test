The T1Q1.5 Video Teleconferencing/Video Telephony Subworking Group (SWG) was formed to draft a performance standard. Important questions were asked, relating to video digital performance characteristics of video teleconferencing/video telephony. Is it possible to measure motion artifacts with digital transport? If it can be done by objective measurements, can they be matched to subjective tests? Is it possible to correlate the objective measurements of analog and digital performance specifications? The SWGÂ´s attempt to answer these questions is discussed

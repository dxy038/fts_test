Fine grinding of barley grain has traditionally been considered to be a potential risk to rumen function, feed intake and milk yield. These concerns are thought to be reduced by steam-rolling or coarse dry rolling. We hypothesized that finely ground barley grain is as effective in stimulating feed intake and milk production as are dry- and steam-rolled barley grain, and so the objective was to determine effects of feeding either (1) finely ground, (2) steam-rolled, (3) finely dry-rolled, or (4) coarsely dry-rolled barley grain on rumen fermentation, digestibility and milk yield and composition. Eight multiparous midlactation Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4Ã—4 Latin square design experiment with four periods of 21 d. Diets contained 256 g barley grain/kg on a dry matter (DM) basis. Processing method did not affect milk yield and composition, DM intake, rumen pH and volatile fatty acids, fecal and urine pH, and apparent total tract nutrient digestibility. Results suggest that finely ground barley grain is no different than dry-rolled and steam-rolled barley grains in stimulating feed intake and productivity of midlactation cows, when 256 g of dietary DM/kg is barley grain.

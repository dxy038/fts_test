We present a computer aided education package allowing one to visualize the magnetic field in and around the magnetic circuit of a double-U shaped contactor. The objective of this application is to allow students to intuitively understand the distribution of the magnetic field when varying geometric, electric and magnetic parameters. The modeling of this problem is performed by solving in real time a nonlinear finite element problem. The implementation of this method is optimized in order to allow one to animate field patterns in real time in reaction to any user interaction.

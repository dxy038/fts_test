Long duration, to-and-fro interleaving transportation among multi supply places and multi demand places are main features of emergency goods logistics under large scale emergency incidents. To implement large scale emergency goods distribution effectively according to demand, the routes logistics optimization model among multi supply places and multi demand places under large scale emergency incident is established. Several preconditions of the model are given, the optimization objectives include that emergency routes should be selected along the largest emergency goods flow direction, the curve degree of emergency routes should be minimized, the burden of emergency routes should be balance, and the repeat parameter of emergency network should be minimized as far as possible. Some constraints such as transportation quantity, length, curve degree of emergency routes, avoiding of isolated point and the number limit of emergency routes are considered. Above multi-objective non-linear programming model is transferred, and its solving method by GA is designed. The emergency logistics problem within one certain typical region is taken as the research instance, the validity of the model and its solving algorithm is validated. The obtained calculation result shows that, under the precondition of meeting the emergency routesÂ´ length and flow quantity, the emergency network performances such as repeat parameter, route exchanging times per transportation, number of isolated nodes, burden balance degree of emergency routes, average curve degree of emergency routes are satisfied. Under large emergency incidents, above routes optimization model and algorithm will benefit for improving efficiency and precision of emergency logistics, and its maneuverability is strong.

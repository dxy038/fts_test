The advances in digital data collection and storage technologies during the last two decades allow companies and organizations store up huge amounts of electronic documents. Large collections of electronic text present opportunities and challenges. How to assist users to find the most relevant documents from vast text collections efficiently is one of the challenges. This study proposes a hierarchical clustering method to efficiently label documents that satisfy usersÂ´ information needs. An experiment was conducted to examine the proposed method and the results shown that the clustering method is effective and efficient, in terms of both objective and subjective measures.

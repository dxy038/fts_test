In this paper we present a biological Nano and MEMS communication platform that uses Nano logic computation based on controlled cell-signaling mechanisms. The proposed solution also integrates compartmentalisation techniques to support parallel processing. Based on our solution, our objective is to create a nanoscale communication networks between various biological Nano and MEMS devices within a tissue to support various medical applications (e.g. patient monitoring).

The objective of the work is to propose a Quality of Service (QoS) aware heterogeneous networking model for emergency management system using network virtualization. An emergency management information system is made up of heterogeneous communication and computing networks to address the crisis situation and adopt the network according to the service parameters. To meet the unpredictable demands and accept various data formats, some subnets of the heterogeneous network are virtualized using network virtualization techniques. The various protocols and the routing policies are selected based on the end services using the context of the emergency situations like flood, terrorist attack and fire. The overall action is coordinated by centralized government agency and the performance in terms of QoS of the heterogeneous network for emergency management system is simulated with mobile clients.

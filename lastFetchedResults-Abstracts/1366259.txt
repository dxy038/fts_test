Background: Ovarian tissue transplantation is emerging technologies for fertility preservation. In addition, in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes retrieved from ovarian tissues may overcome the fertility defects in certain cases. Objective: The aim was to evaluate the best site for ovarian tissue transplantation in mice. Also, feasibility of IVM of oocytes retrieved from auto grafted ovarian tissues was freshly assessed. Materials and Methods: Hemi-ovaries from 6 weeks old mice were auto grafted into kidney capsule (K) versus the back muscle (B) and leg muscle (L) in a mouse auto graft model which was stimulated with gonadotrophins. Then ovarian grafts were recovered and processed histologically for follicle assessment compared with control, also the ability of oocytes to mature with IVM was studied 14 days after transplantation. Results: Total follicle count was significantly higher in K-graft (3.5Â±3.17) and the antral follicles were only observed in K-site model. The number of retrieved immature oocytes as well as successful IVM in K-grafts was significantly higher than other groups (p=0.008, p=0.016). Conclusion: The kidney capsule is a promising site for ovarian tissue auto graft in mice. This resulted in better follicular survival and IVM outcomes

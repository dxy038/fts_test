The demands for recombinant proteins, in addition to plasmid DNA, for therapeutic use are steadily increasing. Bacterial fermentation processes have long been and still are the major tool for production of these molecules. The key objective of process optimization is to attain a high yield of the required quality, which is determined, to a large extent, by plasmid replication rates, metabolic capacity and the properties of the specific gene construct. When high copy number plasmids are used, the metabolic capacity of the host cell is often overstrained and efficient protein production is impaired. The plasmid copy number is the key parameter in the exploitation of the host cell, and can be maximized by optimal control of the flux ratios between biosynthesis of host cell proteins and recombinant proteins.

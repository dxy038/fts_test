The objective of this paper was to present a preparatory investigation of modeling of IC packages for chip-package co-design. Our work was focused on the modeling and parameter extraction methods of bond-wires. Based on two-port parameters, a lumped Pi-type equivalent circuit for a single-bond-wire was presented and the R, L, and C parameters of the bond-wire were extracted. In addition, multi-bond-wires were proposed for better performance by comparing their simulated S-parameters with measured results. Finally, a simple and low cost test structure was designed and made for validation of the parameterized model

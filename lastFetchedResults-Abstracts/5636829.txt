SystemC is a new open source library in C++ for developing cycle-accurate or more abstract models of software algorithms, hardware architecture and system-level designs. SystemC is meant to be an interoperable, modeling platform allowing seamless tool integration. Our objective is to evaluate the feasibility of linking a third party software to SystemC without modifying the SystemC source. We chose the development of a GUI as such an application. This application illustrates a set of applications following the observer pattern defined recently in software engineering. This class of applications can be loosely coupled to a platform designed following specific rules of software reuse

Models and analytical techniques are developed to evaluate the performance of time-synchronous packet networks with priority queueing disciplines. In cases which require approximation, the model was validated through extensive computer simulation and compared to analytical results. A local first-order Markov model based on a burstiness criterion is used to approximate the delay incurred by each class of traffic in a network. The application of this model to selected networks shows that it accurately predicts behavior of tandem (i.e. with and without departures), unidirectional, and bidirectional loop networks

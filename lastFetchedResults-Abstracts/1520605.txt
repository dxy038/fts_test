Background: Patients with hematologic malignancies are at risk of advanced tuberculosis. The prevalence of tuberculosis between these patients is 2.1- 2.6 percent. The cellular immune deficiency caused by hematologic malignancies and or its treatment increases the risk of tuberculosis in these patients. Multiple Myeloma is malignant proliferations of plasma cells that involves different classes of immune system. Cellular and humeral immune deficiency due to the Multiple Myeloma and drugs for its treatment results in susceptibility to unusual infections. Infections are of the important factors of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from multiple myeloma ,but coincidence of Multiple Myeloma and tuberculosis  is rare and very little has been reportedCase presentation: In this paper a 60-year-old woman from Kermanshah, Iran who is suffering from back pain, weight loss, weakness and sweating will be introduced. Spondylitis was seen in her lumbar imaging. Her husband suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis. In diagnostic studies tuberculose spondylitis and multiple myeloma were diagnosed simultaneously.Conclusion: Although the accompanying of Multiple Myeloma and tuberculosis is not common, but immunodeficiency caused by a hematologic malignancy as well as a history of close contact with a patient with tuberculosis resulted in tuberculosis of spine in this patient. Clinical features of abovementioned diseases are very similar. But in endemic area for tuberculosis, this disease should be considered because delay in diagnosis leads to increment in mortality and morbidities. Diagnosis of tuberculos spondylitis is based on radiologic and histologic features of the disease and on the response to treatment because the sensitivity of definitive diagnostic tests such as culture and PCR is low in extra pulmonary tuberculosis.

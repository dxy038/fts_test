In spite of poor efficiency of the photovoltaic systems developed up to date and the high cost of the installations of the equipment of this kind of station of solar energy conversion into electric power, this did not stop the researchers to continue to make efforts in this field in order to minimize the expenses of installation of equipment and to increase the output efficiency of the photovoltaic systems. In order to make solar energy competitive with the other forms of renewable energies, a better exploitation of its advantages especially environmental side, this will be possible only with the development of the less expensive and high output efficiency systems. The objective of this work is to bring a contribution to the study of the behaviours of the photovoltaic generators and converters used to feed a well defined load, in our case an asynchronous machine actuating a centrifugal pump, this through modelling and simulation of the various stages that constitute the overall system.

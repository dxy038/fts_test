In this study, the effects of quantity and type of lignocellulosic reinforcement on the physical and mechanical properties of wood polymer composite were studied. To meet this objective, two types of lignocellulosic materials include of wood flour and cotton fiber were mixed with polypropylene at 30, 40, 50 and 60 percent of weight rations, also 2 percent of MAPP as the coupling agent in all formulatins was used. Then the composite was manufactured by injection molding, and the physical and mechanical tests were performed on samples according to ASTM standard. The result indicated that, the flexural strength, flexural modulus, tensile strength, tensile modulus, water absorption and thickness swelling of composite were increased by increasing lignocellulosic reinforcement, but the impact strength were decreased. In addition, mechanical properties and water absorption capacity of composite made of cotton fiber is higher than wood flour.

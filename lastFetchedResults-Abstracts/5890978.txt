In this paper we present a study of objective video quality metric performance on test sequences which have undergone spatiotemporal resolution scaling prior to and after compression. The bit rates and resolutions tested have been chosen to typify consumer `home theatreÂ´ wireless streaming scenarios. The aim of the study is to identify a suitable video quality metric for use in a video streaming system that meets changing bandwidth constraints through adaptation of spatiotemporal resolution in addition to quantisation parameters. We first collect subjective quality scores and then assess correlation of objective metrics with this data. Of the metrics tested, we conclude that MOVIE is the most capable of accurate subjective score prediction under changing spatiotemporal resolution conditions.

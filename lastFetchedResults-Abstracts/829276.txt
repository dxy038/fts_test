
Objective: 8-Methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is a photoactive compound widely used in the
treatment of proliferate disorders. The present study investigates the effects of 8-MOP on
ovary function and pituitary-gonad axis in mice. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental analytical study, 45 female Balb/C mice
were divided into three groups (n=15), control, sham (olive oil injection) and experimental.
The experimental group were received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the LD50 dose
of 60 mg/kg 8-MOP. At 30 days after injection, the animals were sacrificed while in the
proestrus stage and examined for morphological and histological changes their ovaries.
Blood samples were collected and estrogen, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating
hormone (FSH) levels
were assessed by radioimmunoassay.
Data
were analyzed
using
one-way ANOVA
and the t test.  
Results: The mean levels of estrogen and progesterone in the experimental group significantly
decreased
(p < 0.001).
However,
there
was
a
significant
increase
in
LH
and
FSH

levels

in this group compared to the control groups (p < 0.001). The mean number and
diameter of the corpus luteum (CL) and the number of growing follicles in the experimental
group
significantly
reduced
compared
to
the
control
and
sham
groups
(p < 0.001).
The

mean

granulosa thickness in the experimental group also significantly decreased compared
to the control and sham groups (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Our data indicated that 8-MOP can affect the levels of LH, FSH, estrogen
and progesterone. Our findings further suggest that consecutive doses of 8-MOP may
impair the female reproductive tract (or development).

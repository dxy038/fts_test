Islam is a political religion, and jurisprudence (Fiqh) which is the science of Islam’s rites and injunctions, inevitably enjoys political aspect. As a result, the system of Islamic injunctions (Fiqh) is arranged in such a way that its full realization was only possible in the form of the Islamic government of Medina, but in spite of the clarity in the interaction between the two fields of jurisprudence and politics at the time of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), their interaction is not so clear to us nowadays. (Question) Of course it should not be forgotten that understanding the relationship between jurisprudence and politics is only achievable in a systematic view to Islamic injunctions. (Hypothesis) It’s clear that the answer to the aforementioned question can guide us in achieving the means, features, aims, intentions etc, and in passing through “tribe-based society” of Hejaz to “Wali-based community” of Medina. (Objective) In the present research it is tried to review the political jurisprudence of Islam in its first period, i.e. the time of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), from its power generation perspective in the field of politics. (Methodology) Form the results of the article, it can be noted that the interaction between jurisprudence and politics at the time of the Prophet (PBUH) cannot be achieved through a posteriori understanding, but the way to implement political jurisprudence in the Islamic government in the contemporary era is possible by a priori understanding of the relationship between jurisprudence and politics.

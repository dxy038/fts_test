The objective of this study was to evaluate the microbiological quality, defined as health safety, microbiological stability, sensory acceptability and dietary value, of raw-fermented sausages with Lactobacillus casei LOCK 0900 probiotic strain. The study assessed the impact of the number of probiotic starter culture suspension (Lc1 ≈ 6 log cfu/g; Lc2 ≈ 7.3 log cfu/g) on the microbiological quality of sausages after the fermentation and following 6 months' storage. The number of used probiotic in the examined raw-fermented sausages was approx. 9 log cfu/g after the fermentation and following 6 months' storage. The number of lactic acid bacteria in the Lc1 and Lc2 samples after the fermentation was similar, however, the smaller number of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae in the Lc2 sample shows that a greater addition of the starter culture suspension is more beneficial. The sensory evaluation results showed that the overall quality was positively correlated with the aroma of cured meat, the taste of dried meat and muscle tissue fragmentation following the fermentation. Negative evaluation of the product was based on such parameters as bitter or other taste, acrid odour, fatty taste. The environment of raw-fermented sausages is suitable for the growth and survival of probiotic.

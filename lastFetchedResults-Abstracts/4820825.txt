This paper describes the ICFHR 2010 Contest for quantitative evaluation of binarization algorithms. These algorithm are applied to synthetic images of modern pdf documents with noise from historical documents. Today, many scientists work on the binarization task and many algorithms have been proposed. However, the selection of the most appropriate one is not a simple procedure. The evaluation of these algorithms proved to be another difficult task since there is no objective way to compare the results. Here, 4 groups with 6 systems are participating in the competition. The experimental setting is described in detail. Moreover, a short description of the participating groups, their systems, and the results achieved are finally presented.

Introduction: Quality of work life (QWL) is an important concept, which is associated with many administrative and human factors. Given that nurses are the largest staffing in healthcare organizations, evaluating their quality of working life and its predictive factors is required in order to increase the productivity and other work out comes.
Objective: Given the special conditions of nurses in the operating room, the study aimed at determining predictive factors of QWL among operating room nurses.
Materials and Methods: This analytical-descriptive study was done in training hospitals of Tabriz in 2015. The research community was nurses in the operating room, selected by cluster sampling. The Sirgy QWL questionnaire was used after determining the validity and reliability (?= 0.85). It evaluates QWL in terms of seven parameters including hygienic and safety, economical and domestic, social, self-respect, self-bloom, knowledge, and aesthetics. Data were analyzed in SPSS 16 software by descriptive analysis, Pearson, t-test and ANOVA. In order to predict changes of the quality of working life variance, linear regression was used.
Results: As revealed, 147 questionnaires were completed. The mean and SD of QWL was 44.65 Â± 8.40. Muscle pain (p= 0.000), exercise (p = 0.030) and job satisfaction (p = 0.001) in univariate analysis were significantly associated with QWL. Daily exercising and job satisfaction could also predict 19.7% of the variance of the quality of working life.
Conclusion: According to the results, facilitating daily physical exercise, correcting ergonomic problems and improving job satisfaction of nurses seem to be necessary in order to improve the QWL.

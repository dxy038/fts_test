Online social networks (OSNs) provide a new platform for product promotion and advertisement. Influence maximization problem arisen in viral marketing has received a lot of attentions recently. Most of the existing diffusion models rely on one fundamental assumption that an influenced user necessarily adopts the product and encourages his/her friends to further adopt it. However, an influenced user may be just aware of the product. Due to personal preference, neutral or negative opinion can be generated so that product adoption is uncertain. Maximizing the total number of influenced users is not the uppermost concern, instead, letting more activated users hold positive opinions is of first importance. Motivated by above phenomenon, we proposed a model, called Opinion-based Cascading (OC) model. We formulate an opinion maximization problem on the new model to take individual opinion into consideration as well as capture the change of opinions at the same time. We show that under the OC model, opinion maximization is NP-hard and the objective function is no longer submodular. We further prove that there does not exist any approximation algorithm with finite ratio unless P=NP. We have designed an efficient algorithm to compute the total positive influence based on this new model. Comprehensive experiments on real social networks are conducted, and results show that previous methods overestimate the overall positive influence, while our model is able to distinguish between negative opinions and positive opinions, and estimate the overall influence more accurately.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with dynamic resource allocation is widely considered to be a key component of most emerging broadband wireless access networks. However, resource allocation in an OFDM system is complicated, especially in the uplink due to the heterogeneity of the usersÂ´ subchannel conditions, individual resource constraints and application requirements. We formulate the resource allocation problem as a convex optimization problem, which has a unique optimal objective value but might have multiple corresponding optimal solutions. We then present a primal-dual based algorithm that is distributed, low complexity, and is provably global convergent to the optimal solutions. The convergence and optimality of the algorithm is studied through a realistic OFDM simulator.

Web caching or web proxy has been considered as the prime vehicle of coping with the ever-increasing demand for information retrieval over the Internet, the WWW being a typical example. Existing work on web proxy has primarily focused on content based caching; relatively less attention has been given to the development of proper placement strategies for the potential web proxies in the Internet. In this paper, we argue that the placement of web proxies is critical to the performance and further investigates the optimal placement policy of web proxies for a target web server in the Internet. The objective is to optimize a given performance measure for the target web server subject to system resources and traffic pattern. Specifically, we are interested in finding the optimal placement of multiple web proxies (M) among potential sites (N) under a given traffic pattern. We show this can be modeled a dynamic programming problem. We further obtain the optimal solution for the tree topology using O(N<sup>3</sup>M<sup>2</sup>) time

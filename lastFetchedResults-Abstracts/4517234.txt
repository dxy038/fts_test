A novel isolated full-bridge DC-DC converter with bidirectional power flow is proposed in this paper. By adding auxiliary active clamping circuits to both bridges, zero-voltage and zero-current-switching are achieved to improve the performance of the bidirectional PWM converter. The switches are controlled by phase shifted PWM signals with a variable duty cycle. The principle of operation is analyzed and simulated. Experimental results of a 3 kW 50 kHz prototype are presented.

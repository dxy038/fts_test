The purpose of this paper is to identify and develop potential solutions on how to facilitate the financing of bioenergy projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. We focus on four main areas that have been identified from empirical research in achieving this objective; these are: (i) financing, (ii) markets; (iii) trade and (iv) policy. The sources utilised consist of primary and secondary data compilation and analysis. Of particular relevance are the results of a market survey undertaken on funding opportunities, where the perspectives of both, project developers as well as project financiers are taken into account. Results indicate that the four areas cannot be treated autonomously, as they not only overlap but impact each other. There are a number of difficulties for biofuel ventures, not least the nature of the projects themselves, but also around the financing and political landscape of these enterprises. Common solutions which cross cut the four areas are the need to raise awareness and the skillsets, in areas including, financing opportunities, markets, policy, technical aspects among a range of stakeholders involved in biofuel ventures. There is also a necessity to create a supporting framework for the emerging carbon trading-related activities in Africa.

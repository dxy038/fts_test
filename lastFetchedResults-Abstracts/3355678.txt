Wireless networks are widely used in urban or office environments and are increasingly considered as an attractive solution for various aeronautic applications. Current investigations focus in particular on RFID technologies because of their widespread use, low cost and ease of installation. The question of the optimal positioning of transmitters and receivers checking all industrial constraints arises during the design phase. Numerical modelling appears as a powerful way to assess this optimization step. The objective of this paper is thus to present a methodology to predict performances of RFID systems in complex aeronautic environments.

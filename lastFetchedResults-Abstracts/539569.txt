Soils in urban areas often present characteristics that might submit these environments to erosion processes. Applying municipal solid wastes (MSW) composts to soils have been suggested as a means to improve physical and chemical properties. A field experiment with a completely randomized design was conducted in a Typic Argiudoll from a degraded area in Buenos Aires City. The objective was to evaluate the effect of MSW compost application on soil properties, residue decomposition and Poa (Poapratensis L.) reestablishment. At the beginning of the trial, compost was prepared and applied in a bare soil on 0.25 m2 square plots afterwards litterbags were incorporated and Poa was sown. Compost amounts were: 0 (control); 2 (low); 4 (medium) and 7 kg m-2 (high) on fresh matter basis. During the trial residue decomposition and aerial dry matter (DM: g treatment-1) were evaluated, at the end soil physical and chemical parameters were measured. Medium and high compost rates increased organic C, total N and extractable P. Addition of 2 kg m-2 affected soil organic C as well, but in a minor fee. Soil physical properties were improved after MSW compost addition. In medium and high doses, augmentations in organic matter reduced bulk densities and enhanced water infiltration. Aerial DM was significantly affected by treatments (p < 0.05). Medium dose improved soil properties and plant DM in the same amount as the highest rate. MSW compost application in urban soils is a viable alternative, since allows the full restoration of an area with serious environmental problems.

Real time optimization (RTO) is described as the continuous reevaluation and alteration of operating conditions of a process. In this work the effect of Real Time Optimization (RTO) on reducing energy consumption in a gas sweetening plant in Iran, is investigated. The simulation package used for modeling the plant was HYSYS. Optimizer was defined in HYSYS optimization spread sheet and process was optimized respect to plant profit as objective function. Then for investigating the influence of using real time optimizer, some probable disturbances were performed and the results of running optimizer in offline mode were investigated. The optimization results leading to a 30-40% reduction of energy consumption respect to different disturbances.

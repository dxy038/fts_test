In this work, we propose the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) based distributed object tracking algorithm in a visual sensor network (VSN). A VSN consists of several distributed smart cameras having the ability to process and analyze the retrieved data locally. The first objective is to optimize the tracking process within the VSN through the CKF. Under the conditions of non-linear motion and observation model, the CKF based method features a considerably better tracking accuracy than the extended Kalman filter (EKF) based method in terms of the mean square error (MSE). Although, the particle filter (PF) based method shows better performance than the CKF, it is computationally very complex. The second objective is to optimize the object tracking by aggregating the tracking results from multiple cameras. Assuming the VSN is a multi-camera network with overlapping field of views (FOVs), cameras having the same object in their FOV exchange their local estimates of the object´s position and velocity. During the estimation process, each of the participating cameras aggregates the received states via a consensus algorithm. Thus, the object´s real state is more accurately predicted by the resulting joint state than it would be by processing only a single camera´s observation.

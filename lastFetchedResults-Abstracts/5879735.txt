In a power system, load varies from one hour to another, reactive power varies accordingly which results into unacceptable voltage variation. This affects the performance of load and other parameters like power loss and power factor. This paper deals with Simulation of 132/11 kV Distribution Sub Station using SVC for voltage enhancement. Load Flow is carried out, considering balanced system during peak load condition, with the voltage enhancement is the main objective. Other objectives of the paper are the reduction in power loss and improvement in power factor. Simulation is developed in Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP) environment and recorded parameters are compared with Simulation results.

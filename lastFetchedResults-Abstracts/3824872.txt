In this paper, we present a novel coding technique that makes use of the nonstationary characteristics of an image sequence displacement field to estimate and encode motion information. We utilize an MPEG style codec in which the anchor frames in a sequence are encoded with a hybrid approach using quadtree, DCT, and wavelet-based coding techniques. A quadtree structured approach is also utilized for the interframe information. The main objective of the overall design is to demonstrate the coding potential of a newly developed motion estimator called the coupled linearized MAP (CLMAP) estimator. This estimator can be used as a means for producing motion vectors that may be regenerated at the decoder with a coarsely quantized error term created in the encoder. The motion estimator generates highly accurate motion estimates from this coarsely quantized data. This permits the elimination of a separately coded displaced frame difference (DFD) and coded motion vectors. For low bit rate applications, this is especially important because the overhead associated with the transmission of motion vectors may become prohibitive. We exploit both the advantages of the nonstationary motion estimator and the effective compression of the anchor frame coder to improve the visual quality of reconstructed QCIF format color image sequences at low bit rates. Comparisons are made with other video coding methods, including the H.261 and MPEG standards and a pel-recursive-based codec

Although extensive research has been conducted for turbulent single and offset wall jets, relatively little research has been conducted for turbulent parallel jets. Relevant applications include burners, boilers, film cooling, fuel-injection, heating and air-conditioning systems, and designs for pollutant exhaust stacks. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the use of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes, k-epsilon, numerical simulations to predict the three-dimensional evolution of twin, isothermal, turbulent, round jets at a ReynoldÂ´s number (based on jet diameter d and jet exit velocity Ue) of 25,000. Comparisons with existing experimental literature are conducted with respect to the stream wise turbulence intensity. Further, the stream-wise distance to the combined point is evaluated, along with integrations of stream wise momentum flux. This research will offer an enhanced understanding of parallel jet flow interaction in terms of flow entrainment, as well as provide insights into the sensitivity of the numerical results to variations of inlet turbulence.

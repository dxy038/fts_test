In recent years, the cellular formation is attended with the increasingly fierce market competition, diversification and personalization of product demand and delivery conditions. Many researchers have put forward cell reconfiguration to meet the different demand in each period, but they donÂ´t consider the product can be processed in different routes in the same period to decrease the reconfiguration cost and other relation cost. So a 0-1 nonlinear multi-objective mathematical model is brought forward considering the purchase cost, operational cost and reconfiguration cost to adapt the different demand in each period. At last, a numerical example is given and it proves that the model is effective.

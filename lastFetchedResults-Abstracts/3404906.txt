One of the requirements that electronics circuits must satisfy comprises conducted and irradiated noise specifications. Whereas conducted noise is well covered in the literature, radiated noise is not. Radiated noise regulations impose limits on the noise measured 3 or 10 m away from electronic equipment. These measurements are usually made in anechoic rooms, which are very expensive. Moreover, the measurement procedure is not a ldquoplug-and-playrdquo feature, but requires a strict measuring protocol. Once the electronic circuit has been tested, the designer remains ignorant of the source of the problem should the regulation not be met. Hence, the procedure to make an electronic circuit comply with regulations is usually one of trial-and-error, in which the experience of the designer is essential. A new radiated noise measurement technique is proposed in this paper with a twofold objective: to simplify the measurement procedure and to obtain more information about noise sources. The main idea is to scan the electric/magnetic field at two arbitrary although known distances. From these measurements, the source reconstruction technique enables the identification of the noise sources in the surface of the circuit and the field estimation at any distance and the assessment of compliance with regulations. Moreover, if regulations are not met, the effect of modifying the noise source can be tested in order to ascertain how the circuit should be modified to comply with regulations.

Composites can fail due to exposure to certain corrosive environments such as water, aqueous
acids and bases, and organic solvents. The objective of this study was to determine the
interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and impact property changes on unidirectional carbon fibre
reinforced polyetherimide (PEI) composites following exposure to various liquid environments
at ambient and elevated temperature. The sample weights were increased for both of the
samples with swelling effect. From the detailed investigation of the impact energies, it was
observed that the crack initiation energy was decreased while the propagating energy was
increased. Liquid environments with higher temperature affect material more remarkable
compared to lower temperature. Also, remarkable decrease in ILSS values for all samples
subjected to liquid environments was observed. By means of scanning electron microscope
(SEM) studies the fracture mechanisms and morphology of the material after chemical
corrosion was investigated. Remarkable morphological changes at the cross section of treated
materials were observed.  C 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

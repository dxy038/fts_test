Decisions on which processes, tools and techniques will be used in order to accomplish project objectives in the most efficient way are contingent upon specific project features. One of the most challenging of such features is the projectÂ´s complexity. The objective of this study is to contribute to the knowledge on the concept of project complexity, relations between project complexity and use of specific project management processes and techniques. A questionnaire was submitted to 313 project managers. The data analysis indicated that the complexity of projects managed by the participants is generated by the criticality of the goals and can influence the frequency of use of processes and techniques related to the project planning and people management.

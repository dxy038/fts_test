Summary
ry gland neoplasms – pleomorphic adenoma, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma – share a common histogenetic trait, but differ markedly in their biological properties. The objective of the study was to assess the polarization colors of picrosirius red-stained stromal collagen fibers in these salivary gland neoplasms to evaluate their possible role in the histopathogenesis of the tumors and to evaluate the potential usefulness of this approach as a diagnostic tool. Ten cases of each tumor type and 10 cases of mucous extravasation phenomenon (control) were examined using picrosirius red staining and polarizing microscopy. In each case, at least 50 thin (∼0.8 μm) and 50 thick (1.6–2.4 μm) collagen fibers were counted and classified as green-yellow or yellow-orange, the mean percentage was calculated and statistical differences analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Results showed a similar thin fiber distribution in all tumor types and controls (82–88% green-yellow, 12–18% yellow-orange, p&gt;0.05). Thick fibers showed a different distribution in polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma (approximately 50% green-yellow) compared to pleomorphic adenoma and mucous extravasation phenomenon (approximately 13% green-yellow) (p=0.001). Thick fiber distribution was similar in polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma (p&gt;0.05). We conclude that with picrosirius red staining and polarizing microscopy, stromal collagen fibers differ significantly in pleomorphic adenoma from those in polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma, but not from mucous extravasation phenomenon. Similarity between polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma may indicate that these tumor types represent a single entity with a broad spectrum of biological behavior.

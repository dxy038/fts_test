This paper proposes methodologies to realize bidirectional power transfer between hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and the power grid for the most common HEV configurations. Only the internal power electronics and electric machines of the vehicleÂ´s propulsion system are being used, thus avoiding additional external power converters. Theoretical analysis and simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.

Recent developments in rectangular waveguide latching phase shifters have been directed primarily toward achieving good electrical performance with reduced size as a secondary objective. Miniaturization efforts have concentrated chiefly on strip line and coaxial structures. While these designs have achieved moderately good low power electrical performance and some reduction in physical size, they have exhibited inherent frequency dependence not associated with rectangular waveguide phase shifters.

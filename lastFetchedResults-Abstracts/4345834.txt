A modern fighter aircraft is highly &#8220;electronic-intensive&#8221; with large number of equipments and systems. All these systems have to work safely and efficiently in a hostile electromagnetic environment. To achieve this objective it is essential to adopt systematic EMC measures throughout the life cycle of the design and development of a combat aircraft. This paper addresses an integrated approach using a mix of analysis and testing adopted by the EMC design team of Indian Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Programme in order to achieve an operational aircraft with minimal EMI problems

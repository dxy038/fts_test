Background: In IVF/ICSI treatment, several attempts have been made to quantify the implantation potential of embryos in order to optimize the pregnancy rate. The objective was to determine the possible factors which might have positive impact on implantation. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 110 IVF- ICSI cycles as first trial for ART programs. Maternal and ovulation factors such as female age, body mass index, type of infertility, infertility diagnosis, duration of ovulation stimulation, numbers of aspirated and fertilized oocytes, day of ET, were compared in high (≥2 gestational sacs) and low implantation groups (one or no sac). All analyses were adjusted for age and PCO subgroups in line with the design of the study. Results: Our results showed that there were significant differences in follicle size between high and low implantation groups (19.32±0.37 vs. 18.07±0.32 respectively) (p= 0.014). Mean number of grade (V) oocytes was also statistically greater in high implantation group (p=0.035). Our results were also compared based on age and PCO diagnosis. Women younger than 35 years old in high implantation group had higher number of grade (V) oocytes than the other group (p=0.038). Assessing our results based on PCO diagnosis, we found that the number of oocytes grade (IV) were significantly higher in high implantation group with non PCOs diagnosis (4.82±2.87 vs. 4.25±3.6) (p=0.043). Non PCO women in low implantation group had also greater number of grade II oocytes compared to the other group (p=0.017). The mean follicle size was significantly greater in high implantation group than the other group (19.32±2.17 versus 18.07±1.76) (p=0.014). Conclusion: Follicle size, and oocyte quality have positive effect on high implantation potential.

The objective of this paper is to present a flash EEPROM memory diagnosis methodology based on I-V cell characteristics extraction. In this work, the root cause of any variation of the memory cell IN characteristic is investigated. Thus, this method allows to quickly diagnose any variation of the memory IN shape in terms of design parameters, process variability, electrical variations, bridge and open fault defects while maintaining the test cost acceptable. This novel technique is more efficient than conventional Flash EEPROM diagnosis techniques based on threshold voltage extraction (V<sub>T</sub>).

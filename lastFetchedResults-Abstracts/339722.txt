Objective
Standard competitive repopulation assays have proven valuable in evaluating engraftment potential in ablated hosts, permitting comparisons between various test cell populations. However, no similar method exists to compare engraftment of test cells in submyeloablated hosts, which would be helpful given the applications of reduced-intensity conditioning for hematopoietic gene-replacement therapy and other cellular therapies. Here, we developed a novel assay to quantitate engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells in submyeloablated hosts.
Materials and Methods

Engraftment of murine marrow cells transduced with retroviral vectors using two separate protocols was compared to engraftment of fresh untreated competitor cells within low-dose radiation–conditioned hosts using a “three-way” marking system, so that test, competitor, and host cell chimerism could be reliably determined posttransplantation.
Results

We demonstrate that the repopulating ability of marrow cells transduced using two distinct protocols was reduced not, vert, similar10-fold compared to fresh competitor cells in submyeloablated hosts utilizing the novel “three-way” transplant assay.
Conclusions

Murine marrow cells transduced using a clinically applicable protocol acquire an engraftment defect in submyeloablated hosts, similar to cells transduced using a research protocol. We conclude that the submyeloablative competitive repopulation assay described here will be of benefit to comparatively assess the engraftment ability of manipulated hematopoietic stem cells using various culture protocols, such as to test the impact of modifications in transduction protocols needed to attain therapeutic levels of gene-corrected blood cells, or the effect of ex vivo expansion protocols on engraftment potential.

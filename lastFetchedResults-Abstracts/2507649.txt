Background: Many people suffer from nerve injury. The time consuming nature
of the treatments makes the condition worse. Therefore, finding a way to accelerate
the process of nerve repair is very important.
Objective: To determine the effect of ultrasound on the acceleration of crushed
peripheral nerve regeneration.
Methods: The experimental model included crushed ratâ€™s sciatic nerve. 40 rats
were categorized into control and test groups. We used functional and electrophysiological
tests to measure the amount of nerve regeneration. We extracted SFI from rats
paw print for functional test and measured CMAP wave amplitude for electrophysiological
test. After testing 3 types of ultrasound radiation parameters, we selected the
best parameters. Ultrasound radiation in test group had the intensity of 0.2 W/cm2
and frequency of 3 MHz. It was applied 3 days per week for 2 min each time starting
72 h after the injury. Control group just received sham expose.
Results: During the treatment period, both SFI and CMAP amplitude was significantly
higher in test group than in control groups (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: We found that ultrasound accelerates injured peripheral nerve regeneration.
In addition, type of injury can be assessed according to changes in CMAP
amplitude during the treatment period.

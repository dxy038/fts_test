Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is partial or complete recurrent upper airway obstructions during sleep. Reduction in blood flow of the optic nerve head is an important causative factor in glaucoma. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) in OSA patients. 
Materials and Methods: From September 2009 to January 2010 in this descriptive-analytic cross sectional study, 90 cases of patients with OSA referred to Yazd Shahid Sadoughi hospital were collected and studied by polysomnography, blood gas analysis and ocular examination including measurement of intra ocular pressure, gonioscopy, fondoscopy and automated perimetry. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software.
Results: Thirty-one patients had mild OSA, 30 patients had moderate OSA and 29 patients had severe OSA. The prevalence of POAG in this group of patients was 10% (95% CI: 4-16). It is higher than the general population in the same age group (p=0.017). There was no significant correlation between the presence of glaucoma and apnea hypopnea index (AHI), mean saturation arterial O2 (MSaO2), body mass index (BMI), sex and age. A significant correlation between AHI with IOP and cup/disc ratio was not documented.
Conclusion: According to our founding, the prevalence of POAG in OSA patients was higher than the general population in the same age group. Thus we recommend screening of glaucoma in OSA patients. This Study suggests that AHI, MSaO2, BMI, sex or age are not important risk factors for glaucoma in OSA patients.

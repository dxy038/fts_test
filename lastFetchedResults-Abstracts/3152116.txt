The core objective of this work is to analyze the possible future relevance of hydrogen from renewable energy sources focused on technology development and application from content analysis, and with special focus on Taiwan. This research was carried out to investigate hydrogen production, storage, delivery and application. The major conclusion of this analysis is that hydrogen is a suitable alternative energy but it still has a long way to go. We should develop different kinds of alternative energies to try to replace fossil fuels, not only hydrogen. The major reason for this is that a successful transition to the hydrogen economy requires not only advanced hydrogen technologies and application, but also a reformation of energy infrastructure and policy support. Hence, there are still limits to hydrogen economy in the future. Only after further comprehensive technological developments and corresponding favorable political support could become a competitive energy industry in Taiwan.

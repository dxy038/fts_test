Indoor channel measurements are performed to study the performance of polarisation diversity in DECT systems. The objective is to demonstrate that polarisation diversity in DECT may be an effective way to combat fading and hence improve the quality of communication. The measurements are conducted on the 21<sup>st</sup> floor of the Information Technology and Systems office building at Delft University of Technology. A transmitter at a selected fixed position transmits vertically polarised RF continuous wave (CW) signal and is swept over the DECT frequency band. The signal is received by a dual polarised microstrip antenna at different positions and rotational angles. The simultaneous signal power on different polarisations is measured simultaneously using a spectrum analyser. At the selected receiver antenna positions the received power is measured as function of frequency. An improvement of 2 to 15 dB is observed by using polarisation diversity

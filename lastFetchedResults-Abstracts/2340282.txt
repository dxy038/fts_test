This article seeks to outline an integrated and practical geometric optimization design system (GODS) incorporating hybrid graphical electromagnetic computing-wedge modeling (GRECO-WM) scheme and the genetic algorithm (GA) for calculating the radar cross section (RCS) and optimizing the geometric parameters of a large and complex target respectively. A new wedge modeling (WM) scheme is presented for calculating the high-frequency RCS of wedge with only one visible facet based on the method of equivalent currents (MEC). The applications of GODS to 2D cross-section and 3D surface are respectively implemented by choosing an average of monostatic RCS values corresponding to a series of incident angles over a frequency band as the optimum objective function. And the results demonstrate that the RCS can be effectively and conveniently reduced by the GODS presented in this article.

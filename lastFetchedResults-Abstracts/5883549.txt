The project TINA (Telecommunication Information Networking Architecture) shares with the intelligent network (IN) architecture the objective of rapid service development through reusability of components, In addition, TINA promotes an integration of telecommunication information access and transport services and relies on a strict separation between service and the underlying native communication and computing environment (NCCE). According to the principles of the architecture, telecommunication services are distributed on a computing platform called the distributed processing environment (DPE)

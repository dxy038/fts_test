This paper introduces an optimal power filter design method to compensate simultaneously current harmonics and reactive power of a nonlinear load. The power filter consists of a passive RL low-pass filter placed in series with the load and a pure active power filter which has RL elements connected in series with an insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) based voltage source converter. The filter is supposed to inject a current into the connection node of the load and grid in order to eliminate current harmonics and its imaginary current. The voltage source converter is placed in a hysteresis feedback control loop to generate the reference current. The bandwidth and output amplitude of the hysteresis controller are optimized with inductance of RL filters. Three objective functions are considered in the optimization problem, which include minimizing current total harmonic distortion, maximizing power factor, and minimizing the IGBT bridge current. For solving the optimization problem, two well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm are applied, namely, Suppaptinarm Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (SMOSA) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The results obtained from the MATLABsimulink simulations show the effectiveness of the method in achieving the objectives.

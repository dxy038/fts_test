A method to analyze the steady-state performance of a stand-alone permanent magnet synchronous generator driven by a diesel engine is presented. The proposed method is based on equivalent d-q circuits and the phasor diagram of such a generator under steady-state conditions. A fixed capacitor-thyristor controlled reactor scheme is used to regulate the generator terminal voltage by controlling the thyristor ignition angle. Furthermore the overall system dynamics are modelled in terms of state variables and control inputs. Based on a reduced order linearized model, digital optimal state and output feedback controllers are designed by minimising a quadratic performance index using the dynamic programming technique. The objective of the controller is to maintain the load voltage and frequency constant under varying load conditions. The controllerÂ´s effectiveness is assessed by examining the closed-loop system response to sudden load changes

The scanning laser confocal microscope has been established as a tool for 3D measurement. However the nanometric measurement in z direction had been difficult. The new technique, combination a Miraw objective lens with a confocal microscope, opens up new surface metrology. This technique does not sacrifice any merits of confocal microscope, quick measurement, twice the bandwidth, high contrast and scatter free imaging

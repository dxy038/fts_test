On the basis of analysing the conventional methods for calculating the torque of the variable reluctance motor. A new method is given in this paper. The calculated values obtained by using the method agree well with the measured ones. By using the Hooks-Jeeves Direct Search Method and taking the torque as an objective function, the rectangular teeth geometry is optimized. A few improvments have been made on the H-J method to decrease the times of calculating the objective function. The result is satisfactory. Triangular mesh generation is realized by successive dividing. Then renumbering the nodes by following the least memory criterion the needed meshes are produced.

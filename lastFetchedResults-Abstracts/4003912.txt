The latest in our series of reports from the emerging countries that will be vital to achieving an agreement at the climate change conference in Copenhagen. India is tackling climate change with the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The stated objective of this policy is to establish an effective, cooperative and equitable global approach based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and relative capabilities; to identify measures that promote development objectives while yielding co-benefits for climate change. The plan was developed by a special council appointed by the Prime Minister in 2007. The Council includes ministers, government officials, scientists, civil society and business, but has met infrequently. As of 2009, strategies to advance the eight missions identified in the plan are being developed by ministries, agencies and consultants. The need for further stakeholder engagement has been recognised. Many programmes in the NAPCC have been underway for some time, but it is not always clear how the plan will build or expand on these existing programmes. The council are also proposing to revisit many difficult or stalled policy and regulatory reform processes. However, proposed programmes to significantly expand solar power are new; energy efficiency mission implementation involves significant new programmes.

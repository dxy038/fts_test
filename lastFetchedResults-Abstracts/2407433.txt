Introduction: Given the early stages of developing insulin resistance, most patients are asymptomatic, controlling glucose tolerance test in high risk patients such as those with PCOS can serve as a useful diagnostic test.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between polycystic ovary syndrome and glucose metabolism in the participating patients from Rasht, northern Iran.
Materials and Methods: This case- control study was conducted on 159 patients, aged 35-15 years old with PCOS and 53 healthy women. Age, weight and height were recorded for all patients. Fasting and 2-hour glucose after oral ingestion of 75 g glucose were measured in all patients. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. 
Results: The two groups did not differ in age and body mass index. The two groups showed no significant difference in mean fasting blood glucose, whereas in patients with PCOS the 2-hour glucose levels, were significantly higher than that in normal counterparts and significant differences were observed between the two groups. As revealed, in 6 (7/3 %) cases, fasting blood sugar higher than 125 and in 6 patients (9/4 %), the two-hour blood glucose levels were above 200 
Conclusions: PCOS patients are more at risk of developing glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes. So screening for impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes seems necessary.

Objective: This study investigated the relationship between depression, nutritional risk and dietary
intake in a population of older caregivers. Design: Mailed questionnaire with sub group participating in a homebased
interview. Participants and setting: Seventy-six community dwelling caregivers aged 50 y or over from
Victoria, Australia. Measurements: Questionnaires provided information on weight, height, hours of care,
depressive symptoms, nutritional risk and appetite. The home-based interview assessed dietary intake and
shopping, cooking and meal consumption habits. Results: The sample had a mean±SD age of 70.3±12.8 y, BMI
of 27.2±4.8 kg/m2 and the time spent caring was 101.8±68.1 h/wk. Overall, 32% of caregivers had depressive
symptoms, 21% were at risk of malnutrition and 21% reported their appetite was fair/bad/very bad. Caregivers
with depressive symptoms (32%) compared to those with no depressive symptoms (53%) had a poorer appetite
(p<0.05). Of the 20 caregivers who participated in the home interview, 25% reported they ate their meals alone.
Conclusion: A significant proportion of community dwelling older caregivers had depressive symptoms, were at
risk of malnutrition and had poor appetites, although the majority were overweight or obese.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the perceived quality of life and functional status of pregnant adolescent girls. Study Design: The Medical Outcomes Survey-Short Form 36, version 2, is a multi-item scale that measures a subject's perception of eight health components. These questionnaires and demographic surveys were completed by teen patients aged 14 to 18 years during antenatal visits to a university-based resident continuity clinic. Mean scores (0 points indicates the poorest perceived health and functional status, 100 points indicates the highest perceived health and functional status) were then compared with mean scores for women in the general population of all ages and, specifically, women aged 18 to 24 years. Results: Forty-two pregnant adolescent girls participated (median age, 16 years; median education level, 10th grade). Ninety-two percent of the girls belonged to a racial-ethnic minority, and all qualified for Medicaid. Pregnant adolescent girls had slightly lower overall scores for all components of perceived quality of life, with the exception of the vitality component. Scores were significantly lower than normative scores (by >1 SD) for only the physical functioning component. Conclusion: There appears to be little change in perceived quality of life in pregnant adolescent girls. This information may be useful in the provision of comprehensive care to pregnant adolescent girls. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1231-3.)

 Introduction Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has known as the most
                            frequent urological malignancy among adults, which occured mostly among
                            male patients. Sunitinib malate (SUTENT<sup>®</sup>, Pfizer
                            Inc., New York, NY, USA) is an oral, multitargeted tyrosine kinase
                            inhibitor (TKI) which acts on VEGF receptors 1–3. Herein, we have
                            presented two simultaneous adverse effects (nail changes and
                            erythematous lesions over the knuckles) of 26-year-young woman with a
                            high risk RCC during the sunitinib therapy. Case Presentation Our
                            patient was a 26-year-young woman, who has undergone left radical
                            nephrectomy in December 2013. Microscopic pathological analysis has
                            shown a 40 mm clear cell carcinoma of grade 2. She has started on target
                            therapy with sunitinib, at over 3 months of TKI Sutent 50 mg four weeks
                            on and two weeks off in this drug. We have seen, nails changes and
                            erythematous lesions over the knuckles. After decreasing the dosage of
                            the drug to 12.5 mg four weeks on and two weeks off the severity of
                            lesions have decreased and subside the complaints of patients.
                            Conclusions Sunitinib therapy could have different side effects among
                            patients. We have not known that a benign side effect could affect a
                            female patient like discoloration despite, or not. This matter that you
                            had not any interference for its treatment, but it has exited so we must
                            try to know more about it.

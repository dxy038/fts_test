In the decision-making, in many cases, we need to know the situation in a next step, if another alternative was adopted or which would be the best alternative, in that moment, with the situation that is envisaged. Decision making for election of regional water resources management entities shows a high complexity, due to much interrelation between aspects, decision makers and planning procedures. We make the decision following the multi-criteria discrete decision methods and we combine this procedure with the Bayesian methods and dynamic programming. The new decisional matrix, weights and the utility functions are obtained under uncertainty. We combine uncertainty and decision-making. An objective function, relating effects of decisions to actions, often cannot be specified in advance. This is an approach of MCDM to decide in conflict situations.

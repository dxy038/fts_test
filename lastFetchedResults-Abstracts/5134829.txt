The main objective of this paper is to introduce the concept of reconfigurable graphic coding and an implementation of this concept under the form of a functional units library. The heterogeneity of data for 3D graphics objects representation requires the adaptability of the compression schemas. Although these schemas inherently share the same classical data processing chain, the components forming it may vary with respect to the dimension, range, correlation type. Based on the analysis of traditional, yet state of the art 3D graphics compression approaches, we propose a set of processing units. We show how this set can be configured/connected into a network to obtain reference decoders. Moreover, the network can be reconfigured at the run time, based on information that is provided with the encoded object. This modular concept of functional units allows optimized management of computation relative to the hardware architecture (CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc.).

One of the most important operational functions of modern day energy management system is environmental/economic dispatch (EED). The environmental issues that arise from the pollutant emissions produced by fossil-fueled electric power plants have become a matter of concern more recently. This paper presents a multi-objective Gravitational Search Algorithm (MOGSA) for environmental/ economic power dispatch (EED) problem.The EED problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained multi-objective problem with competing and non-commensurable objectives of fuel cost, emission and system loss. The proposed MOGSA approach adopts an external elitist archive to retain non-dominated solutions found during the evolutionary process. In order to preserve the diversity of Pareto optimality, a crowding entropy diversity measure tactic is proposed. The crowding entropy strategy is able to measure the crowding degree of the solutions more accurately.Several optimization runs of the proposed approach have been carried out on the IEEE 30- and 118-bus test system.The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing its performance with other evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms such as NSGA, NPGA, SPEA, MOPSO and MODE. The comparison with reported results of other multiobjective optimization algorithms reveals the superiority of the proposed MOGSA algorithm and confirms its great potential in handling the multi-objective problems in power systems

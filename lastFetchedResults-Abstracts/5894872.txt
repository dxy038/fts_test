A fast routability estimator, namely FREe, is proposed in this paper. With the fast feedback on congestion, FREe serves incremental placement or guides routing to shorten the physical design time. FREe firstly extends an existing combinatorial model with the extended bounding box for flat tow-pin nets/sections to pre-estimate congestion probabilistically. Then, it routes all nets guided by the pre-estimation to get more exact congestion estimation, which is fast since it does not include any iteration/optimization as a router does. The idea of FREe is net-order-independent. FREe can get a uniform usage of routing resources by probability. The experimental results show that FREe can give more detailed congestion information in a short running time. Compared FREe with a recent router SSTT, we find that FREe has a good congestion correlation with SSTT, but FREe is more objective

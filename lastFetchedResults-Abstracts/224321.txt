The Static Var Compensator (SVC),
Contyollable Series Compensator (CSC) and Phase Shifter
(PS) are three of the options of power electronic devices,
referred to as FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems)
devices. They are becoming of increasing importance in
suppressing power system oscillations and improving
system damping. In this paper, a unified model of a power
system installed with these three FACTS devices is
established. Their effectiveness in suppressing power
system oscillations is investigated by analysing their
damping torque contributions to the power system. The
work in this paper relies on the theoretical analysis of a
general single-machine infinite-bus power system where
the objective is to present an insight into the operation of
the damping control of the FACTS devices.

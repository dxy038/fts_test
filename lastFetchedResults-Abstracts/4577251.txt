Prony method is used to acquire oscillation characters; the effects of each parameter of self-optimal fuzzy power system stabilizer (SOFPSS) are analyzed by Matlab simulation; parameters of SOFPSS are regulated by the above information. In order to meet the objective of obtaining the information of low frequency oscillation (LFO) and controlling LFO when not depending on mathematical models, the thought of uniform damping is put forward to coordinate multi-SOFPSS. Taking IEEE benchmark system with four machines and eleven buses as an example, the result of simulation shows that the method which combines information gained by Prony method, damping characteristic of SOFPSS and damping conservation theory to coordinate parameters of SOFPSS can damp LFO under multi-operation modes and achieve good effects

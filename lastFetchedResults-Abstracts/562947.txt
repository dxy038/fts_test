This paper presents the synthesis of 2009 research of PNII 52104/2008 project, which has as a major objective the evaluation of aS1 casein genetic polymorphism on milk quality, cheese making efficiency and their specific goat flavour in Carpathian goat breed. In the phases 2 and 3 we had as goals the establishing of experimental lots and performing controlled mating in docks, in order to obtain the F1 progeny. Following genotyping (by IEF and PCR), of some goat populations from central part of Romania, 136 females and 6 males on the 3 homozygous genotypes categories (AA, EE, FF) in aS1 casein. Following controlled mating in docks 2 reproduction indexes were established: fecundity index (94,85%) and abortion index (4,65%). In order to study the allele frequency in all 6 loci codifying major milk proteins, we continued the milk samples collection from the 2 planned regions in these 2 phases. Therefore 916 samples in all were collected form 5 farms from northern part of Romania (468 samples) and 5 farms from eastern part (448 samples). The obtained results so far are in accordance with the proposed objectives for these 2 phases

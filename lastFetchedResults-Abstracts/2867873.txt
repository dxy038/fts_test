To improve the operation performances of an interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) under field-weakening (FW) control mode, this paper presented a multi-objective optimization design method to obtain the optimal geometric parameters of IPMSM to achieve multiple quality targets for an inverter-based refrigerant compressor application. Three design targets that contain the high reluctance torque, the high power factor, and the low torque ripple are studied. The multi-target fuzzy-inference Taguchi method and the finite element method (FEM) are employed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and to obtain the best geometric parametersÂ´ combination of the IPMSM machine. Experimental results have showed that the proposed method can rigorously and effectively obtain the optimal geometric parameters of an IPMSM machine for enhancing the motor performances under FW control mode.

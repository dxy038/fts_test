This paper presents a study of the influence of cutting parameters (cutting velocity and feed rate) and cutting time on drilling metalâ€“matrix composites. A plan of experiments, based on the techniques of Taguchi, was performed on controlled machining with cutting conditions prefixed in workpieces. The objective was to establish correlation between cutting velocity, feed rate and the cutting time with the evaluator the tool wear, the specific cutting pressure and the holes surface roughness. These correlations were obtained by multiple linear regression. Finally, confirmation tests were performed to make a comparison between the experimental results foreseen from the mentioned correlations.

Nowadays, almost all the countries are facing threats from terrorists and intruders from their border areas, challenging the internal security of the country in those areas. So many civilian and military applications require locating an intruder in a secured area. Target tracking, data processing and analysis play a major role in this type of applications. The proposed system is to develop a centralized computer application that needs to identify moving objects in a specific area using sensors. The system will be basically designed to detect human intruders. The objective is to design and implement an object tracking system using a wireless sensor network. This application is able to detect and track objects, and report direction and speed of the intruder to a central base station. The human intruder is detected using a passive infrared (PIR) sensor. The sensor is connected to a MICAz sensor node. The PIR sensor is able to detect the humans and provide information about the direction of the movement. The gathered information from the sensor network is to be given to the base station for processing. The proposed system provides an environment for easy deployment and which does not require any existing infrastructure or constant monitoring by humans.

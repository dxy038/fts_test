OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to develop a reliable method for prenatal diagnosis of fetal rubella infection through the detection of viral ribonucleic acid extracted from the chorionic villi, amniotic fluid, or fetal blood in pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Double amplification of rubella viral ribonucleic acid by nested polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription was applied to samples from 34 women suspected of having rubella. The results were compared with those of serum antibody and levels of rubella virus - specific immunoglobulin M antibodies in fetal blood. RESULTS: Viral ribonucleic acid was revealed in 8 of 34 cases (23.5%). In the remaining 26 cases, healthy babies were born in 24, 1 was electively aborted, and 1 died in the thirty-sixth week of pregnancy of unknown causes. CONCLUSIONS: This method allowed very early detection of fetal rubella infection by sampling of chorionic villi and amniotic fluid compared with evaluation of the maternal symptoms and serum antibody levels. Fetal blood was also more useful for making a diagnosis up to the twentieth week of pregnancy than was measuring rubella virus - specific immunoglobulin M antibodies.

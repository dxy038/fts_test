802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Bluetooth are likely to be used within the same area. The two technologies operate in the 2.4 GHz band. This will result in mutual interference. The new emerging 802.11n Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) devices implement different Physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers compared to legacy 802.11b/g devices. Through empirical experiments, this paper studies and presents results on the mutual impact of 802.11n and Bluetooth devices. The results show that coexistence mechanisms are crucial for the 802.11n to achieve the intended objective throughput.

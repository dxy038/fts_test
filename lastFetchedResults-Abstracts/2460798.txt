A conformal surface wave antenna (CSWA) with a low profile configuration and a bidirectional asymmetric radiation pattern is proposed. Periodic square patches on a curved dielectric slab are used to support the propagation of the surface waves in the desired direction to obtain an asymmetric radiation pattern. The diffraction of surface waves at the edges of the ground plane generates a bidirectional radiation pattern. The antenna pattern is similar to that of wire inverted F antennas (WIFAs). However, It is low-profile, without aerodynamic drag and without high degree of electromagnetic coupling to the fuselage. In fact, the CSWA eliminates the disadvantages of WIFAs. The proposed conformal surface wave antenna exhibits a great potential for telemetry applications when a bidirectional asymmetric radiation pattern with a low-profile and conformal geometry is desired. The proposed antenna is simulated at 5.8 GHz with commercial CST software and the corresponding impedance bandwidth and gain are, respectively, 7% and 8.8 dBi.

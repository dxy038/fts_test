A new synchronization method for MIMO-OFDM systems with CAZAC sequence is presented in this paper. Frame timing objective functions is sharpen by using CAZAC Sequence, and its accuracy is also improved. Combing frame and symbol synchronization, only one step is needed for timing algorithm. Reducing the computation load and defining the first channel path accurately. Integral frequency offset correction is achieved in time domain with a lower complexity. The proposed scheme can not only improve the precision of synchronization, but also reduced the complexity greatly. Simulation result shows a better performance than traditional method especially in multi-path channel.

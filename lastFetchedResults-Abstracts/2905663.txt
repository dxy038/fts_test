A novel topology of half bridge three-level full bridge bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed. The configuration and operational principles of the novel converters with the dual-phase-shifting control were analyzed. The ZVS soft-switching range of the left three-level half bridge and the right H-bridge under different voltage conversion ratio were discussed. In order to improve the whole system efficiency, Based on the mathematical models of transmission power and backflow power, the equation describing the minimum backflow power under the given transmission power was formulated. The dual-phase-shifting optimized control strategy with the minimum backflow power for different given transmission power under ZVS soft- switching conditions were proposed. At last, the experimental results were presented to validate the theoretical analysis.

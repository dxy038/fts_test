From March 1997 to March 1999, sequential rainwater samples were collected during 12 rainfalls at Avignon, Southern France, with the objective of investigating how the formation conditions affect the isotopic composition of the most frequent rain types occurring in the western Mediterranean region. Three major isotopic trends were identified: (i) a descending δ18O trend, produced when a cold front penetration causes the rise of warm and humid air masses, accompanied by adiabatic cooling and precipitation. The temperature variation is the predominant feature of frontal rainfalls; (ii) an L-shaped δ18O trend, which can be produced by convective rains, with an initial rapid decrease followed by a stationary value; (iii) a V-shaped trend, in which the final phase of precipitation obeys a different mechanism from the first phase. Frontal and convective rainfalls may produce this trend.

Three heavy rainfalls were selected for applying a numerical Rayleigh condensation model to describe their isotopic trends. Some irregularities in the generally monotonously decreasing isotopic trend were attributed to inputs of new air masses, which were often recorded by chemical variations as well. The numerical model indicates that about 80, 60 and 45% of the vapour initially present was condensed. The lowest fraction corresponds to the most abundant rainfall, and it is due to the convective nature of the latter implying a continuous supply of condensable vapour.

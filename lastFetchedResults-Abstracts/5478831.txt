In this paper a performance comparison between a classic wound rotor double-fed induction generator and a 75 kW brushless double-fed induction generator prototype is presented. The main objective of this comparison concerned the respective efficiencies at three distinctive points of operation. A simulation using MATLAB/SIMULINK/SimPowerSystems was made that extends this comparison to the whole speed operation range. The results show that at rated speed, the efficiency of the brushless generator is only about 1% lower than the generator fitted with brushes. The cost of operation of both machines was compared taking into account the difference of generated energy due to the relative efficiency as well as the maintenance costs. Also, an analytical and experimental analysis of the generators vibration performance was performed and the results are presented. These results show that the design criteria adopted led to a category "A" vibration behavior according to standard ISO 2372

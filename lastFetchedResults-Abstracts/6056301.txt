This work presents a sequential symbol synchronizer, that is based on a comparation between variable pulse against a reference fixed pulse. This synchronizer has two types, namely the both data transitions and the positive data transitions. Each type has two versions: the manual and the automatic. Then, we apply a prefilter, with three bandwidths B, namely (B1=&#194;&#191;, B2=2.tx, B3=1.tx) to see its effects. Where tx is the bit rate. The objective is to study the synchronizers with the prefilter and evaluate the jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus the SNR (Signal Noise Ratio).

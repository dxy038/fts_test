The objective of this article is to introduce, an interoperability concept; in ldquoIntelligent and electronic ( i &amp; e) - manufacturing system integration for semantic web. It demonstrates as to how to make use of the Semantic Web Infrastructure in the event of an Industry. We come-up with a methodology, that needed to try out (or in fact already a portion is tested) in live industrial environment. Interoperability design is extensively spoken out; and to some degree is trying to specify generally the requirements and challenges. But, what is the scenery of this revolt in technology? And what new technical challenges will it present? The ubiquity of computation and communication is not the only symptom of the insurgency. Much of this emerging computation is embedded; the processors in your phones, cars, personal digital assistants, and home appliances. Increasingly they are in concert with other computational fundamentals as part of a larger ensemble. This broad span of capabilities represents a fresh pattern of computing. Accurately when we realize that the ubiquity of communication bandwidths over and over again; makes it possible to position computational mission at whatsoever point in this chain of command; makes the most sense. We can do better - let us watch-out!

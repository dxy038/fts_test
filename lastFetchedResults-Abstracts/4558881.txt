The objective of this paper is to provide performance metrics for small-signal stability assessment of a given system architecture. The stability margins are stated utilizing a concept of maximum peak criteria (MPC) derived from the behavior of an impedance-based sensitivity function. For each minor-loop gain defined at every system interface, a single number to state the robustness of stability is provided based on the computed maximum value of the corresponding sensitivity function. In order to compare various power-architecture solutions in terms of stability, a parameter providing an overall measure of the whole system stability is required. The selected figure of merit is geometric average of each maximum peak value within the system. It provides a meaningful metrics for system comparisons: the best system in terms of robust stability is the one that minimizes this index. In addition, the largest peak value within the system interfaces is given thus detecting the weakest point of the system in terms of robustness.

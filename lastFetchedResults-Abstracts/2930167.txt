This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of signature recognition. We introduce the use of revolving active deformable models as a powerful way of capturing the unique characteristics of a signature´s silhouette. Experimental evidence shows that the silhouette of a signature uniquely determines the signature in the majority of cases. The objective of our method is to recognize signatures based on the spatial properties of the signature boundaries. Our active deformable models originate from the snakes introduced to computer vision by Kass et al. (1987), but their implementation has been tailored to the task at hand. These computer-generated models interact with the virtual gravity field created by the image gradient. Ideally, the uniqueness of this interaction mirrors the uniqueness of the signature´s silhouette. The proposed method obviates the use of a computationally expensive segmentation approach and yields satisfactory results regarding performance, without compromising the accuracy rate. Interestingly, the active deformable models have been implemented in such a way, that the method is potentially fully parallelizable. The experiments performed with a signature database show that the proposed method is promising

Abstract - The paper represents the design of recursive
second order Butterworth low pass digital filter which
optimizes both the magnitude and group delay
simultaneously under the Multi-Objective Big Bang-Big
Crunch Optimization algorithm. Multi-Objective problem of
magnitude and group delay are solved using Multi-Objective
BB-BC Optimization algorithm that operates on a complex,
continuous search space and optimized by statistically
determining the abilities of Big Bang Phase and Big Crunch
Phase. Here both experimented fitness functions (magnitude
error function and group delay error function) based on the
mean squared error between the actual and the ideal filter
response. MATLAB programming is used for
implementation of proposed algorithm. Experimental results
show that the proposed method can effectively optimize the
magnitude and group delay functions simultaneously and by
using this optimization algorithm, group delay becomes more
constant in the passband than the other optimization
algorithms. The Multi-Objective BB-BC Optimization seems
to be promising tool for both IIR and FIR filter design
especially in a dynamic environment where filter coefficients
have to be adapted and fast convergence is of importance.

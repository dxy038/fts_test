Background: Matricaria chamomilla (MC) has a series of flavonoid compounds with benzodiazepine-like properties.
Objective: So it may be effective in the treatment of epilepsy and seizures. We evaluate the effect of intraperitoneally injection of hydroalcoholic chamomilla extract on seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole in male rats.
Methods: In this study, 56 male rats (200 - 250 g) were divided into to seven groups (n = 8): 1 - control (saline) 2 - MC 50 mg/kg, 3 - MC 100 mg/kg, 4 - MC 200 mg/kg, 5 - MC 500 mg/kg, 
6 - Diazepam (0.2 mg/kg), 7 - Flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg) + MC 200. All groups received PTZ 
(65 mg/kg/ip) 30 minutes after material injection and the animal's convulsive behavior were recorded. The data were analyzed statistically by SPSS software with using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test.
Results: The administration of hydroalcoholic extracts of chamomile, delayed onset of tonic seizures in the animal's anterior limb and body at all used dosages. This effect was significant at doses of 200 and 500 mg/kg, in compare with control group. Also the extract of chamomile reduced the total duration of seizure and the duration of tonic -colonic seizures dose - dependently, that were significant at 100, 200 and 500 mg/kg of dosage.
Conclusion: Intra-peritoneal administration of chamomile hydroalcoholic extract can effectively reduce seizures that induced by PTZ in rats. Here by, it is recommended to identify its effective components by conducting complementary research.

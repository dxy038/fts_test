This paper presents a model for a supply chain consisting of a supplier, a
manufacturer and a customer with objective of minimizing the delivery time of last
order to customer (Makespan). The problem is first described and solved in small
scales by Lingo 11.0. Then, because of problem complexity, a Bee Algorithm
(BA) methaheuristic approach is developed to find near optimal solutions in
reasonable run times.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the milling behaviour of natural inlays (NI) dental restorations constructed from sound extracted teeth. This was done by comparing the milling accuracy and fit of NI to those of industrial porcelain inlays (PI), milled in the same way. Methods:  A calibration pro-inlay was used to mill three NI and three PI. These were cemented in six acrylic cavities reproduced from the calibration mould, using composite luting cement. No etching and bonding were done. After storage for 24h in water at room temperature the specimens were sliced buccolingually in a standardised way. For each specimen, two sections were photographed under a light-microscope, resulting in enlarged pictures of the sections. An acetate matrix with the measurement points was placed over each picture in a standardised way. The interfaces between inlays and moulds were measured at 13 fixed points per section using computerised image analysis software. The mean vertical-and floor-interfaces were calculated for each picture, and the overall means were found for each group. Confidence intervals were used for comparison of the differences. The profiles of the milled materials were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Results:  There were no differences between NI and PI in the mean interfaces (NI, 102 ± 8 μm; PI, 107 ± 8 μm). Electron microscopy revealed no apparent differences in the profiles of the milled surfaces. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the milling accuracy and the fit of natural inlays and milled porcelain inlays are comparable.

Background and Objective: Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and deterioration (BMD) of bone tissue. This leads to increased bone fragility and risk of fracture, particularly of the hip, spine and wrist .This study was performed to assess the relation between calcium intake and bone densitometry values.
Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive study to verify the relation between BMD and calcium intake. The study was carried out on 250 women who did not have the history of any metabolic diseases or estroidal intake were enroled in this study. The individuals were matched for sex, age, BMI and hormonal intake. Data were obtained using a two part questionaire containing demographic information and a table of consumed daily food including the amount of daily calcium intake. The optimal calcium intake 1200 mg/day and in bone mineral densitometry, t score <1 SD was considered as osteopenia and t score <215 SD was defined as osteoporosis. Data were analysed by chisquare test, Mann-Witney and Kruskal-Wallis test.
Results: Although most of patients were in post menopausal stage (56.4%) but daily calcium intake of 89.3% of them was lower than 1200 mg. Positive significant relation between daily calcium intake and education was obtained (p=0.02), wheras, in housewife womens, there were low calcium product in daily dietary intake. There was a significant realation between bone density values of hip and lumboscral area and the daily calcium intake (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Acording to the results of this research and due to the effects of calcium effects intake on bone density and prevention of osteoporosis in elderly stage, we suggest wide teaching and information in general papulation with aim of improving dietry calcium.

Many soil microorganisms are able to transform insoluble forms of phosphorus to an accessible soluble form, contributing to plant nutrition as plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPM). The objective of this work was to isolate, screen and evaluate the phosphate solubilization activity of microorganisms in maize rhizosphere soil to manage soil microbial communities and to select potential microbial inoculants. Forty-five of the best isolates from 371 colonies were isolated from rhizosphere soil of maize grown in an oxisol of the Cerrado Biome with P deficiency. These microorganisms were selected based on the solubilization efficiency of inorganic and organic phosphate sources in a modified Pikovskaya's liquid medium culture containing sodium phytate (phytic acid), soybean lecithin, aluminum phosphate (AlPO4), and tricalcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2). The isolates were identified based on nucleotide sequence data from the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) for bacteria and actinobacteria and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA for fungi. Bacteria produced the greatest solubilization in medium containing tricalcium phosphate. Strains B17 and B5, identified as Bacillus sp. and Burkholderia sp., respectively, were the most effective, mobilizing 67% and 58.5% of the total P (Ca3(PO4)2) after 10 days, and were isolated from the rhizosphere of the P efficient L3 maize genotype, under P stress. The fungal population was the most effective in solubilizing P sources of aluminum, phytate, and lecithin. A greater diversity of P-solubilizing microorganisms was observed in the rhizosphere of the P efficient maize genotypes suggesting that the P efficiency in these cultivars may be related to the potential to enhance microbial interactions of P-solubilizing microorganisms.

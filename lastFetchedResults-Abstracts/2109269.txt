Objective(s):The objective of this study was to find a stable microemulsion vehicle for transdermal delivery of ibuprofen to improve the skin permeability. Materials and Methods: Microemulsion was prepared using different sorts of oils, surfactants and co-surfactants. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were used to evaluate the microemulsion domain. The effects of oleic acid and surfactant mixture on skin permeation of ibuprofen were evaluated with excised skins. Results: The optimum formulation F3 consisting of 6% oleic acid, 30% Cremophor RH40/Transcutol P (2:1, w/w) and 59% water phase, showed a high permeation rate of 42.98 Î¼g/cm2/hr. The mean droplet size of microemulsion was about 43 nm and no skin irritation signs were observed on the skin of rabbits. Conclusion: These results indicated that this novel microemulsion is a useful formulation for the transdermal delivery of ibuprofen.

The general objective of the ATRIUM project is to enable automated detection of threats hidden under clothes using millimetre-wave imaging. In the physics-based approach developed to address this problem, physical characteristics (such as the dielectric constant of the materials of the objects) are used to classify the different kind of materials present in the scene and inform a decision about the existence of a hidden threat. This paper provides a description of the first steps in this approach: (1) millimetre-wave imaging and (2) modelling these images. Results of synthetic images as well as a comparison between these images and real ones are provided.

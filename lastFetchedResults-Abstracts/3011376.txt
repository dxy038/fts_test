In this study, predictive coding of area functions for data rate reduction of LPC coded speech is examined. The properties of several predictors are described, and the benefit obtained from use of the mutual information among the areas is assessed. Coding methods examined include differential coding and two-dinmensional prediction. This experimental study uses an objective speech quality measure to aid in optimal bit allocation among the parameters.

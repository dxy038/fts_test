A high speed sample image processing application using AER-based components is presented. The setup objective is to distinguish between two propellers of different shape rotating at high speed (around 1000 revolutions/sec) to show event-based systems capabilities in high speed applications. Event-based schemes allow the most relevant information to propagate faster through the system layers. So image processing is sped up because a rough result may be available when only a little part of the input has arrived. This setup is much faster than the conventional frame-based image processing systems because they would need to process more than 10kFrames/s to do the same task proposed here, whereas only few events are required with the event based technique

Study Objective: Oral contraceptive pills (OCs) are a commonly prescribed method of birth control for sexually experienced adolescents. The purpose of the current study was to describe anticipated parental involvement and adolescent compliance with pill taking, and to describe experiences with a 20-mcg OC regarding satisfaction and side effects after six cycles.
Design: Anticipated parental involvement and anticipated compliance, and experiences with an OC, were assessed at baseline, and after the first and sixth cycles during a clinical trial of oral contraceptives, which required parental consent.
Setting: Three adolescent medicine clinics in New York, NY; Cincinnati, OH; and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Participants: The sample consisted of 43 female adolescents with a mean age of 17 years.
Results: The majority of adolescents living with a parent anticipated parental involvement, and few adolescents anticipated difficulties with consistent pill taking. For two side effects (weight and mood changes), more than 30% of the adolescents anticipated the occurrence or worsening of side effects. However, few adolescents actually experienced increases in any of the nine side effects assessed. Ninety-seven percent of adolescents in this trial reported being satisfied with a 20-mcg OC.
Conclusions: Health care providers can assess adolescents' anticipated difficulties with compliance with daily pill taking, and desire for help from their parents. This information can be incorporated into counseling to promote consistent and correct use.

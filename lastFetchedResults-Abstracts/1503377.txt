A novel and robust approach is proposed to nd the optimum shape of concrete
arch dams located on any unsymmetrical shape of a valley. The approach is capable of
nding the optimum shape for any given valley type in suitable time, based on abutment
stability analysis, against thrust forces from an arch dam. The behavior and stability
of a concrete arch dam is strongly dependent on the bedrock on which the dam rests.
The stability of the abutment is considered a constraint in the proposed approach. In
addition, a new objective function is introduced to decrease the nal volume of the arch
dam. Furthermore, a computer program was developed, which takes the eect of the dam
foundation system into consideration, and can model most loads applicable to arch dams.
The optimization problem is solved via both Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and
classical methods. Several practical factors have been considered to make the approach
more feasible and eective in practical projects. The results show the eciency of the
proposed method and the nal shape satises all constraints.

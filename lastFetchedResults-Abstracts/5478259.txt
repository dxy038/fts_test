Summary form only given, as follows. The rapidity with which solid-state imaging technology has advanced through-charge transfer techniques places the burden on the product planners to match capability to requirement. As evidenced by the papers to be presented, charge transfer does not mean a single product, but rather a range of products using the same basic technology. It will therefore be necessary that the product planner understand the precise capabilities and limitations of the alternatives offered him. Further, he needs to know the advantages the solid-state product can offer in comparison to existing approaches. This is not a one-way responsibility, however, for the device designer must realistically describe his products performance. Parameters that are loosely applied by analogy to image tubes, such as MTF and dynamic range, must be precisely defined. A further consideration is the fact that there are application potentials beyond conventional imaging - optical character recognition, point-of-sale date reading, and target tracking, to mention a few - that have their own particular requirements. Matching the device to the requirement is possible, but requires objective discussion between device designers and product planners.

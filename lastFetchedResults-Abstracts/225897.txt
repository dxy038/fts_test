A method is presented for the simultaneous optimization of a batch distillation column design and its
operation, for single and multiple separation duties, each involving different multicomponent mixtures
and complex operations with intermediate cuts. For operation structures selected a priori, the formulation
presented permits the use of general distillation design and cost models. The objective function and constraints
include capital and operating cost. In particular, the number of internal plates is optimized along
with the most significant operating variables (recoveries in various cuts and reflux ratio profiles
and times). The multiple duty formulation presented accounts for the different importance of each duty
and setup time between batches. Application of the method to single duty multicomponent separation
from the literature shows that significant profit improvements can be achieved within acceptable computing
times. For multiple separation duties (two binary mixtures), the method clearly shows the importance
of including allocation time to each duty and setup time for each batch in the objective function.

The linear programming model of enterprise human resource training program is established by taking maximization of the total increased output of the enterprise as an objective function. And the optimal solutions are obtained for different assessment periods. Based on the comparative analysis of the optimal training schemes for different assessment periods, it is found out that the assessment period has significant effects on the design of the enterprise training program. For short-term assessment period, the optimal training scheme is different. However, for long-term assessment period, there is only one optimal training scheme, which gives the maximal increased output for the enterprise. It is further shown that the scientific method for design of enterprise training program is of great significance.

In this paper, Shuffled frog leaping (SFL)
algorithm is used for VAr planning with the Static Var
Compensators (SVC) in a large-scale power system. To
enhance voltage stability, planning problem is formulated
as a multiobjective optimization problem for maximizing
fuzzy performance indices. The multi-objective VAr
planning problem is solved by the fuzzy SFL and the
results are compared with those obtained by the Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA).

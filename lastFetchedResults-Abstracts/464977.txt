OBJECTIVE: We compared the diagnostic performances of fetal fibronectin assay of cervical and vaginal secretions and of transvaginal ultrasonographic evaluation of the uterine cervix in the prediction of preterm delivery of patients presenting with preterm labor and intact membranes. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred eight patients admitted to the hospital for preterm labor and with intact membranes underwent assay of fibronectin in the cervical and vaginal secretions and transvaginal ultrasonographic evaluation of the uterine cervix. The ultrasonographic parameters evaluated were cervical length, presence of funneling, and cervical index ([Funnel length + 1]/Cervical length). Outcome measures were occurrence of preterm delivery, defined as birth before the thirty-seventh week of gestation, and the admission-to-delivery interval. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (43.5%) were delivered preterm. Receiver characteristic curve analysis showed that a level of fetal fibronectin in cervical secretions ≥60 ng/ml had the highest diagnostic performance in predicting preterm delivery (sensitivity 80.9%, specificity 83.6%). Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that the cervical index significantly improved the prediction of preterm delivery achieved by the fetal fibronectin assay. In patients with cervical secretion fibronectin levels ≥60 ng/ml, survival analysis showed a shorter admission-to-delivery interval in the presence of an abnormal cervical index (p≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The assay of fetal fibronectin in cervical secretions is more accurate than ultrasonographic evaluation of the uterine cervix in the prediction of preterm delivery. Combined use of the fetal fibronectin assay and the cervical index improves the diagnostic efficiency and allows prediction of the admission-to-delivery interval, identifying a subgroup of patients who may require aggressive treatment.

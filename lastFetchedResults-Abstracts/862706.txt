This study employs mathematical modeling along with a recursive searching algorithm to
determine the optimal run time for an imperfect finite production rate model with scrap,
rework, and stochastic machine breakdown. In real-life manufacturing systems, generation
of defective items and machine breakdown are inevitable. The objective of this paper is
to address these issues and to be able to derive the optimal production run time. It is
assumed that the proposed manufacturing system produces defective items randomly, a
portion of them is considered to be scrap, and the other portion can be repaired through
rework. Further, the proposed system is subject to random breakdown and when it occurs,
the abort/resume (AR) policy is adopted. Under such an inventory control policy, the
production of the interrupted lot will be resumed immediately when machine is fixed and
restored. Mathematical modeling along with a recursive searching algorithm is used for
deriving the replenishment policy for such a realistic production system.

Performance assessment and feedback of its result for improving everyday operations are important activities for success in service business, and Performance Indicators (PIs) are useful tools for visualizing service business performance. The objective of this study is to propose a framework for developing PIs for flight operations management in an airline. Performance indicators should be based on objective data on operations performance, derivable by concrete and simple calculation rules, and exhaustively related to business goals. The development framework of this study consists of service tasks, measurement items, PIs, and interrelations between them, and the PIs development process based on the framework consists of six phases. Since the proposed framework is general enough, it is expected applicable also to services other than airline business.

<p class="Default" dir="ltr"> <strong>Background</strong><strong>: </strong><em>Linguatula serrata</em>, one of the parasitic zoonoses, inhabits the canine respiratory system (final hosts). The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence rate of <em>L. serrata </em>nymphs in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of cattle and buffaloes (intermediate hosts) that were processed in the Ahvaz, Iran abattoir.</p><p class="Default" dir="ltr"><strong>Methods: </strong>During November 2010 to March 2011, 223 animals (119 cattle and 104 buffaloes), in different sex and three age groups (&lt;2, 2–&lt;3 and 3-&gt;3 years old) were sampled randomly at Ahvaz abattoir. Up to 35 grams of their mesenteric lymph nodes were examined separately for nymphal stages of <em>L. serrata </em>by digesting the samples with acid- pepsin method, collected the nymphs and counted under stereomicroscope.</p><p class="Default" dir="ltr"><strong>Results: </strong>Overall 37(16.6%) of 223 animals were infected with <em>L. serrata </em>nymphs in their mesenteric lymph nodes. Prevalence of the infection in cattle and buffaloes were 16.8% and 16.3% respectively. The number of collected nymphs of MLNs was ranged from 1 to 16. No significant differences were seen in the infection rates between males and females (sexes) and age groups in the cattle and buffa-loes (<em>P </em>&lt;0.05).</p><p class="Default" dir="ltr"><strong>Conclusion: </strong><em>Linguatula serrata </em>has an active life cycle in the studied area and a zoonotic potential for transmission between animal and human. Avoiding use of raw MLNs to dogs can help reduce the infection.</p>

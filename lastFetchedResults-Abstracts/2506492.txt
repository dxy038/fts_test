Application of biorefinery approach in which in addition to bioethanol, simultaneously one or more other biological products are produced, has attracted attention as a new and hopeful strategy to economize ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. So, objective of the present study was to optimize co-production of ethanol and xylitol in a co-culture system of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida tropicalisstrains in a batch fermentor. To determine the best nitrogen source, two strains were co-cultured on the medium containing one of 8 different organic and mineral nitrogen sources (6 g/l). The results showed that different nitrogen sources showed significantly different biorefinery efficiency, and the maximum ethanol (24.41 g/l), xylitol (22.7 g/l) and biomass (13.24 g/l) production was observed when yeast extract was used.  At the next step, effect of different dissolved oxygen concentrations, 5, 10, 20 and 30%, was evaluated on the efficiency of ethanol and xylitol production at batch fermentor level.  The maximum ethanol production (38 g/l) and yield efficiency (Yp/s= 0.47 gram ethanol per gram used glucose) was achieved when dissolved oxygen concentration was 5%, whereas the maximum xylitol production (21.6 g/l) and yield efficiency (Yp/s= 0.54 gram produced xylitol per gram used xylose) was achieved when dissolved oxygen concentration was 10%. Also, the maximum biomass (25.7 g/l) was achieved at 30% dissolved oxygen concentration. Finally, it could be concluded that the yeast extract and 5-10 % oxygen concentrations were selected as the best nitrogen source and oxygen concentrations, respectively, for co-production of xyltitol and ethanol by co-culture of the studied yeasts.

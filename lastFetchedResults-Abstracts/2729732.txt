This experiment investigated the effects of different machine-mounted area lighting technologies on visual performance in a simulated underground mine environment. The primary objective was to conduct a comparative evaluation of the lighting technologies based on the visual performance of 36 human subjects in a simulated underground mine environment. Incandescent (Incand), fluorescent (Fluor), and light-emitting diode (LED) technologies were used to create four lighting combinations. Visual performance was quantified for the detection of movement in the peripheral field of view and the identification of ground hazards. Measurements were made of the speed (response time measured in milliseconds), the accuracy (the number of targets and objects missed), and the subjective discomfort rating of the glare experienced for each lighting combination. A secondary objective explored the effects of aging on visual performance. The results indicate that lighting combinations which consisted of LED area lights significantly improved visual performance for the detection of hazards found in the peripheral field of view, as well as those found on the ground. They furthermore indicate that age plays a significant role in visual performance.

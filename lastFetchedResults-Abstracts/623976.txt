Abstract
Background and Objective: Cardiac angiography, which is widely used in Iran, is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure for cardiac diseases. The patients suffer from back pain due to complete bed rest after angiography. Thus, this study aimed at determining the correlated factors with the severity of back pain after cardiac angiography in Dr. Ganjavian Hospital of Dezful , 2011.
Material and Methods: In this correlational study, 140 candidates of cardiac angiography were selected via convenience sampling. We used a checklist to collect the data about age, sex, body mass index(BMI), smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and duration of angiography,  which are the  influential factors of  the severity of back pain. Then, the severity of back pain was measured at first, second, fourth and sixth hour after angiography, using a numerical scale of pain assessment.  To analyze the data, we used descriptive statistic, Mann Whitney and Spearman correlation. 
Results: The subjects are males (N=67), females (N=64) and smokers ( 12%). The mean age is 55.7±7.7, and body mass index is 27.6±3.07. None of them has history of back pain and previous angiography. Based on Spearman, there is no significance correlation between back pain of 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after angiography and factors such as age, BMI and duration of angiography. Man Whitney test indicates a statistical significance between gender and severity of pain in the first hour (Z=-2.17) and sixth hour (Z=-2.4) after angiography, whereas there is no statistical significance in the second, fourth and fifth hour after angiography.  As well, there is no significant correlation between back pain and variables such as smoking, diabetes and hypertension. 
Conclusion:The findings showthat the nurses by being aware of related factors to back pain severity can try to reduce the pain and promote the patients’ convenience.

This paper proposes the integration of a vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) system with a typical stand-alone wind energy system during wind speed variation as well as transient performance under variable load. The investigated system consists of a 3 kW variable speed wind turbine with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), diode rectifier bridge, buck-boost converter, bidirectional charge controller, transformer, inverter, ac loads and VRB. The state of charge (SOC) method control is used for controlling the VRB in order to ensure the difference of energy, if the wind turbine canÂ´t supply the total energy for the loads. The main purpose is to supply domestic appliances through a single phase 230 V, 50 Hz inverter. Simulation of the system using Matlab/Simulink software was performed in order to validate the stability of the supply.

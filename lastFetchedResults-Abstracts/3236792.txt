The power system is going to undergo some changes regarding improvements of information and communication from technological innovation, getting a smarter system, term known as Smart Grid. One of the first changes to be adopted will be the replacement of electromechanical meters by electronic ones, called Smart Meters. With the use of Smart Meters is possible to apply for different tariffs according to the time of day for consumers of low voltage (LV). Additionally, there will be a significant increase insertion of sources of Distributed Generation (DG) with the new system - Smart Grid. The objective is present a methodology that analyzes the impact of White Electricity Tariff and Microgeneration for residential consumers in LV network. The methodology use the software Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables, considering the conventional tariff, the new tariff, load profile of residential consumers and microgeneration. The main result is the economic in the electricity bill.

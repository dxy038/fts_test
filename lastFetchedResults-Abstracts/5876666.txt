Summary form only given. The objective of this project is to analyze the instability associated with the breakdown of tumble during compression of an internal combustion engine flow. It has been observed that the tumble vortex (a vortex whose axis is perpendicular to the cylinder axis which is produced during intake by an asymmetry of the valve(s)) becomes unstable during compression and ultimately leads to turbulence near the end of compression. This turbulence leads directly to better engine performance and the possible use of leaner fuel mixtures via faster burning rates.

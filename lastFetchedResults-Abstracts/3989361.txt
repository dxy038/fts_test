The objective of this paper is to study the impact of the solar flares on the single event rate (SER) dynamics investigating the influence of shielding, the technological integration level and the contribution of the direct ionization of protons for a 65 nm technology. This paper proposes a comparison of MUSCA SEP<sup>3</sup> calculations and SAC-C satellite in-flight data in terms of SEU &#8220;instantaneous&#8221; rate and total count.

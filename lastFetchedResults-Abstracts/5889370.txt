ALOHA systems are some of the most attractive options for wireless applications which include packet transmission. However, despite their flexibility and simplicity, they present a very low channel throughput. The objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of such a protocol based layered space-time scheme over wireless communication links. A multiuser environment is hence considered in which each user carries only one transmit antenna. A generalization of Vertical-Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) technique for BPSK modulation is then invoked to detect the transmitted signals through the use of multiple receive antennas at the base station. We asses in this paper the gain achieved by the proposed receiver; denoted by rT-BLAST, compared to the conventional V-BLAST system. We first consider the performance of this system over flat fading channels for a variety of system parameters. Then, throughput and delay performance are analyzed under different packetized traffics. It is demonstrated through simulation results that a significant improvement in system capacity, throughput and delay are achieved

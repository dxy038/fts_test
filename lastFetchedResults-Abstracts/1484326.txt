Early weaning of calves (60 days old) is adopted in cowâ€“calf operations for its high reproductive response. The objective of this research work was to find how age classes are related to beef quality in early weaning cull cows. Twenty four cows were grouped in four different age classes (teeth and number of calves produced) from two teeth and no calf produced, up to 12 years and 7 calves produced. All cows grazed a perennial pasture based on alfalfa and fescue. There were differences (P &lt; 0.05) in final weight (younger cows being lighter) but no other differences could be found during field conditions or in abattoir data (carcass weight and yield, top value hindquarter cuts weight and carcass percent). No differences (P &gt; 0.05) could be found in meat quality attributes except for moisture, protein and fat yellowness. Differences (P &lt; 0.05) in sensory attributes could only be found in connective tissue.

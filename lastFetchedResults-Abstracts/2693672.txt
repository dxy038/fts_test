Building automation is the key to sustainable, safe and comfortable buildings as well as to the integration of buildings into smart grids and with other external applications such as cloud computing. In a typical smart community scenario, various household appliances of multiple residential users are connected via a Home Area Network. HANs are further connected to the local power distribution network via smart meters, forming a LAN, where also renewables communicate. Methods are needed to design and integrate networks with hundred thousands of nodes in a cost-efficient way. The key to providing improved services in building automation is to process complex scenarios in an adequate way. Furthermore, building automation systems must be seen as dependable systems covering both safety and security aspects. The main objective of this Special Section is to bring the ideas of the worldwide research community into a common platform, to present the latest advances and developments.

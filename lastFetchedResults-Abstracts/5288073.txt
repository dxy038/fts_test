Nowadays, Opinion Mining is getting more important than before especially in doing analysis and forecasting about customers´ behavior for businesses purpose. The right decision in producing new products or services based on data about customers´ characteristics means profit for organization/company. This paper proposes a new architecture for Opinion Mining, which uses a multidimensional model to integrate customers´ characteristics and their comments about products (or services). The key step to achieve this objective is to transfer comments (opinions) to a fact table that includes several dimensions, such as, customers, products, time and locations. This research presents a comprehensive way to calculate customers´ orientation for all possible products´ attributes. A use case study is also presented in this paper to show the advantages of using OLAP and data cubes to analyze costumers´ opinions.

This letter presents a novel approach for visual saliency estimation through single image optimization. Instead of directly mapping visual features to saliency values with a unified model, we treat regional saliency values as the optimization objective on each single image. By using a quadratic programming framework, our approach can adaptively optimize the regional saliency values on each specific image to simultaneously meet multiple saliency hypotheses on visual rarity, center-bias and mutual correlation. Experimental results show that our approach can outperform 14 state-of-the-art approaches on a public image benchmark.

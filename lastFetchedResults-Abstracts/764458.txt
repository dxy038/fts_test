Today, water scarcity and declining water quality lead to use of unconventional water in farming including wastewater and urban sewage. This study was conducted with the objective of reviewing the impact of the application of raw and treated sewage on the trend of changes of some of soil chemical properties and micronutrients at different soil depths. An experiment was performed three times to this end in the form of a completely randomized design with three treatments including tap water, treated sewage, and raw sewage. Soil sampling was done as composites at the soil depths of 0-30 and 30-60 centimeters. Analyzing the samples was done by common experimental methods to determine some of the soil chemical properties and micronutrients, and the data was saved in Excel software database. The data experimented was analyzed at two probability levels of 1 and 5 percent by a statistical software to determine the level of significance, and the Duncan test was used to compare the averages. The results from the statistical analysis showed that the use of raw and treated sewage has stimulated an increasing trend in parameters including, Cadmium and chloride Concentrations.

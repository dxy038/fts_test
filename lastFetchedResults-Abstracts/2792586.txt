This paper presents a significant evolutionary based algorithm for solving conventional Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) problem in power system. This problem was designed as a Multi-Objective case with loss minimization and voltage stability as objectives and Generator terminal voltages, tap setting of transformers and reactive power generation of capacitor banks were taken as optimization variables. Modal analysis method is adopted to assess the voltage stability of system. The above presented problem was solved on basis of efficient and reliable technique among all evolutionary based algorithms, the Differential Evolution Technique. The proposed method has been tested on IEEE 30 bus system where the obtained results were found satisfactorily to a large extent that of reported earlier.

In urban area, the accumulation of polluted stormwater sediments (SWS) in retention ponds may be a source of dissolved pollutants and nutrients for the aquatic ecosystems. Our objective was to quantify the influence of the thickness of SWS layer and the occurrence of tubificid worms on organic matter processing (O2 uptake and fluxes of image, image, image, and dissolved organic carbon between sediment and water), releases of 17 PAHs and 4 heavy metals, and microbial characteristics. Results showed that oxidation of SWS organic matter (O2 and image uptakes) and releases of nutrients were significantly increased by the quantity of accumulated SWS and the worm bioturbation. Releases of acenaphtene and naphthalene from sediments were significantly increased by the thickness of the SWS layer. In contrast, tubificid worms did not promote the mobilization of pollutants. In conclusion, biological activities and stormwater sediment characteristics need to be assessed to quantify the fate of pollutants and nutrients in stormwater retention ponds.

Objective of this paper is focused on 2D numerical analysis of tensile capacity of cast-in-place anchors with different head size and effective depth because the influence of head size is not taken into account in the CCD (Concrete Capacity Design) approach which is used in Eurocode. Twenty-four breakout simulation tests of six different head diameters with four different effective depths were investigated. The concrete properties were kept constant for all of them. It was found that the capacity of anchor is affected by the head size significantly. The approximately 25% decrease of capacity for small heads and about 30% capacity increase for large heads were observed in comparison to the CCD method.

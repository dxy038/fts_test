We consider the bidirectional broadcast channel with common and confidential messages. We show that polar codes achieve the capacity of binary input symmetrical bidirectional broadcast channels with confidential messages, if one node´s channel is a degraded version of the other node´s channel. We also find a new bound on the cardinality of the auxiliary random variable in this setup.

In power systems are operational separators and protection elements. Determine their proper functioning and efficient system. Circuit breaker is an example of an element that ensures proper functioning. For example, in a facility with to power on due to limit working voltage, there are significant amounts of current. Any output from nominal operating parameters of the circuit elements and thus cause losses decrease efficiency. To avoid such deficiencies are made periodically or whenever necessary checks of switching devices, performing so-called predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance aims to assess the status through periodic monitoring (off-line) or continuous (on-line). The ultimate objective of predictive maintenance is maintenance works "timely" before the equipment to deteriorate during operation. Scheduled maintenance requires regular interventions on the equipment, often without responding to urgent needs. This paper presents a virtual tool that can take some of the tasks of the operator, ensuring a maintenance high degree of automation. Electrical parameters and kinetic analyzes are obtained by monitoring offline. We aimed to implement a robust algorithm being provided and saving data for later analysis. Virtual instrument can be adapted with minimal changes to any acquisition board compatible with NI LabVIEW programming environment.

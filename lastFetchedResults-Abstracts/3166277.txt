A reproducible method for identifying the myocardium and quantifying regional myocardial blood flow using 13N labelled ammonia and positron emission tomography (PET) has been developed. This method allows an objective comparison of regional myocardial blood flow within and between patients and is easy to use, fast, and reproducible.

This paper presents the application of immune algorithm (IA) to find optimal location of unified power flow controller (UPFC) to achieve optimal power flow (OPF) and congestion management. Objective function in the OPF, that is to be minimized, is the overall cost functions, which includes the total active and reactive production cost function of the generators and installation cost of UPFCs. The OPF constraints are generators, transmission lines and UPFCs limits. In power system, it may not always be possible to dispatch all of the contracted power transactions due to congestion of the transmission corridors. We propose IA method to minimize the objective function under all equality and inequality constraints. Simulations are performed on 4-bus, IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 30-bus test systems for optimal location of UPFC and the results obtained are encouraging and will be useful in electrical restructuring.

Our objective was to evaluate the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of skate skin protein hydrolysates and its corresponding fractions. The skate skin hydrolysates were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis using alcalase, α-chymotrypsin, neutrase, pepsin, papain, and trypsin. Amongst the six hydrolysates, the α-chymotrypsin hydrolysate had the highest ACE inhibitory activity compared to other hydrolysates. The amino acid sequences of the purified peptides were identified to be Pro–Gly–Pro–Leu–Gly–Leu–Thr–Gly–Pro (975.38 Da), and Gln–Leu–Gly–Phe–Leu–Gly–Pro–Arg (874.45 Da). The purified peptides from skate skin had an IC50 value of 95 μM and 148 μM, respectively, and the Lineweaver–Burk plots suggest that they act as a non-competitive inhibitor against ACE. Our study suggested that novel ACE inhibitory peptides derived from skate skin protein may be beneficial as anti-hypertension compounds in functional foods.

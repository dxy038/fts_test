Splenic tuberculosis is usually associated with disseminated miliary tuberculosis; it typically exhibits a multiple micronodular form. We report on magnetic resonance imaging findings of an extremely rare case of multiple macronodular splenic tuberculosis without extrasplenic involvement. The nodules showed hypointensity on T2-weighted images and gradual peripheral enhancement with complete fill-in. These findings are consistent with observations in disseminated splenic tuberculosis, except for the nodule and spleen sizes.

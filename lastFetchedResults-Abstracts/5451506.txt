In this paper, we propose an architecture that, exploiting the Semantic Web technologies, has the objective of allowing semantic interoperability among software agents in the Web. Such an architecture takes advantage by the Semantic Triangle model in which communication agents share the referents (real world objects) and not the references (mental image of a real object of the sender agent), thus ensuring an effective semantic interoperability in the information exchange process. We have carried a case study in order to assess the appropriateness and the feasibility of the process for the semantic information exchange by realizing and testing an instantiation of the related architecture.

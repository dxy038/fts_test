For multi-objective design and robust control synthesis problems, the methods based on quantifier elimination (QE) have been proposed. QE based methods are really suitable for such problems but, in general, they have a drawback on computational complexity. We propose an efficient symbolic method for a parameter space approach based on sign definite condition by a special quantifier elimination using a Sturm-Habicht sequence. Then we examine its feasibility, in particular, for multi-objective control using a low degree fixed-structure controller by showing the several experimental results

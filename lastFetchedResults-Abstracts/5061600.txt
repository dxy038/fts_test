Highlights the current principal application areas of artificial neural networks in mineral engineering. An investigation into the suitability of a multilayer perceptron architecture using the generalised delta training rule with backpropagation of error for synthesising deformability models for Crosland Sandstone is discussed. The results of the investigation indicate that this method is effective in achieving this objective for engineering purposes

This paper presents an optimal scheme of excitation capacitor to decrease the capacity of static excitation controller (SEC) for dual stator-winding induction generator (DWIG) system applied in wind power generation. The investigations into reactive excitation power released by the excitation capacitor and SEC illustrate that the optimal excitation capacitor is not only related to generator parameters, speed range, and load, but also affected by wind turbine power curve. Based on the objective of minimizing the capacity of SEC, several methods are employed here to select an appropriate excitation capacitor. Through the analysis of DWIG control mechanism and model of SEC in the stator-voltage-orientation synchronous d-q frame, a decoupling control strategy using the space vector modulation is obtained. On the basis of this, the simulation and experimental works from the prototype of 18-kW six/three-phase DWIG wind power system are carried out to verify the optimal scheme. The results demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of this optimization scheme.

As our life has become too dependent on computers, rapid utilization of computer systems are increased widely. Therefore, the impact of computer resources on our environment has also increased, that is degrading natural resources. To reduce the effect, the green computing theory has been introduced to improve efficiency, to make energy efficient and realize ecological protection and save energy. Focus on green computing has started in early 1990Â´s with the program like Energy star, but recent drastic changes in global climate has renewed the interest in green computing. The driving force behind this change comes from the ever growing business computing needs, fast growing burden of energy cost, growing awareness of global warming issues and increasing sense of national energy security. As today, The use of Evolutionary Algorithm is increasing as our objective problem domain size is also increasing. Therefore, our problem domain is going from single objective to multiple objectives and many objectives are in trend. Therefore this paper gives a clear cut view on green computing and a modified genetic algorithm to make it green efficient.

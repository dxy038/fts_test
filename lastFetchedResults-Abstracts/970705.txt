objective functions in the form of a ratio of numerator and denominator functions which involve both
contains linear and quadratic forms with the assumption that the set of feasible solutions is a convex
polyhedral with a nite number of extreme points and the denominator part of each of the objective
functions is non-zero in the constraint set. In this paper, we extend the procedure as suggested
by Lachhwani (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. India, 82(4), 317-322) based on fuzzy goal programming
approach for the solution of multi objective quadratic fractional programming (MOQFP) problem.
The proposed technique is simple, ecient and requires less computational work. In the proposed
FGP model formulation, corresponding objectives of equivalent multi objective programming problem
are transformed into fuzzy goals (membership functions) by means of assigning an aspiration level to
each of them and suitable membership function is dened for each objectives. Then achievement of
the highest membership value of each of fuzzy goals is formulated by minimizing the sum of negative
deviational variables. The proposed methodology is illustrated with numerical example in order to
support the proposed methodology.

In this paper we present the performance evaluation of a Distributed Component based Telerobotic Framework that implements a real-time interaction between a telrobotic client and server. The objective is to optimize delays in multistreaming of force feedback, stereo data and master-slave commands. Different scenarios are considered and statistically analyzed to relate the effect of thread manipulation to time delays. Telerobotic components communicate with each other using .NET Remoting and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) that automatically handle the network resources and data transfer. This approach significantly reduces the delays over a LAN as we are able to attain a rate of 17-18 stereo frames per second from camera(server) to remote client over the same LAN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest rate achieved over a 100 Mbps LAN.

Data gathering is a vital operation in wireless sensor network applications, which necessitates energy efficiency techniques in order to increase the lifetime of the network. Similarly, Clustering is an effective technique that is implemented to improve the energy efficiency and network lifetime in wireless sensor networks. This paper proposes an Energy Sorting Protocol (ESP) architecture, which employs clustering. The objective of ESP architecture in case of wireless micro-sensor networks is the accomplishment of low energy dissipation and latency without sacrificing application specific quality. The ESP accomplishes the objective by employing (i) randomized, adaptive, self - configuring cluster formation (ii) localized control for data transfers and (iii) application - specific data processing, such as data aggregation or compression. The cluster formation algorithm permits each node to make autonomous decisions, so as to generate good clusters as the outcome. From the simulation results, it is illustrated that this algorithm also minimizes the energy and latency for cluster formation, in order to minimize overhead to the protocol.

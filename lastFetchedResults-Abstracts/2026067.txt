Spatial data mining is the discovery of interesting relationships and characteristics that may exist implicitly in spatial databases. The main objective of the spatial data mining is to discover hidden complex knowledge from spatial and not spatial data despite of their huge amount and the complexity of spatial relationships computing. However, the spatial data mining methods are still an extension of those used in conventional data mining. Spatial data is a highly demanding field because huge amounts of spatial data have been collected in various applications, ranging from remote sensing, to geographical information systems (GIS), computer cartography, environmental assessment and planning, etc. The collected data far exceeded human's ability to analyze. Recent studies on data mining have extended the scope of data mining from relational and transactional databases to spatial databases. In this paper we discuss how cluster analysis can be helpful for mining spatial data. Cluster analysis divides data into meaningful or useful groups (clusters). If meaningful clusters are the goal, then the resulting clusters should capture the “natural” structure of the data. For example, cluster analysis has been used to group related documents for browsing, to find genes and proteins that have similar functionality, and to provide a grouping of spatial locations prone to earthquakes. However, in other cases, cluster analysis is only a useful starting point for other purposes, e.g., data compression or efficiently finding the nearest neighbors of points.

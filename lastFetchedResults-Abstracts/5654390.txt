We consider the basic problem of using optimization in situations where the quantities involved cannot be evaluated precisely. An example we have considered in the past (see reference [1]) is the circuit design optimization problem. The objective in such a problem is to determine values for certain parameters in the circuits that optimize some measure of circuit performance. This measure or criterion is evaluated by solving a system of nonlinear algebraic and differential equations. These equations can be solved to a specified degree of accuracy, but the cost of a function/ gradient evaluation can increase significantly when the accuracy is increased. In this situation the function and gradient evaluations contain approximately the same percentage errors. Initial tests as represented in [1] indicated that variable metric schemes can be reliable when applied to such problems. Many other applications exist. In this talk we examine this question of computing an ´optimal´ solution in the presence of such errors.

A framework of joint antenna selection and source coding strategy for scalable video transmission over wireless systems was proposed. Each layer of a bit-stream could be switched among multiple transmit antennas in order to achieve unequal error protection (UEP) for prioritized video layered bit-streams. At first wavelet-based 3D ESCOT codec generates layered bit streams that need prioritized delivery. Then we obtain the ordering of transmit antennas with channel strengths as partial CSI. Finally by the proposed joint antenna selection and layered source coding algorithm, we are able to transmit higher priority layers of a bit stream into antennas with higher channel strengths. Therefore we can achieve UEP for layered scalable video coding transmission over MIMO OFDM system. Simulation results show that the proposed framework improved the system performance significantly. The proposed joint antenna selection and layered source coding algorithm enables us to achieve UEP for layered video transmission over MIMO OFDM system with low complexity of algorithm at the transmit side as well as achieve different QoS at receive side.

The main objective of this paper is to present and evaluate methods that can be used to extract valuable information from traffic data history for use in travel information and guidance systems. Through two different analyses, we identify the roads which the system should pay closer attention to. First, we introduce an approach that finds the patterns of the traffic speed which lie within the data history. Second, we discover the relations between traffic speeds and various features of roads. The result of our study let travel guidance systems know how heavy the traffic will be at any given road. We extend these approaches to tackle the problem of incident management, and designed a system that returns, the expected range of effect of an incident using road features.

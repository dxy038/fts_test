Fixed charge solid transportation problems are formulated as
profit maximization problems under a budget constraint at each
destination. Here item is purchased in different depots at
different prices. Accordingly the item is transported to different
destinations from different depots using different vehicles. Units
are sold from different
 destinations to the customers at different selling prices. Here selling prices, purchasing costs,
unit transportation costs, fixed charges, sources at origins,
demands at destinations, conveyances capacities are assumed to be
crisp or fuzzy. Budget constraints at destinations are imposed. It
is also assumed that transported units are integer multiple of
packets. So the problem is formulated as constraint optimization
integer programming problem in crisp and fuzzy environments. As
optimization of fuzzy objective as well as consideration of fuzzy
constraint is not well defined, different measures-
possibility/necessity/credibility
 of fuzzy event are used to transform the problem into equivalent crisp problem.
 The reduced crisp problem is solved following generalized reduced gradient(GRG) method using lingo software.
 A  dominance  based genetic algorithm (DBGA) and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique using swap sequence are also developed for this purpose and are used to solve the model.  The
models are illustrated with numerical examples. The results obtained
using DBGA and PSO are compared with those obtained from GRG.
Moreover, a statistical analysis  is presented to compare the
algorithms.

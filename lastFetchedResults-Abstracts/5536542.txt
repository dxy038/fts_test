Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs) are used as objective method for diagnostics and quantification of hearing loss. Many methods for automatic recognition of ABRs have been developed, but none of them include the individual measurement setup in the analysis. The purpose of this work was to design a fast recognition scheme for chirp-evoked ABRs that is adjusted to the individual measurement condition using spontaneous electroencephalographic activity (SA). For the classification, the kernel-based novelty detection scheme used features based on the inter-sweep instantaneous phase synchronization as well as energy and entropy relations in the time-frequency domain. This method provided SA discrimination from stimulations above the hearing threshold with a minimum number of sweeps, i.e., 200 individual responses. It is concluded that the proposed paradigm, processing procedures and stimulation techniques improve the detection of ABRs in terms of the degree of objectivity, i.e., automation of procedure, and measurement time.

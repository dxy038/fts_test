We considered the problem of optimizing travel time in a highway traffic composed exclusively of autonomous vehicles. The objective of this paper is to propose an algorithm to compute all trajectories in a segment of a double lane highway considering individual priorities. The idea is that vehicles that want to reduce travel time must provide credits to increase their priority. These credits must be paid by each vehicle every time they finish the segment sooner than its expected travel time. As other vehicles may be affected and waste time when one decides to alter its priority, a time compensation scheme is also proposed. Simulation tests to evaluate the methodology are presented.

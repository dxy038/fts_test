Subvalvular left ventricular aneurysms can be subaortic or submitral with variable etiology. This is a retrospective study of 19 subvalvular aneurysms seen in 16 cases. There were 12 isolated subaortic aneurysms, 3 isolated submitral aneurysms, and in 1 case with multiple subaortic and submitral aneurysms. Subaortic aneurysms were associated with infective endocarditis, while there seems to be a strong association between submitral aneurysms and tuberculosis. Five cases of subvalvular aneurysm has associated aneurysm sinus of Valsalva—this association suggests a congenital weakness in the attachment of aortic and mitral annuli to the underlying myocardium.

Background: Heart failure is a chronic disease with relapsing nature. As a result the recurrent hospitalization of patient with heart failure has become a major topic of discussion in the field of health care. Various studies has shown that home visit exert a positive influence on readmission and mortality rate in these patients.
Objective: To determine the effect of home visit on readmission rate in patients with cardiac failure.
Design: This was a field trial with control group. Three home visits were carried out in the cases but not in the control group over a six-month period. At the end, the number of admissions in the two groups were compared.
Sample: 100 patients diagnosed with heart failure were enrolled by continuous sampling into the study and then distributed into 50 cases and 50 controls. Result: Result indicated that the case group experienced fewer readmission during the 6 month period of the study than the control group; the difference being statistically significant [z= 2.096 and P= 0.044]. Hospital stay was also shorter in cases than in controls, the difference again being statistically significant [t=20.39 and P=0.017].
Discussion: The result showed that home visit lead to a reduction in rehospitalization rates in patients with heart failure. Therefore, it is recommended that regular, systematic home visit can lessen complications and prevent deterioration of the disease, thereby reducing re-admission rates in these patients.

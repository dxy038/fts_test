The objective of this paper is to design a compensator by a singular perturbation approach for flexible structures subjected to moving vibratory system (e.g. bridge vibration system with moving vehicle). The proposed design of the controller includes a composite control strategy derived by the singular perturbation approach. In order to overcome the problem of lack of full state availability, a compensator is applied to the controller. Using this compensator, the vibration amplitude of the elastic beams can be reduced and the performance of the dynamic system improved. Although the research idea originated from exploration of the dynamic characteristics of the bridge system, the findings of this paper can be applied to various mechanical systems such as space structures, ballistic systems, gantry crane, and other dynamic systems with moving loads

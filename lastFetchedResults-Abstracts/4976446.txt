A proposed alternative to existing &#8220;suboptimal&#8221; therapies or fusion available for the treatment of scapholunate dissociation is its replacement with a bone-ligament-bone unit transferred from the ankle. The objective of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical properties of ankle ligaments compared to wrist ligaments for their potentials as a bone-ligament-bone replacement. Based upon the mechanical strength and strain properties displayed by the ankle ligaments tested, a good biomechanical rationale exists for transferring either the anterior talofibular or anterior tibiofibular ligament for the clinical replacement of the scapholunate ligament

The objective of this work is to achieve high capacitance density on-chip capacitor using 0.18 &#956;m Cu/SiO<sub>2</sub> interconnect technology, compared with metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor fabricated with existing mature techniques (700 &#197; silicon nitride as capacitor dielectric). Metal-insulator-metal-insulator-metal (MIMIM) structure was explored. Another approach, thin silicon nitride (300 &#197;) MIM capacitor was studied as reference. Capacitance densities of 1.7 and 1.9 fF/&#956;m<sup>2</sup> have been achieved. Their DC and RF characteristics were studied and compared. Satisfactory characterization results were demonstrated. A simple and efficient MIM capacitor equivalent circuit model was applied in this study.

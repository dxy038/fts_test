In mobile cloud computing (MCC) systems, both the mobile access network and the cloud computing network are heterogeneous, implying the diverse configurations of hardware, software, architecture, resource, etc. In such heterogeneous mobile cloud (HMC) networks, both radio and cloud resources could become the system bottleneck, thus designing the schemes that separately and independently manage the resources may severely hinder the system performance. In this paper, we aim to design the network as the integration of the mobile access part and the cloud computing part, utilizing the inherent heterogeneity to meet the diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements of tenants. Furthermore, we propose a novel cross-network radio and cloud resource management scheme for HMC networks, which is QoS-aware, with the objective of maximizing the tenant revenue while satisfying the QoS requirements. The proposed scheme is formulated as a restless bandits problem, whose &#8220;indexability&#8221; feature guarantees the low complexity with scalable and distributed characteristics. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed scheme compared to the existing ones.

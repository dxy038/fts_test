This paper presents the benefit of an increased dc-link bus voltage on power losses in a bidirectional two-level inverter. Inherent power losses in inverter originate in IGBTs and diodes among electric vehicles. A model is built to consider parameters from these devices, electric input (current, voltage, power factor) with improved accuracy to evaluate losses and estimate the junction temperature of IGBT and diode with the help of an equivalent thermal-electric model. Compared are two dc-link bus voltages of 400V and 700V. Also SiC-diode is applied to further improve efficiency in motoring and regeneration modes.

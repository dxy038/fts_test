This paper presents a novel methodology in the formulation of expected energy not served (EENS) considering the forecast errors on load demand and wind generation. The EENS value is then integrated into the objective function to optimize the energy, reserve procurement and EENS costs. Studies on the schedule cost and reliability of the thermal unit system due to forecast errors of system load and wind power generation are performed. This work illustrates the impact on conventional generation systems when the wind energy penetration is varied.

Reader collision problem (RCP) seriously affects the reading efficiency in radio frequency identification (RFID) system s, especially in dense reader environment. This paper proposed a novel cluster based anti-collision solution to deal with the R CP with multiple readers. The existing cluster based solutions do not solve the inter-cluster interference efficiently, and rarely consider the interference among readers that located beyond the overlapping region of clusters. In this paper, multiple clusters are firstly formed based on neighbor node discovery (NND-based Clustering), and the cluster headers (CHs) obtained the intra cluster and neighbor CHs information. Then, the CHs cooperate with their neighbor CHs to allocate resource (time slots) to the slave readers (CHs-Cooperation), which is an optimization problem with objective function of minimizing the interference among readers. The proposed solution solves both the intra-cluster and inter-cluster interferences efficiently and the simulation results show its good performance.

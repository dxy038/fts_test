In this paper, a new approach for a solution of a nonlinear multiobjective programming problem is introduced. An equivalent ηη-approximated vector optimization problem is constructed by a modification of the objective and the constraint functions in the original multiobjective programming problem. The connection between (weak) efficient points in the original multiobjective programming problem and its equivalent ηη-approximated vector optimization problem is proved. In this way, optimality conditions for nonlinear constrained multiobjective programming problems having invex and/or generalized invex objective and constraint functions (with respect to the same functions ηη) are obtained.

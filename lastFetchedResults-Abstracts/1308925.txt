The contamination of drainage channels and creeks with pesticides used in the production of rice is of concern in south eastern Australia. Of major concern is the molinate that at times has been detected in over 25% of water samples from surface drains and creeks. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rice pesticide model RICEWQ version 1.7.2 for its applicability in simulating the fate of the pesticide molinate in paddy rice floodwater in south eastern Australia. The model was successfully calibrated using water depths and molinate concentrations obtained from a rice bay. By using the calibrated model, the effects of the different application methods and the rates of molinate on water quality were investigated.

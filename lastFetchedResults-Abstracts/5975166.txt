A multi-objective optimization formulation for considering multiple view requests in a peer-to-peer multipoint video conferencing system is described. The system aims end-points with varying bandwidth connections to the Internet and makes use of layered video to assure that each participant can view any other participantÂ´s video at anytime. However, this may cause some of the peers to receive lower quality video. We allow multiple video requests from the participants with sufficient bandwidth. Formulations to minimize the number of lower quality video receivers while maximizing the number of additional requests are presented. A multi-objective optimization assigning importance weights to each of these objectives is described and explained with a practical scenario. Sensitivity analysis of the optimization approach, to changes in the weights is made.

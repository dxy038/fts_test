Objective (s): Improving maternal and neonatal care is a priority. In early pregnancy body mass index is an important predictor of pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between BMI and pregnancy outcomes among vulnerable women in Tehran, Iran.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through cluster sampling. Nine hospitals randomly selected from five regions of Tehran including north, south, east, west and the city center. Four hundred pregnant women with low socio-economic status attending to these selected hospitals were included in the study. Data were collected using a valid questionnaire and medical records. 
Results: In all 31% percent of vulnerable pregnant women were overweight (BMI=25-29.9 kg/m2) and 13% were obese (BMI?30 kg/m2). The adjusted odd ratio for diabetes was higher in obese [OR: 6.68, 95% CI: 2.36-18.63] and overweight women [OR: 2.29, 95% CI: 0.51-10.14] compared to mothers with normal BMI. Also compared to women with normal BMI the adjusted odd ratio for pregnancy hypertension was higher in obese [OR: 4.63, 95% CI: 1.40-15.38] and overweight [OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 0.38-12.65] women.
Conclusion: The finding suggests that to improve pregnancy outcomes in vulnerable women, there is need to pay special attention to life style issues in this population during prenatal care.

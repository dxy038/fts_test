Backgrounds & Aims: Metabolic disorders like diabetes type 2, lipid metabolism disorders and hypertension associated with obesity are important health problems today. Recent studies showed the high prevalence of obesity in adolescents. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of obesity with lipid and glucose metabolism disorders in adolescents attending a pediatric endocrine clinic in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran.
Materials & Methods: This is a case - control study conducted on 100 obese and 100 non- obese children, 12-16 years old, selected by serum lipid and glucose sampling after 12-14 h overnight fast. Patients with FBS> 110 mg/dl were selected and glucose tolerance test (1.75 mg/kg) were conducted.
Results: Of the study population , 6% of obese subjects had impaired glucose tolerance test, 37% had hypertriglyceridemia and 20% had hypercholesterolemia compared to 0% , 15% and 7% in control group respectively (p<0.001). Dyslipidemia was more common in obese girls than boys and hypertriglyceridemia was the most frequent lipid abnormality.
Conclusion: This study shows obese children are prone to dyslipidemia and glucose metabolism disorders so, they should be encouraged to adhere to a systematic program of exercise and a balanced diet.

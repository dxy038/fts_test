Corn gluten meal is the high-protein fraction from wet milling of corn. Although protein, minerals, and fat compositions have been reported, minor components that cause unpleasant flavor and taste are not known. The objective of this study was to determine the compounds present in headspace of corn gluten meal and wet cake (dryer feed). A solid-phase microextraction device with a polyacrylate coating was used to collect volatiles for 1 hr at 25 and 100(degree)C above a stirred water slurry of corn gluten meal or wet cake. The absorbed compounds were desorbed onto the inlet injector of a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector. Compound identification was done using a Wiley library and confirmed by retention time of pure compounds in the gas chromatograph. Twenty-nine compounds were identified. Knowledge concerning volatiles of corn gluten meal may lead to improvement of flavor and taste, and increased utilization of this material, produced over 1 million metric tons per year in the United States.

This paper presents a new practical approach of Prony´s Method extended version. The theoretical aspects of the Prony´s algorithm are presented and then applied to realize bass improvement of a small loudspeaker through the well known psychoacoustic phenomenon of the missing fundamental. This new method compared to known algorithms based on FFT analysis seems to have best performances and simpler implementation. Objective and subjective evaluations have been performed to validate the virtual bass improvement.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Objective of this study was to the effect of vibration on some of functional markers of delayed onset muscle soreness.
Methodology: 30 college males with mean age of 21.2, were selected and were divided into two groups randomly. A vibrator was used to apply 50 Hz vibration for 1 min in the VT group, while no vibration was applied in the non?VT group. Then, Both groups performed five sets (10 repetitions per set) of the eccentric contractions , at 85% of one repetition maximum (1- RM). Range of motion at elbow jount Circomference of  nondominant elbow and Muscle soreness  were recorded before, after, 24, 48, 72, 96 (hr) after eccentric contractions.
Statistical Result: The results showed vibration training do show positive effects on Range of motion at elbow joint and Muscle soreness and Circomference of nondominant elbow (p >  0.05).
Discussion: A comparison by experimental groups indicates that VT before eccentric exercise may prevent and control DOMS.

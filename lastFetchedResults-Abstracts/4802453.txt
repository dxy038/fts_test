In order to improve the efficiency of Loading Mechanism for municipal solid waste(MSW), a new loading mechanism which can be used with the waste compacting vehicle was proposed, and the equipment working principle was introduced. Mathematics model of optimization design was established. Objective function and restriction that helps to produce a uniform initial population is used to enhance the optimization efficiency of the genetic algorithms. Instead of using traditional SQP programming method, the configuration was optimized by using MATLAB and the Optimization Toolbox offered by MATLAB. Through the comparison between the optimal scheme and the old scheme, the cost of this equipment was reduced, the performance of the loading mechanism is obviously increased and the validity of the GA is proved.

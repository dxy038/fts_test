The objective of this study was to develop a software application that is able to support plastic surgeons interested in applying simulations and soft tissue modeling during presurgical planning activities. By using our user-friendly interface and force-displacement graphs, users can analyze scalp skin behaviors when subjected to stress. Users can 1) determine the dynamic of a general point of scalp skin after the application of a specific force, 2) predict the force needed for displacement of a point, and 3) study the deformation of all the points of the entire scalp based on the force applied. Results showed how users are able to manipulate and analyze mechanical behaviors on a mechanical model rather than on a pure geometric qualitative physiological model. The entire application was developed on a Silicon Graphics workstation.

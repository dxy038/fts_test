In present investigation, 2-(4-formyl-2-methoxyphenoxy) acetic acid on condensation with various ketones in methanolic KOH solution yielded the corresponding chalcones (1â€“3). These corresponding chalcones were reacted with appropriate acid hydrazide in glacial acetic acid led to the formation of phenoxy acetic acid derivatives. All newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-mycobacterial activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.

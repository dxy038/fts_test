Two issues are addressed in this paper. Firstly, it investigates some important properties of bidirectional associative memories (BAM) and proposes an improved capacity estimate. Those properties are the encoding form of the input pattern pairs as sell as their decoding, the orthogonality of the pattern pairs, the similarity of associated patterns, and the density of the pattern pairs. Secondly, it proposes an implementation approach to improve the storage capacity. The approach embraces three proposed methods, i.e., the bipolar-orthogonal augmentation, the set partition, and the combined method. Along with those methods is the construction of the set of bipolar orthogonal patterns

Study of the history of development of social punishments shows that such punishments have been employed in various models. One of these models is the model of substitution. The sketch of social punishments which have been presently included in the Chapter Nine of the Second Part of the first Book of the Bill of Islamic Punishments is based on the substitution model. Since the rules included in that chapter of the above Bill are not free from problems and defects of the substitution, thus there are certain doubts about success of social punishments included in that Bill. Thus, the legislator proposed to accept social punishments as “independent” reactions which fit the objective of “correction” and correct the rules mentioned in the above-mentioned Chapter Nine to extend the scope of application of social punishments.

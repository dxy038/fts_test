A supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is an integrated platform that incorporates several components and it has been applied in the field of power systems and several engineering applications to monitor, operate and control a lot of processes. In the future electrical networks, SCADA systems are essential for an intelligent management of resources like distributed generation and demand response, implemented in the smart grid context. This paper presents a SCADA system for a typical residential house. The application is implemented on MOVICON&#8482;11 software. The main objective is to manage the residential consumption, reducing or curtailing loads to keep the power consumption in or below a specified setpoint, imposed by the costumer and the generation availability.

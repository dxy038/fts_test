The paper introduces a direct photonic beam steering device, which is intended to be used as a large scale all optical switch array for communication networks. The objective is to direct the light beam with two degrees of freedom, so the beam from any of the input ports can be sent to any of the output ports, satisfying the optical and operation requirements. The technology is enabled through the integration of microelectromechanical systems, thin film piezo actuators, optical engineering technologies, and Axiomatic approach to systems design. The curved electrode electrostatic and thin film piezoelectric actuators are simulated in advance to the microfabrication processes. This technology has the potential of many novel applications such as: all optical switching, microendoscopy and gazable microeye among others.

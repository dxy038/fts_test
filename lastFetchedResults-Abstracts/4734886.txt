Microholographic recording is a promising technology for realizing next-generation large-capacity optical data storage systems because of its three-dimensional nature and its affinity with conventional optical disk systems. To ensure media exchangeability in the optical data storage systems, it is necessary to clarify the influence of aberrations in the optics on a readout signal. In the microholographic recording, the influence of spherical aberration was investigated qualitatively for example. The objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of various kinds of aberrations on the readout signal in the microholographic recording quantitatively through a numerical simulation.

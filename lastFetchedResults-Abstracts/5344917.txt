Presents a comparative analysis of various pancreas models, &#946;-cell models, and glucose control algorithms based on steady-state, dynamic, and frequency responses. The approach highlights desirable aspects of individual models as controllers for insulin delivery devices. Behaviors such as rapid response to hypoglycemia, derivative response to glucose concentration increases and constrained insulin delivery are advantages to be integrated into a glucose control algorithm, whereas large amplitude ratio at high frequency and over-aggressive insulin delivery are undesirable behaviors to be avoided. A better understanding of these systems provides the means to reverse-engineer the biological objective function of the pancreas by identifying individual model components representative of true physiological system responses

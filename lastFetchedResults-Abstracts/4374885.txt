Safety and economic operation in power system is the most important issue for the power industry. Combination of distributed generation into large power grids is considered as the development tendency, however the active power dispatching considering intermittent energy is the bottleneck for the renewable energy integration. This paper comprehensively overviews the dynamic active power scheduling problem considering the intermittent power. Through reviewing models including objective functions and constraints, analyzing and comparing various optimization algorithms, the paper summarizes methodology and research on optimal active power scheduling considering intermittent power based on the basic model. Finally, the issue needed to be studied further is concluded.

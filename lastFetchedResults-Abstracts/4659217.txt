This work focuses on the real-time control of an adept Cobra 600 4-axis SCARA robot through the Internet. In particular, command shaping is applied to move a cable suspended load at the end point with the objective of minimizing load swing. The first part of this paper discusses inverse kinematics, pendulum dynamics calculations, and the corresponding shaping control algorithm. Standardized Internet interface via the DataSocket software in Lab VIEW is then addressed in the second part.

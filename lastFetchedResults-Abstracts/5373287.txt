The rapid progresses of computers introduce evolutionary computations to next step, which is the demand for the variety of Pareto solutions in multi-objective optimization problems. We can calculate a large amount of Pareto solutions in a short time. However, it is difficult to use the acquired Pareto solutions effectively, because the Pareto solutions have multi-dimension of fitness values. This study tries to develop "mining of solutions" technique with visualization. This paper proposes a visualizing method for Pareto solutions which have multi-objective fitness values. The proposed method enables us to grasp the distributed structure of Pareto solutions and clarify the relationship among multi-objective fitness values. This paper shows that the visualized data enables us to interpret the characteristics of Pareto solutions through experimental result

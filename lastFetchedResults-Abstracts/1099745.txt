The twin, co-orbiting GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites were launched in March 2002. The primary objective of the GRACE mission is to determine the Earth's gravity field and its temporal variations with unprecedented accuracy. To satisfy this objective as well as other applications (e.g. atmospheric profiling by radio occultation), accurate orbits for GRACE are required. This paper describes several results related to the use of the data collected by the GRACE GPS receiver, high precision accelerometer observations and precise attitude data from star trackers in the application of the GRACE Precise Orbit Determination (POD). The orbit accuracy is assessed using a number of tests, which include analysis of GPS tracking observation residuals, Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) residuals, K-Band Ranging (KBR) residuals and external orbit comparisons. The results show that an accuracy of better than 5 cm in each direction for GRACE orbits can be obtained. The relative accuracy of the two GRACE satellites is about 1 cm in position and 10 micrometers per second in velocity.

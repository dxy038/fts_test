The objective of this research was to create an object component oriented requirements analysis software tool that enables enterprises to analyze and design all critical aspects of their demanufacturing processes over the web and/or their company intranets. Our solution provides an analytical method for evaluating various disassembly line manager and operator user requirements, based on appropriate engineering solutions, including the parameter ranges and their correlation matrices of such solutions. The result of this R&amp;D effort is our implemented and validated, web-enabled, open source CORA Tool (object/component oriented requirements analysis tool).

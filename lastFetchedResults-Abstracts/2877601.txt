This paper considers the decoy location problem, i.e., the problem of determining optimal locations for decoys that protect a surface-based radar against an anti-radiation missile. The objectives of the problem are to simultaneously maximize distances between the missileÂ´s detonation point and the radar as well as the decoys. The problem is solved using a stochastic simulation model providing the distances as well as a ranking and selection procedure called MOCBA-p. In the procedure, location combinations are evaluated through a multi-attribute utility function with incomplete preference information regarding weights related to the objectives. In addition, multi-objective computing budget allocation is used for allocating simulation replications such that the best combinations are selected correctly with high confidence. Numerical experiments presented in the paper illustrate the suitability of MOCBA-p for solving the decoy location problem. It provides computational advantages over an alternative procedure while also enabling ease of determining the weights.

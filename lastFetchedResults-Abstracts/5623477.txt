This paper introduces a novel, resource-semantic approach to designing site structure for Web applications. In this approach, every resource constituting the site is assigned a specific, distinct semantics called identity, and an identifier in form of URI which expresses this identity as a user-readable string. Identity is connected to concepts in Web application domain; it is constructed and manipulated as an RDF graph, suitable for manipulation within the application. Site structure defines a bidirectional mapping between the identities and identifiers, which are placed in resource representations. An experimental framework implementing the approach is also presented.

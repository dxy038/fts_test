Objective: Assessment of Metabolic and developmental condition of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC)-derived cardiomyocytes in Mice based on kinetic properties of Creatine Kinase (CK) compare with neonatal cardiomyocytes.
Materials and Methods: ESCs were differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes spontaneously, and neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from 2-4 day old pulp mice. Total protein were extracted by sonication and centrifugation for determining kinetic properties of creatine kinase with spectrophotometric methods.
Result: Specific activity of CK for CrP was 3.26±0.26 and 5.67±0.35 mM and its km was 50.25±2.21 and 43.48f2,04pmol min-'mg' in ESC-and neonatal-derived cardiomyocytes respectively. Optimum pH of CK activity was 7 for ESC-derived cardiomyocytes and 6.5 for neonatal-derived cardiomyocytes. The optimum temperature of CK activity was 45°C for both enzyme preparations.
Conclusion: This data showed ESC-derived cardiomyocytes displayed a model that seems to resemble the in vitro development of cardiomyocytes.

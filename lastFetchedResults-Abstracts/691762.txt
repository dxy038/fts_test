This paper deals with the estimation of the parameters of the Monod model for the activated sludge process on the basis of oxygen uptake rate data only. The objective of the paper is to concentrate on the practical identifiability properties of the model and on the design of informative experiments for parameter estimation. The results are illustrated by experimental data. Improvements in parameter estimation accuracy with a factor 2 can be obtained by small extensions of the respirometric experiments. The optimal experimental design procedure for parameter estimation (OED/PE) can be implemented in the respirographic sensor.

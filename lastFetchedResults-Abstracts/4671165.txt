Owing to the current evolution of computational tools, a complicated parameter optimization problem could be effectively solved by a computer. In this paper, a CAD tool for multi-objective controller design based on MATLAB program is developed. In addition, simple GUIs which provide a visual approach in specifying the contraints are also constructed using GUIDE tools within MATLAB. The linear controller design problem can be cast as the convex optimization subjected to time domain and frequency domain constraints. This optimization problem is efficiently solved within a finite dimensional subspace by a practical ellipsoid algorithm. In the design process, we include a model reduction of the resulting controller to speed up the computational efficiency. Finally, a numerical example shows the capability of the program to design multi-objective controller for a one-link flexible robot arm.

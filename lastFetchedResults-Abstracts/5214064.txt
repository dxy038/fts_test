We investigate the physics of bidirectional injection-locking in optoelectronic oscillators (OEO). In particular, we identify the effects of injection strength on phase noise and spurious modes for a dual injection-locked OEO. Our experimental data is then used to design a numerical model of a dual injection-locked OEO. This model will be used in the future to optimize the multi-dimensional injection-locking parameters to achieve minimal phase noise and spurious mode levels.

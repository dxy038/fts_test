This paper presents an optimum switching pattern for the space vector modulation (SVM) of matrix converters based on a genetic algorithm. The possibility of choosing the sequence of active duty cycles, and the ability to allocate the duration of the inactive duty cycle to each one of the zero duty cycles in a matrix converter SVM, provide some degrees of freedom in designing of the switching pattern. This leads to an optimization problem. Therefore, a suitable genetic algorithm for solving the switching pattern optimization problem is adopted, and an objective function to minimize the weighted total harmonic distortion (WTHD) and the low-order harmonics of the output voltage is proposed. Simulations in Matlab/Simulink confirm the validity of analytical achievements.

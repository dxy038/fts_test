In this document is presented the implementation of the programming schedules as a method of lighting control, to perform a total saving and a personalized saving using neural networks. With the acquisition of a series of data about the operation of five lightings located in different parts of a specific house, it was designed a neural network to illuminate it and was implemented this design to the remaining. These neural networks were trained with input vectors; hour of the day, day of the week, holiday Monday\Â´s and their respective objective vectors "total saving and personalized saving" with the purpose of evaluating the performance of the neural networks in the optimization of methods for saving electric energy in residential lighting.

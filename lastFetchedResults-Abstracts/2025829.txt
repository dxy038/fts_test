In this paper we introduce effective data hiding for
image annotation, High fidelity is a demanding requirement
for data hiding for images with artistic or medical value. This
correspondence proposes image watermarking for annotation
with robustness to moderate distortion. To achieve the high
fidelity of the embedded image, the model is built by mixing
the outputs from entropy and a differential localized standard
deviation filter. The mixture is then low-pass filtered and
normalized to provide a model that produces substantially
better perceptual hi-fidelity than existing tools of similar
complexity. The model is built by embedding two basic
watermarks: a pilot watermark that locate the existence of
the watermark and an information watermark that carries a
payload of several dozen bits. The objective is to embed 32
bits of metadata into a single image in such a way that it is
robust to JPEG compression and cropping

An analysis is presented of a system consisting of a three-phase delta connected inductive static load controlled by unidirectional and bi-directional controllers. The voltage and current equations are developed for a delta connected inductive circuit representing the steady state model of an inductive load. The simulated and actual voltage and current waveforms for unidirectional and bidirectional controllers are illustrated.

This paper studies the two-agent scheduling on an unbounded serial-batching machine. In the problem, there are two agents A and B each having their respective job sets. The jobs of different agent cannot be processed in a common batch. Moreover, each agent has an objective function to be minimized. The objective function of agent A is the makespan of his jobs and the objective function of agent B is maximum lateness of his jobs. The target is to find all Pareto optimal solutions for the two agents. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding all Pareto optimal solutions of this two-agent serial-batching scheduling problem.

In 1978, dynamic instability of the Great Britain power system associated with power transfers from Scotland to England was first noted. To solve this problem power system stabilisers were applied to selected generators in Scotland. The author describes the series of tests undertaken on the Great Britain power system between 1980 and 1985. The objective of the tests was to measure system damping with and without power system stabilisers in service, and with various combinations of stabilisers. The tests indicated that system damping was considerably improved by the use of power system stabilisers, such that operators now have the confidence to assume that the dynamic stability limit on transfers from Scotland to England is higher than the transient stability limit

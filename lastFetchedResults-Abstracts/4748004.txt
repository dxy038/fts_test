The reduction of the ripple of driving force is required for the practical utilization of linear synchronous motor for rope-less elevator. In addition, it is important to increase the driving force and reduce the weight of motor. In this paper, the Halbach type permanent magnet linear motor is optimized by using the evolution strategy (ES) method in order to reduce the ripple and to increase the driving force. Multi-objective results are also discussed.

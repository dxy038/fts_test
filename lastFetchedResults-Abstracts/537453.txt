Objective
This study was conducted to determine the frequency of urinary tract infection(UTI) among children with febrile convulsion (FC).
Materials & Methods
We analyzed the hospital records of 137 children who had been admitted to thepediatric ward from March 2004 to February 2007 because of FC. Informationsuch as age, sex, developmental status, type of FC, family history of seizure,urine sampling method, and the results of antibiograms were recorded.
Results
The age distribution of 137 patients (82 boys, 55 girls) was as follows: 1-6 monthsof age, 1 infant (0.7%); 6-12 months, 21 infants (15.3%); 1-3 years, 75 (54.8%);3-5 years, 30 (21.9%); and more than 5 years, 10 (7.3%). Three out of the 82boys and 6 out of the 55 girls had UTI (3.7% vs. 10.9%, total, 6.6%). The agedistribution of these 9 patients was as follows: 1-6 months, 1 patient (11.1%);7-12 months, 5 (55.6%); and 1-3 years, 3 (33.3%). The relative incidence of UTIwas 6.6%. The most common organisms causing infections were Escherichiacoli in 8 and Proteus spp., in 1 patient (88.8% vs. 11.1%). Simple FC was seenin all 9 patients with UTI.
Conclusion
In this study, the relative frequency of UTI among children with FC was 6.6%and this frequency was higher that the incidence of UTI in girls and boys(3-5% and 1%, respectively). Therefore, we recommend that UTI should beconsidered as an important cause of FC in children.

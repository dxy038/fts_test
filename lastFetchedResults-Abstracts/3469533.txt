An experimental comparative study of various controllers for a class of ac-dc converters, known as power factor precompensators (PFP) is presented. The control objective is to robustly regulate the output voltage to a desired constant level in the presence of variations in the load, while retaining a unit power factor at the input, i.e., the input current should follow in frequency and in phase the input voltage. Several control schemes are presented and compared via experiments.

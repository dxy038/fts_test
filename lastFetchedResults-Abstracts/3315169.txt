Often different research fields provide their own perspective on the same topic, many times implicitly and unknowingly. If made aware one of each other, they could purposively draw from each other, creating novel archetypical solutions in their own field. Conversely, such attempts are scant. Correspondingly, the purpose of this article is to scrutinize the bidirectional linkage between the pervasive concept of Product-Services (P-S) in manufacturing with the novel innovation strategy Design Driven Innovation (DDI). The latter aims at providing radical changes in the meaning of the product. Our findings depict that the P-S strategy is a viable approach to create radical changes of meaning using DDI, which is not solely oriented on existing usersÂ´ needs, but is foremost creating new ones. This findings call for a revision of existing definition of servitization. Finally, the potential benefits of PS are depicted in the DDI strategy.

This study analysed the implementation and performance of a novel procedure based on wavelet atomic functions (WAF) used in the high-resolution reconstruction of colour and greyscale video sequences of different types. The approach, which is justified based on key Wavelet properties such as cosine approximation, Reisz values, etc., permits the enhancement of video resolution by four times in comparison with that of the initial image format. Statistical simulation results method based on WAFs performs better at improving resolution than do existing frameworks, both in terms of objective criteria and based on the more subjective measure of human vision. Implementations of the proposal on a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) have demonstrated the possibility of real-time processing.

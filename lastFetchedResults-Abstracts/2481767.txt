ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the relationship between joint sounds and radiographic findings could be helpful in selecting a suitable treatment for internal temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD). This study aimed to evaluate degenerative changes, condyle position and joint effusion in patients with TMJD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a gold standard procedure.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 34 patients diagnosed with TMJD via MRI. MRI images were obtained from the sagittal plane of the subjects using 5.0 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Scanner with open and closed mouth. Click sounds were divided into three categories based on the origin of the sound while opening the mouth: premature ( < 15 mm), intermediate (16-30 mm), and delayed ( > 31 mm). In addition, effusion volume, condyle-fossa relationship, swelling of the joints and degenerative changes were evaluated in the patients.
FINDINGS: Regarding the condyle position in the fossa, 32 of the examined joints (47.1%) were in central position, 30 (44.1%) were in posterior position, and 6 joints (8.8%) were in the upper position. Moreover, 34 joints (70.8%) had clicks, and 14 joints (70%) had no clicks or symptoms of osteoarthritis. Following that, grade-zero and grade-one effusions accounted for the highest number of examined joints, and there was no significant relationship between effusion volume and type of clicking. In the study group with clicking joints, 10 cases (14.7%) had premature clicks, 20 (29.4%) had intermediate clicks, and 18 joints (26.5%) had delayed clicks.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, presence or absence of premature, intermediate and delayed clicks have no effects on condylar position in the fossa, effusion volume and occurrence of osteoarthritis in MRI.

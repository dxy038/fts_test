Abstract form only given. The main theme of this research subject is the study and the development of a low cost and energy efficient railway balise. To design this balise, we must use some new radio techniques that consume a small amount of electric energy. The first idea that came to our minds is the new concept of communication called &#8220;green communication&#8221;; the aim of this research field is the improvement of the energy efficiency of communication systems and the optimization of communication networks. Beside the energy consumption constraint, the balise must localize the train precisely when this latter passes and must offer a high data rate bidirectional communication link. But in this work, we only inspect the energy efficiency problem.

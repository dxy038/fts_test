Objective
sion levels of MUC1 and TLR-2 were evaluated in burning mouth syndrome (BMS) patients and compared with those of controls and oral lichen planus (OLP) patients. The relationships between the expression levels of MUC1 and TLR-2 and levels of salivary pro-inflammatory cytokines were also investigated.

male BMS and ten female OLP patients were included. Ten female age-matched volunteers served as controls. RNA was isolated from stimulated whole saliva samples. Real-time PCR was used to quantify MUC1 and TLR-2 mRNA levels relative to β-actin and GAPDH mRNA levels. The clarified supernatants of saliva samples were used to measure IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels. The level of blood contamination in saliva samples was also determined.
s
were significant increases in MUC1 transcripts in BMS patients compared with OLP patients (1.766-fold) as well as controls (1.840-fold). There was no significant difference in TLR-2 expression among the groups. The OLP patients showed significantly higher levels of IL-6 and blood contamination in saliva than other groups. The levels of MUC1 or TLR-2 expression did not correlate significantly with the levels of cytokines or blood contamination in saliva.
sions
ay play a role in the development and/or progression of BMS.

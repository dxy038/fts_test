The objective of this work is to determine the amount of nitrogen oxides per hour in a period of one year of the CRG 1870, 420 t/h boiler. In the second phase of paper was carried out a comparative study of nitrogen oxide emissions caused by the methodology used by SC CET SA Bacau, based on CORINAIR emission factors, and the mathematical model obtained on the flow due time.

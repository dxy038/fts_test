High throughput screening (HTS) is now a powerful tool for a variety of analytical and synthetic methods. The objective of this study was to examine the potential of using high throughput methods to rapidly screen a large number of process variables in the development of effective microfiltration processes. Data were obtained in 96-well plates, syringe filters, unstirred filtration cells, and small cartridge filters. The membrane resistance was very similar in the different formats, except for data obtained in the pleated filter which were influenced by large parasitic pressure losses in the cartridge. The specific resistance of bakerâ€™s yeast deposits was evaluated over a range of cake thickness, solution ionic strength, and in the presence or absence of a poly-cationic flocculant. The data obtained in 96-well filter plates were in good agreement with results from the larger filters, demonstrating the scalability of the results. Effective conditions for yeast microfiltration were identified, suggesting that high throughput screening techniques can be a useful tool for process development and optimization.

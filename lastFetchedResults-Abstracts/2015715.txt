This paper mainly focuses on refrigerant mixtures with relatively simple critical behavior, and presents a practical and useful method for the critical point calculation for the mixtures using mixture models based on Helmholtz energy equations of state. The expression for critical point criterion suitable for this objective is derived first. Numerical manipulations to obtain a physically correct solution are described in detail. For four binary refrigerant mixtures of difluoromethane (R-32) + pentafluoroethane (R-125), R-125 + 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R-134a), R-125 + 1,1,1-trifluoroethane (R-143a), and R-32 + propane (R-290), the critical temperatures and critical molar volumes are calculated applying the presented method. The calculation results are compared with experimental values, and the capabilities of the mixture models for the mixtures in the critical region are discussed.

In this paper we consider the problem of driving to zero by means of state feedback the state of a nonlinear plant when only an approximate model of the plant is known and the information about its state is sampled. To this aim, we develop a specific model based control scheme and, under suitable hypotheses, we give a sufficient condition, in terms of length of the sampling interval and of other design parameters, for achieving the control objective.

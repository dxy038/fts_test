A network-topology-based capacitor control algorithm for distribution systems is proposed in this paper. Two matrices, the bus-injection to branch-current matrix and the branch-current to bus-voltage matrix, are developed based on the network topology of distribution systems and used to derive the proposed method. These two matrices can be used to represent the relationships between the bus voltages, branch currents and bus current injections. Sensitivity relationships between the incremental capacitor shifts and the system status can be developed based on these two matrices, and then the sensitivity-based objective function and network constraints can be formulated. The linear formulation can then be solved by the commonly used linear programming technique. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by a corrective-dispatching problem. Test results show that the proposed method is robust and accurate; therefore it has great potential for real-time operation.

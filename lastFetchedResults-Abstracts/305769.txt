Objective. To determine whether electron beam computed tomography (CT) adds to conventional risk factor assessment in the prediction of angiographic coronary artery disease.

Background. Electron beam CT scanning can be used to predict the severity of coronary atherosclerosis, but whether it does so independently of conventional risk factors is unclear.

Methods. Electron beam CT scans were performed and conventional risk factors were measured in 290 men and women undergoing coronary arteriography for clinical indications. The association of the electron beam CT-derived coronary artery calcium score and conventional risk factors with the presence and severity of angiographically defined coronary atherosclerosis was analyzed by logistic regression and receiver-operator characteristics analysis.

Results. Age, the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the coronary calcium score were significantly and independently associated with the presence of any coronary disease and obstructive coronary disease. In association with any coronary disease, odds ratios for age, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol and calcium score, highest quartile vs. lowest quartile, were 6.01 (95% confidence interval 2.87 to 12.56), 3.14 (1.56 to 6.31) and 94.08 (21.06 to 420.12), respectively. For obstructive coronary disease, highest quartile vs. lowest quartile, the respective odds ratios for age, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL and calcium score were 3.86 (1.86 to 8.00), 4.11 (1.98 to 8.52) and 34.12 (12.67 to 91.86). Male gender was also significantly associated with any coronary disease (odds ratio 2.19, p = 0.04) and obstructive coronary disease (odds ratio 2.07, p = 0.04). Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with any coronary disease (odds ratio = 2.74, p = 0.004), and diabetes was significantly associated with obstructive disease (odds ratio 3.16, p = 0.01). After adjustment for the coronary calcium score and other risk factors, it was determined that triglycerides, family history and hypertension were not significantly associated with any disease state.  coronary calcium score ≥80 (Agatston method) was associated with an increased likelihood of any coronary disease regardless of the number of risk factors, and  coronary calcium score ≥170 was associated with an increased likelihood of obstructive coronary disease regardless of the number of risk factors (p < 0.001).

Conclusion. Electron beam CT scanning offers improved discrimination over conventional risk factors in the identification of persons with any angiographic coronary disease or angiographic obstructive coronary disease.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), as a central element of IFN-γ-signaling, plays a critical role in tumor suppression. However, its expression and underlying molecular mechanism remain elusive in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, we examined IRF8 expression and methylation in RCC cell lines and primary tumors, and further assessed its tumor suppressive functions. We found that IRF8 was widely expressed in human normal tissues including kidney, but frequently downregulated by promoter methylation in RCC cell lines. IRF8 methylation was detected in 25% of primary tumors, but not in adjacent non-malignant renal tissues, and associated with higher tumor nuclear grade of RCC. Ectopic expression of IRF8 inhibited colony formation and migration abilities of RCC cells, through inducing cell cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis. IFN-γ could induce IRF8 expression in RCC cells, together with increased cleaved-PARP. We further found that IRF8 inhibited expression of oncogenes YAP1 and Survivin, as well as upregulated expression of tumor suppressor genes CASP1, p21 and PTEN. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IRF8 as a functional tumor suppressor is frequently methylated in RCC, and IRF8-mediated interferon signaling is involved in RCC pathogenesis.

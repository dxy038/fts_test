Objective:
Compare the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) assay and the tuberculin skin test (TST) in bladder cancer patients receiving high dose BCG therapy (BCG patients).
Design and methods:
BCG patients and healthy visitors, both exposed to tuberculosis, were screened with a TST and QFT.
Results:
QFT-TST correlation was excellent in visitors, but poor in BCG patients. BCG therapy predicted a positive TST (p < 0.001) but not a positive QFT (p = 0.35).
Discussion:
The management of BCG patients was impacted, by measuring the QFT.

Within the framework of the project Ko-Tag, various antenna array configurations for Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation in traffic scenarios in the 5.8 GHz frequency band are investigated. The main objective of the project is the protection of vulnerable road users and vehicle-vehicle-safety using a cooperative sensor technology on the basis of transponder systems. The focus of this study was the dependency of the phase differences of the single antenna elements on the angular coordinates as well as its consideration in AoA estimation.

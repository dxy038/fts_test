Objective
To explore the hypothesis of an association between current wheeze and other health problems in adolescence and to investigate any sex differences.
Methods

N = 8817 adolescents aged 13–19 years completed a self-administered questionnaire including questions on health and lifestyle in Norway (1995–1997).
Results

All subjective health problems were significantly more prevalent in current wheezers compared to non-wheezers (frequent headache: girls 18% vs. 9%, boys 8% vs. 3%; frequent neck and shoulder pain: girls 10% vs. 5%, boys 6% vs. 2%; frequent joint and muscle pain: girls 6% vs. 2%, boys 6% vs. 2%; and frequent abdominal pain: girls 10% vs. 3%, boys 3% vs.1%). In both sexes, adjusted for covariates, current wheezers had statistically significant increased risk of reporting frequent headache (girls OR = 2.0, boys OR = 2.9), frequent neck and shoulder pain (girls OR = 1.9, boys OR = 3.3), frequent joint and muscle pain (girls OR = 2.7, boys OR = 3.5) and frequent abdominal pain (girls OR = 2.7, boys OR = 2.0).
Conclusions

Current adolescent wheezers reported more additional health problems compared to non-wheezers. Even if girls reported more symptoms in general, the associations were stronger in boys. The findings are important for the clinical approach to teenage wheezers and should increase doctors' awareness of coexistence of other health complaints in these patients.

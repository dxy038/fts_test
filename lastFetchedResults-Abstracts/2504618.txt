Background: Genital tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of infertility in the developing countries, where hysterosalpingography (HSG) remains an initial diagnostic procedure in the evaluation of tubal and peritoneal factors leading to infertility. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the HSG findings of genital TB in infertile women. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed HSG findings in 20 women with genital tuberculosis. HSG was performed in these women as part of infertility work up over 5 years. The other diagnostic procedures used included endometrial curettage and biopsy, histological examination, culture, laparoscopy, hysteroscopy and polymerase chain reaction. Results: The mean age of the participants was 30.5Â±8 years. All women had clinical history of infertility for at least 4 years. Women presented with pelvic abdominal pain (30-35%) and menstrual disturbances (20-25%). Reviewing 20 cases of female genital TB were encountered various presentations on HSG. Conclusion: HSG is an invaluable procedure in suggesting the diagnosis of genital TB in patients being investigated for infertility

Critical path method (CPM) is a project network analysis techniques for one or more activity by analyzing the sequence (line) scheduling flexibility (the total float) at least to predict the duration. The traditional method solves earliest time through forward pass and latest time through backward pass, to determine the critical path. However, as for large-scale and complex projects, the traditional methods commits calculation of predecessor activity of maximal earliest start time and minimum follow-up to the latest start time to a great memory. Using 0-1 programming method Can be easily adapted to different sizes to establish critical path network plan and quickly solve the mathematical model, and then through the objective function of model sensitivity analysis, critical path change problem can be solved. Besides, the metod provide basic computer algorithm for the large-scale program of complex network.

Biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of chronic liver diseases. However, the concordance between readers is subject to variability causing an increasing need of objective tissue description methods. A complete framework has been implemented to analyze histological images from any kind of tissue. Based on the feature selection approach, it computes the most relevant subset of descriptors in terms of classification from a wide initial list of local and global descriptors. In comparison with equivalent methods, this implementation is able to find lists of descriptors which are significantly shorter for an equivalent accuracy and furthermore it enables the classification of slides using combinations of global and local measurements. The results have pointed that it could reach an accuracy of 82.8% in a human liver fibrosis grading approach by selecting 6 descriptors from an initial set of 258 global and local descriptors.

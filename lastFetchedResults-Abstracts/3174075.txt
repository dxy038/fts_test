Previous research has suggested that there is a trust `gap\Â´. Whilst tangible security aspects of such services are relatively well understood, intangible aspects of trust, particularly with respect to trust formation and validation amongst e-partners is a much less well developed area. The contribution offered is largely conceptual at present. The semiotic ladder is used to support the VO service lifecycle (analysis and design) whilst run-time execution is supported via the articulation of a supportive trust agent. The intention is to offer all parties better support for trust (as reputation) management including the reduction of risk and improved reliability of VO e-services. A novel trust agent is proposed that seeks to provide an e-service consumer with an objective measure of the trustworthiness of the e-service at run-time, just prior to its actual consumption. Specifically, VO e-service consumer confidence level is informed, by leveraging third party objective evidence. This comprises a set of Corporate Governance (CG) scores. CG scores are used as a trust proxy for the "real" owner of the VO. The scores have inherent limitations, and these are duly acknowledged.

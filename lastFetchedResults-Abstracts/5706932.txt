The Content Centric Networking (CCN) architectural framework is designed with the central abstraction of content distribution rather than host-to-host connectivity. CCN has several advantages such as inherent router caching, lower content retrieval time and network load reduction. However, it also faces various challenges such as scalability, deployment and storage issues. In particular, the routing state information that needs to be maintained in the CCN routers leads to very high memory requirements that might not be met using current technologies. If the routing state information stored in the routers is reduced, it leads to flooding of interest packets increasing congestion in the network. The objective of this paper is to propose techniques that avoid congestion due to interest flooding in CCN while having low router memory requirements. We have proposed three different algorithms to address this problem and present their performance using discrete-event simulation models.

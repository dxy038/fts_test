In this paper, an AC power supply system is proposed using a vehicle engine-generator set with the battery. The output power of an engine-generator set is converted to the DC power through a three-phase diode rectifier. The boost converter and dual-active-bridge isolated bidirectional DC/DC converter with the battery ensure that the DC voltage (connected to the inverter) level is kept constant. The DC/AC single- and three-phase voltage source inverters with output LC filters produce the constant-voltage constant-frequency (CVCF) output. The system performance is shown through the simulation results.

Objective:
We examined several critical parameters that must be optimized when converting between the ABI Prism 7700 real-time PCR platform and the Cepheid SmartCycler® II while using the same primer and probe sequences.
Design and methods:
A lyophilized master mix, MgCl2 concentration, PCR cycling conditions, and ramp times were evaluated.
Results:
Optimization of each parameter, including use of the OmniMix™ HS-lyophilized beads, 6 mM MgCl2 concentration, changes in PCR cycling parameters, and increased ramp time were necessary to convert this real time PCR assay to a new platform.
Conclusion:
We conclude that careful consideration of several analytical parameters can result in a smooth transition of assays between real time PCR platforms.

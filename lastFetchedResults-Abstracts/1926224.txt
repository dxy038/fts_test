Conceptus estrogen clearly plays a major role in luteal maintenance in the pig; however, other conceptus-derived substances or conceptus-induced uterine secretory products appear to have a local luteotrophic/anti-luteolytic effect on the corpora lutea (CL) and likely may play a key role in maternal recognition of pregnancy in the pig. The objective of these studies was to compare PGF2α-induced luteolysis in estrogen-treated ‘pseudopregnant’ gilts versus pregnant gilts during the period of maternal recognition of pregnancy. In Experiment 1, doses of PGF2α ranging from 1 to 100 μg were administered via intraluteal silastic implants to pseudopregnant gilts to determine the dose necessary to cause functional (progesterone) and structural (weight) luteal regression similar to that observed during the natural estrous cycle. Luteal sensitivity to this minimally effective luteolytic dose of PGF2α was then determined for both pseudopregnant and pregnant gilts in Experiment 2. Experiment 3 investigated whether Day 13 porcine conceptus tissue could directly prevent PGF2α-induced luteolysis at the level of the CL. The minimally effective luteolytic dose of PGF2α (100 μg) determined in the pseudopregnant pig caused a similar decline in progesterone concentration and weight of CL in pregnant gilts, suggesting that the susceptibility of CL of pregnant and pseudopregnant pigs to PGF2α is similar. However, luteal weight was greater (P&lt;0.05) for the pregnant gilts than for pseudopregnant gilts, suggesting that estrogen treatment alone cannot mimic the conceptus effects on CL growth and development. Experiment 3 demonstrated that lyophilized Day 13 conceptus tissue implanted directly into individual CL could partially inhibit PGF2α-induced luteolysis, providing for the first time direct evidence that porcine conceptuses as early as Day 13 contain factors which can directly (i. e. at the level of the CL) prevent luteal regression.

The stated objective of the first workshop on Collaboration and Cloud Computing" in WETICE 2009 was "to analyze current trends in Cloud Computing and identify long-term research themes and facilitate collaboration in future research in the field that will ultimately enable global advancements in the field that are not dictated or driven by the prototypical short term profit driven motives of a particular corporate entity." This report describes the progress made within the span of three conferences which helped develop a new approach to the convergence of distributed clouds, grids and their management. This track presents a new computing model and its implementation which resulted directly from the collaboration of the two workshops, Collaboration and Cloud Computing Workshop and the Emerging Technologies for Next-Generation GRIDs sponsored under the Aegis of WETICE. In this paper we present some of the key issues that still need to be addressed to improve the efficiencies and utilize the new generation of many-core servers that are transforming the information technology landscape. We hope WETICE2011 will continue the tradition to forge new collaborations and lead to innovation without a short term agenda.

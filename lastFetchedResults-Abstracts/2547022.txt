Introduction: Over the past few decades, two revolutionary
approaches have emerged as a new form of medical education:
Electronic Medical Education and Web-based Medical Education.
A number of well-known medical institutions, such as Harvard
and Johns Hopkins used a wide range of cyberspace capabilities
to increase their competitiveness. Researchers have expressed that
cyberspace will change health system’s main objective of training
physicians and medical education. We conducted this study to
identify the health system critical considerations on core issues,
involving the development of medical education on cyberspace.
Methods: In order to conduct this study, we observed the steps
of a critical literature review, combined with the ‘Four-phase
method’ adopted by Carnwell and Daly. We focused on particular
literature on health and cyber system functions; it was associated
with systemic approach.
Results: We developed a six-level taxonomy, Cyber level,
Governance level, Ministerial level, Organizational level,
Program level and Performance level, as a key solution that can be
applied for the success of medical education on cyberspace. The
results were summarized and appraised in more details.
Conclusion: Medical education on cyberspace is a complex
interdisciplinary system. It is important that all aspects of the
health systems be involved as integral to the development of cyber
based medical education; without this convergence, we will be
confused by the decisions made by others within the system. Health
system should also communicate with those external sectors that
are critical to achieving better learning on cyberspace. Integrated
planning, governance and management of medical education in
cyberspace are pivotal elements for the promotion.

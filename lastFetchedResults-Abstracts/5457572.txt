For the next processor generation, many cores and parallel programming will provide high-throughput and high-performance processing. As a consequence, research works have studied on-chip interconnection architectures to identify alternatives capable of decreasing the communication latencies. The objective of this paper is to present the evaluation of three well-known architectures (bus, crossbar switch and a conventional network-on-chip) in order to propose a multi-cluster network-on-chip architecture for parallel processing. The results show that a NoC composed of programmable routers and crossbar switches to interconnect clusters of cores has a better performance than conventional NoCs.

The objective was to make use of the combination of waste glass powder (GP) and rice husk ash (RHA) as replacement for Portland cement. Hybrid mixtures containing 0–20% GP and 0–20% RHA were prepared. The best values of replacements by GP and RHA, based on the 28-days compressive strength and strength activity index, were determined as 10% and 5%, respectively. From these results, the properties of hybrid concrete tended to increase with age due to the development of higher pozzolanic activity. The results also revealed good evidence that both GP and RHA can be used together in concrete without any adverse effects.

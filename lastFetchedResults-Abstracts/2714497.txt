The objective of this paper is to propose the development of a multiinput dc-dc converter (MIC) family, which is composed of isolated and/or nonisolated dc-dc converters. By analyzing five basic isolated dc-dc converters, four isolated pulsating voltage source cells and three isolated pulsating current source cells are generated. Moreover, a semiisolated multiinput converter (S-MIC) for hybrid PV/wind power charger system which can simplify the power system, reduce the cost, deliver continuous power, and overcome high-voltage-transfer-ratio problems is proposed. In this paper, the operational principle of the proposed S-MIC is explained, the small-signal ac model is derived, and the controller design is developed. Computer simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the accuracy of the proposed small-signal ac model and the performance of the proposed S-MIC.

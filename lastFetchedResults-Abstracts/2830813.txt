This paper outlines a means to manage electrical competence in an International Oil Company and begins to explore the connections that may be possible to the industry in general and a possible role for the Petroleum and Chemical Industry Committee in this process. A key objective is to allow new employees in the electrical discipline to add value to the business as quickly and effectively as possible. This sometimes involves acquisition of new knowledge and behaviors. Some resources and programs are available on the open market but these are usually not well matched to the specific needs of the industries covered by the oil, gas and chemical sector - often the focus is more on utility companies. By sharing the needs of this International Oil Company and the initial response from the Petroleum and Chemical Industry Committee - Europe, it is hoped to stimulate further thinking and possible alignment on this important subject.

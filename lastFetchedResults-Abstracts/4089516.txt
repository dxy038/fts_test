SERIES capacitors have been recognized for some time as a means of increasing the amount of power transmitted over a long transmission line and as a means of increasing the distance that alternating-current power can be transmitted economically.<sup>1</sup> The basic concept of neutralizing any portion of the series inductive reactance of a long transmission system by means of series capacitors is theoretically sound. The practical application of series capacitors for such service introduces several new and interesting problems of system design and operation, which while capable of solution will require the attention of engineers of both the equipment manufacturers and the operating companies. It is the objective of this paper to outline system characteristics encountered when series-capacitor compensation is used, with a view toward solving the problems arising therefrom. No attempt will be made to reexamine the relative cost of transmission with and without series compensation. In fact, the cost of the compensated system will be influenced to a certain degree by the methods used to solve the problems arising through use of series compensation.

improper consumption of the energy has adverse effects 011 the development and
economy of the developing countries as a result of reduction in the potential energy
production. This is due to high investment in the energy production and import of
technology. The main objective of this study is to present the rate of electrical enegry
which IS undesirablely lest in the water pumping stations in Iran as a result of poor
operations. Till: standard and current pumping efficiency indices arc separately estimated
and compared for the rnedern and traditional electro-pumping stations operated in the
agricultural and industrial sectors. The result proves that application of the standards in
design and selection of pump and piping systems along with implementation of operating
management \\ ill improve current operating efficiency of pumping in large, and can save
us much as 6.07% of total electrical energy production in Iran each year. The price for
the saved electrical energy is estimated \.0 be 17~6 (10 9
) Rls and 4019 (10'') Rls
(computed based on the local and international energy production prices), respectively
each year.

In a time of digitalization and informationization for mine enterprise, based on the complication of multiobjective ore blending planning and management, a question of fuzzy multi-objective ore blending is proposed. Then according to linguistic preference information and satisfying degree of decision maker, a fuzzy multi-objective optimization algorithm is designed. The algorithm effectively solves the difficulties in multi-objective decisions, such as difficult to quantify certain objectives and restrictions and to weigh decision objectives subjectively, and different dimensions of objectives. It has also the characteristics of flexibility and sensitivity, which is verified through a application example of certain mine, it is a practical, great universal method or means for the mine ore blending planning and management.

The paper proposes a mathematical model to optimize wind power turbine maintenance by minimizing the total costs with preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance and costs due to energy losses. Objective function is an economic function and is represented by the total costs associated with actions of preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance and production losses due to interruption of equipment operation during maintenance activities. Furthermore, a study case is presented to show the implementation of the proposed mathematical model.

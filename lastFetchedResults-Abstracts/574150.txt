Suitable site-selection of industrial units creates proper conditions for optimum use of material and reduction of waste, and on the other hand, leads to more sell and hence high profit. The objective of this study is to determine the effective criteria in decision making of selecting the most suitable location for establishing a furniture unit. For this purpose, after preliminary investigation and interviews, 25 effective criteria were identified. The hierarchy of these criteria was designed and then the priority rates (weighting value) of obtained criteria and sub-criteria were determined using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results showed that among 25 identified effective criteria, the five criteria as market capacity, purchasing cost of raw material, man force availability, granted facilities and man force cost have the highest priorities, respectively.

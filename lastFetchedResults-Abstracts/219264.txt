Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a multi-systemic infection. A resurgence of cases of M. tuberculosis infection and extrapulmonary involvement has occurred in parallel with the HIV epidemic. Tuberculosis is rarely associated with cutaneous or osteoarticular infection.
Patient: In this case report we described an unusual case of tuberculosis presenting with concurrent cutaneous abscess
and osteomyelitis. The final diagnosis was confirmed by radiographic and cultural findings. Conclusion: Cutaneous tuberculosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with cutaneous abscesses or musculoskeletal complaints, particularly in high risk populations such as immigrants from endemic regions and
immunosuppressed patients.

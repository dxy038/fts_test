Objective: The aim of the ‎present study was to estimate the ‎pooled prevalence of different ‎types of child abuse in Iran‏.‏
Method: We systematically ‎searched four English databases ‎‎(PubMed, Sciencedirect, ‎PsychINFO and Scopus), and ‎three Farsi databases (Magiran, ‎IranMedex and SID) to find out ‎relevant articles that have ‎reported the prevalence of child ‎abuse in Iran. Studies conducted ‎on special samples, special ‎setting or on adult population for ‎history of child abuse were ‎excluded from our study. The ‎total number of obtained articles ‎from English databases was 83. ‎After removing the duplicated ‎articles, 77 manuscripts ‎remained. Next, we screened the ‎articles based on their title and ‎abstract and only 13 articles ‎remained. After screening based ‎on the full text only 5 studies ‎were left.  Since Farsi databases ‎did not give us the option to get ‎all the search results together, we ‎read the search results based on ‎their titles and selected the ‎relevant articles. Twenty-four ‎studies were selected based on ‎their title. After screening based ‎on the full text, 8 studies ‎remained. The total number of ‎the studies from both English and ‎Farsi databases that we entered ‎in our review was 13‎‏.‏
Result: The prevalence of ‎physical abuse, emotional abuse ‎and neglect in both genders ‎differed from 9.7% to 67.5 %, ‎‎17.9% to 91.1% and 23.6% to ‎‎80.18%, respectively. The pooled ‎estimate of the prevalence of ‎child physical abuse in both ‎genders was 43.591% (CI 42.50, ‎‎44.68), and the pooled estimate ‎of the prevalence of child ‎emotional abuse was 64.533% ‎‎(CI 63.48, 65.58). In regards to ‎child neglect, the pooled estimate ‎of the prevalence was 40.945% ‎‎(CI 39.77, 42.13). The ‎heterogeneity of the studies was ‎not statically significant (I2 = ‎‎0.0%).‎
Conclusion: Child abuse has ‎several negative effects on the ‎health of children and adults. It ‎seems that child abuse in Iran is ‎in a critical condition, so the ‎policy makers should act upon ‎solving this problem and design ‎special programs and develop ‎effective policies to prevent child ‎abuse in Iran.‎

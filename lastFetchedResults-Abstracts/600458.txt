Objective: Most studies that determine the range of motion of joints of the lower limbs study the Western population. The Asian population differs significantly, as daily activities demand differ¬ent sitting positions. Our study aimed to establish the normal values of hip and ankle range of motion in various age groups in the Indian population and the effect of various functional posi¬tions of the hip on range of motion. Methods: Three hundred and twenty-six Indian subjects, between the ages of 1 month to 75 years, were randomly selected for measurement of the range of motion of the hip and ankle joint. Exclusion criteria included history of injury or disease related to the lower extremities. Changes with age in the arc of joint motion were studied. The influence of various functional positions of the lower limb on the range of motion of the hip and the effect of weight-bearing on the ankle joint range of motion were also analyzed. Results: Hip range of motion differed in various positions. Hip rotations were significantly greater when measured with the knee in flexion in both the sitting and prone positions than in the supine position. The arc of hip rotation was highest in the prone position. A significant increase in the arc of ankle dorsiflexion was found in a weight-bearing (squatting) position. Age related reduction in movement was found mainly in the rotations of the hip and dorsiflexion of the ankle. Conclusion: The data compiled in this study on the range of motion in the hip and ankle joint of the Indian population will be useful in the evaluation of patients with disorders of these joints, especially in the Indian and Asian population.

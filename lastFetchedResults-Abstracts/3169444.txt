Objective: To predict and screen vaccine candidate antigen genes from white spot syndrome virus by bioinformatics methods. Methods: The complete genome sequences of virus attachment protein 281 were downloaded from Gene Bank. The bioinformatics analysis tools of OMIGA, Accesslrys Gene and DNASTAR were used to predict and screen probable vaccine candidate antigen genes of WSSV. Results: Seven vaccine candidate antigen genes were screened and these genes were conserved by analysis. Conclusion: The conserved and surface exposed or secreted antigens could be predicted, which lays a foundation for rapid identification of vaccine protective antigens.

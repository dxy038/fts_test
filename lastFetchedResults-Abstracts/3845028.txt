The concept of integral manifolds is used to create systematically improved reduced-order models of synchronous machines. The approach is illustrated through a detailed example of a single machine connected to an infinite bus. The example shows the advantages of the manifold approach and clarifies several issues regarding such models. The basic objective of the method is to include the effects of more complex models without including the additional differential equations. This is illustrated for the effects of stator transients and damper windings on the swing equation

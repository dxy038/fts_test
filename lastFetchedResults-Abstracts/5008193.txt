The objective of this paper is to design a rotating speed function of a ball-screw system with the aim of lowering the peak acceleration value of the slider. For the purpose of analyzing the kinematic characteristics of the system, the normalized motion equations of the ball-screw system were derived. From the analysis, a set of design rules was devised and a rotating speed function of was designed. It was revealed from computer analysis that as the rotating speed function was applied to the screw input, the peak acceleration value of the constant pitch screw, operated at a constant speed, was decreased. For comparison purpose, a computer-controlled experimental device for characterizing the kinematics of a ball-screw system was also designed and manufactured. The results from the tests and the analytical model were comparable.

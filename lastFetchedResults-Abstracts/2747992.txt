The objective of this paper is to propose a breakdown mechanism of lightning impulse voltage in high voltage vacuum interrupters (VIs) with long contact gap by complementing the Cranberg "clump" hypothesis with an impulse voltage and a non-uniform field. The Cranberg "clump" hypothesis assumed that the vacuum breakdown was due to the loosely adhering microscopic particles under a DC voltage and a uniform field. The microscopic particles might be torn from an electrode surface at a critical voltage. We considered the microscopic particles located at the area with the maximum electric field had the highest possibility to be accelerated. Therefore, the transit process of the micro-particles to the opposing electrodes was under a non-uniform field distribution driven by an impulse voltage. The rise rate of the impulse voltage applied was also considered. As a result, it was found that the breakdown voltage of a vacuum gap depends upon a 0.76 power of the gap length for the plate-to-plate contacts. The diameter of the contacts was 60 mm. The contact radius of curvature was 6 mm. In the same conditions, our previous experimental results showed that the impulse breakdown voltage was in a range of 0.70 to 0.79 power of the contact gap. So the experimental results supported the Cranberg hypothesis in its extension to the impulse breakdown under non-uniform field in high-voltage VIs. Thereafter, this proposed breakdown mechanism is a complement to the Cranberg "clump" hypothesis in terms of impulse voltage breakdown under a non-uniform field in high voltage VIs.

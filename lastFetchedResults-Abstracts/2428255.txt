Fracture at a bi-material interface is essentially mixed-mode, even when the geometry is symmetric with respect to the crack and loading is of pure Mode I, due to the differences in the elastic properties across an interface which disrupts the symmetry. The linear elastic solutions of the crack tip stress and displacement fields show an oscillatory type of singularity. This poses numerical difficulties while modeling discrete interface cracks. Alternatively, the discrete cracks may be modeled using a distributed band of micro-cracks or damage such that energy equivalence is maintained between the two systems. In this work, an approach is developed to correlate fracture and damage mechanics through energy equivalence concepts and to predict the damage scenario in quasi-brittle bi-material interface beams. The study is aimed at large size structures made of quasi-brittle materials failing at concreteâ€“concrete interfaces. The objective is to smoothly move from fracture mechanics theory to damage mechanics theory or vice versa in order to characterize damage. It is concluded, that through the energy approach a discrete crack may be modeled as an equivalent damage zone, wherein both correspond to the same energy loss. Finally, it is shown that by knowing the critical damage zone dimension, the critical fracture property such as the fracture energy can be obtained.

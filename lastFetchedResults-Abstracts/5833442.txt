In this paper we present the design of Kokone, a small humanoid robot. Kokone (&#194;&#191;kid&#194;&#191; in na&#194;&#191;huatl, a mexican dialect) has 22 degrees of freedom (DoF), with an aluminum structure (1.5 mm thickness). A PC sends control signals to the robot via a serial link. The forward kinematics model is obtained with the Denavit-Hertenberg method. The inverse kinematics problem is solved using a genetic algorithm (GA). The solutions obtained by the GA are then plotted in order to verify their suitability, and show a good performance. Our main objective with this project is to obtain an affordable robotic platform for the development of robotic vision algorithms and navigation strategies.

Objective: The present research aimed to study the relationship of identity styles and attitude toward delinquency with delinquent behavior of adolescents.
Methods: The present research is a cross sectional study. Data collection tools were Berzonsky&rsquo;s identity style inventory, attitude toward delinquent behaviors questionnaire, and interviews, which were analyzed through simultaneous regression analysis using SPSS software. Study sample consisted of all 150 male adolescents who were detained in Tehran&rsquo;s Center for Correction and Rehabilitation for committing delinquency/crime.
Results: Based on the obtained results, informational, normative, diffuse/avoidant, and commitment identity styles had significant associations with delinquency and positive and negative attitude toward delinquent behavior. In other words, identity styles and attitude toward delinquent behavior explained 57% of the changes in adolescents&rsquo; delinquent behavior (P<0.001).
Conclusion: Given the importance of family and social models in the formation of identity styles as well as positive and negative attitudes toward delinquency, it is necessary to offer individual and group courses of educating families and adolescents to control and prevent delinquent behavior as well as providing suitable models for adolescents to gain proper identities.

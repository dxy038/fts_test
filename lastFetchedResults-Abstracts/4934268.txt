Context-aware computing are gaining increasing attention due to the value they add to wireless networks. We described the innards of IGS (intelligent guide system), an 802.11 location-based tour guide system. Our objective is to empower mobile devices to recognize the context when the tourists visit some scenic spots and provide corresponding services. In our work, we proposed BAFO (be away from obstacles) algorithm to deploy access points (APs), and proposed a received signal strength (RSS) based algorithm MNNSS (modified nearest neighbor in signal space) to position mobile terminals. We divided the whole IGS system into four parts, and each part can do its job independently. We also used a friendly user interface so that the user can easily get the information they need. These proposed techniques can be further extended to the indoor guiding and tracing system.

Process management in OS is used to solve planning problem and a new algorithm is proposed, named process semaphore planning (PSP). Technique of process has been mature. If it is used in planning, it will promote development of planning. First, a planning problem must be translated to a planning operation through signal quantification. A planning operation contains four sets, namely action-process set, semaphore set, initial semaphore set and objective semaphore set. PSP has pre-dealing and main part. Pre-dealing classifies action-processes to assign priority. Pre-dealing uses transcendental information which improves speed of algorithm. Main part determinates sequence of action-processes by exclusion and synchronization. Exclusion and synchronization are redefined in this paper. Synchronization determinates which action-process should execute before another. Exclusion determinates which action-process could not execute with another together. New definition, non-spending semaphore, are proposed. If two action-processes just compete for non-spending semaphore, they can run concurrently. Non-spending semaphore improves concurrency of PSP.

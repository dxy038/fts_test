A new kind of control system to remotely manage an LV switchboard is presented. The main feature of the system is an optimal load management that allows both to optimize end-use energy consumptions and increase the level of supply continuity. An interesting application of the switchboard lies in the management of LV installations connected to smart grids, where the consumer - also named &#8220;prosumer&#8221;- can produce energy, usually from renewable sources as in the case of photovoltaic generation. In applications of this kind traditional switchboards are not able to manage bidirectional power flows, loads, and generators at same time. The proposed control system is provided by a user-friendly interface developed in a Microsoft Visual Studio environment, which is also described in the paper.

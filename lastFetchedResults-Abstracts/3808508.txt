This paper presents a control algorithm for a voltage-sourced converter-based back-to-back (VSC-BTB) tie that enables a "transient free" load transfer between the tie sides. The studies were performed for the recently commissioned Eagle-Pass VSC-BTB interconnecting the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) transmission network in the United States to the Comisi??on Federal De Electricidad (CFE) transmission network in Mexico. The objective of the algorithm is realization of the transfer of load from one side of the VSC-BTB to the other side of the tie without interruption of the power supply to the Eagle-Pass load. The developed algorithm has been validated through simulation studies, describing the load transfer process.

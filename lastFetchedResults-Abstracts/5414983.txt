This paper provides an overview of some demonstration projects, which utilize Satellite Earth Observation, Navigation and Telecommunications technologies to the benefits of user communities in different domains with a high potential economic/societal impact. The main objective of the European Space Agency Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) program is to foster the development of sustainable user-driven services integrating multiple space technologies. The presented applications are related to agriculture (GrapeLook), energy management (INTOGENER) and the maritime domain (SEMAFORS). For each project the user communities and their needs, the selected technical solution, the innovative elements and the operational prospects are discussed.

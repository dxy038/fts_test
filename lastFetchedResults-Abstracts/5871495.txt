The cells and tissues usually may be subjected to cryo-injure, but caused to die during freezing process for cryo-preservation. Among them, the most direct reason is extra-cellular and intra-cellular ice formation. How to control, reduce, or eliminate the ice formation has been an important research topic in fundamental cryobiology. The objective of this study was to test a hypothesis that the alternated electric field could significantly influence the solution of 0.9% NaCl freezing property at a relative slow cooling rate. The test sample consisted of 0.9% NaCl solution and it was frozen in 0.26 K/min cooling rate, simultaneously was exposed to alternating electric fields ranging from 50 Hz to 5M Hz. A system was built and utilized to measure the temperature of the test sample continually. It was founded that alternated electric fields strongly influenced the freezing property of the solution, included the undercooling point temperature of the solution and the latent heat produced by phrase transition during freezing process. The results were analyzed by using dielectric theory and ions moving phenomena, it indicated that the icons moving under alternated electric field is main factor influencing the property of 0.9% NaCl solution during freezing process

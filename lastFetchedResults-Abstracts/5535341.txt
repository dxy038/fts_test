In this paper we address a multi-objective control problem for a group of kinematic unicycle agents. Namely, we consider three objectives; trajectory tracking, collision avoidance, and connectivity maintenance. By integrating the gradients of the avoidance and connectivity functions into the desired orientations of agents, using Lyapunov-type analysis, we prove that agents track reference trajectories with bounded errors, while avoiding collisions and maintaining connectivity.

To evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas, we developed a general framework to integrate necessary steps into an operational system. In this case study, we applied the framework to the Wolong Biosphere Reserve in Sichuan Province (southwestern China), the largest reserve of Giant Pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). We collected data through questionnaire surveys and employed fuzzy modeling to analyze and integrate the data collected. The results revealed that Wolong Biosphere Reserve was moderately effective in nature conservation, especially in the protection of Giant Pandas. But the overall effectiveness of Wolong Biosphere Reserve was not as high as expected because its functions in environmental education, social development and economic development were only marginally effective. Both the overall effectiveness of Wolong Biosphere Reserve and the effectiveness of nature conservation need to be improved.
First, efforts should be directed towards improving nature conservation and more specifically on improving the protection of forest ecosystems. To achieve this objective, local farmers in Wolong Biosphere Reserve should become the main group improving nature conservation. In addition, more effective measures should be developed to raise the living standards and the socio-economic status of the local farmers in an environmentally compatible way.
Second, environmental education for local people and outsiders should be increased.
Furthermore, we need to strengthen basic research and build cooperation among the reserve administration bureau, researchers and other organizations at the local, national and international levels.
Finally, we need to improve the living conditions of the local population through education, family planning and healthcare.

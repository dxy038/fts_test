In this work, CBR (case-based reasoning) is used as a powerful tool for estimating the blast duration based on the statistical data of the just terminated on-gas phase. This CBR estimating method is easy to be implemented and the estimated result is shown to be satisfied. Based on the on-line estimation of blast duration, a novel coordinated control strategy for the hot blast stove system was proposed, which takes a smooth and higher blast air temperature as its control objective and is realized by means of adjusting dynamically the heating intensity of the current on-gas stove

We put forward the elite preserving strategy when the Pareto optimal solutions are built by the arena´s principle, which used weighted sum based on the AP algorithm to evaluate the fitness function and preserve the elite. We construct the fuzzy rule base for traffic distribution, which can easily express explicit knowledge, and the limitation of greedy algorithm can be avoided. The experimental results show that Fuzzy-WSGA can find better Pareto front and Pareto optimal solutions in much less time. So it is more effective than st-GA and m-GA in finding Pareto optimal solutions.

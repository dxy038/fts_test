Objective: The current study aimed at investigating the role of patience and its components in predicting self-control among high school students in Shiraz, Iran.
Methods: The statistical population of the study included all high school students of Shiraz. Three hundred and thirty-two students (161 females and 171 males) were recruited via cluster sampling method. The subjects participated in the study by completing the patience scale for children and adolescents and self-control scale. To analyze the data, mean, standard deviation (SD), and Pearson correlation coefficient were used. Moreover, to investigate the role of patience and its components in predicting self-control, simultaneous multiple regression analysis was utilized.
Results: The results showed that patience total score and the components of transcendence, contentment, persistence, and hesitation positively and significantly correlated with self-control (P < 0.01). Patience total score also positively and significantly predicted self-control (&beta; = 0.58; P < 0.001). This variable explained 33% of the variance. Moreover, transcendence (&beta; = 0.18; P < 0.001), hesitation (&beta; = 0.27; P < 0.001), and persistence (&beta; = 0.35; P < 0.001) positively and significantly predicted self-control. These variables explained 36% of the variance.
Conclusion: According to the role of patience and its components in predicting self-control, it is recommended to utilize educational strategies of patience to enhance self-control among high school students. To emphasize the components of patience in teaching educational strategies of patience is also suggested.&nbsp;

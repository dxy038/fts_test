The objective of this study was to measure viscoelastic shear (storage and loss) moduli of low concentrations of agarose gel using hyper-frequency viscoelastic spectroscopy which is a non-contacting optical method. Using a Rheospectris C500, measurements were made in an excitation frequency range of 10-1000 Hz. It was found that the magnitudes of the moduli increased with frequency. Favorable comparisons were found to values determined using dynamic mechanical analysis.

The paper takes a look at the software engineering education and evaluation model followed in the induction program for fresh engineering graduates at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. It describes how the induction program fulfils the objective of bridging the gap between what the academia supplies and what the industry demands. It also elaborates the evolution of the evaluation process followed in the program. The current evaluation model incorporates a blended approach using case studies and online exams. Small groups of trainees are assessed based on their case study deliverables. Online exams in which trainees solve problems close to real-world scenarios are conducted at the end of each phase to assess individual performance. These assessments happen in a staged manner and ensure continuous and comprehensive evaluation. Further the performance analysis of trainees from various institutes also helps in giving inputs to improve talent acquisition in the organization. The TCS software engineering education and evaluation model is a continuously evolving model to meet the demands of the rapidly growing and changing IT industry.

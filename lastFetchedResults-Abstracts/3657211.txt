The objective of this investigation is to develop multistatic electromagnetic identification/discrimination algorithms using the complete polarimetric scattering data. At high frequencies the electromagnetic scattering from a complex object is modeled by certain scattering centers. The high-frequency (physical optics) bistatic and monostatic scattering matrix properties of a flat plate model of such a scattering center are developed in detail. For the complex target representations, the single scattering center results can be extended to two and three scattering center models. It is suggested that the knowledge of the locations and the local geometries of these scattering centers can be useful in developing identification and pattern recognition algorithms.

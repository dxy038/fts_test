The paper demonstrates the advanced simulation methodology based on differentiation of the discretized finite element (FE) equations to parametric simulation of micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS). The idea of the approach is to compute not only the governing system matrices but also high order derivatives (HOD) with regard to design parameters by means of automatic differentiation (AD). As result, Taylor vectors of the model response can be expanded in the vicinity of the initial position with regard to dimensional and physical parameters. The objective of this presentation is to demonstrate the viability of HOD methods to parametric simulation of MEMS in the static, modal, frequency response domains on the basis of the structural analysis and macromodeling.

Environmental impact assessment will soon become a compulsory phase in future potable water production projects, especially when alternative treatment processes such as desalination are considered. An impact assessment tool is therefore developed for the environmental evaluation of potable water production. The evaluation method used is the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The quick and easy assessment of energetic and environmental performances contributes to determine the weak points of potable water production processes or the best suited treatment in a specific context. Studies of some potable water supply scenarios (groundwater treatment, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, seawater reverse osmosis and thermal distillation associated to water transfer) are presented in order to illustrate the environmental information drawn from this tool. The main source of impacts is shown to be electricity production for plant operation. Improvement levers are presented for impact reduction and for the objective comparison between alternative and conventional water treatment processes.

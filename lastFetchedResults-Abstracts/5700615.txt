A femtocell is a small cellular base station (BS), typically used for serving approved users within a small coverage. In this paper, we investigate the problem of data multicast in femtocell networks that incorporates superposition coding (SC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC). The problem is to decide the transmission schedule for each BS, as well as the power allocation for the SC layers, to achieve a sufficiently large SNR for each layer to be decodable with SIC. The objective is to minimize the total BS power consumption. We formulate a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is NP-hard in general. We then reformulate the problem into a simpler form, and derive upper and lower performance bounds. Finally, we consider three typical connection scenarios in the femtocell network, and develop optimal and near-optimal algorithms for the three scenarios. The proposed algorithms have low computational complexity, and outperform a heuristic scheme with considerable gains in our simulation study.

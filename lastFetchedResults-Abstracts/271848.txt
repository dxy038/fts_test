The objective of this paper is an analytical and numerical study of the transient vibrations of a taut inclined cable
with a riding accelerating mass that is suspended in space. The moving mass is accelerated by a thrust down the
inclined cable and is able to be aerodynamically brought to a halt. The thrust is a follow force that is tangential to
the deformed con®guration of the cable.
The cable is suspended from two points of dierent elevation. The higher point of the cable is anchored to the
ground, and the lower point of the cable is controlled so that its tension at that point is held at a constant level.
Hence, the length of the cable is not ®xed and is a parameter to be determined during any run. The restriction in
which an inextensible cannot vibrate in the limit of vanishing sag then is removed.
The mechanics of the problem is Newtonian. Methods of analysis will consist of the dynamics of small
deformations superimposed on the static catenary state. The problem is nonlinear due to the presence of friction
and the convective acceleration interaction of the moving mass and the cable. Galerkin's procedure for removal of
spatial dependence and numerical integration are used to obtain convergent solutions.

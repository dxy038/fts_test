The objective of this study is to understand how adsorbed synthetic polymers affect deposition kinetics of dissolved and colloidal wood materials. The synthetic polymers were characterised by means of static and dynamic light scattering, and their adsorption on silica was studied by means of optical reflectometry. Deposition kinetics of colloidal wood resin, compounds in model process water, as well as adsorption of anionic carbohydrates was then studied on the surface layers formed by synthetic polymers. It was found that neither wood resin nor anionic carbohydrates have affinity for adsorbed polyethylene oxide. However, wood resin deposited readily on adsorbed cationic polyacryl amides. Both polyethylene oxide and cationic polyacryl amides formed multilayers with compounds in the model process water.

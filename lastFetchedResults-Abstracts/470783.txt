Objective
The purpose of this study was to quantify the total direct cost to the US health care system for the management of uterine leiomyomas.
Study design
We used Center for Disease Control heath care databases for estimates of inpatient care, ambulatory care, and outpatient care of leiomyomas. With International Classification of Diseasesâ€“9 codes for fibroid tumors and fibroid-related conditions, all fibroid-related care was identified in each database. Inpatient and ambulatory surgical cases were stratified by surgical procedure, and outpatient clinical cases were categorized by type of visit and health care provider. With the use of Medicare's RBRVU reimbursement rates for 2000 as a proxy for the cost of physician services and Medicare diagnostic-related group reimbursement as a proxy for facility costs, the total direct cost to the US health care system for the care of fibroid tumors was estimated.
Results
Total direct cost to treat uterine fibroid tumors was estimated at $2,151,484,847. Most of the cost was due to inpatient care, in particular, hysterectomy.
Conclusion
Uterine fibroid tumors consume a significant amount of health care resources in the United States.

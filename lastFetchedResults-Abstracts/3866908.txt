This paper deals with the application of short-time spectral attenuation techniques to the restoration of musical recordings degraded by background noise. Signal distortions induced by the restoration process are evaluated analytically, and their audibility is assessed on the basis of objective criteria. The results obtained highlight the influence of adjustable parameters (e.g., short-time frame duration or noise overestimation) on the quality of the restoration

Abstract â€” A social network is defined as a social structure
of individuals, who are related (directly or indirectly to each
other) based on a common relation of interest, e.g. friendship,
trust, etc. Social network analysis is the study of social
networks to understand their structure and behavior. The
online social network field is broad, and any literature review
can only focus on a selection of articles. The present article
highlights recent research in the field and focuses on
centrality, linkage strength, identity, trust, activity and
benefits. By no means is this review comprehensive, but it
should give practitioners some useful concepts to consider as
they design social network based web applications. Thus the
overall objective of the proposed survey is to come up with an
aim to have the latest research and simultaneously discuss
contributions of renowned researchers whose work created a
revolution in the social networking area. The goal of the
survey process is to produce new knowledge or deepen
understanding of a same topic or an issue.

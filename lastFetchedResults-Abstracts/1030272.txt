The objective of this work was to investigate the catalytic activity of gold catalysts supported on two metal oxides, yttrium oxide and nickel oxide, prepared by co-precipitation for CO and methanol oxidation reactions. The TGA and XRD results confirmed that yttrium hydroxide (Y(OH)3) was formed at calcination temperature below 300 °C. When it was calcined at 400 °C, the Y(OH)3 was transformed to yttrium oxide hydroxide (YOOH). Finally, when calcination temperature was raised to 600 °C, the YOOH was completely transformed to yttrium oxide (Y2O3). Interestingly, the gold loaded on YOOH calcined at 400 °C and gold loaded on Y2O3 calcined at 500 °C comparatively showed the highest catalytic activity for complete CO oxidation at a reaction temperature of 300 °C. The 0.12% Au/Y2O3 catalyst calcined at 500 °C was employed for both CO and methanol oxidation studies. For complete CO oxidation, the reaction temperatures of Au/Y2O3 and Au/NiO catalysts were 325 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The light-off temperatures of Au/Y2O3 and Au/NiO catalysts for methanol oxidation were 210 °C and 205 °C, respectively. Conclusively, the Au/Y2O3 clearly exhibited the same activity as that of Au/NiO for methanol oxidation while the Au/NiO gave higher activity for CO oxidation.

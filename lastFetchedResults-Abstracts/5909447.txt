Understanding the heat transfer processes of compression-ignition engines requires attention to both convection and radiation components. Although a number of correlations for convective heat transfer in engine environments have been implemented in simulations with some accuracy, reliable correlations for the radiant heat transfer are yet to be developed. Most radiant heat transfer correlations are configuration-dependent and fail to accommodate important physical aspects of the radiant heat transfer process in diesel engines. The development of reliable radiation heat transfer correlations requires reliable data. The two-colour method for radiation measurement has provided valuable insight into the combustion process inside direct-injection compression ignition engine. The two-colour method is a popular approach because it is cost effective and simple approach that can provide time-resolved data. The objective of this paper is to present a review of radiation heat transfer measurement in the diesel engine environment using the principles of the two-colour method. The theory, approach, issues and complications associated with the two-colour method are discussed.

In this paper the authors present the design and cost analysis of an automation system for swimming pools in South Africa. The purpose of the automation system is to lower the energy consumption of the circulation pump and to regulate the chemical composition of the water in the swimming pool. The objective of the project was to design the automation system as economically as possible. This paper provides an overview on swimming pool automation systems, detail on the design of the low cost automation system, the experimental results and cost analysis of the designed automation system compared to other automation systems.

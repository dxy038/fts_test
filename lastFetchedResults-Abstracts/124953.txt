Background: Listeria moncytogenes is an important cause of meningitis, septicemia, stillbirth, neonatal sepsis and spontaneous abortion.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to detect Listeria monocytogenes by serologic and bacteriologic methods in women suffering from abortion.
Methods: 120 specimens including placenta or curretage material were cultured on blood agar and palcam agar and kept at 37°` for 48-72 hrs. Also Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) were used as subculture media at 4°G for a period of 6 months. Colonies were identified using several biochemical tests. 120 sera from above patients and 60 sera from control group were also used for the investigation of Listeria specific antibody by indirect immunofluorescence method.
Findings: 2.5% of specimens were positive bacteriologically, that had significant relationship with the serologic results (P<0.05). The results of serologic study showed that 25 case of test group, and 6 cases
of control group had an antibody titer of 1/160 against this microorganism. In test group, of 25 patients who had  1/160 titer, 12 patients, and in control group, of 6 patients who had1/160 antibody titers,2 patients had,1/320 antibody titers. Therefore, in test group 20.83% had a titer of 1/160 and 10% had a titer 
of 1/320 .In control group the rates of the above antibody titers were 6.66% and 3.33% respectively. Overall ratio was 3.2. Also there was significant difference between antibody titer in test and control group (P<0.02). All the patients who had positive culture of this bacterium also had a titer of1/320 antibody against this microorganism. Conclusion: Listeria moncytogenes is an important cause of abortion, and all of the patients with positive culture of this bacterium had a 
1/320 antibody titer. The cold enrichment method  is suggested as a suitable method for the isolation of this microorganism.

The objective of this paper is to discuss issues involved in the formation, and successful operation of research consortia. As an example, the Complex Interactive Network and Systems Initiative, CINSI, is a program that aims to develop tools and techniques that will enable national infrastructures to self-heal. EPRI and DOD are jointly funding the project for about $30 million over five years.

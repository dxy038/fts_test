Surface finishing accounts for up to 50% of the total time required to produce a mold or die, and most finishing operations are still performed manually. The objective of this paper is to develop an automatic surface finishing system (ASFS) based on closed-loop surface topography control. A process planner module has been used in the developed ASFS to select different finishing levels and finishing strategies based on the design specifications in CAD design databases and surface topography analysis. A prototype ASFS has been constructed to serve as a platform to perform experiments to verify the approach. Experimental results have proven the feasibility of the concept

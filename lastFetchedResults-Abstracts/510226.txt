The 2006 census reveals that more than 50% of employed population in Iran is not involved in the production of food, clothing, housing and other tangible goods. Apart from the serious reservation of industrialization in Iran, this can be considered as one of the indications of a new phase shift known as "service economy". To analyze such a post-industrialization economy, it requires new concepts and classifications which, to our knowledge, have been ignored by researchers mainly in Iran. The main objective of this paper is to measure and identify the domain of the fourth sector and its structural analysis in the framework of input-output and semi-social accounting matrix models.

Using 2001 input-output data, the overall results show that the fourth sector appears to be oriented as a consumption goods sector compared to the other sectors. Consequently, the consumption-induced effect ploys a significant role in rising production, income and employment.

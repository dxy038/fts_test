Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle has a very good application foreground for it has some advantages, such as high efficiency and little emission, etc. In order to characterize the structure of hybrid power system for Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle, the project of parallel hybrid power system was brought forward, which consisted of Fuel Cell, NIH battery and DC/DC converter, and besides, the power flow chart of hybrid power system and energy management objective was especially analyzed. The issue for energy management of hybrid power system was converted to combinatorial optimization problem. The power flow chart of hybrid power system was analyzed in start-up mode, accelerating mode, cruising mode and braking mode and the respective control strategy of various mode was designed. The dynamic control and energy management strategy was designed by applying multi model control method based on fuzzy supervised rule, being differ from conventional compulsive switch strategy. In the end, the simulation results were presented, which show the effectiveness of the control strategy, for it can improve economy performance of vehicles in comparison with fuzzy control strategy.

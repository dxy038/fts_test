The objective of this paper is to present a new zero-power controller design scheme by means of a transfer function approach for a voltage excited 4-pole hybrid electromagnet. Furthermore, ManabeÂ´s canonical form is integrated into determining process of the gains of controller polynomials. Accordingly, validity of the proposed approach is verified through numerical and experimental studies over an experimental test bench.

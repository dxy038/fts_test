Internet is the basic need of all segments of our modern society. Day by day popularity of internet is increases. The clouds computing is also derived from stream of networking, which is also becomes so popular. They not only shares information between the processors, but also supports distributed or parallel processing approach. Load balancing of processes onto parallel processing system is very important and challenging area of research. The issue becomes more critical and difficult as parallel computing system gradually progresses to the use of off-the-shelf workstations, operating systems, and high bandwidth networks to build cost-effective clusters for demanding applications. Clusters are more popular because of their super computing power. The workload on a cluster system can be highly variable, increasing the difficulty of balancing the load across its nodes. And the general rule is that high variability leads to wrong load balancing decisions taken with out-of-date information and difficult to correct in real-time during applications execution. The objective of this paper is to review the different dynamic load balancing algorithms using a real time data, this paper measures the performance of different dynamic load balancing algorithms further suggests probable frame work of new load balancing algorithm for LINUX clustered system.

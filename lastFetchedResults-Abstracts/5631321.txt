Scheduling of processes has a significant effect in overall system performance. Moreover, scheduling of n-processes to optimize certain objective is a well-known NP hard problem. This paper presents a scheduling algorithm for n-processes based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique. ACO is an optimization technique which can efficiently find optimal solution for single as well as multi-objectives problems. Moreover, the simulation results of the proposed approach with some deterministic scheduling algorithms (including Shortest Job First, First Come First Served) are reported.

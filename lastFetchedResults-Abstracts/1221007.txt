Due to its continuation and extension in time and space, wind erosion has high destructive potential, especially in arid regions, and its damage to economic resources, especially soil and vegetation, is significant. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of wind erosion formation, performance, affected areas, and overall effects is essential. The objective of the present study was to present a suitable method for providing wind erosion hazard zoning maps. At first, the role of six effective factors on wind erosion including height changes, geomorphology, stone sensitivity to erosion, soil types, diversity and density of vegetation cover and land use were studied according to the status of the study area. For this purpose, Numerical Taxonomy Method, a rating scale method, was used. In the context of this method, facies units were selected by geomorphological method. Then, erosion intensity and effective index were determined in every unit using Taxonomy Method. Finally, the zoning map was presented in GIS based on Arc View3.2a. The results showed that sand dune units with plant coverage (SDPC), bare clay grounds (BCG), and clay grounds with plant coverage (CGPC), with the greatest quantitative values of, respectively, 0.76, 0.76 and 0.77 were prone to very intense wind erosion. In the meantime, the quantitative value of wind erosion risk for the entire region was estimated at 0.52, which indicated high potential of the region for occurrence of wind erosion. Generally, based on the final layer, 15% of the area of Khezrabad basin is prone to high risk of very intense wind erosion and threatens70% of the region with intense wind erosion.

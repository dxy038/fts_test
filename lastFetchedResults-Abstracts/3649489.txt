The human engineering area of the STARS program is focused primarily on the end users of US DoD computer systems and on the personnel involved in the development and operational support of these systems. The objective is to ensure the development of systems that are highly usable by these two groups. The issues, however, are identical to those arising in the development of commercial products as well. This article discusses several key issues related to the human engineering of computer systems and recommends several general types of activities to help ensure the design of highly usable systems.

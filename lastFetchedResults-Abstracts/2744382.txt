sLine is a fast-frame 128 dual-channel high-voltage switcher ASIC for 2D SLAC LINAC Coherent Light Source (LCLS) detectors with rolling shutter. The ASIC allows each row of pixels in a sensor to be addressed according to a time-division multiplexing scheme, so that the pixels in the selected row are read out and reset in parallel by a multi-channel front-end ASIC. Optimized for the X-ray Charge Pump Sensor, each channel of the ASIC can operate independently, with two control lines replicating low-voltage control patterns at high voltages. The two high-voltage outputs per channel can be arbitrarily set between &#177;16 V and are able to switch a 1 nF load within about 300 ns. The active outputs are selected by inserting a token into a bidirectional shift register. The control input level for the ASIC are LVDS. In this paper, the ASIC architecture and performance of the final release are presented.

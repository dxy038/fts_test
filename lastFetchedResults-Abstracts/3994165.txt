This study proposes a probabilistic dynamic model for multi-objective distributed generation (DG) planning, which also considers network reinforcement at presence of uncertainties associated with the load values, generated power of wind turbines and electricity market price. Monte Carlo simulation is used to deal with the mentioned uncertainties. The planning process is considered as a two-objective problem. The first objective is the minimisation of total cost including investment and operating cost of DG units, the cost paid to purchase energy from main grid and the network reinforcement costs. The second objective is defined as the minimisation of technical risk, including the probability of violating the safe operating technical limits. The Pareto optimal set is found using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm method and the final solution is selected using a max-min method. The model is applied on two distribution networks and compared with other models to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Physical activity (PA) and the energy expenditure it generates (PAEE) are increasingly shown to have impacts on everybody´s health (e.g. development of chronic diseases) and to be key factors in maintaining the physical autonomy of elderlies. The SVELTE project objective was to develop an autonomous actimeter, easily wearable and with several days of autonomy, which could record a subject´s physical activity during his/her daily life and estimate the associated energy expenditure. A few prototypes and dedicated algorithms were developed based on laboratory experiments. The identification of physical activity patterns algorithm shows good performances (79% of correct identification), based on a trial in semi-free-living conditions. The assessment of the PAEE computation algorithm is under validation based on a clinical trial.

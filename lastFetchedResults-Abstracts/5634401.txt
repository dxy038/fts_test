In this paper we take a critical look at the emerging field of metamaterials, with a view to understanding their behaviors as well as performance-enhancement capabilities of small antennas. The objective is to see if we can sort out the facts from fiction, and if we can identify the directions along which we might profitably tailor our future research effort on metamaterials.

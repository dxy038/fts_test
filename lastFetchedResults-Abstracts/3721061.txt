The load matching factor is used as a measure for the quality of load matching to a photovoltaic (PV) array. An optimization approach is used to solve the load matching problem with the objective of maximizing the load matching factor, and consequently the PV output energy. This approach is then applied to resistive loads (with and without an internal EMF) connected to the array. Results show that optimum matching can be achieved by carefully selecting the array parameters with respect to the load parameters. The temperature of the array has little effect on the optimum matching factor. However, the optimum matching parameters are greatly affected by the array temperature. A maximum power tracker may not be achieved

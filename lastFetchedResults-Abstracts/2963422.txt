We attempt to find solutions to the fully fuzzified linear program where all the parameters and variables are fuzzy numbers. We first change the problem of maximizing a fuzzy number, the value of the objective function, into a multiobjective fuzzy linear programming problem. We prove that fuzzy flexible programming can be used to explore the whole undominated set to the multiobjective fuzzy linear program. An evolutionary algorithm is designed to solve the fuzzy flexible program. The program was applied to two applications with good solutions

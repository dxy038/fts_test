Astragalus oniciformis Barneby is a narrow endemic xerophyte of the upper Snake River Plain of central Idaho, USA, where it inhabits stabilized, aeolian sand deposits and previously burned, sandy sites over Quaternary basalt flows. The objective of this study was to determine the levels and distribution of genetic differentiation within and among populations of A. oniciformis. Fifteen individuals from each of eight populations, chosen from throughout the range of the species, were selected based on accessibility, density of individuals, and large population size. Inter-simple sequence repeats were chosen as the marker to assess genetic differentiation. The two primers selected yielded 40 polymorphic loci in A. oniciformis. In an analysis of molecular variance, 88.69% of the variation was significantly attributed to variation within populations. High gene flow (Nm = 3.91–3.93; SD = 0.01) and a low percentage deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to population subdivision (GST = 0.113–0.1134; SD = 0.0002) were found among sampled populations. These results suggest that current threats to this species, including changing fire patterns and habitat loss from grazing disturbance, have not yet affected the genetic diversity of this species. Preservation of large populations and smaller, intervening, dispersed patches will help preserve the genetic integrity and the genetic diversity found in A. oniciformis.

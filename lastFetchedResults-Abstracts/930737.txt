The objective of the present research was to determine the effects of heat treatment and starter culture on some properties of Urfa cheese produced from bovine milk. Proteolysis developed more rapidly in the cheese made with mesophilic starter culture. Whereas the cheese inoculated with thermophilic starter culture received higher sensory scores. High heat treatment (at 72 °C for 5 min) affected the sensory and chemical properties of Urfa cheese adversely. Therefore, incorporation of low heat treatment (at 65 °C for 20 min) is recommended for the production of Urfa cheese, with addition of a culture of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris.

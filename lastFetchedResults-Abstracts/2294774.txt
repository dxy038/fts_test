This paper concerns the flutter, post-flutter and adaptive control of a non-linear 2-D wing-flap system operating in supersonic/hypersonic flight speed regimes. An output feedback control law is implemented and its performance toward suppressing flutter and limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) as well as reducing the vibrational level in the subcritical flight speed range is demonstrated. This control law is applicable to minimum phase systems and we provide conditions for stability of the zero dynamics. The control objective is to design a control strategy to stabilize the pitch angle while adaptively compensating for uncertainties in all the aeroelastic model parameters. It is shown that all the states of the closed-loop system are asymptotically stable.

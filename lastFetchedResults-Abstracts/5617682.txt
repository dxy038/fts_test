An algorithm for computing the relative maxima of objective functions constrained by nonlinear, nonconcave models is employed to analyze the behavior and policy implications of an intermediate size nonlinear econometric model. A behavioral test is constructed to determine which of the sets of point estimates of the unknown parameters are consistent with economic theory. The model´s evaluation of the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy versus fiscal policy is analyzed. An inflation test is constructed to evaluate the model´s realism.

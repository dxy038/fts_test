Exclusion criteria were tubal and male factor infertility, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus.

Metformin was used for at least 8 weeks in combination with CC. Forty four PCO women who had not ovulated after medical therapy with combination of CC and Metformin were selected for LOD. The data was analyzed with SPSS software using t- test and logistic regression analysis. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</span>  </p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Book','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: JA;">Results: </span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Book','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: JA;">Patients aged 28.9±2.3 years with infertility duration of 4.8±2.3years and BMI of 28±3.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Effectiveness of medical therapy significantly was related to BMI (P&lt;0.001). After LOD, ovulation occurred in 14 cases (31.8%), restoration of menstrual cycle in 18 women (40.9%), and spontaneous pregnancy in 5 cases (11.3%).<br /></span><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Book','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: JA;">Conclusion</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Book','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: JA;">: LOD is a good method for restoration of ovulatory cycles in anovulatory PCOS women who were resistant to the combination of CC and Metformin. LOD may avoid or reduce the need to gonadotropins for ovulation induction. <br /></span></p>

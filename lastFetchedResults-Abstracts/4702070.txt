The dynamic avoiding collision with moving obstacles of mobile robot has been studied. For the existing problems of the past velocity obstacles methods used for dynamic collision avoidance, the collision distance and collision time were considered. Furthermore, in the velocity variation space, we translated the dynamics collision avoidance problem into an optimization problem, defined a new objective function, and the corresponding dynamic collision avoidance arithmetic was designed. Simulation experiments show that the proposed methods effectively overcome conservative strategy of robotÂ´s motion of collision avoidance, achieve rapid movement towards the goal when robot avoiding collision with moving obstacles.

Signal acquisition under a compressed sensing scheme offers the possibility of acquisition and reconstruction of signals sparse on some basis incoherent with measurement kernel with sub-Nyquist number of measurements. In particular when the sole objective of the acquisition is the detection of the frequency of a signal rather than exact reconstruction, then an undersampling framework like CS is able to perform the task. In this paper we explore the possibility of acquisition and detection of frequency of multiple analog signals, heavily corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise. We improvise upon the MOSAICS architecture proposed by us in our previous work to include a wider class of signals having non-integral frequency components. This makes it possible to perform multiplexed compressed sensing for general frequency sparse signals.

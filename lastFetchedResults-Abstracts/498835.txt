Background and Objective: Due to the necessity of creating healthy competition, enhancing dynamism and scientific esprit, identifying superior talents, expanding and reinforcing training and research incentive among students, promoting spiritual conditions, encouraging them to be loyal toward human elevated principles and values, and encouraging them to perform cultural and social activities; selecting superior police cadets in IRI Police University (IRIPU), as the sole police training centre, is of high importance. So far, we have witnessed approval of guidelines and various methods for selecting superior police cadets in IRI Police University. However, due to the rather distinct nature of selecting supreme police cadet, there have been some questions unanswered for those involved in the process. Materials and Methods: The method used in the research for selecting supreme police cadet, is introducing a model for selecting supreme police cadet through Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). In line with this, four major priorities notified by the esteemed police commander to IRIPU in training police cadets including religious training, discipline, physical fitness and training have been the basis for selecting supreme police cadets. Determining their indices, the three graduate police cadets ranking the first, middle and last are prioritized, once more, based on their average scores and the determined criteria. Results: The achieved results, led to a completely different prioritization among police cadets, and indicated that although taking into consideration all the criteria for selecting superior police cadet are of importance, the university existing criteria for this purpose are not in line with its priorities.

A novel multi-function digital excitation regulator of the synchronous generator, which is not only applicable for stand-alone control, but also for regulating on grid connection and for quasi-synchronization plunging into power system, is considered here. The regulator adopts compound control strategy which combines closed-loop current error, produced between needed current value deduced by the theory of instantaneous reactive power and practically measured value, with voltage error between practical value and objective value on stand-alone run. Power-factor error between the generator and power grid is employed as controlled object on grid connection. Otherwise, new arithmetic is put forward on quasi-synchronization. Experimental results show the excitation regulator has excellent performance characteristics in every course of generators running.

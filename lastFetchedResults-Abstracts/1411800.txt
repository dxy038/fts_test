The objective of this 28-day study was to investigate changes in plasma and urine neutriphil gelatinase-associated lipocaline (NGAL) levels in dogs with acute kidney injury following the administration of cisplatin. A total of 10 healthy adult male Iranian mixed dogs, (dosed dogs=7 and control dogs=3) were include in this study. Treated dogs were given cisplatin at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days. Urine and blood samples were collected on days 0, 1 (1, 2, and 4 hours) 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 28. Clinical examinations of the Animals were performed twice per day for signs of toxicity with cisplatin. Changes in creatinine serum levels, indicating renal function (glomerular filtration rate) on the test and control animals on day 0 were on average 0.66 and 0.94 mg/dL, respectively. From day 2 onwards, significant changes in the creatinine serum levels in the test animals were observed. On the final day of the experiment, mean values of the creatinine serum level for the test and control animals were 1.35 and 1.00 mg/dL, respectively. Both Plasma and urine NGAL levels within 2 hours after the first injection of cisplatin were significantly increased. The plasma NGAL fell to its initial value at day zero after 24 hours. However, the urine NGAL level did not decrease even after 24 hours. In conclusion, the results of this study showed that the plasma and urine NGAL levels rise much faster than urea, creatinine and other traditional biochemical markers, and therefore, they can be used as excellent early markers of detect acute kidney injury in dogs. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on evaluating on NGAL as a biomarker for acute kidney injury following administration of cisplatin in dogs.

Summary form only given. Among the treatments for cancer tissue, hyperthermia is known as a minimally invasive treatment technique. With this therapy, we propose ´Soft Heating´ method, which allows thermosensitive magnetic materials embedded in the body to be heated by the application of the external magnetic field, thus necrotizing the tumor tissues. Our method, a non-contact heating system without the necessity of temperature measurements, uses as a heating element thermosensitive magnetic materials with Curie temperature, sufficient enough not to cause a damage to the rest besides the tumor site. In this paper we have examined a new cancer treatment which enables an effective heating on the objective affected area, in combination with a significantly improved hybrid heater for the heating efficiency and a movable magnetic micro-machine in gels utilizing the external magnetic field.

Objective: to study the radioimmunoimaging of <sup>131</sup>I labeled <sup>131</sup>I ScFv and normal mice IgG in nude mice bearing human primary ovarian cancer with three-step pretargetting method, to provide the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer with a new method, and to form the experimental basis for clinical use. Method: 5.0MBg/0.1mL labeled antibody is injected into the tail vein of each mouse. The SPECTs are performed at the 2nd, 4th, 16th, 24th hour after injection. The mice are killed in lots and the percent injected dosages of every gram of tissue (%ID/g) are measured at the 2nd, 4th, 16th, 24th. Results: <sup>131</sup>I ScFv can be selectively accumulated in the tumor tissues, and the rate of ingestion is higher than <sup>131</sup>I -IgG (p&lt;;60;0.05). Conclusion: in the nude mice bearing human ovarian cancer, <sup>131</sup>I -H-OV-5 ScFv has affinity to the over-expressed ovarian cancer single chain antibody H-OV-5. <sup>131</sup>I ScFv is promising to become the direct carrier of ovarian cancer diagnosis.

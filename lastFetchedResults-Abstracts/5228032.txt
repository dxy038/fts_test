The promotion of green products is a resolution for reducing resource waste and improving environment pollution. Resources of green products are relatively limited which entails inconvenience and higher price for purchasing green products. Therefore, how to determine the amount that customers are willing to pay for them is an important issue. In this study, we proposed an analytical method to solve this problem. A list of questionnaires was designed to determine customersÂ´ behavior and preferences. Then, incorporating an MAUT technique, a win-win concept is adopted to develop a bi- objective nonlinear mixed integer problem. The results provide optimal price and promotion strategies, which ensure greater satisfaction on both suppliers and customers.

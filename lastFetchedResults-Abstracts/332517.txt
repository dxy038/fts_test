Objective
To evaluate the 6-year performance of two glass fiber-reinforced packable resin composites in Class II cavities.
Methods

Sixty-three participants received 87 medium to large, cervically dentin bordered, Class II restorations of two fiber-reinforced resin composites, 42 Nulite F (N) and 45 Alert (A). The restorations were evaluated clinically, according to slightly modified USPHS criteria at baseline, after 6 months, and yearly during 6 years.
Results

At 2 years the cumulative failure frequencies for N and A were 4.8% and 2.2%, respectively, which increased at 6 years to 25.0% and 12.8%. Reasons for failure were secondary caries, material and cusp fracture. The majority of the failures occurred after 3 years. Secondary caries occurred between 4 and 6 years. The incorporation of fibers resulted in very rough surface characteristics.
Conclusions

A rather high failure rate was observed for one of the fiber-reinforced resin composites, while the other fulfilled the ADA criteria. The occurrence of most failures after 3 years indicated the necessity of long-term evaluations of new materials.

Purpose: This study has for objective the assessment of the vigilance, mood states variations and the blood glucose levels, during a triangular effort progressive in trained athletes during Ramadan fasting (RF). Methods. Ten trained male athletes aged 21.8 Â± 1.1 years are evaluated before (B.RF), during (1st, 2nd and 3th week) and after Ramadan fasting, in the blood-glucose, vigilance, and mood states at rest and after (A. Ex. ) a triangular exercise test (TUB II).Results. Comparing to the reference period (B.RF), the RF induces a decrease in the maximal aerobic power (TUB II) approximately 2- 5% and a hypoglycaemia. The objective vigilance is doubly influenced by the RF (F= 14.58, p

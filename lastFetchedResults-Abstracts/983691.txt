Background and purpose: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by
lesions covered with silvery-white scabs of dead skin. This autoimmune disease occurs when the immune
system sends out faulty signals that speed up the growth cycle of skin cells. Prevalence of psoriasis in
world populations is about 0.5-4% depending on the regions. People with psoriasis have an increased
incidence of depression, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cancer. The exact
cause of psoriasis is unknown, however, recently the role of microbial agents in triggering or exacerbating
psoriasis has been considered. The main objective of this study was an overview on the role of microbial
agents in psoriasis.
Materials and methods: Published articles in PubMed/MEDLINE and Iranian databases
between 1961 and 2011 were reviewed for the role of microbial agents in psoriasis. The results of these
studies were carefully analyzed.
Results: Microbial agents, especially Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida
species, Malassezia species, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can alter the process of
disease via change in the skin characteristic of patients with psoriasis.
Conclusion: According to this review, it is believed that microorganisms are very important in
pathogenesis of psoriasis. Microorganisms can lead to exacerbation of psoriasis via monocytes and T cells
activation by Superantigens and secretion of various toxins.

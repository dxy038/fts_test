We consider optimal control design for systems that involve continuous and discrete states. The discontinuous nature of such a system results in the inconsistency of the derivatives of the objective function used by gradient-based numerical optimization algorithms. To avoid this difficulty, we propose a novel algorithm using constrained differential dynamic programming to solve the optimal control problem

This is a report of the preliminary activities of ISCS Working Group 3. The major objective of our working group is to study the origins and transport of solar emissions through the heliosphere. The emphasis of our group is on studies of dynamic activity in the mid to outer corona and its influence on the solar wind. WG3 has three subareas of study: 1) Dynamic solar emissions in the increasing and maximum portion of solar cycle 23; 2) Propagation in the interplanetary medium (coronal mass ejections, interplanetary shocks, and energetic particles); and 3) Interaction of coronal mass ejections and solar wind streams with Earth's magnetosphere.

This paper focuses on analyzing the impact of the excitation control mode of synchronous generators when operating connected to power distribution systems, through the study of a system derived from a real distribution feeder from a Brazilian utility. The number of connections of distributed generation has increased over the last years, bringing new technical issues when planning and operating a distribution system. In Brazil, the major part of the distributed resources applications is composed by synchronous generators directly connected to the distribution system. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the stability analysis of these systems, as there is still no consensus among the electric energy companies about the best control mode of synchronous generators in the context of distributed generation.

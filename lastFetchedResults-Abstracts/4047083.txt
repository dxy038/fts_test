An isolated bidirectional full-bridge dc-dc converter with high conversion ratio, high output power, and soft start-up capability is proposed in this paper. The use of a capacitor, a diode, and a flyback converter can clamp the voltage spike caused by the current difference between the current-fed inductor and leakage inductance of the isolation transformer, and can reduce the current flowing through the active switches at the current-fed side. Operational principle of the proposed converter is first described, and then, the design equation is derived. A 1.5-kW prototype with low-side voltage of 48 V and high-side voltage of 360 V has been implemented, from which experimental results have verified its feasibility.

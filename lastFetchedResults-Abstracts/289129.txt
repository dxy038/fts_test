Calvarium is a frequent target site of involvement for common neoplasms. Some cases of calvarial metastases have been reported in literature as secondary lesions from renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but only five cases have been described concerning calvarial mass as the first clinical presentation of this kind of tumor. In this report, we discuss the clinical aspects of two further cases we observed, in which the renal cell carcinoma was found thanks to the histological examination of a calvarial mass after surgery. We also briefly review the literature.

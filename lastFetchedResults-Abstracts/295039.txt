Although the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion has been recognised as a complication associated with burn and other trauma in adults, relatively little is known about its incidence in children. The objective of this study was to investigate whether it is a complication associated with burn injury in children. Plasma and urine levels of arginine vasopressin (anti-diuretic hormone), sodium and osmolality were measured in samples collected from 16 burn-injured children admitted to the burns unit of the regional childrenâ€™s hospital. No significant correlations were found between plasma vasopressin and plasma sodium or osmolality levels, but there were significant correlations between plasma vasopressin and urine osmolality, 36 (r=0.74, p=0.009), 60 (r=0.92, p=0.000) and 84 h (r=0.84, p=0.001) after admission, respectively. There were also significant correlations between plasma sodium and plasma osmolality, 24 (r=0.7, p=0.005), 36 (r=0.57, p=0.04) and 84 h (r=0.84, p=0.004) after admission. The data suggest dissociation between the osmolar control of vasopressin secretion and vasopressin levels after burn injury in children, but do not support the incidence of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.

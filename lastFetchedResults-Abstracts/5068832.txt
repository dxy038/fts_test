An innovative framework for the management of server services at various sites across a communication network is presented. It consists of a better organization of queries´ plan and data allocation to server, considering the group and query mobility along with the dependency of servers. Nowadays servers´ ability to work semi autonomously, in regards to the decision of the appropriate query plan and the provision of the effective data location, plays a significant role to the query and network performance. Our objective is to minimize the communication and execution cost of the query plan for the dependent servers (when the query can not be completed in the starting servers) servers having query and group mobility. Data Mining methods are applied to reduce the dependent servers´ external queries. A set of direct executing methods for starting the query server enforces the semi-autonomous server process. Simulation results are provided.

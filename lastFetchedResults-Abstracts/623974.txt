Abstract

Background and objective: Low blood pressure and Muscle cramps are common complications of Hemodialysis. One approach that has recently been proposed to prevent this complication is the combination of sodium and ultrafiltration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of of sodium and ultrafiltration profile on some of the common complications during Hemodialysis.
Material and Methods: In this crossover clinical trial study, 22 Hemodialysis patients referred to Panje- Azar Hospital in 2012 were divided randomly into two groups. For each group, two treatment protocols were conducted, six hemodialysis sessions. The intervention protocol was a linear sodium dialysate and linear ultra?ltration. In routine Protocol, both sodium dialysate and ultra?ltration were considered constant. Using chi-square test and relative risk, the data was analyzed (P < 0.05).
Results: The mean age is 54.73 Â± 11.21 year and 59.1% of them are females. The incidence of hypotension and muscle cramps in the experimental protocol procedure is significantly decreased compared with that of control group (P < 0.05), but the incidence of headache and vomiting is not significant (P < 0.05). 
Conclusion: Because sodium and ultrafiltration profile is simple and cost-free and reduces the incidence of complications during dialysis, we recommend using sodium and UF profile instead of routine one.

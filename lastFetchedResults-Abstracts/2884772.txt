This paper presents a new grassy effect generation approach. The grassy effect changes original image as the one behind the grass. A random number generation function is employed to decide the same of block and location of the pixel. Obtained various block size and pixel location yield unexpected grassy execution to the original image. The subjective and the objective image performances are compared which conclude that the proposed approach successfully crates glassy effect in images.

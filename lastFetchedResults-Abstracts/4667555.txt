In this paper, the emphasis is on network protection related problems caused by the distributed generation. The objective of the research was finding out the most typical problems, proposing some suitable solution methods and studying these problems and solutions in an actual installation case using a sample network. An essential basis for the study was using a weak distribution network as a research environment. The calculations were made by using the ABB Open++ network information system. The case study concerned connecting the Hogsara wind park to the distribution network in the Finnish archipelago.

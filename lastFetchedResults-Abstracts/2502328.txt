Tool wear and surface roughness of the workpiece are the important parameters in evaluation of the machining processes. In this research, effect of the machining parameters on the tool wear and surface roughness of the 4140 steel workpiece have been modeled and optimized using the response surface and desirability function approaches. First, required experiments have been designed by specifying the level of the input parameters (feed rate, cutting depth, operation time and cutting speed). Then, the experiments have been performed using a CNC lathe and tool wear and workpiece surface roughness have been measured as objective functions. In the next stage, main and interaction effects of the parameters investigated and response surface model of the objective functions obtained. At last, optimized value of the input parameters have been gained using the desirability function method as a multi objective optimization approach. Results showed that the process has been modeled precisely and minimized value of the surface roughness and tool wear obtained by optimizing the input parameters. Investigation of the parameters effects showed that the surface roughness and tool wear increase as the feed rate increases and tool wear increases and surface roughness decreases as the cutting speed increases

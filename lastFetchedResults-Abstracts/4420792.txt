With the increasing number of portable and wireless devices and the expanding of wireless network bandwidth, there is a growing demand for high quality and low bitrate speech and audio codec. This paper presents a speech and audio codec, which is based upon AVS P10. In our presented codec, ACELP and TCX technology is adopted, and also presents a hybrid bandwidth extension to coding high band signal. The paper gives an overview of the codec architecture and presents results of formal listening tests, objective test, and complicity of algorithm comparing this new codec with ITU-T G.718 and AVS P10. This result shows a comparable performance and forms the basis of the reference model in the ongoing AVS standardization activity for AVS2 speech and audio coding.

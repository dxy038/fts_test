Electrical generators of renewable electricity resources are quiet, clean and reliable. Optimal placement of renewable electricity generators (REGs) results in reduction of objective functions like losses, costs of electrical generation and voltage deviation. Because of recent technology developments of photovoltaic units, wind turbine and fuel cell units, only these generators are considered in this paper. This work presents a multiobjective optimization algorithm for the siting and sizing of renewable electricity generators. The objectives consist of minimization of costs, emission and losses of distributed system and optimization of voltage profile. This multiobjective optimization is solved by the Improved honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, an external repository is considered to save non-dominated (Pareto) solutions found during the search process. Since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering technique is used to control the size of the repository within the limits. This algorithm is executed on a typical 70-bus test system. Results of the case study show the proper siting and sizing of REGs are important to improve the voltage profile, reduce costs, emission and losses of distribution system. The main feature of the algorithm refers to its accuracy and calculation speed.

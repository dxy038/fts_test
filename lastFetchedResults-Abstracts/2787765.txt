Cloud computing is a developing computing paradigm that has inclined every other entity in the digital industry, it may be government sector or the personal sector. Taking into account the mounting significance of cloud, finding new ways to advance cloud services is an area of concern and research center. Usually clouds have powerful data centers to handle large number of users. Cloud is a platform providing dynamic pool of resources and virtualization. To properly manage the resources of the service contributor, load balancing is required for the jobs that are submitted to the service contributor. Load balancing is a tactic to share out workload across many virtual machines in a Server over the network to achieve optimal resource consumption, least data processing time, least average response time, and avoid overload. The objective of this paper is to propose efficient and enhanced Hybrid scheduling algorithm that can maintain the load and provides modified resource allocation techniques. In this paper Hybrid approach is applied for load balancing using Throttled and Equally Spread Current Execution (ESCE) algorithms.

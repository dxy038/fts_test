Traffic controlling of signalized intersections is realized through signal plans. Different approaches can be used if we want to design the signal plan. The approach using mathematical programming represents one of them. Using mathematical programming we can get an optimal signal plan; we can also use several mathematical models that differ in objective functions. It is obvious that the signal plans may differ if we use different objective functions. Our paper describes selected practical examples of using the approach to signal plan design. On the basis of the examples it is shown that the mathematical modelling approach is very effective.

This paper studies the problem of designing robust <i>H</i> <sub>infin</sub> controllers for networked control systems (NCSs) with time-varying sampling period. A sampling period switching-based method is proposed to deal with NCSs with time-varying sampling period, long time delay, and packet dropout, then by formulating a non-convex feasibility problem into a multi-objective optimization problem subject to LMI constraints, <i>H</i> <sub>infin</sub> controller design is presented by using the proposed sampling period switching-based method. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling period switching-based <i>H</i> <sub>infin</sub> controller design.

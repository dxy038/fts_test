Most of analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs) are based on Nyquist criteria which usually results in redundant data samples. The main objective of this paper is to determine the minimum sampling required to characterize and reproduce with no information loss a signal of interest. In this paper, a novel scheme, called analogue- to-information, is proposed for data conversion. Although this scheme is based on an irregular sampling scheme, however, it employs an adaptive adjustable clock generator for signal variation and exploits a linear relationship arbiter in every two adjacent sampled data for saving the amount of conversion. Simulation results are provided which illustrates better performance than irregular sampling schemes.

Neural networks have been applied very successfully in the identification and control of nonlinear dynamic systems. The paper presents a design of neural network based control system for 2DOF nonlinear laboratory helicopter model (Humusoft CE 150). The main objective of this paper is to develop artificial neural networks to control helicopterÂ´s motors, or consequently elevation and azimuth angles. Neural networks are obtained by cloning various type of controllers designed in our previous papers. Those procedures included a cloning linear PID controller, gain scheduling controller and fuzzy controller.

The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular pathological responses of hepatopancreatic digestive cells from the periwinkle Littorina littorea exposed to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) fluoranthene and to ascertain whether any injurious effects were reversible within the experimental time scale. A secondary objective was to establish the relationship of the various reactions to animal health status, using lysosomal stability as an index of well-being. Exposure of snails to a concentration of 335 μg l−1 (1.7 μM) fluoranthene (seawater renewed and spiked daily with fluoranthene) for 5 days resulted in a reduction in lysosomal stability (neutral red retention) and endocytosis; and an increase in smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 7-ethoxycoumarin-o-deethylase (ECOD; measured as cyano-ECOD) activity measured in isolated live digestive cells. Exposed snails treated with clean seawater for a further 8 days resulted in a return to control levels of lysosomal stability, ECOD and ER; endocytosis showed only a partial recovery. Multi-variate and uni-variate analysis showed that there were strong correlations between the various cellular biomarker responses. These findings are interpretable within the current framework of molluscan biomarker responses to PAHs. Principal component analysis was used to derive the first principal component for endocytosis, ER and ECOD reactions and these were plotted against lysosomal stability as a measure of cellular well-being. The resulting significant regression represents the mapping of the individual biomarkers within health status space for a gradient of fluoranthene toxicity. From this analysis, we concluded that endocytosis is an indicator of healthy snails while proliferation of ER and to a lesser extent induced ECOD are indicative of dysfunction and reduced health. Finally, the results indicate that stress induced by chronic exposure to a PAH is reversible.

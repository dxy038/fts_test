In order to re-assess the potential contribution of infrared (IR) imaging as a first-line component of a multi-imaging strategy using currently available technology, we first review the history of its introduction and clinical application, including the results of the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Projects (BCDDP). We then discuss experiments with a new high-resolution, computerized IR station and software program acquired by the Ville Marie Breast Center to assess IR imagingÂ´s ability to complement clinical examination and mammography in the early detection of breast cancer. Our goal is to show that high-resolution IR imaging provides additional safe, practical, and objective information when produced and interpreted by sufficiently trained breast physicians.

In this study, the author considers a robust cooperative output regulation problem for a class of uncertain non-linear multi-agent systems. The dynamics of each agent can be represented by a non-linear system with unknown parameters. It is assumed that only some of the agents are able to access the exosystem, and thus the problem has to be solved by cooperation among different agents. An internal model-based control strategy is proposed such that, regardless of small parameter perturbations of the agent and control law, the objective of asymptotic tracking and disturbance rejection can be achieved by the control law. Moreover, this method does not require each agent to have identical dynamics.

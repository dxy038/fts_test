The principal objective of this study is to analyze structures of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) using a wavelet technique. We use data measured with the SOHO/LASCO coronographs C2–C3, EIT and STEREO COR1A–B, COR2A–B. We have found that different structures show up in a CME at different spatial scales of wavelets. We also study the orientation of the most intense flux and find the orientation of the structures in the CME.

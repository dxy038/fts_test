In this paper a new class of higher order (F ,ρ,σ)-type I functions for a multiobjective
programming problem is introduced, which subsumes several known studied classes.
Higher order Mond–Weir and Schaible type dual programs are formulated for a nondifferentiable
multiobjective fractional programming problem where the objective functions and
the constraints contain support functions of compact convex sets in Rn. Weak and strong
duality results are studied in both the cases assuming the involved functions to be higher
order (F ,ρ,σ)-type I. A number of previously studied problems appear as special cases

With more and more applications of Stereo/multiview video technology, Stereo/multiview video quality assessment is quite needed. In this paper, we have proposed a novel multiview video quality assessment method based on disparity and SSIM. We evaluate video quality from two aspects, stereo perception and image quality. Stereo perception is evaluated by the disparities, and image quality is got by the similarity of every view. The subjective experiments verified the rationality of the presented novel objective method.

The objective of this study was to devise wafer level AC measurement procedures as an aid to the development of production line radiation hardness assurance screens and controls for complex Integrated Circuits (ICs). This objective was met using a commercially available AC probe and associated test equipment in conjunction with removable probe pads connected to critical circuit node points. The procedure was demonstrated for the test case of 100% electrical screens for neutron effects on transistors on dielectrically isolated linear circuits. Prediction accuracies (using a damage factor obtained independently) averaged 4% with a 4% standard deviation. This test case was only a part of the more general development program which is still in progress. A number of other applications for the measurement procedure are described.

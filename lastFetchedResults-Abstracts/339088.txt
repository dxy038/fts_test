Objective
Chemotherapy agents (CA) such as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), idarubicin (IDA), and etoposide (VP-16) are widely used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) However, their effects on signaling pathways leading to cytotoxicity have only been described recently. Ligation of the leukemia-associated antigen CD33 by anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (mAb) also results in signaling events that induce a downregulation of cell growth. We examined the possibility that anti-CD33 mAb and CA might cooperate in mediation of growth inhibition in primary AML samples and AML cell lines.
Materials and methods

We investigated two AML cells lines and 14 primary AML samples for their proliferative response (3H-thymidine incorporation), colony formation, and biochemical (Western blot analysis) to anti-CD33 mAb treatment combined with chemotherapy agents.
Results

CD33 ligation induced a significant increase in ara-C- or IDA- but not VP-16â€“or Bryostatin-mediated inhibition of proliferation and colony formation. Ara-C and IDA induced SHP-1 and SHP-2 protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) phosphorylation and Lyn/SHP-1 complex formation, while VP-16 and Bryostatin did not. CD33 ligation, however, mediated phosphorylation of these PTPs and Syk/SHP-1 complex formations. Combined treatment of AML cells by ara-C or IDA with anti-CD33 mAb resulted in higher levels of SHP-1 phosphorylation. Reduction in SHP-1 by short interfering RNA abrogated these effects.
Conclusion

These data suggest that combined incubation of leukemia cells with anti-CD33 mAb and ara-C or IDA, but not VP-16 or Bryostatin, independently triggers similar events in the downstream signaling cascade, and therefore leads to additive antiproliferative effects and enhanced cytotoxicity.

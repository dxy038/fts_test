Background&Objective: Cardiovascular disease is among imprtant factors of mortality in haemodialysis patients. There are some reports that indicate the camitine concentration reduction in the tissues accelerate cardiovascular abnormalities in those patients whome regularly are haemodialysed. This research has been set up to study the effect of oral carnitine on the heart funciton of haemodialysis patients from Sari and Vali-Asr hospital in Ghaem-Shan Fatemeh alzahrah, Imam Khomaini in during 2003.
Materials&Methods: In this study 20 patients with at least 3 month duration and 3 times interval haemodialysis in each month were choosen. The sample hemogenously devided in case and control group. One carnitine tablet with 1 gr dose was given to the case group daily. The placebo was prescribed to the control group EF and LVEDD of patients were determined by echocardiography. The ratio dimeter of heart to the chest was determined by chest rediography. The plasma level of haemoglobin, cholestrol and triglyceride were determined simultanously.
Results: There was not any meaningfull recovery in E.F and LVEDD and serum lipids, between the case and control group six months after treatment with 1 gr/day carnitine. There was only a meaningfull difference in E.F after six-month duration of this study. In spite of this, there was a meaningful] recovery with these patients anaemia (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Carnitine does not have a meaningfull effect on heart function and serum lipid level, but it has an efficacy on anaemia recovery of such patients.

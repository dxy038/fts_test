CO2 injection is one of the most common methods in enhanced oil recovery. Objective of this paper is to simulate continuous CO2 injection in field scale to obtain recovery factor of CO2 flooding and storage capacity of carbon dioxide in an oil field located in South-West of Iran. It has been considered that CO2 is captured from external flue gases in Ramin Power Plant. Using the commercial software and validated compositional reservoir model, the most affecting operational parameters such as injected CO2 volume, injection rate, location and number of injected wells, perforated intervals, GOR constraint of production wells, and CO2 solubility in the aquifer were investigated. Simulation results have shown that increasing the injected volume of CO2 causes increase in storage capacity, but not in the oil recovery factor necessarily. The most effective parameters on oil recovery factor are injection rate and perforated intervals. Injection in lower layers increases the recovery factor and storage capacity, simultaneously. Limiting the production wells with GOR constraint, increases the storage capacity and reduces the oil recovery factor. CO2 solubility in aquifer reduces the recovery factor of the process and increase CO2 storage capacity. Finally, at the best scenario, recovery factor obtained from continuous CO2 injection is around 7.5%, and CO2 storage capacity is 33 BSm3 equal to 60 MM metric Ton.

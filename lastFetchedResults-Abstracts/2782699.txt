Voltage stability improvement is a challenging issue in planning and security assessment of power systems. As modern systems are being operated under heavily stressed conditions with reduced stability margins, incorporation of voltage stability criteria in the operation of power systems began receiving great attention. This study presents a novel voltage stability constrained optimal power flow (VSC-OPF) approach based on static line voltage stability indices to simultaneously improve voltage stability and minimise power system losses under stressed and contingency conditions. The proposed methodology uses a voltage collapse proximity indicator (VCPI) to provide important information about the proximity of the system to voltage instability. The VCPI index is incorporated into the optimal power flow (OPF) formulation in two ways; first it can be added as a new voltage stability constraint in the OPF constraints, or used as a voltage stability objective function. The proposed approach has been evaluated on the standard IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus test systems under different cases and compared with two well proved VSC-OPF approaches based on the bus voltage indicator L<i>-</i>index and the minimum singular value. The simulation results are promising and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VSC-OPF based on the line voltage stability index.

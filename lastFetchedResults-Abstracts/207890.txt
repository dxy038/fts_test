This paper draws on the work of Jacques Lacan
and Jacques Derrida in order to present a discussion
of how students and teachers in the field of
art and design education achieve their pedagogised
identities. My purpose is to offer some
thoughts on assessment by advocating a project
of difference which attempts to embrace children’s
and student’s ontological orientations of
practice. Assessment discourses which assume
universal and essentialist ideas of ability are criticised
and shown to presuppose objective or
naturalist fantasies. A valuing of difference and
the singularity of practice is proposed by describing
five drawings produced by Year 7 students in
a London secondary school, and then by referring
to the Lacanian Real in order to extricate the
art object from normative assessment discourses.

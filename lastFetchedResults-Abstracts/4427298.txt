Both simulation and analytic modeling are often employed during the various phases of a systemÂ´s lifetime e.g. definition, design, development, engineering and operations. A primary objective of such modeling is usually to insure that performance objectives are met in a cost effective manner. Often a variety of simulation and analytic tools are used, but invariably there is no relationship between any of the tools. To address this problem (as well as others, including model reuse), an open, object-oriented environment consisting of a variety of integrated toolsets for modeling, analysis, simulation and engineering of computer/communications systems is being developed at Monmouth University. MASE, an integrated toolset built around a generalized queueing network paradigm, is the first toolset in that environment

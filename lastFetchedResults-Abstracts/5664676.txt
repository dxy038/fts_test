This paper presents the results of a statistical correlation study between a data base of subjective speech quality measures and a data base of objective speech quality measures. Both data bases are derived from approximately 18 hours of coded and distorted speech. The subjective test used was the Diagnostic Acceptability Measure (DAM), a parametric speech quality test developed at the Dynastat Corporation. The objective measures included approximately 1500 parametric variations of many commonly suggested objective measures. This paper summarizes the performance of the objective measures in predicting the subjective results.

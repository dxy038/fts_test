The objective of this study was to characterise the sensory profile of goat milk and cheese evaluated in three different seasons
on the basis of alcohols, ketones, esters and terpenes content and profile. For this purpose, a trained panel of eight people was
used, which sniffed the pure compounds corresponding to those found in all the products.
One group of 15 lactating goats grazed a local pasture from March to July. Daily grazing time was approximately 8 h/day.
During winter, spring and summer, herbage intake and the contribution of each species to the grazing diet were estimated by
difference of herbage mass weight. Volatile organic compounds (VOC) content in herbage diet, milk and cheeses was determined
by a multiple dynamic headspace extraction and GC–MS. The “fragrance” profilewas described using the single pure compounds
found in milk and cheese. The results showed that from winter to spring especially ketones content increased in milk, while no
variation was observed for the other compounds. Summer milk was characterised mostly by terpenes.
Also, the “fragrance” profile changed with grazing season.Winter milkwas characterised bywood pulp-hay, green-herbaceous
and blue-cheese notes, while in the spring by wood pulp-hay, blue-cheese, hot milk and musty. In the summer, the profile totally
changed. In this season resinous, citrus, mint and fruity were the dominant notes.
In comparison to herbage and milk, cheeses were less rich in volatile compounds. Not significant variation was observed in
cheeses from a season to another, but their sensory profile was dominated by sweet odour.

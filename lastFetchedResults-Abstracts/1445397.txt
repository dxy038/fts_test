The problem of identifying dynamical models on the basis of measurement data is usually considered in a classical open-loop or closed-loop setting. In this paper, this problem is generalized to dynamical systems that operate in a complex interconnection structure and the objective is to consistently identify the dynamics of a particular module in the network. For a known interconnection structure it is shown that the classical prediction error methods for closed-loop identification can be generalized to provide consistent model estimates, under specified experimental circumstances. Two classes of methods considered in this paper are the direct method and the joint-IO method that rely on consistent noise models, and indirect methods that rely on external excitation signals like two-stage and IV methods. Graph theoretical tools are presented to verify the topological conditions under which the several methods lead to consistent module estimates.

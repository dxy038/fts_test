Multipulse-excitation has greatly improved the speech quality achievable from linear predictive coders which previously required speech to be classified as voiced or unvoiced for excitation purposes. Multipulse removes the need for voicing classification, it improves speech quality by enhancing the excitation and offsets errors in the vocal tract filter. The authors have investigated a multipulse-excited channel vocoder. The prime objective being to improve the speech quality of the channel vocoder and achieve multipulse linear prediction quality. We describe how a particular channel vocoder is incorporated into a multipulse algorithm, and report the initial results of our multipulse-excited channel vocoder investigation.

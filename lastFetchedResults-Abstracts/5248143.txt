This paper presents improvements over the dynamics window approach (I-DWA), used for computing in real time autonomous robot navigation. A novel objective function that includes Lyapunov stability criteria is proposed. It allows to guarantee a global and asymptotic convergence to the goal, resulting in a more simple and self-contained approach. Experimental results with simulated and real environments are presented to validate the capability of the proposed approach.

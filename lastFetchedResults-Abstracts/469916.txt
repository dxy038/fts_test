Objective
This study was undertaken to compare the objective and subjective long-term surgical outcomes in patients receiving Tutoplast fascia lata allograft slings with those receiving autograft slings for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
Study design
We reviewed all patients (n = 71) undergoing suburethral sling with either autologous fascia lata (n = 39) or Tutoplast fascia lata (n = 32) for urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) from October 1, 1998, to August 1, 2001.
Results
Of the original 71 patients, 47 were evaluated by objective and/or subjective means at a minimum of 2 years after surgery. Subjective quality of life measures, subjective continence, maximum urethral closure pressure, and bladder neck mobility were not different between the 2 groups. USI was demonstrated in 41.7% of allograft patients compared with no autograft patients (P = .007).
Conclusion
Although patient reported cure of SUI is high for both sling types, USI recurs at a significantly higher rate in Tutoplast slings compared with autologous slings.

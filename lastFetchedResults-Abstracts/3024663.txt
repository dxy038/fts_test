The establishment of performance indices and standards is a constant challenge in the Brazilian electric system. In particular, ONS, with the support of various agents (transmission, distribution, generation and free consumers), representative associations of these same agents, universities, research centers and ANEEL developed an initial set of indices and standards with the objective of evaluating the performance of the basic grid. However, it is acknowledged that the adoption of these indices and standards is not sufficient to guarantee the adequate performance of the network. It is also necessary to develop a set of procedures for determining many things such as the values of the indicators themselves and for evaluating the violations of performance including the determining of their causes and define the remedies needed to reestablish an adequate level of performance and finally, identify where lies the respective responsibilities in these cases. These same procedures must also be used to as evaluate the performance of new connections to the basic grid. This paper presents some aspects associated with the management of the performance standards utilized in the basic grid in Brazil and include: the responsibilities of the system operator - ONS - and of the agents in the management process, the evaluation philosophy and management of the performance standards as well as the divulging of the results thus obtained.

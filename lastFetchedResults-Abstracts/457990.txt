Objective
Adiponectin has anti-atherogenic properties and low circulating adiponectin has been linked to coronary atherosclerosis. Yet, there is considerable evidence that the high-molecular weight (HMW) complex of adiponectin is the major active form of this adipokine. We therefore investigated whether HMW adiponectin is associated with the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) in men.
Research design and methods
Associations among CAD, HMW adiponectin and the HMW/total-adiponectin ratio were assessed in 240 male patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. Total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serum levels were correlated with defined coronary scores and established cardiovascular risk factors.
Results
We found significant inverse correlations between angiographic scores and HMW adiponectin [Extent Score (ES): r = −0.39; Gensini Score (GS): r = −0.35; and Severity Score (SS): r = −0.40, all P < 0.001], and the HMW/total-adiponectin ratio (ES: r = −0.49; GS: r = −0.46; SS: r = −0.46; all P < 0.001). Multivariable regression analyses revealed that HMW adiponectin and the HMW/total-adiponectin ratio were significantly associated with the extent of CAD (both P < 0.001). ROC analyses demonstrated that the predictive value of HMW adiponectin and the HMW/total-adiponectin ratio for the extent of coronary atherosclerosis significantly exceeded that of total adiponectin (P < 0.001, P = 0.010, respectively).
Conclusions
HMW adiponectin and the HMW/total-adiponectin ratio inversely correlate with the extent of CAD. HMW adiponectin in particular seems to be a better marker for CAD extent than total adiponectin.

As a unique opportunity to promote medical and biological engineering and science (MBES), the Bologna movement has triggered an initiative by the European MBES community to establish their higher education area by harmonizing the educational programs, specifying minimum qualifications, and establishing criteria for an efficient quality control of education, training, and lifelong learning, which is very high on the list of priorities for the EU. The main objective of the current initiatives within MBES is to establish a general European consensus on guidelines for the harmonization and accreditation of high-quality MBES programs and for the certification and continuing education of professionals working in the healthcare systems. Adoption and adherence to these guidelines will allow mobility in education and employment. Implementing the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) for MBES in cooperation with all relevant groups will also further the professional standing of MBES and the competitiveness of European education, industry, and healthcare systems. A survey of the current status of the EHEA for MBES demonstrates that its implementation is steadily progressing and that its impact will benefit the quality of education and training.

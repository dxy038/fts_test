With enormous growth in video applications, a huge amount of video data is being generated every day. The study, analysis and investigation of recent development would leads to acquire objective of future. The proposed work is inspired from the same issue in concern face detection in video. It would be the future demand for searching, browsing, and retrieving human face of interest from video database for several applications. The goal of proposed work is to systematically address the recent work of face detection in video through evaluation that permits a meaningful objective comparison of techniques, provides the research community with sufficient data for the exploration of automatic modeling techniques. The outcome of the paper which fulfilled the three objectives-i) study and classification of recent techniques ii) analyzed the status recent techniques with respect to results and performance Finally, iii) identification of most feasible and optimized technique along with discussion for betterment. Also, information about some video database provided. Mean while, objective evaluation would be extremely useful to the computer vision research community for years to come.

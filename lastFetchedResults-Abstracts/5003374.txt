The objective of this paper is to investigate the issues and concepts that arise when integrating wind power, and discusses the concrete approaches to the interconnection considerations. Significant penetration of wind power in the present power systems will have large influence on the operation and control of the grid to which the wind parks are connected. The interconnection of wind energy system, normally through a power electronic device, to the system brings challenges of its own. This paper also provides a technical assessment of the impact of distributed generation technologies on the power grid. Some of the considerations are addressed with the aid of the feasibility studies of some example studies

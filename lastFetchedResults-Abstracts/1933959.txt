The objective of this study was to characterize the temporal profile of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs; isoforms 1–11) across different stages of gestation in the Barbari goat. Placentae were collected from local abattoir, classified according to crown rump length of the corresponding foetus into five groups (0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 91–120, and 121–150 days of gestation), and used for relative quantification of mRNA expression by Pfaffl method. In addition, adult female goats (pregnant, n = 7; non-pregnant, n = 5) were used to estimate weekly plasma PAG and progesterone (P4) concentrations. The relative mRNA expression of PAGs was greater (p &lt; 0.05) during 31–60 days of gestation, which correlated well with the temporal changes in plasma PAG concentrations. Relative expression of PAGs decreased steadily as gestation advanced with minimum expression observed just before parturition, except for PAG-4 and PAG-8 that showed constantly higher expression throughout pregnancy. Plasma PAG and P4 concentrations showed a distinct temporal pattern with a significant increase beginning at 2 weeks and return to basal levels by 20 weeks of gestation. However, PAG concentrations reached a peak earlier in gestation (8 weeks) than P4 (10–14 weeks). Correlation analysis indicated a strong positive association (r = 0.748, p &lt; 0.01) between plasma PAG and P4 concentrations. In conclusion, results of this study indicate a distinct temporal pattern of PAG expression and secretion during gestation in the Barbari goat. The temporal changes in PAGs and the positive association with P4 are suggestive of their role in maintenance of pregnancy and progressive foetal development.

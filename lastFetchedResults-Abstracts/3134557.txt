Taking the kinetic energy decoupling level as the objective function, stiffness of each mounting acted as the design variable, penalty function method and Powell algorithm were applied which were programmed in the MATLAB software. During the optimization the natural frequency and displacement of the powertrain mounting system were taken into account. To verify the result of optimization, the corresponding simulation model was built in ADAMS software. It could be concluded that the decoupling effect has been improved which is beneficial to ride comfort.

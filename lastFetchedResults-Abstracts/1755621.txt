Objective
esent study aimed to examine the medium and long term psychological impact of diving accidents on the victims (n=52), compared with the impact on two control groups: the victim's diving “buddy” (n=40) who simply witnessed the accident, and a second control from the same boat who did not dive with the victim (n=38).
s
as a prospective cohort study of the impact of an accident on the victims who attended the Hyperbaric Unit, in comparison with the two control groups. Pre-accident psychological morbidity was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire. Trauma symptoms were assessed using the Revised Impact of Events Scale at 3, 6 and 12 months post accident.
s
cident victims endorsed more trauma symptoms and experienced them more intensely and for longer, compared with the two control groups.
sion
ificant minority of diving accident victims (between 25% and 50%) continued to suffer from the psychological impact of the accident, some for over a year. This has important implications for their future health care, for their safety on subsequent dives, and for dive training.

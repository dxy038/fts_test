Kappa-casein, as a major protein component in mammalian milk, plays an essential role in formation and stabilization milk micelles and preventing them from aggregating and therefore, helping to keep calcium phosphate in solution and transfer of calcium and phosphors from animal milk to consumers. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to investigate genetic and phylogenetic analysis of exon 4 of k-casein (CSN3) gene in Iranian camels using 10 blood samples from Dromedary camels and 5 blood samples from Bacterian camels. After DNA extraction, partial DNA fragment (713 bp) of the k-casein gene was amplified and sequenced using specific primers by PCR reaction. Obtained sequences were edited and subsequently were compared with other k-casein gene sequences which were submitted in NCBI data base. The results showed that there were no significant variations among analyzed sequences. Furthermore, the Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic analysis showed that according to k-casein gene sequence, Iranian Dromedary and Bacterian camels have the lowest genetic distance with Lama species.

Objective. Erythropoiesis involves proliferation and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitors to mature red blood cells. The objective of this study was to characterize growth characteristics of human CD36+ erythroid progenitors and to profile temporal expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, structural proteins, and growth factor receptors involved in erythropoiesis.

Materials and Methods. Erythropoietin-induced differentiation of human cord blood CD36+ erythroid progenitors was profiled for GATA-1, GATA-2, NFE2, EKLF, SCL, PU.1, Id1, Evi-1, c-myb, Hox2.2, c-kit, EpoR, glycophorin A (GPA), CD71, β- and γ-globin, and protein 4.2 gene and/or protein expression and DNA content analysis on days 4, 7, and 15 of culture.

Results. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed upregulation of GATA-1, Id1, glycophorin A, and protein 4.2 mRNA expression on day 7 when compared to day 4 and decreased expression on day 15. EKLF, GATA-2, Hox2.2, c-myb, Evi-1, c-kit, and PU.1 mRNA expression decreased on days 7 and 15. NFE2, CD71, SCL, and EPO-R mRNA expression remained similar on days 4 and 7 but decreased on day 15. Expression of globin genes β- and γ-globin increased on both day 7 and day 15 compared to day 4. Values from flow cytometric quantitation of glycophorin A, transferrin receptor (CD71), and hemoglobin A proteins correlated with gene expression results. DNA analysis demonstrated that most cells lacked DNA content by day 15, a finding consistent with enucleation and terminal erythroid differentiation.

Conclusion. These data indicate that in vitro liquid cultures of committed CD36+ erythroid progenitor cells retain, in part, many features of erythropoiesis at the cellular and molecular level and may provide a useful model for assessment of disease-related or drug-induced erythropoietic abnormalities.

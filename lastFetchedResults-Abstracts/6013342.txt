Application of APLC to minimize the load harmonic distortion in the power system is one of the most effective and useful techniques to conflict with harmonics. Previous papers on APLC focuses largely on minimizing harmonic voltage distortions across an entire network by using properly located APLC. This paper discusses the optimum placing of an APLC into the power system by designing a fuzzy system. The fuzzy system designed is very useful for this purpose. Optimal placing of an APLC not only depends on topology of network, constrained injection current and kind of objective functions but also depends mostly on the experiences obtained from an expert person and his ability to know the network. Application of fuzzy system having advantages of using fuzzy experiences are wide in the area of control theory and power system planning. Results of an fuzzy system designed to be used in active power systems are presented in this paper

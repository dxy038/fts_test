A system of equations of the boundary-value problem of the theory of plasticity, which combines the major statements of the mechanics and physics of the plastic deformation and failure of metals, is proposed. It is shown that the system ensures construction of adequate mathematical models of multistep plastic forming processes occurring under the conditions of a complex loading and nonmonotonic deformation. The system can be used in rationalizing and optimizing the production processes of cold plastic forming of blanks and machine parts with the objective of minimizing the time and material and energy expenditures, as well as improving the reliability of machines.

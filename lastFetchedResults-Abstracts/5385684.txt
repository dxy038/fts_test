This single-chip RF and modem transceiver provides a complete radio interface between the radio block, digital demodulation including time and frequency synchronization and data buffering. The number of external components is minimized so that only one crystal and one resistor and several decoupling capacitors are required. The bidirectional differential antenna pins are commonly used for RX and TX, therefore, no external antenna switch is needed. One on chip low-drop voltage regulator provides the analog and digital 1.8 V supply. The RX and TX signal processing part is implemented using 0.18 mum libraries, utilizing the low power consumption and the high density of the technology. The transceiver is implemented in a 1P6M 0.18 mum CMOS Technology with MIM capacitors. The receiver sensitivity is -94.7dBm for 1% packet error rate defined in IEEE 802.15.4 standard and error vector magnitude (EVM) of transmitter is 10% for 2.4 GHz band.

Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Arrays utilize a complex mammalian cell free expression system to produce proteins in situ. In alternative to fluorescent-labeled approaches a new label free method, emerging from the combined utilization of three independent and complementary nanotechnological approaches, appears capable to analyze protein function and proteinâ€“protein interaction in studies promising for personalized medicine. Quartz Micro Circuit nanogravimetry, based on frequency and dissipation factor, mass spectrometry and anodic porous alumina overcomes indeed the limits of correlated fluorescence detection plagued by the background still present after extensive washes. This could be further optimized by a homogeneous and well defined bacterial cell free expression system capable to realize the ambitious objective to quantify the regulatory protein networks in humans. Implications for personalized medicine of the above label free protein array using different test genes proteins are reported.

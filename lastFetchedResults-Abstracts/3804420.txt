The objective of the study described in this paper was to formulate a simple way of calculating the distribution of transient voltages at different points of a cascaded system consisting of a transformer winding connected to a tranmission line. A method of calculating the steady-state voltage distribution based on a simple eigervalue technique for the analysis of identical ladder networks representing the line and the transformer winding is described which is then used in conjunction with the numerical inversiorn of the Fourier integral to obtain the transient voltage waveform at various points in a 500 kV line and in the transformer winding.

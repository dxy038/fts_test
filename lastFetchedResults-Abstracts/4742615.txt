With recent development, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) are actually providing inexpensive broadband access and supporting numerous applications, thinks to the use of advanced radio technologies such as multiple radio interfaces and directional antennas. In this paper, we present a new methodology to show that an important aspect of dimensioning WMNs is by considering weighted fairness and the estimated users demand for specific running applications. Our objective is to satisfy the required demand while ensuring weighted fairness by exploiting the overall links capacity. To achieve this objective, we propose the combination of both capacity estimation based on BianchiÂ´s model and multi-path routing scheme. We compare our proposition with single path routing based on the shortest path criteria. The obtained results, in term of end-to-end throughput, show that it performs best.

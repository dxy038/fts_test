We present a novel architecture based on an optically switched foldback AWG to achieve symmetrically variable capacity allocation in bidirectional optical networks for downlink and uplink signals. We analyse the experimental degradation of different analog and digital services through the system, such as CATV, 10 GMz-tone, 155 Mb/s PRBS and UMTS signals. Four extra wavelengths have been used to demonstrate the reconfiguration of the approach.

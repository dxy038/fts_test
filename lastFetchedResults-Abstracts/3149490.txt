The objective of the paper is to propose a privacy model for ubiquitous healthcare system involving unconventional information sources like laboratory scanning equipments, networked computing systems and distributed wireless sensors using an actor based domain specific approach. In the existing privacy models for ubiquitous healthcare systems the trust on the middleware and the deployed security mechanisms through which the privacy threshold levels reached are not discussed. The main focus of the paper is to design architecture for enhancing the privacy over different communication networks. The dynamic trust evaluation and the threat monitoring has been carried out to take a decision based on the role and relationship of the actor. A formal model of privacy in U-Healthcare is arrived involving the attributes of the actor classes and invoking methods in that scenario. The performance of the ubiquitous healthcare system is validated through the proposed privacy metrics based on trust and security over different media.

The Activity Monitor described in this paper is an easy-to-configure context-aware mobile application, capable of estimating and evaluating the userÂ´s activity all day long. It relies on fusion strategies for movement and location estimation, which combine acceleration and radio data from in-device and external sensors. The final objective of the Activity Monitor is to deliver adequate context-aware notifications in order to make the user aware of his level of activity. The reasoning process to decide when and how to deliver notifications is fully done in the mobile device by using an embedded reasoner, avoiding privacy issues related to personal sensitive data sharing.

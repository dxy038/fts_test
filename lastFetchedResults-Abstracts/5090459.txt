Currently, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks remain among the most critical threats on the Internet. Ironically, although a major objective of Internet protocol design was to prevent DoS attacks and to maintain network connections in order to provide essential services to the masses uninterruptedly, the Internet is suffering significantly from distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks at present. In recent years, numerous research studies have focused on this topic. However, after deliberately analyzing the proposed defensive measures and supposedly secure systems, we figure that most are themselves extremely vulnerable to DoS/DDoS attacks. This paper contributes a detailed analysis of various existing and proposed defensive measures, as well as their vulnerabilities.

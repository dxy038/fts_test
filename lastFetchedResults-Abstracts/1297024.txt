Most industrial products and processes are characterized by several, typically correlated measurable variables, which jointly describe the product or process quality. Various control charts such as Hotellingâ€™s T2, EWMA and CUSUM charts have been developed for multivariate quality control, where the values of the chart parameters, namely the sample size, sampling interval and the control limits are determined to satisfy given economic and/or statistical requirements. It is well known that this traditional non-Bayesian approach to a control chart design is not optimal, but very few results regarding the form of the optimal Bayesian control policy have appeared in the literature, all limited to a univariate chart design. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bayesian process mean control problem for a finite production run under the assumption that the observations are values of independent, normally distributed vectors of random variables. The problem is formulated in the POMDP (partially observable Markov decision process) framework and the objective is to determine a control policy minimizing the total expected cost. It is proved that under standard operating and cost assumptions the control limit policy is optimal. Cost comparisons with the benchmark chi-squared chart and the MEWMA chart show that the Bayesian chart is highly cost effective, the savings are larger for smaller values of the critical Mahalanobis distance between the in-control and out-of-control process mean.

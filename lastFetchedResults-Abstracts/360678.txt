Study objective: To determine whether the environment of a moving ambulance affects the ability of out-of-hospital care providers to auscultate breath sounds. Methods:  Out-of-hospital care providers assessed breath sounds with a previously described breath-sounds model in a quiet environment (control) and in a moving ambulance. The setting was a nonurban emergency medical services system and an interhospital transport agency based at a 600-plus-bed tertiary care center. The participants were physicians, transport nurses, and advanced life support EMS providers routinely involved in the emergency out-of-hospital treatment and transportation of the ill and injured. The accuracy with which participants identified the presence or absence of breath sounds in the two environments was compared with the use of the χ2 test, with the α-value set at .05. Results:  The accuracy of breath-sounds assessment in the control environment was 96% (251 of 260); the sensitivity was 96% and the specificity 97%. The accuracy of breath-sounds assessment in the experimental environment was 54% (140 of 260); the sensitivity was .09% and the specificity 98%. Participants were significantly less likely to hear breath sounds in the moving ambulance than in the quiet room (P<.001). Conclusion:  Assessment of breath sounds is hampered by the environment of a moving ambulance. [Brown LH, Gough JE, Bryan-Berg DM, Hunt RC: Assessment of breath sounds during ambulance transport.

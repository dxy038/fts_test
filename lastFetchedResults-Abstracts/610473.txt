Introduction & Objective: Leptin , the main peptide secreted by adipose tissue, is considered an alarming factor in the regulation of body fat content . With regard to the physiological effect of exercise as one of the potential regulators of leptin secretion from adipose tissue , this study was performed to examine the effects of resistance exercise on leptin.
Materials & Methods: Twenty inactive and obese female students (10 controls and 10 experi-mentals ) participated in this study. The subjects in the experimental group performed an 8 week resistance training program (chest press, leg press, lat pull down, leg curl, bicep curl, leg extension) with 60 - 70 percent of 1RM. ELISA was used to measure leptin.
Results: The results of this study showed that 8 weeks of resistance training significantly de-creased BMI (31.32 kg/m2 versus 29.73 kg/m2 , P=0.0001), weight body (80.5kg versus 76.25kg, P=0.0001), WHR (0.93 versus0.89, P=0.0001 ) and body fat percent (27.48 versus 24.85, P=0.0001) in EG. Statistically significant differences were not seen in leptin (P=0.939), insulin (P=0.336), glucose (P=0.264) and insulin resistance (P=0.306) between CG and EG.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that , there was no significant difference in leptin levels and insulin resistance between the control and experimental groups, after 8 weeks of resistance training.

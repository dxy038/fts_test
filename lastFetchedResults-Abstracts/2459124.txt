<p><strong>Background: </strong><em>Naegleria </em>is a free-living amoeba, and pathogenic <em>Naegleria </em>may pose a health risk to people exposed to recreational water. Our objective in this study was to determine if there are pathogenic amoebae in environmental water samples from Changchun, Northeastern China.</p><p><strong>Methods: </strong>During July to September 2012, a total of 70 water samples were collected from Changchun, Northeastern China, and <em>Naegleria </em>was enriched by in vitro culture and detected by PCR using <em>Naegleria </em>genus-specific primers. Re-sulting PCR products were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed to identify <em>Naegleria </em>species.</p><p><strong>Results: </strong><em>Naegleria </em>was detected in 65 (92.9%) of 70 water samples. DNA se-quence and phylogenetic analyses based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequences revealed four <em>Naegleria </em>species, including <em>N. pagei </em>(n = 24) and <em>N. Australiensis </em>(n = 18), <em>N. clarki </em>(n = 13) and <em>N. gruberi </em>(n = 10), in which <em>N. australiensis </em>is pathogenic to mice. But the pathogenic species <em>N. fowleri </em>was not detected.</p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>This is the first report on <em>Naegleria </em>species in Northeastern China, showing that almost all environmental water samples were contaminated with <em>Naegleria</em>, including <em>N. pagei</em>, <em>N. Australiensis</em>, <em>N. clarki </em>and <em>N. gruberi</em>, which should be considered a potential public health threat.

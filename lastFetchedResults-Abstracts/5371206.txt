In this paper we present an industrial development of a wireless sensors network technology called OCARItrade. It targets applications in harsh environments in power plants and in warships. OCARI is a radio communication technology that supports mesh topology and power-aware ad hoc routing protocol aiming at maximizing the network lifetime. It is based on IEEE 802.15.4 PITY layer with full deterministic MAC layer for time-constrained communication. During the non time constrained communication period, its ad hoc routing strategy uses an energy-aware OLSR proactive protocol. OCARI application layer is based on ZigBee APS and APL primitives and profiles to provide a maximum compatibility with ZigBee applications. To fully assess this technology, extensive tests will be done in industrial facility at EDIT R&amp;D as well as at DCNS. Our objective is then to promote this specification as an open standard of industrial wireless technology.

A wireless Mesh network is a fully autonomous local wireless network where the primary objective is to provide internet access to the nodes. Different types of devices may be connected to network using local router, switches or End to End wireless connection. Such a network contains access points called Mesh routers, internet gateway and wireless nodes. These nodes can either get connected with internet through a path or through access point or can even communicate with other nodes in the network. Therefore mesh network comprises of different devices. A Multi-radio mesh network is one where Mesh routers connect to different types of LANs for instance 802.11b and Ethernet. Routing is a complex issue in such a network. A node may receive signal from more than one router of different types. In such a case determining the most appropriate router through signal checking and then switching next hop to the best router is a critical issue in WMN. In this work we propose a local repair on AODV based on Signal Strength with the aid of Vertical Handoff for Multi Radio Mesh Network. We simulate proposed technique with Omnet 4.2 using INET framework and show that the system improves network performance to several fold against a re-route discovery based technique.

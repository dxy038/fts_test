In fusion materials, irradiation of 14 MeV neutrons produces He and H atoms at a high generation rate. The objective of this study is to clarify synergistic effects of He and H on microstructural evolution in pure vanadium and two vanadium alloys including candidate ternary alloy V–5Cr–5Ti. The specimens are irradiated with 12 MeV Ni3+ ions at 873 K with simultaneous implantation of 1 MeV He+ and 350 keV H+ ions. Helium and hydrogen implantation ratios are independently controlled at two different He/dpa and H/dpa rates. Dual beam irradiation with heavy ions and He ions or H ions, and single beam irradiation experiments are also performed. Triple beam irradiation strongly enhances growth of cavities and swelling in pure vanadium compared with those under dual beam irradiation with He and single beam irradiation, whereas simultaneous implantation of H without He does not affect cavity growth and swelling. In V–5Cr–5Ti alloy, no cavities are detected without implantation of He. However, Ni, He and H triple beam irradiation is found to enhance swelling. These results are discussed in terms of dislocation and cavity evolution in the irradiated vanadium alloys.

Nowadays, the consumer of energy has the concern in operating with a value of power factor inside of a value stipulated by the energy concessionaries. It is know that the power factor is related with the displacement power factor and the total harmonic distortion. The present work has as main objective the development and implementation of a linear compensator of displacement power factor objectifying to attenuate the negative impact traditionally caused by the discrete control of the reactive power at the fundamental frequency. In this work, the implementation of a compensator is made using a static compensation structure of reactive power (static VAr compensator - SVC) called TCR-FC (thyristor controlled reactor-fixed capacitor). The prototype of this kind of SVC is composed by a fixed capacitor (FC) in parallel with a fixed reactor in series with a bidirectional ac thyristor valve (or switch) (TCR). The proposed structure can be a single-phase or three-phase compensator. In the three-phase configuration, the compensator can be connected in wye or delta. The development of a linear control of reactive power can solve problems generated by the frequent switching of capacitor banks and makes possible the dynamic compensation of the flow of reactive power in the electrical system.

In the present world of wireless technology, many algorithms like RC5, DES and AES are available for sending and receiving the information. But all these algorithms are not sufficient to provide the security and data confidentiality. The objective of this paper is to overcome the drawbacks of various other algorithms such as RC5, DES and AES using single key &amp; to enhance the security of the data transfer over the network. To accomplish this we have arrived at the idea of data encryption using multiple keys. A new FPGA based advanced encryption Standard (AES) -192 with multiple keys encryption is proposed in this paper. In our present work, we have proposed new method which increases the security, Data confidentiality and efficiency of encryption when compared to other algorithms. The cryptographic algorithm, which is in use, is static i.e. only one of the standard algorithms is used at a time and uses only one key throughout the conversation. If same key is continuously used, the crypto analyzers may crack the code or find out the encryption method and may intrude or spy or hack the confidential data. This necessitates a robust encryption technique. This work highlights one of the novel approaches of an implementation of a highly secured cryptic algorithm in FPGA, which makes near impossible for data theft. We have used multiple keys for encryption and the data can be protected effectively.

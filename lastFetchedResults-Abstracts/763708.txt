Backgroud & Objective: Infection of the full-thickness burns due to necrotic tissues is one of the important problems in patients with deep burns. The proteolytic properties of kiwifruit that is used for debridment necrotic tissues also can be effects on the infection of burns. This study assesses topical effectiveness of Kiwifruit on the infections of full-thickness burns in male rats.
Material & Methods: This experimental study was performed on 10 Wistar rats. After anesthesia with ketamin and xylosine, both flanks of rats were shaved. Then full thickness burns with 3cm diameter were produced by boiling water for 10 seconds. The Rats were divided into 3 groups randomly. Right side of the first group was treated by kiwifruit and other side by Elase pomade and second group right side by kiwifruit or Elase pomade and the other side was control group 1 and third group were not received treatment. Evaluation of infection of burn was done by clinical assessment scale with validity and reliability. 
Results: The results showed that none sign of infection was registered during kiwifruit debridement time ( 5/7days ). Also this difference was significant with Elase group (p < 0/001). On the other hand there was no significant difference between control groups with Elase groups. 
Conclusion: Regarding to the result of research, using kiwifruit not only has preventive effects on burns infection but also can accelerate debridement time.

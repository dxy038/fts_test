Coded cooperation (CC) allowing a pair of users to help each other with relaying part of partnerÂ´s data is investigated to extend wireless channel reach by cooperative diversity. Taking advantage of a bidirectional property of data flows, instead of transmitting the each packet from each user in the second phase of CC, we propose to broadcast a joint packet with XOR-gated information of the two second packets from both users. The throughput is increased and the quality is also improved based on mathematical analysis and simulation.

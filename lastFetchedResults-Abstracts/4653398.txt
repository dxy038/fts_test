The key shortcoming of traditional e-learning systems is that the learning they promote is not adaptive. This paper analyses the e-learning activity of individuals with dyslexia and proposes an innovative design for an e-learning system. This new system is user-centric and interactive based on information about the user´s learning preferences. The proposed system design employs a multi-layer architecture, including a presentation layer, an adaption layer, a learning management system layer, an application server layer and a database layer. The learning management system layer contains all the possible systems that provide resources to support the learning process, hence improving the system´s reusability. The adaption layer provides the system´s adaptive technique functionality, which makes it more intelligent and adaptive - the main objective of this research.

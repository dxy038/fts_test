Ambiguity and difficulty in quantification characterize the evaluation of Science Popularization Talents in China. Based on the summary of the domestic and abroad research results and a professional interview, this paper exploits China´s Science Popularization Talents scale, which covers three Dimensions and includes 16 abilities. The three dimensions consist of sense of science popularization, ability of communicating science and technology and scientific spirit. Also, a fuzzy linguistic evaluation scale index is defined in this paper and its corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers are given as well. Then, a generalized induced ordered weighted averaging (GIOWA) operator is used for aggregation to complete the evaluation of Science Popularization Talents´ ability. The evaluation index system provides an objective reference for the selection, check-up and training of Science Popularization Talents, and its validity is verified via empirical example.

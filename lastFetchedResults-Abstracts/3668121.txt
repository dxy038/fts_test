We experimentally investigate the simultaneous all-optical signal processing of two 40-Gb/s wavelength-division-multiplexing optical streams spaced by 5 nm using self-phase modulation and offset filtering in a single highly nonlinear fiber to achieve a 2R optical regeneration. Using a bidirectional configuration, we demonstrate efficient mitigation of the interchannel crosstalk. We experimentally observe no degradation of the regenerator performance arising from the presence of the second channel as compared to the single-channel case.

This paper describes a modified structural dynamics model for aeroelastic analysis of high-aspect-ratio wings undergoing large deformation behavior. To achieve this objective, a moderate deflection beam model is modified with some important large deflection terms and then coupled with a state space unsteady aerodynamics model. Finite element method is used to discretize the equations of motion. A dynamic perturbation equation about a nonlinear static equilibrium is applied to determine the flutter boundary. The obtained results show good agreement in comparison with other existing data such as high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) wing and Goland wing. It is found that the present aeroelastic tool have a good agreement in comparison with valid researches and also considering the effect of the geometric structural nonlinearity and higher order nonlinear terms on the flutter boundary determination is very significant.

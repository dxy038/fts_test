This research designs and realizes a zero-voltage switching (ZVS) three-phase DC-DC buck/boost converter that reduces the current ripple, switching losses and increases converter efficiency. The size and cost can be reduced when the proposed converter is designed with the coupled inductor scheme. This paper describes a three-phase DC-DC buck/boost converter with the coupled inductor and ZVS soft switching operation under different inductor current conduction modes. Simulation and experimental results are employed compare the performance of the proposed three-phase bidirectional converter in the PV system under battery charge and discharge operating modes for energy storage systems.

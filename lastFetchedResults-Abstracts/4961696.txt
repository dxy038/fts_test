In this paper we propose a initial controller for Youla parameterization defined by the convex combination of the two initial controllers such as H2 and Hinfin. Our objective is to design a controller stabilizing the system with defined several specifications via LMI optimization for an multi-objective optimization of the output feedback design in discrete time and use different Lyapunov functions. Another objective of this work is to reduce the LMI conservatism.

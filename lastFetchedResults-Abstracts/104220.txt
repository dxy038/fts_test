Recently, the Bell Laboratories layered space time (BLAST) architecture with multiple transmit and multiple receive (MTMR) antennas has been investigated to realize high data rates in wireless communications. It is understood that the ordering is crucial for good performance to alleviate the effect of error propagation. However, the optimal ordering requires a higher computational complexity. To avoid this difficulty, we propose a bidirectional BLAST receiver that can mitigate the error propagation problem without the optimal ordering. It is shown that the bidirectional BLAST receiver can perform better with a lower computational complexity.

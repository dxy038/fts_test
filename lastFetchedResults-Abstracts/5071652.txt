The design of wireless sensor networks for detection applications is a challenging task. On one hand, classical work on decentralized detection does not consider practical wireless sensor networks. On the other hand, practical sensor network design approaches that treat the signal processing and communication aspects of the sensor network separately result in sub optimal detection performance because network resources are not allocated efficiently. In this work, we attempt to cross the gap between theoretical decentralized detection work and practical sensor network implementations. We consider a cross-layer approach, where the quality of information, channel state information, and residual energy information are included in the design process of tree-topology sensor networks. The design objective is to specify which sensors should contribute to a given detection task, and to calculate the relevant communication parameters. We compare two design schemes: (1) direct transmission, where raw data are transmitted to the fusion center without compression, and (2) in-network processing, where data is quantized before transmission. For both schemes, we design the optimal transmission control policy that coordinates the communication between sensor nodes and the fusion center. We show the performance improvement for the proposed design schemes over the classical decoupled and maximum throughput design approaches.

In this paper, the attribute recognition model was used to identify indoor air quality evaluation. The objective weighting method of variation coefficient and entropy method were also used to determine the weights of evaluate indicators. Then this model was used in four buildings, the evaluate result was in line with the actual situation. This attribute recognition model is fully applicable and feasible, and it can be a theoretical basis to evaluate the whole indoor environment and provide a quantifiable theoretical basis for the improving measures.

The objective of this paper is to prove the
possibility to produce single side buffered substrates for
coated conductors. We report for the first time the production
of highly textured NiW/La2Zr2O7/CeO2 system by
all-chemical solution deposition means using an in-house
built drop-on-demand ink-jet printer. Lanthanum zirconate
precursor ink was produced using lanthanum acetate and
zirconium n-propoxide modified with propionic and acetic
acid, respectively, and diluted with methanol. Cerium
oxide precursor ink was prepared using cerium acetylacetonate
dissolved in acetylacetone and diluted in methanol.
Optimized ink jet control parameters (inter-droplet
distance, nozzle opening time and pressure in the chamber)
allowed the deposition of homogeneous highly textured
films with a thickness of approximately 150â€“200 nm at
speeds as high as 27 cm/min. La2Zr2O7 film showed in
plane and out of plane misalignment of 6.6  and 7.4 ,
respectively, whereas values obtained for CeO2 were 7.8 
and 8.1 , respectively. This study represents a step forward
in the production of reel-to-reel coated conductors in an
efficient and economic way.

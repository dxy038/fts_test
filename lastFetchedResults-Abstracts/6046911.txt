The major objective of this system is to provide decision support for process control in PCB assembly. The system will be expected to have the abilities to accommodate environmental and process variability and to learn from past successful experience. The major methodologies used in the system are statistical process control (SPC), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and expert systems (ESs)

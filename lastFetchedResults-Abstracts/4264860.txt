We consider the combined control of mobile stations´ transmitter power and bit rate in CDMA microcells. The objective is to maximize the number of QoS-satisfied mobile users. We discuss the additional aid offered by the combined scheme over the power-only method in utilizing the scarce radio resources efficiently. Next, we review the problems associated with the microcellular environment and users´ mobility in a Manhattan-like street grid. We demonstrate through system level simulations the significant enhancements over the established power-only control scheme. Both spectrum efficiency and system capacity are improved for multimedia services having diverse QoS requirements

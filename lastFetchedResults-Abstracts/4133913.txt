A novel periodic leaky-wave antenna for broadside radiation with horizontally polarized omnidirectional pattern is proposed, designed and demonstrated experimentally. The objective is to achieve a horizontally polarized omnidirectional antenna array with highly directive beam. The proposed structure is based on combining the rotating electric field method and a leaky-wave antenna design. By properly designing a unit cell with a pair of crossed dipoles spaced at a distance approximately equal to &#955;<sub>g</sub>/4 at the center frequency, not only omnidirectional radiation pattern with horizontal polarization is obtained by crossed dipoles fed in phase quadrature, but also the open-stopband effect exhibited at broadside scan is significantly reduced. The analysis and design of this structure are performed on the basis of a simple equivalent network model. A finite structure formed by 16-unit cell (32-element) for broadside beam is developed at the 2.4 GHz band, which offers a horizontally polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern with enhanced gain of 9.9-10.6 dBi and measured radiation efficiency of 90% for the covering bands.

This study was conducted in order to evaluate the effect of using Continuous Care Model on sleep quality in chemical warfare victims with bronchiolitis obliterans.
Methods & Materials: A total of 62 chemical warfare victims with bronchiolitis obliterans were recruited to the study. The participants were randomly allocated to experimental and control groups. The Continuous Care Model was used to experimental group for a period of two months. The quality of sleep was measured using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) before and after the intervention in both study groups. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-test, and paired t-test in the SPSS-version 15.

Tuberculosis is more prevalent among renal transplant recipient than general population. Immunosuppressive drugs and corticosteroids are the most important causes of the disease. Although extra pulmonary tuberculosis constitute about 40% of the cases pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common clinical presentation. Isolated gastrointestinal tuberculosis is rare in these patients. This study presents a case of intestinal tuberculosis in a renal transplant recipient who died of intestinal perforation. Another interesting point of the case is development of tuberculosis after 18 years of transplantation. Previous studies showed the median interval of 18 months. The patient had received long-term immunosuppressive drugs as well as corticosteroid.

This article presents the results of the first digital terrestrial television field trials and coverage measurements in Spain. First of all the VIDITER project is presented. The main objective of this work is to study the behavior of a whole digital terrestrial television network, from source coding up to the final signal reception. At this point, the experimental network installed in Madrid is described. Next, the measurement campaign is explained, first, by describing the network configuration used for these first field trials, and then, paying attention to the criteria used to select the measurement points and the parameter set to be tested. Some of the results obtained are shown as a first approach to the figures needed to develop and plan a fully operational digital terrestrial television service

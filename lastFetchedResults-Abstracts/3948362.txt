A family of silicon test chips for use in making diagnostic measurements during electronics assembly has been developed. These assembly test chips (ATCs) contain sensors that measure a number of variables associated with assembled IC degradation, including the degree of integrated circuit (IC) corrosion, handling damage, electrostatic discharge threat, moisture or humidity, mechanical stress, mobile ion density, bond pad cratering, and high-speed logic degradation. The chips in the ATC family are intended to give manufacturing feedback in four ways: direct feedback in evaluation of an assembly manufacturing line in an objective, nonintrusive way; before and after comparisons on an assembly production line when an individual process, material, or piece of equipment has been changed; resident lifetime monitor for system package aging and ongoing reliability projection; and thermal, mechanical, DC electrical, and high-frequency mock-up evaluation of packaging (including multichip) schemes

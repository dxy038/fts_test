Objective: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of metacognitive beliefs and perfectionism with test anxiety among students.&nbsp;
Methods: The present study was a cross sectional research. Study population comprised all male and female students of Kermanshah City. A total of 440 students (200 males and 240 females, aged 17-18 years) in the third or fourth grade of Kermanshah high schools (academic year 2015-2016) were selected by random cluster sampling method. The data were collected using test anxiety inventory, metacognitions questionnaire, and multidimensional perfectionism scale. For analyzing the data, we used analysis of regression method.&nbsp;
Results: There were significant positive correlations between the test anxiety with cognitive confidence (r = 0.29, P < 0.01), positive beliefs (r = 0.10, P < 0.05), cognitive self-consciousness (r = 0.35, P < 0.01), uncontrollability and danger of thoughts (r = 0.45, P < 0.01), and need to control thoughts (r = 0.16, P < 0.05). Also, there was significant positive correlations between test anxiety with concern over mistakes (r = 0.36, P < 0.01), doubts about actions (r = 0.41, P < 0.01), parental expectations (r = 0.23, P < 0.01), parental criticism (r = 0.33, P < 0.01), personal standards (r = 0.40, P < 0.01) and organization (r = 0.16, P < 0.05). Moreover, analysis of regression indicated metacognitive beliefs and perfectionism are predictors of test anxiety.&nbsp;
Conclusion: Results of this study support the metacognitive model of test anxiety and showed that people&rsquo;s metacognitive beliefs have important role in test anxiety. Also, results indicated perfectionist individuals are vulnerable for test anxiety.

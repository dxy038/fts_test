Objective: To review the effectiveness and safety of stroke unit of integrative medicine for post stroke comorbid anxiety and depression (PSCAD) systematically. Methods: Electronic databases of MEDLINE, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database, Wan-fang Database, CNKI Database were handled by computer retrieval, and Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine were manually searched for papers of randomized controlled trial (RCT) on Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) plus pharmacotherapy versus pharmacotherapy in treating PSCAD. In accordance with the inclusion criteria, two reviewers independently screened the related literatures, assessed the risk of bias and extracted the literature data, while the software of RevMan5.2.6 was used for the combining data analysis. Results: A total of 25 studies involving 2,044 patients were identified for this review. Meta-analysis results indicated that the integrative group i.e. CHM plus pharmacotherapy group showed more effective for PSCAD (OR=3.63, 95%CI (2.67, 4.95)), lower HAMD (Hamilton depression scale) score (WMD=-3.84, 95%CI (-4.66, -3.02)), and less adverse events (OR=0.71, 95%CI (0.51, 0.97)) compared with the control group i.e. routine pharmacotherapy group. Conclusion: The meta-analysis indicated that the integrative medicine treatment could be more helpful in strengthening the clinical efficacy and reducing the incidence of adverse events in the treatment of PSCAD compared with routine pharmacotherapy. However, due to the small sample size of included trials and the relatively low-rating quality in the majority of studies, further large-scale, multi-center and rigorously-designed trials should be required to confirm the effectiveness and safety of integrative medicine for PSCAD.

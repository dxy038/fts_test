Restoration of a power system after a complete blackout is a very important issue to the safety of the power system. Reasonable black start schemes are necessary to restore the power system as soon as possible. Based on data envelopment analysis, a new strategy for assessing black start schemes is proposed in this paper. Schemes´ technical verification is taken into consideration in the process of the assessment. Whether a scheme is effective is defined by employing its input and output indexes´ values entirely. The application to a practical power system verifies that the method could provide dispatchers more comprehensive and objective decision references

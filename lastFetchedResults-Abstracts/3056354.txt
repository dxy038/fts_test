Human cells from different tissue types, and at different stages of disease, present slight differences in their infrared (IR) absorption spectra. Thus, IR spectroscopy offers the possibility of analyzing individual cells, or biopsy sections of tissues, for the presence of disease, based on totally objective measurements and computer-based analysis of the spectral information.

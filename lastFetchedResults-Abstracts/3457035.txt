The author describes many of the various approaches which have been used in designing display devices. The emphasis is on device configuration and performance rather than on the physics of the glow discharge. There are three aspects of the physics the author mentions as being unusual to many plasma physicists: the use of priming in display-scanning mechanisms, the use of the Townsend discharge in a positive column for high output and efficacy, and the use of a double-layer sheath as a scannable source of electrons. The adroit use of priming can reduce the number of drive circuits required-an advantage unique in the display art to plasma devices. The gas discharge can be used as a source of electrons which can then excite cathodoluminescent phosphors in a variety of colors. It can also be used as a selection means for liquid-crystal displays. A wide variety of device configurations, using both unidirectional and bidirectional pulse excitations, is described

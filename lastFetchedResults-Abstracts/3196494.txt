The objective of this study is to examine why and how operators usually achieve a normal operational level. The author focuses on Threat and Error Management (TEM) in aviation as a key concept for finding an answer. Following this approach, the author conducted a participant observation of railway drivers and explored the above-stated question with reference to some of the behaviour he observed. The author uses a model to suggest that the daily routine by which operators achieve normal operation is guided by their own definitions of work and the negative emotions connected with those. It is further suggested that operators´ definitions of work are regulated by their organisations´ social environments and are intimately related to the satisfaction of the operators´ needs for competence and relatedness.

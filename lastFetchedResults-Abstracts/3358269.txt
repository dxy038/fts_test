Mobile communication has become an essential information exchange platform for today\Â´s enterprise and government organizations. Their employees extensively use mobile devices to support their job activities while they are on the move. Organizations need to secure mobile devices as they secure wired devices. Organizations while securing mobile devices, also have to secure themselves from mobile devices as these devices are easily prone to attacks. We introduce the idea of "location-attack protection" where traffic from high cyber-crime locations (country, state, city, etc.) can be completely blocked. The main objective of this paper is to build a Flexible Perimeter Protection Framework (FPPF) that provides perimeter protection policies that react to dynamic changes, which is quite frequent in mobile setups and respect organizational objectives such as preferential treatment, yet enforce overall security objectives of organizations.

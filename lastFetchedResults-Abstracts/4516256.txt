The increase of electrical loads in automobiles over the last several decades has prompted the automobile industry to consider a higher electrical system voltage of 42 V. However, during the short-term transition period, the new 42 V and the old 14 V electrical systems would coexist in automobiles, requiring a bidirectional DC-DC converter to regulate power flow between the two buses. This paper describes the optimization of a novel ZVS-ZCS Cuk converter with zero-ripple in input and output currents and the design of a robust H<sub>&#8734;</sub> average-current controller. Computer simulations are used to confirm the design of the converter and the feedback controller. The simulation results are verified by hardware implementation.

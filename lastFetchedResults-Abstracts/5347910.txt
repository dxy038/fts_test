The objective of this study is to develop a new operation support system for a refuse incineration plant which is based on quantitative estimation of internal states of a plant. It is important, for stable operation of a plant, to comprehend the quantity of refuse residing in the furnace and the degree of refuse combustion. In this system, these process values of a plant can be estimated quantitatively by combination of the method of a dynamic characteristic analysis modeling and the method of an expert system. Furthermore, the system is applied to an actual plant

‘Tenderness’ has been an important sensory characteristic for beef, although ‘tenderness’ has not been commonly defined. On the other hand, ISO5492:1992 provides internationally established vocabularies for sensory analysis with simple definition. The aim of this study was texture characterization for three beef muscles cooked to four end-point temperatures using ISO5492:1992 texture terms in Japanese to develop objective sensory evaluation terms for beef texture other than ‘tenderness.’ Longissimus, semitendinosus, and psoas major muscles harvested from three Holstein steers were cooked to 45, 60, 72, and 92 °C end-point temperatures and evaluated by a trained sensory panel. Correspondence analysis indicated that the ‘chewiness’ and ‘hardness’ defined in ISO5492 were distinguished in each muscle. Changes in the ‘chewiness’ and ‘hardness’ qualities during cooking were different from each other. These findings suggest that both ‘chewiness’ and ‘hardness’ as defined in ISO5492:1992 should be evaluated simultaneously to determine the sensory texture of beef.

–Bratzler shear force values (WBSFVs) were also correlated with ISO5492 ‘chewiness.’ This finding suggests that WBSFV indicates ISO5492 ‘chewiness’ rather than undefined ‘tenderness.’

We start by reviewing the pattern of a seismic signal. Then, we apply a time-frequency analysis to the signal by means of the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) in order to obtain instantaneous frequency (if) information. Based on the time-frequency behavior, we estimate a pattern to characterize the seismic signal. At the same time, we analyze the energy signal envelope, which is the derivative of the filtered cumulative energy. With the energy behavior, we estimate the different transitions along the seismic signal. The main objective of this work is characterization of seismic signals, and detection above a specific level of energy, so that, we can eventually build a seismic alarm

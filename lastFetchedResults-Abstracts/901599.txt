       This paper with emphasising on religious context of Iranian society, has a critical interpretation which considers psychological damages as an inevitable consequence of modernity(with integrated sociological and psychological approach) attempts to address youth mental health issues. In this regard, this paper with constructing mental aspects (belief and emotional) objective (ritual and outcome) of religiosity and special attention to personalizing social relationship(social isolation variable) analyses the role of these factors. This research is an analytical descriptive study with simple random sampling method on a sample of 345 students of Islamic Azad University of Sirjan. Findings suggest that studentsâ€™ mental health is not as good as mentioned before. Moreover, results indicate a positive and significant impact of mental aspects in contrary to apparent aspects of religiosity on the mental health. In addition, factors such as social isolation, gender, marital status had impact on mental health as well.

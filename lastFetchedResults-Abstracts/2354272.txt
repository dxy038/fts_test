Objective: Melatonin, the chief secretory product of the pineal gland, regulates dynamic
physiological adaptations that occur in seasonally breeding mammals as a response to
changes in daylight hours. Because of the presence of melatonin in semen and the membrane
melatonin receptor in spermatozoa, the impact of melatonin on the regulation of
male infertility is still questionable. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of
endogenous melatonin on human semen parameters (sperm concentration, motility and
normal morphology), DNA fragmentation (DF) and nuclear maturity.
Materials and Methods: In this clinical prospective study, semen samples from 75 infertile
men were routinely analyzed and assessed for melatonin and total antioxidant capacity
(TAC) levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and colorimetric
assay kits, respectively. DF was examined by the sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) test.
Acidic aniline blue staining was used to detect chromatin defects in the sperm nuclei.
Results: There was no significant correlation between seminal plasma melatonin and
TAC with sperm parameters and nuclear maturity. However, we observed a positive
significant correlation between DF and melatonin level (r=0.273, P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Melatonin in seminal plasma is positively correlated with damaged sperm
DNA of infertile patients. The mechanism of this phenomenon needs further study.

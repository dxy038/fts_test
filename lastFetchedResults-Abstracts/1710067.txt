This paper evaluates wet-chemical pre-treatments (alkaline etching, anodising) and a plasma treatment for structural bonding of titanium (Ti6Al4V). The main objective of this study is the comparison of the applicability of the plasma pre-treatment to wet-chemical treatments on titanium for structural bonding. In this context, an atmospheric pressure plasma device was used to deposit thin functional films from hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) precursor on titanium.

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to assess the chemical composition of the surface after different pre-treatments on the titanium substrate, while the morphology and the film thickness were investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The adhesion properties on titanium were evaluated by means of a wedge test in hot/wet conditions. After bonding tests the fracture surface and the failure loci were analysed.

a long arc plasma generator and HMDSO precursor almost stoichiometric SiO2 coatings were obtained on the titanium substrate. These coatings exhibit good long-term durability and bond strength compared to an alkaline etching in the wedge test. The investigated anodising process leads to oxide layers revealing a highly porous nanostructure. In contrast to the alkaline etching, the plasma derived coatings and the oxide layer produced by the anodising process exhibit a higher micro, respectively nano roughness, and hence a better long-term durability.

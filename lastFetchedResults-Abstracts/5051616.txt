The primary objective of building control systems is to provide comfortable, quality air to the building interior, while minimizing heating and cooling loads and providing a high degree of reliability. Improved process monitoring and fault detection is a promising approach for meeting this objective. In this paper, the feasibility of using statistical quality control (SQC) charts for process monitoring in HVAC applications is evaluated via a simulation study for a common subsystem, an air heating coil.

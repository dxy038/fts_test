The objective of the study is to describe a new approach of combining quantum dots technology with anti-cancer drug therapy. In this regard, we communicate the preliminary research on the synthesis of blue-light emitting ZnO quantum dots (QDs) combined with biodegradable chitosan (N-acetylglucosamine) for tumor-targeted drug delivery. The results presented here indicate that the proposed new generation of QDs loaded with anti-cancer agents and encapsulated with biocompatible polymer represent a potential platform to deliver tumor-targeted drugs and document the delivery process, if desired. Non-toxic water-dispersed ZnO QDs with long-term fluorescence stability were synthesized by a chemical hydrolysis method, encapsulated with chitosan and loaded with anti-cancer drug. Chitosan enhanced the stability of the QDs because of the hydrophilicity and cationic charge of chitosan. The study points toward the application of water-dispersed ZnO QDs with long-term fluorescence stability for design of new drug release carrier.

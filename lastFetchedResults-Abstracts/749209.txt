Following a critical review of Khachaturian’s and other diagnostic criteria of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), it is concluded that new, more rigorous criteria are needed. These criteria must be based on objective data, and they should distinguish subjects with mild cognitive impairment from those with normal cognition. Moreover, they should be easy to use. A multicenter study is proposed and outlined to examine the pathology of 3 groups of 20 archival or newly obtained subjects. The three groups should include subjects who are cognitively intact, slightly impaired, and affected by definite AD, as determined by appropriate and timely cognitive tests.

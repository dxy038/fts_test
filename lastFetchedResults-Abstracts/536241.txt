Prioritized flow control is a type of QoS provisioning in which each class is provided a different QoS byassigning priority to one class over another in terms of allocating resources. It is an effective means toprovide service differentiation to different class of service in mobile ad hoc networks. So the objective is toachieve a desired level of service to high-priority flows so that the wireless medium is completely utilizedusing adaptive rate control. In this paper, we propose to design QoS architecture for BandwidthManagement and Rate Control in MANET. Our proposed QoS architecture contains an adaptivebandwidth management technique which measures the available bandwidth at each node in real-time andit is then propagated on demand by the QoS routing protocol. The source nodes perform call admissioncontrol for different priority of flows based on the bandwidth information provided by the QoS routing. The network bandwidth utilization is monitored continuously and network congestion is detected inadvance. Then a rate control mechanism is used to regulate best-effort traffic.

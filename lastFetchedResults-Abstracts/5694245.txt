An intelligent battery equalization scheme is presented, based on and accordingly designed as fuzzy logic controlled battery equalization controller (FLC-BEC). It can effectively reduce equalization time. The proposed individual cell equalization (ICE) scheme is a bidirectional dc-dc converter, based on the Cuk converter operated at discontinuous inductor current mode (DICM). A state space approach is adopted to inspect the stability of the proposed FLC-BEC. Matlab/Simulink simulation and experimental results can be used to verify the stability of FLC-BEC. In this article, an 8-bit micro-controller unit (MCU) is used to accomplish the FLC-BEC, which can reduce volume and complexity of the hardware used for the FLC-BEC.

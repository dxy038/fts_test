This paper presents an integrated traction machine and converter topology that has bidirectional power flow capability between an electric vehicle and the DC or AC supply or grid. The inductances of the traction motor windings are used for bi-directional converter operation to transfer power eliminating the need for extra inductors for the charger and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) converter operation. The electric powertrain system size and weight can be minimized with this approach. The concept has been analyzed with finite element coupled simulation with dynamic analysis software. Experimental results are also provided with an electric machine. The interleaving technique has been used with the inductors to share the current and reduce the converter switching stresses. The proposed integrated converter can operate in the traction mode and in the bidirectional power flow mode when energy can be transferred between the vehicle and the DC or single phase AC supply.

An analytical method for general floorplan design and optimization is proposed. This method is based on a mixed integer programming model and application of a standard mathematical software. The method allows arbitrary combinations of rigid and flexible modules. Various objective functions such as chip area, interconnection length, timing delays or any combination of them are permitted. Routing space is estimated by the global router. Experimental data are provided

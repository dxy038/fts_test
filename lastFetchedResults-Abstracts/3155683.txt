Superconducting fault current limiters (SFCL) are one of the most effective equipments in enhancement of power quality phenomenon including voltage sag, harmonics and voltage unbalance. This paper presents an improved algorithm for multi-objective optimization and design of high temperature superconducting (HTS) fault current limiters (FCL) based on analytical hierarchy process (AHP). To design a SFCL, it is necessary to simulate and define electrical, magnetic and thermal properties in form of equivalent circuits and mathematical models. However, any change in SFCL parameters: dimension, resistance, and operating temperature can affect the limiting mode, quench time, and restore time. Hence, there is a compromise for an optimal design. This paper reports the simulation results for electrical and thermal characteristics of a resistive SFCL from which optimized objectives such as; maximizing limiting impedance, minimizing current peaks, minimizing quench and restore times, and minimizing limiter and cooling system cost was obtained using multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and AHP.

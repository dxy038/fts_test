There has been some work in recent years to produce MEMS speakers. Geometries have included diaphragm structures, cantilever beams, and thermally actuated domes. The diaphragm skeleton is built out of the metal and glass layers of the CMOS chip, greatly reducing the layering ad patterning required, compared to other MEMS designs. "Brute multiplicity" is useful to circumvent the poor linearity of the individual elements; the number of elements determines the distortion of the total sound produced, not the quality of the transducer. The objective of this research focused on design a new way to produce the sound in rang of human hearing using micro speaker (on MEMS scale) and study concerned about possibility of MEMS speaker fabrication.

In this paper, we consider the single machine scheduling problem with a fixed non-availability interval. The objective is to minimize the makespan. Our work aims at the comparison of Jackson´s schedule to the optimal and the worst solutions in order to establish the differential approximation ratio for this problem. The analysis of Jackson´s rule shows that this rule cannot yield a constant differential approximation in the general case.

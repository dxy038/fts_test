Presents a new family of conjugate gradient algorithms. This family originates in the algorithms provided by Wolfe and Lemarechal for nondifferentiable problems. It is shown that the Wolfe-Lemarechal algorithm is identical to the Fletcher-Reeves algorithm when the objective function is smooth and when line searches are exact. The convergence properties of the new algorithms are investigated. One of them is globally convergent under minimum requirements on the directional minimization

Summary form only given: Photonic crystals (PhC) or photonic bandgap (PBG) structures and photonic structures based on them represent nowadays very promising structures of artificial origin, as opposed to "standard" structures in nature. They can indeed exhibit very specific properties and characteristics that can be very difficult (or even impossible) to realise by other means, mainly due to the existence of allowed and forbidden photonic frequency bands. Clearly, development and testing of numerical modelling tools on one side, and analysis and design of novel perspective PhC-based structures on the other side, are strongly interconnected. Various PhC modelling methods have been studied and applied to PhC analysis. This is demonstrated on the several selected examples chosen. To study behavior and properties of photonic crystals, we have used several modeling methods, namely the differential transfer matrix method (TMM, codes Taranis and Translight), bidirectional expansion and propagation method (BEP, code CAMFR), and the plane wave expansion (PWE) method (MIT MPB package). In this poster, several simple examples of modelling results will be shown and discussed, e.g. 1D and 2D PhC structure parametric modelling, linear waveguides in PhCs slabs and their optimization. Simulations have been made using both the differential form of the transfer matrix method, employing home-made code (Taranis), and also other available tools (Translight, CAMFR). Presentation of TMM and of our implementation will make part of the poster

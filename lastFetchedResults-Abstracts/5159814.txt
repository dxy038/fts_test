This paper describes a solution of flexible optimal power flow (FOPF) with automatic differentiation (AD) and interval analysis (IA) techniques without hand code for evaluating Jacobian and Hessian matrices in optimization. Another benefit using AD and IA can improve the calculating accuracy of objective function and constraints to avoid the truncation error and rounding error. The conception of flexibility design for the OPF is proposed, the flexibility means the ease of changing the systempsilas requirements with a relatively small increase in complexity and rework, and ease of utilizing to user. In this paper the flexibility of OPF includes two aspects: from program designerpsilas viewpoint, it supports different solution algorithms and conveniently extends new functions; from user viewpoint, user can easily modify and add/delete objective function and constraints in optimization. A primal dual interior point algorithm with AD and IA techniques is described in detail. Finally, some computational tests for flexibility of OPF are given and show that the proposed method of FOPF is feasible and reasonable.

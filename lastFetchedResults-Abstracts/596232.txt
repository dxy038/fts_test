New Delhi metallo-P-lactamase (NDM-1), as a broad-spectrum P-lactamase, is able to inactivate almost all P-lactams. NDM- producers have been detected in extensively pathogen worldwide. The objective of this study was to analyze the homology of NDM- 1-encoding genes based on the blaNDM-1 gene sequences downloaded from GenBank. The phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the blaNDM-1 gene sequences divided into two different branches with similarity score only 54. A common sequence of 242bps at length was extracted from branch-1, and 469bps common sequence was extracted from branch-2, respectively. The subseÂ¬quent detection of NDM-1 harboring clinical isolates with PCR and real-time PCR molecular techniques should based on the two common sequences of branch-1 and branch-2.

This paper proposes a CASE tool, the GMTool (Geographic Modelling Tool). GMTool supports a geographic object-generating process based on the analysis of cartographic documents. The GIS has become strategic in many sectors. In spite of the graphic interfaces offered by the GIS development tools, they remain inaccessible to newcomers. So, it is important to have GIS development tools. We propose a geographic object-modelling technique based on the process of generating geographic objects. The latter allows one to construct a spatial object scheme from the analysis of cartographic documents. Our objective is to replace the intuitive process of identification of the GIS objects by a process based on rules and heuristic of derivation on the basis of the analysis of cartographic documents. The prototype is implemented using Visual Basic 6 language.

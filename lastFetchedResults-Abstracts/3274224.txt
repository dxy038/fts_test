Based on the background of Lanzhou Railway Station, this paper mainly researches the planning of the station square facilities´ capacity. In order to quantity the distribution of passengers´ transfer, this paper establishes the multi-objective nonlinear programming model, and then solving it based on Lingo software. In addition, the article analyses the square transfer capacity bottlenecks and passengers´ flow organization, and presents a better transfer plan. Finally, it is necessary to prove the improvement effect. This paper deeply considers the passengers´ transfer time, distance and volume on the optimization of proportions for transfer passengers´ flows. The transfer scheme is better in the three aspects of efficiency, layout and satisfaction.

Multiobjective frequency domain design aims to find a controller that gives desirable properties to several closed loop frequency responses simultaneously. This problem may be cast as a problem of finding a controller such that the worst-case <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> norm, i.e. the largest among several <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> norms, satisfies a prespecified bound. The authors define an upper bound, the &#961; measure, for the worst-case <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub>, norm in terms of a scaled <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> cost function. The authors show that the problem of finding a controller that minimizes &#961; can be reduced to a finite dimensional convex program for the unknown scales and a standard <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> problem. The authors give affine matrix inequalities for controller synthesis when the scales are restricted to constant matrices. A numerical example is used to illustrate the advantages of the authors\Â´ formulation, over the single objective <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub>, formulation, for solving multiobjective <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> problems.

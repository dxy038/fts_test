A numerical method is described that provides the means for optimizing any objective function representing a general multilayer integrated optics waveguide. In this way, the physical parameters of the multilayer structure can be set so that the performance of the device is optimized. The method uses any standard numerical minimization algorithm in conjunction with the argument principle method. The method has been successfully applied for the optimization of a multilayer immunosensor and a TE-mode polarizer. The advantages of the method are its generality, its efficiency, its accuracy, and its applicability to a wide range of planar integrated optics devices

Power dissipation is a design limiting factor in many high-performance systems. A GaAs gate array family that can directly replace ECL with equivalent speed performance at one quarter the power dissipation is presented. The arrays have been developed in three sizes with 3 K, 5 K, and 15 K logic gates. The I/O buffers have been designed to be compatible with ECL, TTL, or GaAs. The objective of this work is to describe gate array design features and discuss the measured performance as compared to ECL.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Developing biomaterials having wound healing properties within the search of a common man is the need of hour, particularly in developing and third world countries. Keeping this objective in view we have developed a wound dressing material, in sheet form, containing fish scale collagen (FSC) and physiologically clotted fibrin (PCF), both are by products of aqua food and meat industries respectively. To impart antimicrobial properties to the composite sheet, it was incorporated with Macrotyloma uniflorum plant extract (MPE). SEM pictures have shown that FSC:PCF:MPE composite has fibrous and porous surface which helps in transportation of oxygen as well as absorbing wound fluids and their evaporation. The biomaterials have shown 100% biocompatibility and the percentage cell viability was found to be above 89%. The FSC:PCF:MPE biocomposite film with required mechanical strength, biocompatibility and antimicrobial properties can be tried as a burn/wound dressing material.

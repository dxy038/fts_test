In this study, the multiobjective H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control design method is investigated for nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion systems to minimize H<sub>&#8734;</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> performance simultaneously. In practical applications, we expect the system controller to be not only robust but also optimal. In order to combine the advantages of both the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> control, the multiobjective H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control design is proposed. The multiobjective H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control is quite different from mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control design, a constrained single objective optimization problem (SOP), which is to minimize the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance index with a given H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance constraint. The multiobjective H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control provides a less conservative solution.

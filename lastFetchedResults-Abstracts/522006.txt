Objective: Self- inflicted burn is one of the prevalent and grievous methods of suicide and encompasses different underlying reasons. Although several studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence and the underlying causes of self- inflicted burn in Iran, diverse features have been reported. This study aims at determining the prevalence of self- inflicted burn and its underlying reasons among the population over 15 years old in Iran, through a systematic review. Method: Electronic and manual search methods were applied in order to access all possible sources. Eventually, 21 studies were included in this review. Results: Among all locations where studies were conducted, the highest rates of self- inflicted burn was reported in Masjed Soleiman district. Self- inflicted burn was more prevalent among individuals in the age range of 24.9 to 27.2. Most of the attempters were female; these were mainly married housewives with low educational level. Marital and family conflicts were the most frequently reported stressors. Inadequate information resources, the existing gaps in the conducted studies, and inconsistencies among the reported self- inflicted burn statistics can be noted as limitations of this study. On the other hand, most of the studies have been performed in the western part of the country where self- inflicted burn has a higher rate, a fact that reminds us that their results can not be generalized. To date, the reasons for the higher prevalence of this method of suicide in this part of the country has remained unclear. Conclusion: Precise assessment of prevalence of mental disorders among this group is one of the existing gaps in the literature.

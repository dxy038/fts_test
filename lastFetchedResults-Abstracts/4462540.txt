Objective of this paper is to develop analytical expressions for the delay and throughput. Frequency and timing errors are significant impairments in the new generation of personal and Mobile Satellite Communication systems. Performance results show that Spread Slotted Aloha is very robust to timing and frequency uncertainties and can provide far superior performance in terms of throughput and delay, compared to Slotted Aloha

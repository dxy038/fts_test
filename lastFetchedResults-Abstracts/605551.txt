Background and Objective: Acinetobacter baumannii is an important human pathogen that has been a focus of attention in recent years.  These bacteria are a leading cause of therapeutic resistant nosocomial infections especially in burned or hospitalized patients in intensive care Units.  The aim of this study was to isolate the Acinetobacter baumannii species from the wounds of burned patients and to determine antimicrobial resistance pattern of these bacteria for selection of appropriate antibiotics.
Materials and Methods: Samples were collected from patients and transferred to the laboratory under standard conditions.  Bacteria were isolated and purified by conventional culture methods.  Identification of bacterial species was performed by standard biochemical tests.  The isolates that were identified as Acinetobacter baumannii were subsequently tested for antibiotic resistance by the disk diffusion agar method for 17 different antibiotics.  The tests were carried out on Muller Hinton agar (MHA) plates and incubated at 35?C for 18 hrs.  The minimum inhibition concentrations were determined for 5 common therapeutic antibiotics. 
Results: Out of the 65 clinical Acinetobacter baumannii isolates collected, 61 (94%) were multi drug resistant (MDR).  Ceftazidime and aztronam (98%) were the most effective antibiotics against Acinetobacter baumannii. To determine the MIC, the highest levels of antibiotic resistance were seen against ceftazidime, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
Conclusion: Our results confirm the high prevalence of Acinetobacter baumannii resistant isolates and the ensuing therapeutic problems in Iran.  Determination of the resistance patterns of these bacteria according to MIC is necessary, and it can be especially helpful in treatment of burned patients.

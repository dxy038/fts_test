The paper investigates the integration of appropriate evolutionary and adaptive search (ES&amp;AS) strategies with the various stages of the design process, i.e. conceptual, embodiment and detailed design. Rather than addressing the practical application of ES and AS techniques to complex specific engineering design problems the paper primarily attempts to identify the manner in which relevant co-operative ES and AS strategies can provide both a foundation and a framework for design activity that will satisfy the search and information requirements of the engineer throughout the design process. It is suggested that such strategies can support a range of activities from concept exploration and decision support to final product definition and optimisation. The paper is discussion-based and speculative in nature relying upon aspects of previous ES and AS research relating to the design process as a whole. The objective is to identify some areas of difficulty and assess the current and future potential benefits of successful generic AS and ES integration

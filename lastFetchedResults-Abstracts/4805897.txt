Edentulism consists in absence of natural teeth and it is a common cause for oral dysfunction, affecting oral and general health as well as overall quality of life. Dental implants are today a successful solution in oral rehabilitation. The ultimate objective of implant placement is a functional, aesthetic and durable restoration. Although others radiographic techniques are used to assessment of implant site, Dental Computed Tomography (Dental CT) is the best method for the morphological, quantitative and qualitative assessment of the available bone on potential recipient site for implant placement. These parameters can define the type of surgical procedure, type of implant or even preclude the endosseous implant placement. This paper presents the role of Dental CT with a clinical case of partial edentulism.

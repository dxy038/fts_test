The objective of this research is to develop a computational algorithm for an open tandem queue with blocking and feedback operation. No intermediate queue is allowed in the model. Only the finite queue at the first machine is allowed in the model. With given design parameters, the model generates the state transition rate matrix by utilizing the primitive matrix of the one machine with zero storage space. With this matrix, the computation time can be reduced effectively. As a model variation, a tandem queueing model with feedback operation is also discussed. Finally, the numerical results are compared to the average values of a simulation model.

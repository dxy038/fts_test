The aim of this project is to introduce clean fuel cell technology into an industrial plant located in Valladolid (Spain), to improve the whole process efficiency and reduce the environmental impact at the same time. This plant is devoted to aluminium treatment and produces a waste gas flow containing 500 m<sup>3</sup>/h of impure hydrogen, which is actually burned in a torch. The goal is to install a fuel cell generating power for the plant from that hydrogen after it has been properly purified; another important objective is to design an energy flow management system able to couple the required and the available electric power.

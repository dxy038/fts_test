The design of machines is always done based on the experience obtained by trail and error methods. In this paper, we propose a method of solving an optimal loaded-allocation (OLA) problem of simple beam which is fundamental for the strength factor in design. This model is allocation problem of concentrated load and distributed load for maximized objective function with a nonlinear loaded constraint on the support point.
In general, it is difficult to directly solve many optimization problems formulated as nonlinear integer programming (NIP) model. The application of a genetic algorithm (GA) (that uses the stochastic search method) effectively solves the combinatorial problem making it a remarkable new tool for solving any kind of problem.
In this paper, we formulate an OLA problem of a simple beam with the concentrated load, distributed load or a combination of both, as a NIP problem and solve it directly by keeping the nonlinear load constraint for support point by using improved GA. We discusse the efficiency of the propose method.

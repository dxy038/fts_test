This paper presents an analysis of existing Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) algorithms, when applied to Long Reach Passive Optical Networks (LR-PON). LR-PONs provide coverage beyond 20 Km range up to 200 Km thus paving the way for a combined metropolitan and access network. The DBA algorithm is used to efficiently share the upstream optical bandwidth among the Optical Network Units (ONU). The objective of the analysis is to identify some critical issues in designing DBAs for LR-PONs.

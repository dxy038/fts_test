We propose algorithms to address the spectrum efficiency and fairness issues of multi band multiuser Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) cognitive ad-hoc networks. To improve the transmission efficiency of the MIMO system, a cross layer antenna selection algorithm is proposed. Using the transmission efficiency results, user data rate of the cognitive ad-hoc network is determined. Objective function for the average data rate of the multi band multiuser cognitive MIMO ad-hoc network is also defined. For the average data rate objective function, primary users interference is considered as performance constraint. Finally, numerical results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed antenna selection and channel allocation algorithms.

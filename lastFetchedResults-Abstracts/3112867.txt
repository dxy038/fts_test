This paper conducts the end-to-end process of integrated system identification and discrete H<sup>&#8734;</sup> control synthesis for the CRAF spacecraft [1]. The objective is to identify modal parameters and transfer functions needed to support tuning of performance and stability for the boom-mounted High Precision Scan Platform (HPSP) Articulation/Pointing Control. The overall approach for integration of identification and control has been discussed in [2][3]. The present work conducts the discrete H<sup>&#8734;</sup> control design directly with the discrete parametric model and uncertainty overbound.

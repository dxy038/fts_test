Objective assessment of fabric wrinkledness using multifractal methodology is addressed in the paper. As a first experiment with this methodology in this application field, AATCC standard durable press rating replicas, which are used by textile experts worldwide, were photographed and then segmented using common image processing methods. The resulting skeleton images were then analyzed using the multifractal methodology.

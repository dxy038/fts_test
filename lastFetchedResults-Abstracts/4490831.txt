Evaluation of Teacher´s Performance is the important instrument of carrying out teaching management, and is important assurance of inspiring teachers to further efforts, improving teaching quality and carrying out scientific teaching management and decision. In this article we studied target system of Independent Colleges´ teacher performance evaluation setting up, how to count target weight based on AHP, multi-level matter element extension measurement evaluation model and arithmetic realization. Considering the deficiency of evaluation methods of teacher´s performance, the evaluation index system was established by analyzing the major factors affecting evaluation of teacher´s Performance y. Applied the multilevel matter element theory into the multilevel matter element evaluation model for teacher´s performance and expatiated the analyzing method and process. Aiming at the qualification requirements that are proposed to teachers by universities, considering the three tasks of teaching work, Scientific Research and Working Attitude, following up the principles that are integrated with the transition from the qualitative to quantitative, a multi-level matter element extension measurement performance evaluation model for teachers is raised; it can make the performance evaluation for teachers more scientific, objective and reasonable.

<p><strong>Background and Objectives: </strong>HBHA and Mtb32C have been isolated from culture supernatants of <em>Mycobacterium tu- berculosis (M. tuberculosis) </em>and <em>Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) </em>and their immunogenicity previously studies have been confirmed. In this study, capability of constructed vector containing two mycobacterial immunodaminant antigens (Mt- b32C-HBHA), in producing new chimeric protein under the <em>in-vitro </em>condition was examined.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>In present study Huh7.5 cells was transfected with Mtb32C-HBHA â€“pCDNA3.1+ recombinant vector using the calcium phosphate method and expression of chimeric protein was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot methods.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Results of RT-PCR and Western blot showed expression of 35.5 KD recombinant protein (Mtb32C-HBHA) in thiscell line.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The constructed vector can produce two highly immunogenic antigens that fusion of them to gather makes chi- meric antigen with new traits. Other attempts are needed to evaluate specific properties of this new antigen such as molecular conformation modeling and immunologic characteristics in future studies.</p>

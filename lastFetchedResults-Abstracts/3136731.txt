In this paper we are introducing a new generation of 802.11n wireless network standard. The objective is to obtain numerical values for various measures of networking performance of 802.11n by simulating the system using Simulink. Our initial approach was to investigate the abilities of 802.11n standard to model a transmitter and receiver that communicated over a user defined channel. In wireless communications systems, the transmitted signal is distorted by fading and interference. If antennas are not spaced enough to achieve an independent fading, this can lead to loss in diversity benefits. Traditional wireless communication systems use a single antenna for transmission and a single antenna for reception. Such systems are known as single input single output (SISO) systems. We simulated a single OFDM symbol SISO system and demonstrated visually how the performance of the system gradually increases by increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We also tested the performance of the system using MatlabÂ´s built in bit-error rate (BER) tool.

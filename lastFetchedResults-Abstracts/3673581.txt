Describes the theory and experimental data for a piezoresistive low-pressure sensor featuring a variety of advantages. The objective of this development was a sensor with high sensitivity, high overload range, and good linearity. In comparison to familiar sensor types, the sensor developed for the pressure range of 10 kPa exhibits an excellent sensitivity of 35 mV/V FSO (full scale output) and nonlinearity &lt;&#177;0.05%. The sensorÂ´s theoretical performance was confirmed by measurements on manufactured pressure sensors

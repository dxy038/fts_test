The objective of this research was to identify the dissolved species or solid phase mineral fraction(s) best correlated with rates of carbon tetrachloride (CT) reductive transformation in systems modeling sulfate-reducing and iron oxide-rich soils and sediments. We used sulfide (S(-II))-treated goethite as our model system, but also studied Fe(II) and S(-II)-treated goethite, Fe(II)-treated goethite, pure FeS, and Fe(II)-treated FeS in order to isolate and evaluate the influence of different mineral fractions on reaction rates. Initial rates of CT transformation were measured for different pH values and concentrations of added Fe(II), as well as different aging times and conditions. The following dissolved species and iron and sulfur mineral fractions were quantified and compared with CT transformation rates: aqueous Fe2+ and S(-II), surface associated Fe(II) (including weakly and strongly bound Fe(II)), FeS(s), and Cr(II) reducible solid phase S. Over the pH range of 6â€“10, CT transformation rates were correlated with surface associated Fe(II), while at pH 8, rates were correlated with weakly bound Fe(II). Aging of S(-II)-treated goethite led to oxidation of surface sulfur and a change in the concentration of weakly bound Fe(II), but did not change the relationship between initial rates and weakly bound Fe(II). The results of this research suggest that surface associated Fe(II) and weakly bound Fe(II) could serve as indicators of the potential for abiotic CT dechlorination in natural soils under sulfate-reducing conditions.

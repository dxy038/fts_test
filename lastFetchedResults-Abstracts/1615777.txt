The main objective of this paper is to present the measurement results of the pressure drop and the heat transfer coefficient in the various types of static mixers. The experimental investigations are provided for the explanation of the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on the heat transfer enhancement for different static mixers. Based on the analysis of the experimental database and theoretical considerations, original formulas are proposed for the determination of the power consumption and the heat transfer in various types of motionless mixing devices. In this paper a new criterion is also defined which takes into consideration both the heat transfer process and hydrodynamic conditions. This criterion may be successfully applied to the selection of a static mixer for the heat transfer problems.

This paper deals with dynamic performance of the tubular linear actuator with mechanical spring driven by a pulse wide modulation (PWM) inverter for bidirectional drive. An equivalent electrical circuit was obtained for the tubular linear actuator with the mechanical component represented by a mass-spring system with motional impedance. By analyzing this circuit the variations in power factor, current, active and reactive power vs. frequency was investigated as well as the resonant circuit frequency. Experimental results for dynamic characteristics such as current and stoke are presented for various values of frequency including resonant frequency. In particular, discussion for experimental results at the resonant frequency is presented fully.

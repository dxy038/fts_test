This paper presents an adaptive particle swarm optimization differentially perturbed velocity (APSO-DV) method for dealing with optimal reactive power dispatch aiming at power loss reduction. The optimum reactive power dispatch of power systems is to allocate reactive power control variables so that the objective function composed of power losses is minimized and the prescribed voltage limits are satisfied. The proposed method determines the optimum settings of reactive power control variables such as, generator excitation, tap changing transformers, and SVC that reduces the power loss, while maintaining the voltage stability. IEEE-30 bus test system from the literature is used to test the performance of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed method is better than the methods reported in the literature.

The objective of this work was to study the hydrolytic release of encrypted peptides with antihypertensive activity from storage proteins of Amaranthus mantegazzianus, as determined by in vitro assays, for the first time by in vivo studies in animal models, and by ex vivo assays. Hydrolysates with hydrolysis degree (DH) of 45% and 65% (IC50 0.12 mg/ml, equivalent to 300–600 μM) exhibited an angiotensin-I converting enzyme 1 (ACE) inhibitory activity equal or higher than the potential inhibitory of the average antihypertensive peptides registered in the BIOPEP database and of semi-purified Amaranthus hypochondriacus albumin and globulin protein fractions. Intragastric administration of hydrolysates with DH of 45% was effective in lowering blood pressure of male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Experiments performed in papillary muscles isolated from hearts and with isolated aortic smooth muscle of SHR suggest that the hypotensive effect could be attributed to a lowering of the peripheral resistance. We assume that the amaranth hydrolysates would be acting at the level of the local or autocrine renin–angiotensin system (RAS).

Objective
The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that placental samples that are obtained by needle aspiration ex vivo are useful for the determination of villus gene expression.
Study design
Placental biopsy was performed with a spinal needle after uncomplicated deliveries. Villi were inspected microscopically, and RNA was extracted and analyzed with capillary electrophoresis. Gene expression was determined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
Results
We obtained more placental villous fragments per aspiration using a 20-gauge needle (5.2 ± 1.8 fragments) than with a 22-gauge needle (3.3 ± 1.6 fragments; P< .01). RNA quality was adequate, based on the 28S and 18S recombinant RNA bands, with a mean 260/280 ratio of 1.88. The amount of extracted RNA correlated with the number of villous fragments per aspirate. Importantly, the expression of NDRG1 and hPL, both markedly altered in hypoxia, was consistent between villi that were obtained by either needle or standard biopsy.
Conclusion
Placental samples that are obtained by ex vivo needle aspiration are useful for the extraction of RNA and for the determination of villous gene expression.

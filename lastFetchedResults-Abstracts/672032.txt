Multi-use tree plantations are a major component of the traditional rural landscapes of semiarid Mediterranean regions. Having evolved over centuries, these landscapes are the product of sustainable development. Within their flexible spatial format, agricultural, silvicultural, and pastoral production is combined to provide efficient use of the natural and human resources. Oliver and carob tree plantations in the Girne region of North Cyprus are chose as an example of these traditional landscapes. They are evaluated according to information gathered from field surveys in two sample locations: one in rural marginal lands; the other, a few kilometres to the east of Girne town. The findings indicate that these landscapes are undergoing a process of degradation and fragmentation owing to economic and socio-cultural factors.
The objective of the present study is fourfold: (1) to determine the structure, distribution pattern, and management of these traditional landscapes; (2) to evaluate the pattern and causes of their degradation; (3) to draw attention to their ecological and cultural significance within the context of the Girne region: (4) to propose alternative roles that will allow them to become integrated into future developments.
The study reviews the potential of tourism to provide a context for the appreciation and protection of these traditional landscapes. The Dik Burun tourist project is reviewed as an example of local-scale application of such an alternative. Landscapes of multi-use olive and carob plantations are incorporated into the project master plan, ensuring not only their protection, but also their continued contribution towards enhancing the ecological, cultural and aesthetic character of the region.

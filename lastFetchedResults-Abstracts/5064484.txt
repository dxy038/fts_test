This paper presents optimum width of optical waveguide for integration in the fiber optic communication network. The objective of this study is to find the best design of optical device that gives maximum level of performance in optical network. Optical waveguide was designed and simulated using device design software based on beam propagation method called BPM tool for modeling light transmission in waveguide. A 1&#215;2 splitter was designed to be integrated into network test bed to see the performance of the device. Performance of the device was measured based on output power of the device and its insertion loss. Results obtained shows that waveguide design with 6&#956;m width has the lowest insertion loss with -0.021 dB.

A methodology for rapid multi-objective design of compact microwave circuits is proposed. Our approach exploits point-by-point Pareto set identification using surrogate-based optimization techniques, auxiliary equivalent circuit models, and space mapping as the major model correction method. The proposed technique is illustrated and validated through the design of a compact rat-race coupler. A set of ten designs being trade-offs between electrical performance of the structure and its size (layout area) is obtained at the cost corresponding to less than thirty high-fidelity EM simulations of the circuit. Experimental verification of three selected designs is provided.

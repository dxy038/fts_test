In microcellular systems many base stations are lower than the surrounding buildings in the street. The cell size of such street cells can be enlarged by using bidirectional antennas. This paper proposes a bidirectional collinear antenna with arc parasitic plates (BCAP); it offers a sufficiently wide bandwidth. The configuration and the bandwidth characteristics of BCAP are shown. The configuration of the proposed antenna is presented. The bandwidth characteristics which depend on the size of the arc parasitic plate and on the spacing between the radiation element and the parasitic plate, are shown.

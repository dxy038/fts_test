This study aims to investigate the effects of anomie and
authoritarianism, in the context of socio-economic status, on
Ahvaz Shahid Chamran University students' inclinations towards
engaging in deviant behavior. Drawing on Merton's theory of
anomie and Lippset's theory of authoritarianism, six hypotheses
and a theoretical model were tested. The research method was
survey and research sample included 480 students who were
enrolled in Ahvaz Chamran University. Data were collected using
self-rated questionnaires that asked demographic as well as socioeconomic
questions on both objective and subjective aspects of
SES. There were also questions concerning the feeling of anomie,
authoritarianism, and inclinations towards engaging in deviant
behavior. The results showed that all correlation coefficients
between variables were statistically significant and that all six
hypotheses were supported. Also, standard regression coefficients
showed that all of the paths indicated by the theoretical model with
objective socio-economic status were justified and those with
subjective socio-economic status were not. The results also
indicated that anomie, authoritarianism, and inclinations towards
engaging in deviant behavior are in fact major social problems of
the Iranian society and that their mutual effects within an
economic and class context should be taken into account.

Land use management based on its capabilities and production capacity, as an indispensable factor, plays an important role in maintaining irreparable natural resources such as water and soil. To determine optimum land utilizations according to natural ability and also to improve current management methods, land use planning can be implemented effectively using different methods and tools within GIS. In the present study, ecological capability and land use planning in Cheragh Vei's watershed were determined. For these purposes, two methods of land assessment and land use planning, Systematic and Multi-objective land use allocation methods were used and compared. After evaluation and determination of land capabilities, the obtained maps were merged. Prioritization land uses showed two priorities for plan preparation. In order to compare the efficiency of the two methods, sediment and erosion of the watershed were evaluated using the obtained plans. The results acquired through the EPM erosion model showed that the sediment production in the current situation can be around 44495.32 tons, and in the future according to methodical and multi-objective land allocation can be around 81341.73 and 72973.41 tons respectively. We found that the map obtained from multi-objective land allocation was better in terms of land use allocation and also for reducing erosion and sediment production when compared with that of the systematic method.

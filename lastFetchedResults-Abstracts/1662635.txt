Background and Objective: Lowering serum glucose and lipid levels in diabetic patients by using natural materials is of great importance. In this study, the effect of oral consumption of Fumaria Parviflora Lamwas was assessed on serum glucose and lipid levels in streptozocin diabetic rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 32 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups of control, control under the treatment of F. Parviflora L., diabetic and diabetic under the treatment of F. Parviflora L.. F. Parviflora L. was administered orally (6.25%) after injection of streptozocin for five weeks. Serum levels of glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL were evaluated before and three and six weeks after the treatment.
Results: Regarding glucose level, there was no significant difference between diabetic rats treated with F. Parviflora L. and diabetic rats at third and sixth weeks. However there was a significant decrease in triglyceride level in F. Parviflora L. treated group as compared to diabetic rats at third and sixth weeks. Regarding serum total cholesterol, F. Parviflora L. treated group did not show a significant decrease at third week, but this difference was significant at sixth week. Regarding HDL cholesterol, there was no significant increase in F. Parviflora L. treated group as compared to diabetic group at third week, while this difference was significant at sixth week. 
Conclusion: Oral administration of F. Parviflora L. to streptozocin-induced diabetic rats improved triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL serum levels, but no significant effect on serum glucose and LDL.

Simulation of behavior of aquifers into determining groundwater exploitation rate and planning for sustainable use of groundwater is very important. In this regard, groundwater models using hydraulic, hydrological and hydro-geological parameters were developed to predict the quality and quantity of aquifer parameters. Good knowledge of these parameters can be increase the accuracy of aquifer simulation. For this purpose, a structure based on advance optimization methods for calibration of parameters with low accuracy (coefficient of hydrodynamic, aquifer recharge and withdrawal rates) were developed. In the proposed model, minimizing the sum of the square differences between simulated and observed groundwater level was considered as the objective function. Allowable range of calibration parameters has been considered as constraints. The governing flow equations of the aquifer used to determine the groundwater level in each cells. These equations were solved by the finite difference method. by runing the proposed model, the optimal values of parameters were determined in each cell. The comparison between simulated and observed groundwater level shows the capability of the proposed approach in accuratey estimation of the aquifer parameters.

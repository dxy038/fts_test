Background:  The patch test is an important tool for the diagnosis of contact dermatitis. In the past few years, allergists have shown increased interest in the diagnosis of contact dermatitis and the use of patch testing. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine (1) the frequency of usage of the patch test among allergists, (2) the factors that affect the decision to patch test, and (3) the need for training the allergist to perform patch testing. Method: A single mailing survey was sent to all the members of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI). Results:  Fifty-seven percent of responding allergists performed patch testing but did so infrequently. Those who were fellowship trained in patch testing or attended a sponsored workshop performed the test more frequently than those with no training. Those who perceived the patch test as useful also were more likely to perform the test. Fellowship-trained members felt more confident than workshop-trained members in performing the test, and both, in turn, were more confident than members with no training. Trained physicians also were more likely to find the test useful compared with those with no training in patch testing. Conclusions: Education through fellowship training and workshop was associated with greater self-confidence of the allergist in his/her ability to perform patch testing. Education also was associated with increased perception of patch test utility and increased usage of the test.

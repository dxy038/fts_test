Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides unique information about the underlying tissue structure of brain white matter in vivo, including both the geometry of fiber bundles as well as quantitative information about tissue properties as characterized by measures such as tensor orientation, anisotropy, and size. Our objective in this paper is to evaluate the utility of shape representations of white matter tracts extracted from DTI data for classification of clinically different population groups (here autistic vs control). As a first step, our algorithm extracts fiber bundles passing through approximately marked regions of interest on affinely aligned brain volumes. The subsequent analysis is entirely based on the geometric modeling of the extracted tracts. A key advantage of using such an abstraction is that it allows us to capture invariant features of brains allowing for efficient large sample size studies. We demonstrate that with the use of an appropriate representation of the tract shapes, classifiers can be built with reasonable prediction accuracies without making heavy use of the spatial normalization machinery needed when using voxel based features.

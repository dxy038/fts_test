The problem for optimal control of the activated sludge process based on ASM1 model is considered. The objective is to determine a method for real time calculation of an optimal dissolved oxygen trajectory and the corresponding optimal state trajectories subject to minimization of both the deviations from the effluent requirements and the control energy consumption. The paper presents the developed reduced biological model of the activated sludge process, Athlone plant mass balance model and method for the optimal control problem solution in a real time. The optimal control problem solution is calculated in Matlab environment and the real time control is implemented in Adroit SCADA environment.

A dynamic prediction scheme is presented in this paper, named PROPHET. The purpose of the proposed technique is to predict, given two different classes of quality of service (QoS), the total amount of the demanded transmission requests per QoS class. PROPHET is constructed based on Hidden Markov Chains (HMC), modeled by an ergodic framework. The prediction objective is to reduce the amount of time spent in computing the transmission schedule by predicting traffic requests. The evaluation of the predictor is realized in a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) single-hop network with star topology. Furthermore, PROPHET is compared to a previous prediction-based scheme, called POSA. Simulation results indicate that the novel technique supports efficient predictable QoS, since it operates more accurately than POSA.

Changes in the costate coordination methodology based on the costate prediction method are introduced. The objective is to define a partition criterion for optimizing the solution, using parallel processing, of the problem of optimal control of large-scale system on a multiple-microprocessor architecture using the preferential processor. The partition involves a decentralization of the hierarchical calculation and the distribution of the coordination calculation. An application to a power system is implemented

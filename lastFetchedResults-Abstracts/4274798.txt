This paper presents solution of Optimal Power Flow (OPF) with different objective functions i.e. fuel cost minimization and active power loss minimization using heuristic technique namely Genetic Algorithm (GA). The basic OPF solution is obtained with fuel cost minimization as the objective function and the optimal settings of the power system are determined. For reactive power optimization, active power loss has been taken as the objective function. OPF solution with Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) device is carried out considering fuel cost minimization and active power loss minimization as objective. TCSC is used to minimize the total fuel cost and active power losses. All the above cases are studied using Genetic Algorithm. To evaluate the proposed method, IEEE 30 bus system is used. The suggested technique or method is programmed under MATLAB software. The results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

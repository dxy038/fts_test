This paper presents the simultaneous tuning of power system stabilizers in a multi-machine power system. The problem of selecting the parameters of power system stabilizers in converted into an optimization problem that is solved by genetic algorithm using eigen value based objective function. The dynamic performance of the system has been investigated under small perturbation and large disturbance. The performance of genetic algorithm based PSS has been compared with the conventional power system stabilizer. The non-linear simulation results on 4 machine, 11 bus system verifies the effectiveness of the proposed genetic algorithm based power system stabilizers

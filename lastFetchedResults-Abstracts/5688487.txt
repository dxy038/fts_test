Automated biomonitoring has evolved into a useful method for water quality assessment. A novel biomonitoring system was designed and built. The main objective of the system was to provide the facilities necessary to apply advanced signal processing techniques to the analysis of bioelectric signals. The system has been shown to provide excellent results. A description of the system is given, along with the results

The mechanism for autonomous behavior will be exemplified in this demo session. This mechanism is based on the properties of biological waves and is detailed presented in the paper by Alberto P. Mu??uzuri. In particular, exploration algorithms will be exemplified by numerical animations as well as by showing videos of experimental realizations. Other applications of the mechanism will also be demonstrated via numerical simulations. Cooperative autonomous behaviors, path finders under complicated conditions such as moving obstacles an landscape, moving objective will be also shown.

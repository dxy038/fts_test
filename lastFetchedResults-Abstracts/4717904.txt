Power is inefficient due to the large peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) of the Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. In this paper, we propose an efficient power control algorithm for the OFDM systems, to achieve the optimum and fair resource utilization by maximizing a weighted sum utility. The objective function in this optimization problem is always nonconcave, which makes the problem difficult to solve. We make progress in solving this type of optimization problem using PSO (particle swarm optimization). ItÂ´s proved that the proposed algorithm converges to the global optimal solutions in this paper. Numerical examples show that our algorithm can guarantee the fast convergence and fairness within a few iterations.

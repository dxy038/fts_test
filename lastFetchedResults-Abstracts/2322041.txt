&nbsp;Introduction:&nbsp;Brucellosis which is an important zoonotic disease, exists in our country. Camel is an animal that is frequently imported to Iran and doesn't have any inspection for its brucellosis. The objective of this study was determination of active and passive infection by serologic and genomic detection of brucellosis in one-humped camel that was slaughtered in central part of Iran during 2012- 2013.&nbsp;Materials and methods:&nbsp;For this purpose, 150 blood samples were collected from camels that were slaughtered in Najaf-Abad abattoir and they transported to laboratory in cool box.&nbsp;Initially, Samples were tested by serological methods include: Rose Bengal plat test, tube agglutination test and 2-mercaptoethanol test. Samples which showed anti-brucella antibodies titer equal or more than 1/80 in Wright test and equal or more than 1/40 in 2-ME test were considered as positive. Nucleic acid of samples were extracted and tested by polymerase chain reaction.&nbsp;Results: Results showed that the infection rates were12, 8 and 6 % in RBPT, tube agglutination and 2-ME tests respectively. However 1.3 % of samples were positive in PCR test.&nbsp;Discussion and conclusion: According to 2ME titers, results of serological tests indicated that animals were chronically infected. In present study sequence of pb26 gene was detected, that is common in most brucella species. Present study shows that camel can be a potential carrier; therefore importing camel to the country is a way of bacterial spread to central part of Iran.&nbsp;

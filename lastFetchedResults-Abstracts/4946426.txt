The development and the wide spread use of web services allow for convenient electronic data storage and distribution all over the world. As this web services is a new service-oriented computing paradigm which poses the unique security challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, multi-domain characteristic and highly dynamic nature. A key challenge in Web services security is to design effective access control schemes. However, most current access control systems base authorization decisions on subjectpsilas identity. In this paper, we suggest web access control scheme which incorporating user password and web server log. The major objective of the proposed model is to provide mechanisms to allow control of web user access based on the user access behavior by tracking the web access history. The system controls access to web pages depending on user password, date of last request, page visited (URL) and status action. The active userpsilas access pattern is matched with user access data discovered from user access history, based on mining web usage data using association rules mining and PrefixSpan algorithms, then analyzed to make the access control decision (web access is permitted or denied).

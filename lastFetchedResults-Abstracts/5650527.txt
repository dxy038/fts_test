A method about optimization of parameters for 3-D reconstruction with uncalibrated monoplane angiograms is presented in this paper. Based on the model of monoplane angiographic system, variables concerning about the precision of reconstruction are discussed. Distance between initial image and projection of reconstructed 3-D model is employed to formulate objective function. Adaptive simulated annealing algorithm is utilized to solve the problem of optimization. Experiments on angiograms are presented. The results show that the method greatly improves the accuracy of 3-D reconstruction.

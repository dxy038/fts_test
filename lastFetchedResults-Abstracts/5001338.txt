Proper blood flow in the veins are important to ensure effective return of deoxygenated blood to the heart. A major element of the human venous system is the presence of one-way, flexible, bicuspid valves in the legs that allow antegrade blood flow while preventing retrograde flow. Veins are elastic in nature thus their lumens can collapse under external forces and distend under internal pressures. Fluid flow within such flexible structures is regulated by the stresses imposed upon and by the structure, the material properties of the fluid, and the presence and function of the internal valve. As a result of viscous forces and fluid pressure the flexible structures are subject to continuous displacement. The primary objective of this study is to develop a two-dimensional computational model of non-Newtonian fluid flow within and around flexible structures. Accurate numerical solutions of this system provide a means of connecting venous valve incompetence and fluid flow behavior to the onset of cardiovascular limitations.

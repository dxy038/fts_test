The Stephen Low Company and Rutgers University together with NOAA\Â´s Office of Ocean Exploration have collaborated to design and implement a week-long Summer Institute for formal and informal educators focused on the newly released giant screen film "Volcanoes of the Deep Sea". The Institute was designed to provide educators, including informal educators from Science Museums and Centers hosting the film, and from the NSF Centers for Oceanographic Science Education Excellence (COSEE), with an opportunity to become immersed in cutting edge deep sea research. The objective of the Institute was to provide a window into the scientific, technological and social context of deep sea hydrothermal vents research to an audience that will likely never see this environment in person. Our goal was to teach standards-based science and math concepts using themes in the film as real-world examples. Finally, the Institute was designed to instill a sense of excitement for scientific exploration and discovery in student audiences.

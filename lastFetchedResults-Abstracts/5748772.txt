The main objective of this research is to design, implement, and evaluate a new generation of smart mobile data mining techniques called SmartMobiMine that will be used in the integrated structure of the 4G mobile networks to support and develop the essential services in mobile networks. SmartMobiMine techniques will integrate different types of information to support mobile users. Our research will include using SmartMobiMine techniques to develop new location management, handoff, and load balancing techniques to support the integrated 4G mobile networks. This paper gives an overview of the proposed SmartMobiMine techniques. Initial results show that SmartMobiMine techniques are promising.

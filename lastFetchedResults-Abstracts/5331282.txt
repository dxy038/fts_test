Since heavy metal pollution is a significant aspect to aquatic ecosystems, the objective of this research work was to investigate adsorption characteristics of chitosan as an alternative adsorbent material. In this study, chitosan, synthesized from locally available shrimp type &#8220;penaeus monodon&#8221; was used to observe adsorption characteristics of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) heavy metals from aqueous solution. Batch kinetic experiment studies were conducted for changing initial pH, initial concentration of metal ions, particle size and degree of deacetylation (DD) of chitosan. Simplified models such as, pseudo first order, pseudo second order and intra-particle diffusion models were used to analyze the experimental data. The result showed that the adsorption capacity strongly depends on pH and DD. It was clearly seen that higher adsorption of heavy metals occur at comparatively high pH and high DD. Equilibrium experimental data were analyzed by using two different isotherm models namely, Langmuir and Freundlich. The characteristic parameters for each isotherm and related correlation coefficients were determined by using mathematical modeling software. Isotherms show that adsorption process of Cd and Pb is a heterogeneous process.

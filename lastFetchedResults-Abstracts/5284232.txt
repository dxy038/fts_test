Binary ant colony algorithm has good performance in the function optimization problem. However, the drawbacks that easy to fall into the local optimization and cannot get all the solutions at the same time still exist. In this paper, through introducing the congestion control strategy to improve the algorithmpsilas globe optimization ability and the thought of multi-population, a novel binary ant colony algorithm based on congestion control strategy and multi-population is proposed. The tests of several different functions optimization (including single-modal and multi-modal function) prove that the improved algorithm not only ensure the good globe search ability, but also has better effect to the multi-objective problem.

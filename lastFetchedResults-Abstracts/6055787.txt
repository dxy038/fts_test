The purpose of medical image segmentation is to divides the lesions image with a special meaning and background regional. The characteristics of medical images are generally more complex. There is often overlap between different regions, the edge of the area is vague. Research based on fuzzy clustering method for medical image segmentation, fuzzy C-means clustering and fuzzy kernel clustering methods were studied and discussed fully considered the spatial information, the single objective problem conversion into multi-objective problem. The experimental results show that the method use in medical image segmentation achieved good results.

The conscious narrative studies of narratives emerged from the critical research of the Russians structuralists in the mid-twentieth century. This research pushed the critic Todorov to define narratives as naratology (the science of the narrative) which tries to identify the internal structures in the narrative, distinguish its characteristics, and reveal the relations which connect them together. This research is concerned with narrative structure and narrative discourse, which serve as bases for  literariness and poetic quality. It should be noted that the central objective of these two terms is to emphasize on qualitative features of narrative art. Critical approaches agree that the study of narrative art must be start with the narrative structure and its internal structures and features. This is so because narrative structures are associated with practical applications and try to bring about a narrative text according to narrative conventions. So, Narratives belong to an independent particular literary genre with its own norms.

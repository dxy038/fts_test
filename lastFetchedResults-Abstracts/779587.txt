Objective: This is a critical descriptive study of the situation
of cataloging as an academic discipline within Library and Information
Science studies in Spain. Material and methods: The descriptive
analysis of the sectional contents of the general and specific guidelines
of the degrees of Diplomado (three-year degree) and Licenciado (fiveyear
degree) in LIS and the curricular programs of the Spanish university
schools or departments. Variables analyzed: The denomination and
content descriptors of the course offerings and credit hours. The test-retest
method was used, with a qualitative processing of data. Results:
General data is given about the studies in LIS: their introduction, the universities
that offer them, and the degrees awarded. Cataloging is considered
an obligatory core subject matter, and is represented by severalcourses that present important differences insofar as their denominations,
their credits, and their character from one curricular program to the
next. The average credit requisite for obligatory courses in cataloging
in Spain is 14 (1 credit = 10 class hours), and 19.7 if electives are also
considered. At present, this discipline is undergoing a reform that
will produce important changes as a result of the adaptation of university
studies to the common framework of the European Union

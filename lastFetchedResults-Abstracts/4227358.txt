Detection and recognition of targets, obscured by foliage clutter is an active research area. We address here the important question of foliage clutter modeling. The observed clutter is an highly impulsive random process and can be modeled more accurately with symmetric alpha stable (SalphaS) random process. In fact this is the first objective of this paper. The second one is the comparison of several wavelet (wavelet-like) algorithms for foliage clutter suppression. These algorithms are evaluated through artificial doppler signal corrupted by artificial clutter, following SalphaS distribution and real radar clutter using X-band portable continuous wave radar.

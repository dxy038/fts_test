Background and objective: All believe in hepatitis B as a burdensome viral disease, which consumes a large amount of financial and health resources in developing countries. An important way to prevent hepatitis B infection is vaccination especially among At-risk populations including healthcare workers. Unfortunately immunologic response to the vaccine is not perfect. Multiple different factors such as gender, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, underlying diseases and the interval between the date of last vaccination dose and blood sampling influence the level of immunization. So, this study was conducted to evaluate post vaccination immunologic response of Guilan university of Medical Sciencesf(GUMSf) medical students.

Materials and methods: In This descriptive and cross-sectional study (2003), All the GUMS' medical students who had received complete vaccine series at zero, one, and six months, were enrolled. Their demographic data and the factors which could probably alternate the immunologic response were collected by interview. Their Anti-HBs Ab titer was evaluated by Enzyme Lnked ImmunoAssay(ELISA). Appropriate immunologic response supposed to be HBsAb >=10 mlU/ml and inappropriate response: HBsAb<10 mlU/ml .Then, the collected data were analyzed through SPSS 10.00 statistic software.

Results: We evaluated 443 subjects.245 ones included. Included subjects were between 20-53 years old and their mean age was 24.9±4.5 years. 74.7 %( 183 cases) were female and 25.3 %( 62 cases) were male. 4.9 %( 12 cases) didn't respond properly to vaccination while, 95.1% (233 cases) had adequate response. Mean of the interval between the date of last vaccination dose and blood sampling in non-responsive group was significantly higher than responsive group (P=0.04). Females' immunologic response was significantly higher than males' (P=0.001). Responsiveness was significantly lower in smokers in comparison with non-smokers (P=0.02). 132 cases (97.77 %) of subjects whose the interval since their last vaccination dose was shorter than 24 months had adequate immunologic response in comparison with 96 cases (91.43 %) whose their interval was longer than 24 months(P=0.025). Inadequate immunologic responders' mean age was 28.67±5.4 years and 24.77 ±4.4 years for adequate immunologic responders (P=0.004).

Conclusions: In our study, 95.1% had protective level of Anti-HBs (>10 mlU/ml), which is agreeable to other studies. As health-care staff are a high risk group according to their contamination with HBV, 1-3 month after full three-dose (0,1,6) vaccination they must be evaluated for Anti-HBs titer to prevent the false sense of being immunized among healthcareworkers and risky groups. After all according to the new recommendation this group should receive 3 full doses of vaccination (0,1,6) and Anti-HBs tittering should be performed two months after the last dose.

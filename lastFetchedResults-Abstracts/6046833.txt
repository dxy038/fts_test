ITU-T has selected the candidate submitted by Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola, VoiceAge, and Texas Instruments as the baseline for the G.EV-VBR coding standard. G.EV-VBR is an embedded scalable speech codec that uses state-of-the-art technology to provide the most efficient encoded speech available for various real-time applications. EV-VBR encodes both narrowband (NB) and wideband (WB) speech signals starting at 8 kbps. Near perfect wideband representation is achieved at 32 kbps for all signal types. The bit stream is divided into five robust layers, providing sufficient granularity, in particular for VoIP applications. In addition, an extension to the codec will provide super- wideband and stereo capability by adding layers to the codec. Extensive listening tests were conducted during the ITU-T selection phase to support selection of the best- performing candidate. The selected EV-VBR candidate passed 69 of 70 required and 25 of 28 objective terms of reference.

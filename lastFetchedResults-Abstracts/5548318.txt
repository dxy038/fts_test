Summary form only given.The objective of the current study is the elucidation and application of experimental procedures for determination of extinction and scattering coefficients, anisotropy factors and/or concentrations of molecular systems in light scattering media. The method employed is based on the fiber-optic detection and analysis of reflected and transmitted light intensities generated by modulated visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) diode lasers in turbid aqueous solutions.

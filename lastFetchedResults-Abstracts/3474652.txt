A number of objective criteria for optimal maintenance scheduling of thermal generators is discussed. The criteria are based on generation operating cost, reliability indices, deviations from a desired schedule and/or constraints violation penalties. A comparison of the performance of all these criteria is presented by maintenance scheduling a realistic 30 thermal-unit system. Also, the relationships between the several realibility indices are dicussed.

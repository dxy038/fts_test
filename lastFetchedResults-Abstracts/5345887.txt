The main objective of this paper is to investigate the performance and efficiency improvements of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) after hybridization. For this purpose, the model vehicle chosen was the Hummer H3. We modeled the vehicle using the Hummer H3 parameters and named this a representative Hummer H3. The modeling software that was used for this purpose was ADVISOR (advance vehicle simulator) and Matlab.

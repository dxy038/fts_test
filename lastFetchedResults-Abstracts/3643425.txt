Inverse methods have become a fundamental tool in the physical sciences for remotely sensing unknown objects and reconstructing their physical properties. The objective of this special issue is to present an overview of this important rapidly emerging discipline and to provide examples of the wide scope of methods used to investigate inverse problems in electromagnetics, ranging from purely theoretical considerations to some very practical problems.

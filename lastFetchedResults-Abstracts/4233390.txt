The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between vis/NIR spectral and the major physiological properties of tomato-soluble solids content (SSC), acidity (pH) and fruit firmness. A total of 200 tomatoes were hand harvested and analyzed the spectra features using spectrophotometer. Principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS) were used to develop the prediction models. The models for SSC (r= 0.90) of standard error of prediction (SEP) 0.19degBrix with three factors; pH (r- 0.83) of SEP 0.09 with four factors; compression force (r= 0.81) of SEP 16.017N with six factors, and puncture force (r= 0.83) of SEP 1.18N with three factors, showed the excellent prediction performance. The vis/NIR spectroscopy technique had significantly greater accuracy in determining SSC. It was concluded that it is possible to assess the quality characteristics of tomato

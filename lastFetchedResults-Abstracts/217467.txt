The objective of this study was to explore the extent of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene synthetic solution and
red water mineralization by comparing conventional direct ozonation and multi-stage ozonation-biological treatment
process. The alkaline hydrolysis was used for remediation 2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene and red water at pH = 10.9. Nevertheless,
the hydroxyl radicals would be generated by ozone decomposition with ozone dose of 0.177 g/L. The samples were
subjected to chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon analysis to monitor pollutants removal. The rate of 2, 4,
6-trinitrotoluene and red water pollutants degradation were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography.
2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene synthetic solution resulted 55.5 % chemical oxygen demand removal by 3 h direct ozonation.
Following direct ozonation the biological treatment twenty four hours chemical oxygen demand reached 98.9 % and
98.7 % removal using humic acid and river water 1 % ( v/v) inoculation singly and respectively. Conventional direct
ozonation showed non significant change in total organic carbon degradation. While on using multi-stage ozone-biological
treatment process where humic acid and/or river water were used as inoculums singly and respectively, total organic
carbon fulfilled 73 % and 98.3 % removal. The process was one hour direct ozonation and followed by three days multistage
ozone-biological treatment. In multi-stage ozone-biological treatment process, ozonation was effective to decompose
total organic carbon and to produce biodegradable dissolved organic carbon easily removed by ozone oxidation up to
98.3 % in 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene synthetic solution. Pollutants removal achieved 99 % in authentic red water effluent
using river inoculation 1 % (v/v) in 5 days. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Fourier Transformation Infra Red methods
were performed to confirm types of pollutants content in red water.

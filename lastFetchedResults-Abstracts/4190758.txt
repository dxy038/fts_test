In this paper, optimal placement of distributed generations has been studied accurately. A proper objective function is proposed for distribution network losses reduction and improvement of reliability indices,. A 20 kV sample network, 114 buses from Azarbaijan (Tabriz) Power Electric Distribution Company is selected and different simulation has been performed by using DIgSILENT software. Simulation results show network losses are reduced, reliability indices of system are improved and proposed objective function is very suitable and appropriate.

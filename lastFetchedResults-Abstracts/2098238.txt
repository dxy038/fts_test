Our previous work showed that the cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was enhanced by live Salmonella vaccine (LV). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of live and killed Salmonella vaccines on Salmonella enteritidis (SE) clearance and to determine if the clearance was mediated by cell-mediated and/or humoral immunity. Chickens were first immunized at 2 weeks of age followed by a booster dose at 4 weeks, challenged with live SE 2 weeks later (6-week-old) and tested for CMI, antibody response and SE clearance 1-week post SE-challenge (7-week-old). Spleen cell proliferation induced by SE-flagella and Concanavalin A (Con A) were significantly higher and SE shedding was significantly lower in the LV group. The splenic CD3 population was significantly lower and B cells were higher in the control group compared to all the SE-challenged groups (with and without vaccination). Serum antibody to SE-flagella and envelope were significantly higher in the KV group compared to all the other groups. These results suggest that LV protects against SE infection, probably by enhancing the CMI.

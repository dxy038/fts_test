We developed a simple fluorescence microscopy for acquisition of high-resolution images of single quantum dots (QDs) labeled to biomolecules on apical plasma membrane, in cell interior and on basal plasma membrane of living cells. The method was a combination of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) at apical cell surface and intracellular microscopy coupled with focusing objective. Insulin conjugated to single QD (insulin-QD) was chosen as the model system. In order to bind insulin-QDs to insulin receptors on the plasma membrane through the interaction between insulin and its receptor, as well as internalize them, the cells attached on a coverslip were incubated with biotinylated insulin and QD-streptavidin conjugate at 37 Â°C. Next, fluorescent molecules in the cells were photobleached by illuminating the cells using a 100-W mercury lamp with the wavelengths from 460 to 490 nm. Then, the incident angle of a laser beam was adjusted to produce total internal reflection at the apical surface of a single cell. In this case, the insulin-QDs in the whole cell were excited, and the fluorescent molecules outside the cell were not illuminated. Finally, the images of single insulin-QDs on the apical plasma membrane, in the cell interior and on the basal plasma membrane of the cell were taken by focusing the objective to different positions, respectively. The resolution and contrast of the fluorescent spots in the images were much higher than those obtained by using epi-fluorescence microscopy and comparable to those obtained by using the conventional TIRFM. The method improved the image acquisition speed for the images on the apical and basal plasma membrane using the conventional TIRFM, and could acquire the high-resolution images in the cell interior quickly.

The objective of this experiment is to produce a novel scaffold composed of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/β-tricalciumphosphate (β-TCP) skeleton covered with apatite/collagen sponge. BMSCs were used to evaluate the cell behavior on the hybrid scaffold. Cell morphology on the surfaces of PLGA/β-TCP skeleton and PLGA/β-TCP skeleton with apatite/collagen sponge composite coating was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cell proliferation was assessed by cell number counting. Differentiated BMSCs function was monitored by measuring alkaline phosphates activity of the cells. These results demonstrated that the apatite/collagen sponge composite coating could improve cell proliferation and ALP activity of the hybrid scaffolds and increase its hydrophilicity after hybridization. The experiment suggested that the PLGA/β-TCP skeleton with apatite/collagen sponge composite coating is promising as a candidate 3D substrate for bone tissue engineering.

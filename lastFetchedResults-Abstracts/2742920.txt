Manufacturing cost minimization and productivity maximization are essential for the machining industries sector to survive in the market. The production shop floor is a source of achieving strategic data, providing information to assist cutting processes optimization and better help to use equipment and resources efficiently. In this sense, the objective of this work is to present the development of a New Cutting Process Operational and Decision Support System which is following the most modern computational architecture (this system is being known in Portuguese as SIAPU. The system development is being based on new optimization cutting process approaches. The expectation is that the system offers features as practicability, usability, mobility, beyond contain a help system intuitive on-line. Finally, this work has concluded that the use of the system in industry shop floor can contribute as a remarkable tool to minimize costs or maximize productivity, given to the industries, an opportunity to look for larger profits.

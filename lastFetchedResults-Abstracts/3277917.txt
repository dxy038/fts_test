Power quality is a crucial component of power grid reliability. Due to the high cost of measurement devices, the monitoring of power quality is non-trivial. Our objective is to deploy measurement devices on suitable power links to reduce the uncertainty of power quality estimation on non-monitored power links. To realize our objective, we first model the power grid network as a data-driven network. Using entropy-based measurements and Bayesian network models, we propose different algorithms which identify the most suitable power links for power meter placement. Our proposed solution is efficient, and has the potential to significantly reduce the uncertainty of power quality values on non-monitored power links.

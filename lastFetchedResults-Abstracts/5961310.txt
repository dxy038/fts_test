Objective: To analyze the differentially expressed genes expressed genes in rats that inhaled diesel exhaust (DE) for getting better understanding of the molecular characteristics caused by particle in the public environment. Methods: Got the microarray hybridization data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Identified the differentially expressed genes expressed genes in DE rats and the patterns of their regulation using public bioinformatics software and database, which involved BRB-Arraytools, PANTHER and DAVID, KEGG. Results and Conclusion: These data mining findings between air and DE rats by bioinformatics methods could provide better understanding of the molecular activity change caused by DE.

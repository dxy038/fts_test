In this paper the aspects of program phasing which dictate the need for total configuration control are briefly reviewed with design and data interface and concurrency concept considerations. Basic elements and organizations of a configuration control system are described and integrated with program, project, and functional department management in synchronism with program objective milestones. The importance of acquisition, verification, compilation, and integration of data with timely release for shared use is emphasized. Stress is also placed on the development and preservation of evolution traceability, and the cross-sensitivity of change effects among design, data, schedules, and resources.

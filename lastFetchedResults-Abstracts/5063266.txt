The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of variation of the tube length and the crosshead velocity on the amount of energy absorption of aluminium tubes (Al 6061) towards the inversion collapsed mode. The tests were performed on the Aluminium tubes using compression test apparatus according to ASTM E8 standard procedures. Two parameters that are included in the experiment were the crosshead velocity and tube length. The collected experimental data were organized and analysis of energy absorption was performed. Comparison was made to the values of energy absorption obtained from the experiments, and it was found that the energy absorbed by the Aluminium tube was increased by increasing the tube length as well as crosshead velocity.

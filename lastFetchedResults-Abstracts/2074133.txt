After a long term, the tyranny struck Egypt hopefully looked for promising achievements of the 2011 revolution.But that hope was short-lived and before the end of his legal term, the first civil president had been overthrown by Army and in the commotion pros and cons. Winning the majority of parliament and then first presidential election put the Muslim brotherhood leaders under the spotlight and scrutiny. Apart from the deficiencies in political and economic fields, according to the authors, Muslim Brotherhood leaders’ inattention towards the reflections of their actions in society, and how society would interpret the extensive presence of Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters in political sphere, was the main reason of allegations of totalitarianism and authoritarianism against them by  their opponents. Inspired by the phenomenological methodology of Alfred Schutz’ sociology, we interpret the subjective meaning of Muslim Brotherhood political actions in 3 levels: ideology, organization and  the Jama’at historical experience. Afterwards, we try to understand the objective meaning of these political actions in the Egypt’s political culture and then compare it with the idealtype of democratic political culture. At the end, pointing to the gap between the Muslim Brotherhood interpretation of the meaning of their political participation and other actors’ understanding, the tragic fate of Mohammad Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders will be explained.

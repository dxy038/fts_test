Clays are often used in adsorption processes due to their remarkable adsorptive characteristics and high specific surface area. However, a colloidal system is formed when the clay is dispersed in water, leading to difficulties in clay recovery and separation at the end of the process since clay sedimentation is hindered by colloidal forces. The objective of this work was to obtain clay polymer nanocomposites (CPN) comprised of micrometric polyethylene particles presenting clay particles physically adhered to the surface. How the CPN particles interact with the aqueous phase was also investigated, since the adsorption processes are usually carried out in several washing steps.

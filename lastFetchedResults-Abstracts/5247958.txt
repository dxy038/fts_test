An objective thing can be understood as a problem. Zhang bo and Zhang ling (1990) offered a method of decomposing and resolving a problem by establishing equivalence relations on the domain, parting and refining the problem, and forming a semi ordering lattice. So, the paper offers the concept of a set of dynamic autonomous objects that communicate (DAOC) on a distributed system. By parting and refining a set of DAOCs, a semi ordering lattice is obtained, which is isomorphism or homomorphism with the relevant problem. In this way, the solution of a problem on a set of DAOCs is obtained. Thus, an objective thing can be implemented on a distributed system by a set of DAOCs

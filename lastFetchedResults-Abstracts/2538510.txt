Background and Objective: Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of vulvovaginits in reproductive aged women. Metronidazole which is considered as the first line treatment accompanies a few side effects. Besides, many women prefer to use herbal therapy for the treatment of vaginitis. This study was carried out to compare the effect of Propolis vaginal cream with Metronidazole vaginal gel on the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in reproductive aged women.

Materials and Methods: Based on Amselrsquo;s criteria and gram stain, the afflicted patients were diagnosed and were randomly assigned to two groups of 50 to receive treatments with Metronidazole or Propolis. The results were compared after 7 days of therapy.

Results: There was a significant relationship between groups in terms of type of treatment and recovery based on Amselrsquo;s criteria (P0/05). The response to the treatment in the groups of Metronidazole and Propolis were 95.8 % and 70.8%, respectively.

Conclusion: Although Propolis had a weak effect on the improvement of Amselrsquo;s criteria and nugent score changes, but responses to the treatment in Propolis group was considerable (70.8%). So Propolis can be used as a complimentary treatment besides the main therapy.

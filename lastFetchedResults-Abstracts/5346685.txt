Nanocomposites have attracted tremendous interest for advanced electronic packaging applications due to their superior electrical, thermal and optical properties. The dispersion of nanometer sized fillers in a polymer matrix, however, is very challenging in the preparation of these nanocomposites, because the nanoparticles have a strong tendency to aggregate. An objective and accurate dispersion analysis method is needed to evaluate the dispersion quality and improve the production of nanocomposites. In the present study, we utilize the microscopic observation and image analysis techniques to quantify the dispersion quality of various important nanocomposites for electronic packaging. We have demonstrated that this method is useful in the preparation of polymer nanocomposites including underfill materials, high-K composites and electrically conductive adhesives.

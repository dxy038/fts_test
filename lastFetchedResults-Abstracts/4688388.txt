For solving the problems of low efficiency and high cost in piping design process on offshore drilling platform, the design of manifold optimum piping was taken as research objective, a mathematical model was established with the controlled objects of construction and operation costs. The general adaptive algorithm was improved by projecting the encouraging function to deal with constraints, design of variable probability parameters and the establishment of evaluation mechanism. Simulation experiments show that, the task of optimum piping design on offshore platform could be accomplished by the optimization method based on improved adaptive genetic algorithm and costs were reduced and piping design efficiency was enhanced effectively. Comparing with the algorithm performance not optimized, evolution efficiency, convergence rate and stability of improved algorithm were obviously superior.

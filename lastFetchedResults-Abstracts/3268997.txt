The reduction of the ripple of driving force is required for the practical utilization of linear synchronous motor for ropeless elevator. In addition, it is important to increase the driving force and reduce the weight of motor. In this paper, two kinds of movers for the air-cored linear permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motors are optimized, one is Halbach-type Linear PM motor (HTLPM) and the other is yoke-type air-core linear PM motor (YTLPM), by using the Evolution Strategy (ES) method. Multi-objective results in terms of the reduction of ripple and weight and the increase of driving force are also discussed.

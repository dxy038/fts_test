The objective of an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm is to find steady state operation point which minimizes generation cost, loss etc. or maximizes social welfare, load ability etc. while maintaining an acceptable system performance in terms of limits on generators´ real and reactive powers, line flow limits, output of various compensating devices etc. Traditionally, classical optimization methods were used to effectively solve OPF. The OPF solution includes an objective; the selection of the objective function depends on the operating philosophy of each power system. A common objective function concerns the active power generation cost. An Interior Point Method (IPM) is proposed to solve the OPF problem. The most successful IPM is based on using a primal - dual formulation and applying Newton´s method to the system of equations arising from the barrier method, or in other words, arising by perturbing the optimality conditions. A computer program, written in MATLAB environment, is developed to represent the proposed method. The adopted program is applied to Iraqi 24 bus Super High Voltage (SHV) network (400 kV). The required are data taken from the Iraqi National Control Center (INCC), which belongs to the ministry of electricity. Thus, the proposed algorithm based on Interior Point Method is adopted for the first time on the Iraqi Super High Voltage network which is shown to be a valid tool to perform this optimal power flow.

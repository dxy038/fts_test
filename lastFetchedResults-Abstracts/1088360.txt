This study examines the pyrolysis of three petroleum pitch residues of different aromaticities, (R1), (R2) and (R3), varying the experimental parameters of pressure, temperature and soak time. The overall objective is to provide further detailed information of factors which influence formation of anisotropy or mesophase in resultant semicokes. Pressure was varied during the progress of a pyrolysis. Yields of gases, liquids and semicokes were obtained. Gases were analysed by gas chromatography, the liquids by simulated distillation and 1H-NMR, and the semicokes by elemental analysis and FTIR. For the semicokes from R1, yields are dominantly a function of pressure, with little influence of temperature and soak time. For semicokes from R2, yields are dominantly a function of pressure and temperature, with little influence of soak time. For semicokes from R3, yields are dominantly a function of temperature and soak time, with little influence of pressure. The use of simulated distillation and pressure release, at reaction temperatures, provides additional information about mechanisms of the pyrolysis reactions.

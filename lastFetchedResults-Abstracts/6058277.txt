Flight Control System (FCS) is a key component in aircraft. The high reliability of FCS is needed to ensure the safety flight. In order to achieve the high reliability and make the overall mass and volume as small as possible, mission reliability of the multi-redundancy voting structure of FCS is used as the objective function. The types of the elements and the number of redundancies are chosen as the design variables. The optimization results show that the multi-redundancy voting structure of FCS is more reliable than the single-channel FCS.

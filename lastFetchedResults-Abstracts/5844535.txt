This paper presents an analytical model to quantify the radiated field by an insulated antenna. This antenna corresponds to a PLC transmission line with dielectric coat, the current distribution is assumed to be sinusoidal. The basic electromagnetic equations are formulated and applied to this insulated antenna in free space. The most advanced analytical model, corresponding to the far field radiation of linear antenna, has been proposed by R. W. P. King. In this case, the propagation constants (beta<sub>0</sub>) in free space and at the antenna surface (beta<sub>1</sub>) are equal and the field is computed at sufficiently great distances from the antenna (R GtL and beta<sub>0</sub>R Gt1). We improved this model by considering the practical case of insulated antenna corresponding to PLC transmission lines and we expand the validity of our model to the Fresnel zone. The main objective of this paper is to investigate a close- form and accurate formulation of the electromagnetic fields radiated at large range of frequencies, as well as to predict the electromagnetic transient effects; the case of coated antenna is considered. The propagation constants (beta<sub>0</sub>) in free space and at the antenna surface (beta<sub>1</sub>) are now different. Simulation results based on antenna theory are compared to our close-form approximation and shows very good agreement. The result can be applied to power line communication channel, corresponding to real and practical case of PLC applications. The model is developed using the frequency domain (FD), based on antenna formulation and correspond to asymptotic approximation. This model will be very useful to compute with less consuming time realistic scenarios of radiated field in far and intermediate zones.

Background: Laparoscopic technique has been applied to a variety of colonic and rectal operations, generally using carbon dioxide insufflation (CDI). However, CDI is inevitably associated with cardiopulmonary loading and can cause complications. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of gasless laparoscopic colonic surgery.

Methods: The abdominal wall was lifted up using an originally designed retractor. A small incision, 3 to 5 cm in length, was made at the start of the operation. The surgeon operated through this incision using both conventional and laparoscopic instruments.

Results: Operations were undertaken in 67 patients. In 6 patients (9%), conversion to open surgery was necessitated. In the remaining 61 patients, operations were completed with gasless laparoscopically assisted technique. Four reoperations (7%) were performed because of postoperative bleeding, anastomotic rotation, anastomotic stricture, and transmesenteric hernia. Fifty-three patients with colonic cancer were operated on with potentially curative intent. Of these, 1 (2%) developed hepatic recurrence during the mean follow-up period of 23.8 months. There was no port site recurrence.

Conclusions: Gasless laparoscopic colonic surgery is technically feasible. CDI is not necessary to perform minimal access surgery.

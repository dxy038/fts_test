Purpose: The objective of this research is to provide a step by step guide with a mix of tools for managers to align strategic objectives with the business unit project portfolio. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model is applicable for business units and medium enterprises. It is a sequential model that gives a smooth transition from strategic vigilance to a selection of projects and programs which helps the organization to attain a competitive advantage in industry environment. Based on the most common tools of strategic planning and foresight, the main idea is to generate some sense of sequence and feedback process, in order to select the best ideas for the resource allocation optimization. Findings: When the project portfolio is defined by a set of rules or criteria, the construction of a technology roadmap is the next logical step, not only to classify the projects but to create a path through which the organization can implement them. A methodology to plan all this process was developed. Originality/value: This proposed model helps in the integration of the strategic planning with the step-by-step process at the functional level to run the projects and programs.

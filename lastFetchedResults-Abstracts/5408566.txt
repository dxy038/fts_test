In this paper based on solution relationship between linear multi-objective programming (LMOP) and its corresponding linear programming, the dominant set of efficient solution of LMOP is defined. Some properties of the dominant set are given. Further, some properties of non-inferior vertexes dominant set of LMOP are discussed. According to properties of dominant set, Pareto efficiency of Pareto feasible solutions for LMOP is defined and investigated, which is used to deal with the best selection from different Pareto efficient solutions of the LMOP. Finally, an example is used to illustrate its application of Pareto efficiency.

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and densities of yeasts and filamentous fungi in coastal water samples as well as their correlation with the indicator bacteria of faecal pollution. The prevalence of fungi was investigated in parallel with the standard pollution indicator microorganisms in 197 marine water samples from six northern Greek prefectures during the bathing season Mayâ€“October 1999. Filamentous fungi were isolated from all the examined samples and yeasts from 29 (14.7%) of them; among the positive samples, their mean counts were 90.9 and 38.4 cfu/100 ml, respectively. A total of 23 genera of filamentous fungi and four genera of yeasts were identified. Prevailing genera of filamentous fungi were Penicillium, Aspergillus and Alternaria spp., whereas Candida spp. was the most frequently isolated yeast. Counts of yeasts were significantly (p<0.01) correlated with those of total and faecal coliforms, whereas no correlation was found between filamentous fungi and the indicator bacteria of faecal pollution. Significantly higher counts of total and faecal coliforms (p<0.05), and enterococci (p<0.001), were found during the months with the higher water temperatures and bather numbers. In the six prefectures, significant differences were observed in the counts of filamentous fungi and yeasts as well as in the counts of all the faecal pollution indicators. The results of this study indicate that coastal water can be a path for contamination of swimmers with yeasts and filamentous fungi and that the pollution indicator microorganisms cannot always predict their presence.

There is strong evidence of continuously increasing contamination of soils with platinum
group elements (PGE), in particular with platinum (Pt) from vehicle exhaust catalysts in
roadside soils. However, knowledge about the effects of Pt contamination on soil processes
is very limited. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the contamination of
soils with Pt at realistic environmental levels leads to observable adverse effects on selected
indicator parameters of the carbon and nitrogen turnover in soils. Incubation experiments
with artificially contaminated soils and solutions containing dissolved organic matter
(DOM) were carried out by the use of milled material from a Pt-containing vehicle exhaust
catalyst. Interaction of the catalyst material with the soil resulted in a mobilization of Pt into
the dissolved phase reaching up to 0.1% of the added Pt. The amount of Pt mobilization
seemed to be mainly driven by the pH of the soil. Mineralization of carbon and nitrogen did
not reveal any significant adverse effect of the Pt addition as compared to the control
samples. Future studies dealing with Pt effects on soil processes should focus on
environmental conditions favoring Pt mobilization, e.g. such as very low pH values or
large concentrations of DOM.

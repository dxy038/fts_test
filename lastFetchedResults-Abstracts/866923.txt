This paper describes remote probing, a method that employs the principle of external pivoting and evaluates points with respect to their objective values from a given basic point, i.e., without ever moving out of that basic point. Once a point is deemed sufficiently good, the method moves to that point in a single simplex step, and from there on, the regular primal simplex method commences. In that sense, remote probing can be seen as preprocessing for the primal simplex algorithm.

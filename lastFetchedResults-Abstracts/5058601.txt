An improvement in the effectiveness of information retrieval by using genetic algorithms (GAs) and fuzzy logic is demonstrated. A new classification of information retrieval models within the framework of GAs is given. Such a classification is based on the target of the fitness function selected. When the aim of the optimization is document classification, we deal with document-oriented models. On the other hand, term-oriented models attempt to find those terms that are more discriminatory and adequate for user preferences to build a profile. A new weighting scheme based on fuzzy logic is presented for the first class of models. A comparison with other classical weighting schemes and a study of the best aggregation operators of the geneÂ´s local fitness to the overall fitness per chromosome are also presented. The deeper study of this new scheme in the term-oriented models is the main objective for future work

A circular polarized (CP) slot antenna is designed with a slot composed of multiple circular sectors (MCS). The design has advantages of having a wide 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 57.4%, achieving a good AR smaller than 2 dB in most areas of the frequency range. The design of the antenna follows a multi-objective optimization procedure that applies computational power rather than human tuning. A comparison of the optimized antenna design with other wideband CP antennas in the literature shows that it has advantages of having a smaller physical size in the cross-sectional area than the antennas with multiple feeding structures and a wider operating bandwidth than all the compared antennas.

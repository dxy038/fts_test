Since energy conservation is one of the important issue now days and making our planet pollution free. For these purposes researchers are suggesting alternatives. Battery fed motor vehicles is one of the emerging option rather than conventional fuel vehicles. Bidirectional DC-DC converters are now mostly used in electric vehicles. The main reason behind this is to operate motor in two quadrants as motoring and regenerative for making efficient operation. Bidirectional DC-DC converter consists of buck and boost converter. During motoring mode energy is supplied through a battery and in regenerative mode battery is charged through a DC link created. This paper primarily gives attention on control strategy used for operation. In this gate complimentary control used to trigger initially turned off switch and divert current through anti parallel connected diode of initially active switch so that main switch can be triggered under zero voltage switching.

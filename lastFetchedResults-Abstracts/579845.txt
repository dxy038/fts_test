The study was conducted in two settlements of ethnic communities in Triyuga municipality of
Udayapur district, Nepal. The main objective of the study was to prepare an inventory of cultivated
diversity of plants and animal species by the ethnic communities in the research site and their use in
farming and in sustaining the livelihoods. The study has been based on data collected through personal
interview with the farmers, focus group discussion, non-participant observation as primary source and
also on secondary data collected from related publications of various organizations. The study has
revealed that farmers grew and maintained different varieties and landraces of cereals, vegetables,
fruits, fodder crops and livestock species and were found utilizing different species of plants and
animals in farming and in sustaining their livelihoods. This justifies that the traditional ways of
managing the natural resources have often resulted in landscapes of relatively high biodiversity value,
compared with those associated with modern practices.

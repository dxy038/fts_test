Image quality assessment plays an important role to the 3G network QoE/QoS planners. A great deal of effort has been made in recent years to develop objective image quality metrics that correlate with perceived quality measurement. Unfortunately, there is a lack of non-simulation image material to optimize the algorithms and the parameter settings. In this paper, we suggest a method to capture the frame of video phone on Dtivy&#8482; A2000+H platform. With these frames, the objective image quality assessment algorithms could be improved so that they are used more targeted.

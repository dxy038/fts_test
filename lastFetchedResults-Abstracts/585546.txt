In this study, a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is
utilized to extract interpretable and compact fuzzy rule bases for modeling
nonlinear Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) systems. In the process of non-
linear system identification, structure selection, parameter estimation, model
performance and model validation are important objectives. Furthermore, se-
curing low-level and high-level interpretability requirements of fuzzy models
is especially a complicated task in case of modeling nonlinear MIMO systems.
Due to these multiple and con
icting objectives, MOGA is applied to yield a set
of candidates as compact, transparent and valid fuzzy models. Also, MOGA
is combined with a powerful search algorithm namely Di erential Evolution
(DE). In the proposed algorithm, MOGA performs the task of membership
function tuning as well as rule base identification simultaneously while DE
is utilized only for linear parameter identification. Practical applicability of
the proposed algorithm is examined by two nonlinear system modeling prob-
lems used in the literature. The results obtained show the eectiveness of the
proposed method.

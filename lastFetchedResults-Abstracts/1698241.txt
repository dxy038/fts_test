Proper predictions of the behaviour of shock absorber materials are of utmost importance in safety assessments for licensing casks for transport and storage of highly active waste. After having identified significant discrepancies between numerical results and the actual response of polyurethane foam limiters subjected to accidental scenarios, a new research project ENREA was established by BAM. A major objective is to enhance and to develop advanced material models intended to simulate limiters under impact loading. They should account for all major factors influencing the loadâ€“deformation relationship like temperature, strain rate and specific stress state. The corresponding test program, applicable plasticity models, the overall parameter identification strategy based on local and global optimization techniques as well as experimental and numerical results are presented here in particular for closed cell foams.

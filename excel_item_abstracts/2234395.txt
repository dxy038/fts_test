Plastic deformation of Zr54Cu38Al8 bulk metallic glass (BMG) was subjected to a novel ceramic rolling process. Mechanical properties, shear bands morphology and thermodynamic parameter of the as-cast and as-rolled samples were investigated by compression test, micro-hardness test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), respectively. The results show that the metallic glass exhibits a large plastic deformation without fracture through ceramic rolling at room temperature and high strain rates. Especially, when the alloy is rolled to a diameter reduction of 10%, the ductility and strength of the alloy is significantly improved.

The paper studies the nonautonomous bidirectional associative neural networks systems with time-varying delays. By applying Lyapunov functional method, introducing many parameters, and combining this with the techniques of inequality analysis, a series of criteria of the uniform ultimate boundedness, global exponential stability, and the existence of periodic solutions are obtained. The results obtained in this paper are new and useful.

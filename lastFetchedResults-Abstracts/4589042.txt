The main objective of this presented research work is to implement a steganography application simply based on a new image histogram modification approach. An image histogram is a type of histogram which acts as a graphical representation of the tonal distribution in a digital image. The stego images, obtained using the proposed data hiding method, are inherently robust against main geometrical attacks such as rotation, scattered tiles and warping. The application of proposed method has comparatively higher secret data embedding capacity than its counterparts, as well as providing relatively enhanced PSNR results. Not only has it improved the data embedding capacity from 300-360 bits to 665-747 bits but also the PSNR from 53.10-55.18 dB to 56.01-62.75 dB for the well-known Lena, Baboon and Pepper images, compared to one of its important counterparts.

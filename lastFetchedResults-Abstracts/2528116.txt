Inroduction and Objective:In this study, effects of different riboflavin level were investigated on growth rate and Immune parameters of Acipensernudiventris were investigated.Material and Methods:A total of 120 juvenile Acipensernudiventris with initial weight (30.6±1.28 SD) were fed to saturation by 4 diet contained (protein: 49%, lipid: 14% and energy 21.1 Mj/kg) that were supplemented by riboflavin (0, 15, 20 and 25 mg/ kg) so called RB0, RB15, RB20 and RB25 in 8 weeks.  Biometey were carried out in of 15 days interval. In the end of experiment, blood sles were collected from fish and transported to laboratory for some immune system parameters analysis.Results: Riboflavin supplemented in diet caused a significant increase in final weight compared with control (P20 were significantly higher than other treatment and fish belonged this treatment had highest protein efficiency ratio (PER)  and lowest feed efficiency ratio (FCR) (P50 in fish fed RB20 were priority than control group  (PConclusion: The result of this study indicated that supplementation of riboflavin in diet have benefit effect on Acipensernudiventris juvenile growth and immune parameters.

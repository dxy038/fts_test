Objective: To compare the serum profile of malondialdehyde (MDA) lipid peroxidation and major antioxidant (Vitamins E and C) in patients with Plasmodium falciparum and vivax malaria. Methodology: This comparative study was conducted at Department of Biochemistry, Sardar Patel Medical College, Bikaner, India. A total of 150 patients were studied. This included 100 patients with confirmed malaria (50 with Falciparum and 50 with vivax) and 50 healthy age matched subjects as control. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured to assess the degree of lipid peroxidation. Antioxidant status was measured by estimating the levels of Vitamins E and C. Result: This study suggests that serum malondialdehyde levels were significantly increased in malaria patients. The patients with Plasmodium falciparum infection showed significantly increased levels of lipid peroxides(Mean Â±S D 3.22+1.09 ; p< 0.001)when compared to Plasmodium vivax malaria (2.49 + 0.86 ; p< 0.001). The antioxidant Vitamins E (p< 0.001) and C (p< 0.001) were decreased significantly in malaria patients in both the groups. Maximum decline in Vitamin C (0.20 + 0.07 ; p< 0.001) was observed in Plasmodium vivax malaria. Conclusion: Lipid peroxides are significantly raised in malaria patients; more in falciparum than vivax malaria. The antioxidants (Vitamins E and C) are decreased in both types of malaria. The protective role of routine antioxidant therapy in malaria patients needs further investigation.

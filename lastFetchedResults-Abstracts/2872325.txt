The permanent magnet materials are better, particularly after the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets were discovered. These improvements have made line start permanent magnet synchronous machines (LSPMSM) more popular. The line start permanent magnet synchronous machine has several advantages such as a maintenance-free operation, high controllability, robustness against the environment, high power factor and high efficiency. In this study, design and optimization of LSPMSM have been realized for three different rotor configuration to determine best efficiency*cos/kg and efficiency*cos/cost ratio. Two objective functions used for determine best ratio of LSPMSM.

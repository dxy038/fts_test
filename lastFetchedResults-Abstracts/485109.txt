Background and Objective: In this study the degree of starch gelatinization in Lavash bread was studied as affected by weight of the bread, baking conditions, and storage time.
Materials and methods: The degree of starch gelatinization was determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. In this technique, certain intensities and heights of a peak pattern for different weights of bread indicate gelatinization of starch.
Result and Disscusion: The intensities and the heights of peaks of XRD for breads with different
weights ( 100, 200, and 300 g) followed the V pattern. Therefore, gelatinization of starch had occured. The diffractograms obtained on the third and fifth days of storage indicated gradual appearance of crystals and show that starch crystallization occurs quickly in Lavash bread. This seems to be due to a low moisture content of the bread. Further analysis of the data indicated that neither the weight of the bread nor the baking conditions have any effect on the gelatinization process.
Concision: Gelatinization of starch in Lavash bread occurs only as a function of storage time.

This study revisits and broadens the question as to whether asymmetries exist in the New
Zealand mortgage and short-term interest rate spread. Frost and Bowden’s defined
spread is replaced by the difference between the mortgage and the official cash rates and is
interpreted as the mortgage premium in this revisit. In addition to confirming
asymmetries findings by Frost and Bowden, this revisit reveals three new results that
were not addressed before. First, the estimation results indicate that the mortgage
premium experienced a structural break in January 1994, corresponding to the
anticipation, as well as the implementation, of the 1994 Fiscal Responsibility Act.
Secondly, the empirical results reveal that New Zealand banks asymmetrically price their
mortgage rates consistently with the consumer reaction hypothesis as articulated by
Stieglitz and Weiss (1981). In fact, estimation results reveal that the mortgage premium
adjusts to the threshold faster when the official cash rates fall relative to the mortgage
rates, widening their difference, than when the official cash rates move in the opposite
direction. Third, the findings also reveal the bidirectional Granger causality between the
mortgage rate and the official cash rate, indicating that the mortgage rate and the official
cash rate affect each other’s movement. These findings mean that the housing mortgage
market responds to monetary policy, and monetary authority also responds to housing
mortgage market conditions because the official cash rate is the primary instrument of the
monetary authority.

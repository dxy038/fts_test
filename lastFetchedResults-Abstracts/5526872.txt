This paper presents a new technique of Reactive Power Optimization called Random Selection Paths RSP, where a new implementation depending on limit the region search and choosing the candidates of the control variables randomly has been applied. The objective function of the proposed algorithm is to minimize the system active power loss. The control variables are generator bus voltages, transformer tap positions and switch-able shunt capacitor banks. The new technique can easily treat with the both of continuous and discrete control variables and has been applied for practical IEEE 6, IEEE 14 and IEEE 30 bus systems. The proposed algorithm shows better results as compared to previous work.

Background: Brain tissue segmentation for delineation of 3D anatomical structures
from magnetic resonance (MR) images can be used for neuro-degenerative disorders,
characterizing morphological differences between subjects based on volumetric analysis
of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but only if
the obtained segmentation results are correct. Due to image artifacts such as noise, low
contrast and intensity non-uniformity, there are some classification errors in the results
of image segmentation.
Objective: An automated algorithm based on multi-layer perceptron neural networks
(MLPNN) is presented for segmenting MR images. The system is to identify
two tissues of WM and GM in human brain 2D structural MR images. A given 2D
image is processed to enhance image intensity and to remove extra cerebral tissue.
Thereafter, each pixel of the image under study is represented using 13 features (8
statistical and 5 non- statistical features) and is classified using a MLPNN into one of
the three classes WM and GM or unknown.
Results: The developed MR image segmentation algorithm was evaluated using
20 real images. Training using only one image, the system showed robust performance
when tested using the remaining 19 images. The average Jaccard similarity index and
Dice similarity metric for the GM and WM tissues were estimated to be 75.7 %, 86.0%
for GM, and 67.8% and 80.7%for WM, respectively.
Conclusion: The obtained performances are encouraging and show that the presented
method may assist with segmentation of 2D MR images especially where categorizing
WM and GM is of interest.

With the consideration of the group decision-making behavior for power distribution system dispatch, a distribution network service restoration multiple attribute group decision-making approach using entropy weight and group eigen value is proposed in this paper. Firstly, five evaluation indices such as the quantities of restored load, the number of switching operations and the rate of load balancing are introduced. With the introduction of entropy weights and objective weights, the schemes are comprehensively evaluated. On this basis, the group eigen value method for service restoration scheme is introduced based on the Perron-Frobenius theorem. And the numerical method is used to calculate the vector of the idealized expertÂ´s comprehensive evaluation X*, namely to obtain the preferred sequence of service restoration schemes. A case study on the six-feeder distribution network indicates that the proposed method can give a rapid and efficient group decision-making for service restoration.

The objective of this study was to develop natural dyed fabrics with thermo-regulating properties. Microcapsules (MCs) containing n-octadecane and n-eicosane were applied to the natural indigo-dyed cotton fabrics using the dot-screen printing method. A 50/50 mixture of the two MCs was also applied. At similar loading amounts for the microcapsules, the fabrics were capable of absorbing 18.66, 14.80, and 14.68 J g−1 of latent heat for the n-eicosane MCs, the n-octadecane MCs, and the mixture of the two MCs, respectively. After 20 laundering cycles, about 94% of the latent heat was retained. The color of the fabrics changed negligibly with color difference (ΔE*) ranged 0.45–1.00 after MCs treatment and ranged 1.69–2.00 after 20 launderings. The latent heat was retained 70–89% after rubbing tests and 92–96% after ironing tests using a cover fabric in damp condition.

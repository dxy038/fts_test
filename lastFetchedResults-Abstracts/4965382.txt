In this paper, the delay sensitive transport (DST) protocol is presented for wireless sensor networks (WSN). The objective of the DST protocol is to timely and reliably transport event features from the sensor field to the sink with minimum energy consumption. In this regard, the DST protocol simultaneously addresses congestion control and timely event transport reliability objectives in WSN. In addition to its efficient congestion detection and control algorithms, it incorporates the time critical event first (TCEF) scheduling mechanism to meet the application-specific delay bounds at the sink node. Importantly, the algorithms of the DST protocol mainly run on resource rich sink node, with minimal functionality required at resource constrained sensor nodes. Performance evaluation via simulation experiments show that the DST protocol achieves high performance in terms of real-time communication requirements, reliable event detection, and energy consumption in WSN

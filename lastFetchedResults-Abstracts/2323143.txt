Objective: The autoimmune diseases tend to coexist with diabetes mellitus type I (T1DM). The concomitance of these two types of diseases will lead to poor glycemic control beside their own complications. In this study the prevalence of thyroid disorder and celiac disease among T1DM patients in Yazd, Iran was evaluated.
Materials and Methods: all the patients diagnosed as T1DM in Yazd younger than 18 years old were investigated for the presence of thyroid disorders and celiac by measuring T3, free T4, TSH, Anti TPO and anti-tTG IgA. In positive celiac disease laboratory tes, intestinal biopsy was done to confirm the presence of this disease. Data gathered from all patients were analyzed using SPSS software version 18th.
Results: Eighty one patients consist of 38 boys and 43 girls involved in our study. Six patients (7.4%) consist of 4 girls and 2 boys presented hypothyroidism with positive Anti TPO. Two patients (2.4%) presented positive anti-tTG IgA that both were confirmed by intestinal biopsy.
Conclusion: due to the considerable prevalence of thyroid disorders and celiac disease among T1DM patients, serologically screening for autoimmune diseases and then annually for any new onset is suggested.

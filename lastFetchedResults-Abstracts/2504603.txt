Background: Despite its frequency, the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is still a difficult diagnosis in endocrinology, gynecology, and reproductive medicine. The Rotterdam consensus conference proposed to include the ultrasonographic follicle count as a new diagnostic criterion. Unfortunately, its assessment does not offer sufficient reliability worldwide.
Objective: To explore the possible roles of altered circulating androgens and anti-mullerian hormone among PCOS women regarding their body mass index and their outcomes after IVF.
Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, 195 women with PCO were included, they were divided according to their body mass index (BMI  < 27 kg/m2) as obese PCOS (n=91) and overweight PCOS (BMI ?27 kg/m2) (n=104). Serum levels of androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEAS], testosterone and androstenedione [A4]), and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) were assessed and compared with the endocrine profile and cycles outcomes.
Results: AMH, A4, FSH, and TSH concentrations were significantly higher in obese than in overweight women (p?0.001). Contrary, LH: FSH ratio values, E2, PRL and DAHE-S levels were significantly lower in obese than in overweight women (p?0.0001). Total oocyte retrieved, mature and fertilized oocyte were significantly higher in obese than in overweight women. Among pregnant obese PCOS women both AMH and A4 were significantly increased and DAHE-S was significantly decreased compared to pregnant overweight PCOS women.
Conclusion: Obese PCOS women have a higher chance of getting pregnant over those categorized as overweight PCOS. Also, androgens and AMH levels recommended to be considered in IVF attributes among obese and overweight PCOS women.

This paper provides the novel mathematical framework and solution for a multi-objective optimisation problem that accurately considers both VoIP Quality of Service (QoS) and security metrics under the same scheme. An offline optimization routine can then make the appropriate selection of available codecs, variable voice payloads and cryptographic algorithms that simultaneously maximise the volume of calls fed into the network and the Level of Encryption (LoE) for each corresponding call, for a given VoIP service.

This paper discusses about the Autonomous AU Bicycle: Self-Balancing and tracking control (AUSB<sup>2</sup>). The system will be explained in two parts; balancing and tracking control. In the balancing part, the gyroscope and encoder are used to sense the balance position of the bicycle, the position of the flywheel. Compass, GPS and encoder are used for the tracking control. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the implementation methodology of the bicycle robot and the balancing and tracking control methods.

This electronic document presents the research developed on a R&amp;D Project for the Energy Recovery Department of Rio de JaneiroÂ´s distribution company, Light S.E.S.A. The main purpose is prioritizing the grid investments on non-technical losses reduction actions. The work was developed along eighteen months, and resulted in experimental software. It analyses the historical results of the actions, allocating optimally the resources to a pre-defined period of time. The methodology consists of a statistic model based on historical results processed through a decision three optimization algorithm in order to maximize the objective function. It was tested on decision making process regarding grid investments to reduce non-technical losses, and the Return-on-Investment results were quite satisfactory.

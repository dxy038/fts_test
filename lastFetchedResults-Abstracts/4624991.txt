In this paper, an algorithm inspired from quantum evolution and particle swarm to evolve combinational logic circuits is presented. This algorithm uses the framework of the local version of particle swarm optimization with quantum evolutionary algorithms, and integer encoding. A multi-objective fitness function is used to evolve the combinational logic circuits in order obtain feasible circuits with minimal number of gates in the design. A comparative study indicates the superior performance of the hybrid quantum evolution-particle swarm inspired algorithm over the particle swarm and other evolutionary algorithms (such as genetic algorithms) independently.

This paper investigates the problem of robust exponential H<sub>&#8734;</sub> static output feedback controller design for a class of discrete-time switched linear systems with polytopic-type time-varying parametric uncertainties. The objective is to design a switched static output feedback controller guaranteeing the exponential stability of the resulting closed-loop system with a minimized exponential H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance under average dwell-time switching scheme. Based on a parameter-dependent discontinuous switched Lyapunov function combined with FinslerÂ´s lemma and Dualization lemma, some novel conditions for robust H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance analysis are first proposed and in turn the static output feedback controller designs are developed. It is shown that the controller gains can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are numerically efficient with commercially available software. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

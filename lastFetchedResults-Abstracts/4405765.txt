In order to achieve the interoperability among different devices made from different manufacturers, IEC61850 protocol is applied to the energy management system of microgrids (MEMS) in this paper to make the standardization of data communication among the microgrid. The communication system model of three layers for the microgrid is proposed and applied into microgrids. And the IEC61850-based data model for a microgrid is established based on the characteristics of IEC61850 standard modeling, the real-time data in MEMS and objective-oriented concept. In the proposed data model, the whole distributed generation (DG) unit or a load unit is considered as a logical physical device with different data nodes. A wind generating unit is taken as an example to illustrate the proposed modeling process in detail. The proposedIEC61850 Client and Server based communication system and corresponding testbed are also developed in this paper. The test results verify that the proposed method provides an effective technical way for the equipment integration, operation analysis and intelligent control in microgrids.

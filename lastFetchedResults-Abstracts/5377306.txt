Based on analysis of matter-element theory applied in water quality assessment, enterprise competitiveness evaluation, human resource evaluation, and power quality evaluation, this paper put the theory into electricity services management and constructed an electricity supply service quality evaluation index system for the matter-element analysis model with combination of relevant research results. Then, through an example of quality grading, matter-element analysis model construction, correlation function calculated, weight calculated, and degree of membership determined to illustrate the validity of the theory. Analysis indicates that the matter-element theory applied to evaluate the power quality of service is effective, and has an objective and comprehensive characteristics of the evaluation results.

Pyrolysis of oil shale was performed to produce shale oil. The effect of heating rates on the density, viscosity, solidification point, pour point, calorific value as well as distillation of shale oil was investigated. The results showed that the density of shale oil increased gradually with a rise of the heating rates. The solidification point and pour point increased, while increasing to some extent, then decreased. The shale oil obtained under 15&#176;C/min has the highest solidification point and pour point values. The calorific value of shale oil decreased gradually. Shale oil was distillated at different heating rates, and the distillate yield of each temperature range was different. The main objective of this study is to characterize shale oils to lay the foundation for industrial production of shale oil in the future.

The main objective of this educational paper is to provide an updated survey of ASIC and FPGA technologiesÂ´ convergence in reconfigurable and embedded systems. Through the analysis of design methodologies and strategies facing multi-core and power consumption challenges we will follow that evolution approaching ASIC and FPGA architectures on the embedded systems arena.

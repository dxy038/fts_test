In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneous determination of optimal due
dates and optimal schedule for the single machine problem with multiple common due
dates. The penalty for a job is assumed to be a linear function of the due date and the
earliness/tardiness for the job. The objective function is to minimize the total penalty for all
jobs. We show that with the introduction of learning to job processing times the problem
remains polynomially solvable for a given number of multiple common due dates.

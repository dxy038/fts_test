Background: Histopathological diagnosis of lesions arising from the intake of tobacco is based on
subjective evaluation of morphological alterations within the lesional tissue. Oral exfoliative cytology
is a non-invasive diagnostic technique for early detection of oral premalignant and malignant lesions.
Morphometric techniques have been advocated as objective and reproducible methods of detecting
changes before they are visible by routine microscopy and can facilitate differentiation of normal
and abnormal epithelium. This study was conducted to assess the morphometric parameters (cell
diameter, nuclear diameter and nuclear cytoplasmic ratio [N:C ratio]) in tobacco smokers and
chewers and to evaluate the variations, if any.
Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on cytological smears obtained from oral
lesions of patients with habit of tobacco smoking (Group B) and tobacco chewing (Group C). Group
A comprised of subjects free from oral lesions and not using tobacco in any form. Patients with
both the habits were excluded. The smears were stained using Papanicoloaou staining method. For
morphometric analysis, Microimage 3.0 image analysis software was employed. The statistical test
employed was an analysis of variance and P  <  0.05 was considered as signifi cant.
Results: The results of this study showed that the cellular diameter was progressively reduced and
nuclear diameter progressively increased from Group A to Group B to Group C. The N:C ratio
also showed a progressive increase from Group A to Group C.
Conclusion: The results confirmed that tobacco chewing and smoking influenced the
cytomorphology of normal appearing buccal mucosa and the degree of these changes were found
to be greater in chewers as compared to smokers.

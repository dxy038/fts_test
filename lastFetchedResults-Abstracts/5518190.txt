Predictive video decoding is a technique for reducing end-to-end delay and/or concealing frame loss in video communications. In this paper, we propose an improved predictive decoding technique that incorporates the estimation of the ordinal depth of moving regions, and uses it to compose the predicted frame. Ordinal depth information enables occlusion prediction in the future frame, allowing the predictor to synthesize a more realistic frame. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better subjective and objective quality of synthesized frames compared to a state-of-the-art block-based frame prediction approach.

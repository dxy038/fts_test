The CCTA, Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency, is part of HM Treasury and has the broad objective to improve the return on IT spending in central government. The agency views PCTE from the perspective of information systems or administrative computing. They are concerned to promote interoperability of software, portability of skills, in a word, open systems. The CCTA has taken important initiatives in this field and is therefore interested in the promotion of PCTE.

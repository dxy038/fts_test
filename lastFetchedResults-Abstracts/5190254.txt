Cooperative task assignment for multi UAVs is a key problem of cooperative command and control systems. A cooperative task assignment model is built based on multi agent technology. Every UAV is an agent and every mission is a task. Objective function is the sum weights of threat cost, route cost, time delay, attack cost and so on. At the end, genetic algorithm was adopted for searching the optimal cooperative task assignment policy. The simulation result shows that the model built in the paper is effective and the multi agent technology is an effective approach for cooperative task assignment.

The SPIHT (set partitioning in hierarchical trees) algorithm has attracted great attention in recent years as a technique for image coding. Not only does it give good objective and subjective performance, it is also simple and efficient. In this paper we propose an enhanced image lossless image compression that is based on SPIHT. The most important modification in this algorithm is the addition of a simple modification to the set of type A with a new test on the threshold. Our experiments show that this improvement increases the performance of lossless image coding for all standard test images

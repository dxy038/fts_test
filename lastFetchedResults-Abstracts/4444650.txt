This paper studies robust knapsack problems, for which solutions are, up to a certain point, immune to data uncertainty. We complement the works found in the literature where uncertainty affects only the profits or only the weights of the items by studying the complexity and approximation of the general setting with uncertainty regarding both the profits and the weights, for multiple objective functions. We also propose pseudo-polynomial-time algorithms for some special cases.

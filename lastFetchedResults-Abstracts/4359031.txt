Information technology has put enterprises into global competition, and the process of preparing global software products is being abundantly discussed everywhere. Decision-makers find that various kinds of decision problems are emerging in this process; thus, decision support systems (DSS) are playing an important role in this area. This paper introduces a DSS which can be applied by small-to-medium-sized (SM) software companies already holding a marketable product and facing the challenges of the global market. A multiple-value analysis-based model is introduced to assess multi-objective, intangible impacts, uncertainty and ill-posed problems that SM software companies might be able of responding to within a continuously changing and unpredictable environment. A three-layer DSS framework for software production in the face of a global market is first introduced. Then, a general value model tree can help to better organize the value deployment of the system. Further research concerning real decision scenarios is presented and progressed after this

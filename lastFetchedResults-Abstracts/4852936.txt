Sonoran Desert is a potential pseudo-invariant site that can be used for vicarious calibration of satellite sensors. However, the surface and atmospheric anisotropy of the site first needs to be characterized for the precise evaluation of the long-term stability of the sensors. In this study, the anisotropy of the desert site is investigated by applying widely used bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models to the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance of Landsat 5 TM data. Time series of the original and BRDF-normalized TOA reflectance are first presented, and the radiometric stability of the time series is computed by using the BRDF-normalized TOA reflectance of the Landsat data.

Energy Management for multi-mode Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems remains a daunting challenge. In this paper, we focus on the issue of task allocation for multi-processor based systems with hybrid processing resources that can be reconfigured. With the objective of minimizing energy, we propose a fast, energy aware static task mapping heuristic to minimize the average overall energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic is capable of achieving results that are within 20% of the optimal solution while providing orders of magnitude speedup in processing time.

This paper proposes a coordination optimization method between traffic control and traffic guidance so as to alleviate traffic congestion spatially and temporally. Firstly, this paper summarizes the state of art in this field and brings forward the existing problems. Secondly, considering both network equilibrium control optimization and signal timing optimization, a coordination optimization model including optimization objective function and restriction is proposed. Then, a solution algorithm based on genetic algorithm is proposed. Finally, this paper selects a region with 30 intersections in Changchun city as field test region, uses field data and simulation data to test the method. It comes a conclusion that this method could alleviate traffic congestion to some extent.

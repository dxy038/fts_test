This paper describes the modeling of the Acrobot composed of 2 links with a curved contour and the rolling motion control for this Acrobot. The outer contour of each link is shaped from the arc whose radius is different at the tip and the sidepiece of the link. As the model changes according to the contact point between the Acrobot and ground, it is difficult to control the whole motion via common control strategy. From an intuitive analysis based on systempsilas energy when the Acrobot rolls with a certain constant relative angle, control strategy is constructed in two phases when the Acrobot rolls with lowering or raising the center of the gravity of itself. But, because the control in upward phase needs to lower the COG of the Acrobot, the collision between robot and ground becomes unavoidable. Therefore analysis at collision is also conducted. At last, by setting the output functions that can achieve the control objective in each phase and applying output zeroing control, continuous rolling motion is realized in numerical simulation.

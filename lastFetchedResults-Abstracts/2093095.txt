This study investigates the optimization of gold dissolution from Aghdarre ore. Therefore, a laboratory
investigation was initiated, to improve the leaching conditions with the objective of maximizing mill
capacity with no reduction on gold recovery. It was observed that the time reduction from 25 to 15 hours did
not change gold recovery. In other words, it indicated that a capacity of 140t/h can be sustained without any
detrimental effect on gold recovery. The optimum parameters were 700g/t NaCN, 46% solid in pulp, pH=10,
and d80=45 microns using the Taguchi method. So, the gold recovery was obtained 90.71%. Also, it was
concluded that the NaCN concentration was the most effective parameter and the solid percent plus retention
time had the lowest effect on this process.

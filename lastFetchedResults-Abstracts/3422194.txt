Damping of multi-modal oscillation through supplementary control of a single flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) device is illustrated here. This often requires multiple feedback signals in a centralised multi-input single-output framework for which extension of the classical control design approaches is not straight forward. Past contributions have either focused on decentralised design of low-order PSS in an SISO or MIMO framework; or alternatively, on robust control design techniques which of course, result in higher order controllers. An attempt to design a fixed (low)-order controller, which is robust and is able to damp multiple swing modes with a single FACTS device is presented. The control design problem is formulated as a multi-objective parameter optimisation and solved using a standard evolutionary optimisation technique. Possible post-contingency operating conditions are considered explicitly during the design phase itself to reduce the conservativeness. The present exercise is a step forward towards use of wide area measurement systems for closed-loop supplementary control (around the primary voltage and/or power flow control loop) of the FACTS devices to improve the transfer capacity of the existing corridors.

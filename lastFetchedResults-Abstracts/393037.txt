Objectives
Congenital laryngeal anomalies are less frequent, but their causes are surprisingly variable. In addition, a variety of synchronous airway lesions as well as comorbidities are accompanied. The objective of this study was to review of patients with congenital laryngeal anomalies presenting as chronic stridor in our experiences.
Methods
Fifty-five patients, 30 male (54.5%) and 25 female (45.4%), were enrolled in this study, and their hospital records were retrospectively reviewed.
Results
The most frequent diagnosis was laryngomalacia (36.4%), followed by subglottic stenosis (30.9%) and vocal cord paralysis (29.1%). Twenty-six (47.3%) of the 55 patients had synchronous airway lesions, whereas thirty-one (56.4%) had various comorbidities. Further analysis was performed in patients diagnosed with laryngomalacia, subglottic stenosis, or vocal cord paralysis, which are major causes of congenital laryngeal stridor. The frequency of synchronous airway lesions was not different significantly in these three groups. On the other hand, the frequency of establishment of airway in patients with laryngomalacia was significantly lower compared to those with subglottic stenosis or vocal cord paralysis. Moreover, median duration of the symptoms and the proportion of patients with poor outcome and decease in laryngomalacia were shorter and lower than that in subglottic stenosis or vocal cord paralysis.
Conclusions
While a variety of congenital airway anomalies were causes of chronic stridor, laryngomalacia was the most frequent diagnosis. Severe condition and progression of symptoms should increase suspicion of the synchronous airway lesions and/or comorbidities, which may be important factors for outcome as well as indication of surgical intervention.

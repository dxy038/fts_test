Connections are drawn between the global thermodynamical interpretation of quantum mechanics and the reductionist Cantorian-fractal space-time approach. The objective is to show the influence of the thermodynamical approach on development in both fields and to explain how Cantorian space can serve as a geometrical model for a space-time support of the thermodynamical approach to quantum mechanics. Seen through both theories, quantum mechanics could appear to be the result of a turbulent but homogeneous diffusion process in a transfinite non-smooth micro space-time with an area-like quantum ‘path’. Time symmetry breaking is then a consequence of the transfinite information barrier of Cantorian space-time. An important result found here is that the four dimensionality of micro space-time is a consequence of a discrete Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the elementary Cantor sets forming this space. In fact, it will be shown here that many of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics can be traced back to the contraintuitive character of the underlying unstable and nonsmooth Cantorian geometry of micro space-time.

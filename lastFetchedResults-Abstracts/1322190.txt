Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty ac-ids (MUFA). A number of studies support the hypothesis that SCD gene regulation and polymorphism may affect fatty acid composition and fat quality in meat and milk. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cod-ing region of the bovine stearoyl-CoA desaturase gene have been predicted to result in p. 293A (alanine at amino acid 293) and p. 293V (valine at amino acid 293) alleles at the stearoyl-CoA desaturase1 locus. The objective of this study was to characterize polymorphisms of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) gene in Khuzestan buffalo population. This is the first study of SCD1 gene polymorphism in Iranian buffalo. The blood samples were taken from 85 buffalo of Khuzestan-Iran population. Genomic DNA was extracted using a kit DIAtom DNA prep. After this, PCR reactions were made by using primers that encloses exon V. A 400 bp fragment amplified with standard PCR method. The PCR products were digested by NCO1 re-striction enzyme with PCR-RFLP method. All samples were genotyped on 3% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Electrophoretic mobility shift determined that there were not genetic differences be-tween these animals in the studied region by using NCOI enzyme. Also, this study showed that genotype frequencies were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for SCD1 gene.

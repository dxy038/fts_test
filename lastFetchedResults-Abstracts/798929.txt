This paper is devoted to the continuity of solution maps for perturbation semi-infinite vector optimization problems without compact constraint sets. The sufficient conditions for lower semicontinuity and upper semicontinuity of solution maps under functional perturbations of both objective functions and constraint sets are established. Some examples are given to analyze the assumptions in the main result.

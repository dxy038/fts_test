This paper presents a 2.8 GHz slot antenna over an EBG (Electromagnetic Band Gap) substrate with the objective of higher antenna efficiency, wide bandwidth and compact operation in close proximity to the human body. To achieve compact size, two different size EBGs are developed and the antenna return loss and efficiency are measured in a reverberation chamber. From these results, the EBG substrate demonstrates 60% improvement of the antenna efficiency compared to other methods in the wearable antenna scenario.

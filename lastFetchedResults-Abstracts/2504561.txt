In manufacturing activities, issues such as the intensity of competition, rising and changing customer expectations, and ever-increasing technological developments, intensify manufacturer commitment to eliminate defects in its products and eliminate any deviation from standard performance. To realize the above objective, today's organizations use a tool called Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to ensure flawless products are sent to markets. This method, while being useful, has some downsides, including non-use of the weighting method. Most current risk assessment methods use the Risk Priority Number (RPN) value to evaluate the risk of failure. However, traditional RPN methodology has been criticized as having several shortcomings. Therefore, in this paper, an efficient simplified algorithm to evaluate the ordering of risks for failure problems is proposed. RPN also never considers the relationship between failure mode and failure reason. To resolve these problems and improve the FMEA method, it uses three algorithms, Taguchi, Gray Relational Analysis, DEMATEL and their combination. The case study is the TOOS automotive care company and the piece under examination is the door hinge of SAMAND.

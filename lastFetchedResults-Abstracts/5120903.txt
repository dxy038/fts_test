Since the penetration of wind power in power system is increasing greatly it is urgent to study the impact of wind power on the dynamic stability of power system. Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is widely utilized in large wind power plants. Therefore the dynamic behaviors of DFIG wind turbines is necessary to be studied. This paper presents the impact of static VAr compensator (SVC) on the dynamic stability of power system connected to DFIG. In order to improve the dynamic stability, control parameters of SVC need to be set optimally. In this article, we offer a suitable choice of objective function and then be optimized by genetic algorithm. The dynamic simulation results give us information such as the impact of SVC on the performance of DFIG and synchronous generators dynamic performance. MATLAB is used for executing the dynamic simulation.

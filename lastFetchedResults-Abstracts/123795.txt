History and Objective: Considring the role to importance economic and helth of large intestinal nematodes in domestic animals and lack of information on its Condition in Iran, this study was carried out to determine large intestinal nematodes of domestic animals slaughtered of Kashan. Materials and Methods: The descriptive and randomized strategy of this study was conducted on 195 digestive tract from 80 sheep, 78 goats and 37 caws from different agricultural regions of Iran, Animal 's characteristies and microscopic findings were recorded in special form. Data were calssifled and statistically analyzed.
Results: A total of 195 large intestinal tracts, 80 sheep, 78 goats and 37 caws were examined. A nematodes infection rate was Chabertiidae (54%) Ttrichuridae (38.5%) and oxyuridae (7.5%).
The all case in female were more frequently infected than males. The contamination rate of intestinal infection with Trichuris discolor in sheep and goats 95%, 18%, Chbertia ovina 58.8%, 62.8% and in caws Trichuris ovis 1.8%, Oesophagostomum venulosum 10.8% respectively. The contamination rate of Skrjabinema ovis in sheep 25%, goats 39% and caws 8.2% respectively.
Conclusians: Due to the relatively high prevalence of intestinal nematodes in rumenants. We suggest further studies to determine the causes and decrease contamination and the role of different factors.

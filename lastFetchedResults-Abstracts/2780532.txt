Improving resource utilization has been a hot issue in heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs). This paper proposes a radio resource management (RRM) method based on access proportion optimization. By considering two or more wireless networks in overlapping regions, users in these regions must select one of the networks to access when they engage in calls. Hence, the proportion of service arrival rate that accesses each network in the overlapping region can be treated as an optimized factor for the performance analysis of HWNs. Moreover, this study considers user mobility as an important factor that affects the performance of HWNs, and it is reflected by the handoff rate. The objective of this study is to maximize the total throughput of HWNs by choosing the most appropriate factors. The total throughput of HWNs can be derived on the basis of a Markov model, which is determined by the handoff rate analysis and distribution of service arrival rate in each network. The objective problem can actually be expressed as an optimization problem. Considering the convexity of the objective function, the optimization problem can be solved using the subgradient approach. Finally, an RRM optimization scheme for HWNs is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance the throughput of HWNs, i.e., improve the radio resource utilization.

In this paper, we consider a single machine scheduling problem with piecewise-linear deterioration
where its objective is to minimize the number of tardy jobs, in which the processing time of each job
depends on its starting time where all the jobs have a specific deterioration rate. The problem is known
to be NP-hard; therefore a Branch and Bound algorithm and a heuristic algorithm with O(n2) are proposed.
The proposed heuristic algorithm has been utilized for solving large scale problems and upper
bound of the B&B algorithm. Computational experiments on 1840 problems demonstrate that the Branch
and Bound procedure can solve problems with 28 jobs and 85.4% of all the sample problems optimally
showing the high capability of the proposed procedure. Also it is shown that the average value of the ratio
of optimal answer to the heuristic algorithm result with the objective Pð1   UiÞ is at last 1.08 which is
more efficient in contrast to other proposed algorithms in related studies in the literature. According to
high efficacy of the heuristic algorithm, large scale samples are also being solved and the results are presented.
A specific form of this problem is also being considered and it is proven that the B&B procedure
can handle problems with more jobs even up to 44 jobs.

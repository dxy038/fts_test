The objective of the SMOScat project is to operationally provide soil moisture at 1 km resolution or better over Catalonia. A downscaling algorithm is applied to 40 km resolution L2 SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) soil moisture product using 1 km resolutionMODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. High resolution soil moisture is compared with in situ measurements collected each month from April to October 2011 in a dryland and irrigated area. Our results show and increase of correlation coefficient with in-situ measurements when high resolution soil moisture is used. The 2012 experimental field campaign will address topography issues.

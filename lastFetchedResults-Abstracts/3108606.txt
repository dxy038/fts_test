This paper details techniques which are instrumental for successful implementation of advanced refinery control. The basis of the paper is a reformer advanced control installation at a petroleum refinery. Specific topics covered are: 1) Project objective definition 2) Dynamic computer simulation and training 3) On-line commissioning Application of these methodologies have been used successfully in commissioning advanced microprocessor based explicit dynamic gradient control on an existing catalytic reformer. System commissioning was done while the process was on-line, without requiring the need of costly process downtime and swings. Control loop performance is presented in the results summary section.

In this paper a new method is designed to account price of military software, which is based on option pricing models. Firstly, it is introduced about the basic knowledge of option pricing model. And then the military software pricing model is provided based on Black-Scholes option model and binomial tree model. Several variables in reference to military software price are redefined in the related models. Then, in order to calculate the software price, we build up system of equations, of which one is Black-Scholes equation and the other one is binomial tree equation. Lastly, a case study is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the model. The study results and sensitivity analysis show the factors that influence the real price of software and the consistency of two classic option pricing models in practical application. In addition, one of the factors-volatility plays an important role in military software pricing based on Black-Scholes model, and there is a further research to make it clear and objective.

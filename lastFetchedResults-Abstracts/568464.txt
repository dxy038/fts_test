Objective correlative is the non-vocal expression of emotions through a set of sophisticated situations, events which bring to the reader the same emotions. In other words, the writer instead of direct expression of emotions, illustrates them by object, situations and events in order to influence the reader. This disinterested or impersonal theory of foregrounding emotions or experiences in art and poetry is also being used in the poetic vocations of both Nima and Shamloo. So the present comparative study intends to show the manifestation of the term objective correlative in some of the poems by these two poets, which does not seem to have received so far a significant attention by the researchers. Of Nimas poems, the authors have selected: Guard of night, Night whole night and Night, Call him, and of Shamlooâ€™s poetical vocations they have chosen: Rejected, Where is the flower, There is nothing to say, Euology, Connection, Ibrahim in the fire, and Plan.

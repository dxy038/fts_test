In this letter, we propose a novel dynamic cell on/off scheduling algorithm in small cell networks based on the Stackelberg game. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to optimize the packet throughput performance with a tradeoff of energy consumption. In our system-level simulations, the proposed algorithm exhibits considerable performance gains, in terms of packet throughput per unit of energy consumption, compared with two existing algorithms respectively based on random on/off and packet arrival-triggered cell activation.

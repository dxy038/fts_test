Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of mixture of berberis lycium, galium aparine and pistacia integerrima in carbon tetrachloride (CCL4)-treated rats.Material and Methods: This study was conducted in the animal house of the Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad in the year 2000. A total of 20 rats were divided in 4 groups of 5 rats each. 1.Normal Control Group: with no medication given 2.CCl4 Treated Group: only CCl4 was given 3.Hepatopreventive group: Initially treated with medicinal plants mixture followed by CCl4 4.Hepatoprotective group: Initially treated with CCl4 followed by medicinal plants mixture Then blood sample from each rate was collected and analysed for ALT, AST and ALP. Results: The rates included in the study were male Sprague Dawley rats (albino) weighing 150-300g received from the animal house of the NIH, Islamabad. ALT , AST and ALP activities were significantly raised (P<0.001) in hepatocurative groups as comparative to the normal control, and decreased (P<0.001) as compared to the CCl4-treated rated and the hepatopreventive group. While the hepatocurative group treated with aqueous extract of the mixture of medicinal plants decrease more than treated with suspension of medicinal plants mixture and alcoholic extract. Conclusion: The results this study indicates that a mixture of Berberis lycium, Galium aparine and Pistacia integerrima have hepatoprotective effects. These medicinal plants have more effect as curative agents rather than preventive agents.

This paper presents a concurrent brightness and contrast scaling (CBCS) technique for a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit TFT-LCD display. The proposed technique aims at conserving power by reducing the backlight illumination while retaining the image fidelity through preservation of the image contrast. First, we explain how CCFL works and show how to model the non-linearity between its backlight illumination and power consumption. Next, we propose the contrast distortion metric to quantify the image quality loss after backlight scaling. Finally, we formulate and optimally solve the CBCS optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the fidelity and power metrics. Experimental results show that an average of 3.7X power saving can be achieved with only 10% of contrast distortion.

Evaluation and selection of green sustainable development (GSD) strategies is a critical but difficult process involving many uncertain factors and affected by dynamic conditions. The decision problem is essentially multi-objective. This research proposed a simulation based method that uses simulation to capture the complicated process flow and decision logic involved, and interface the simulation with a search procedure to improve solutions. The design of simulation model emphasized a robust structure that represents adequately the process flow and decision logic of typical applications of GSD improvement. A process/activity based cost structure was built into the simulation to capture essential trade-offs contributed by different cost drivers during the process of GSD implementation. Experiments were designed and implemented via simulation to verify and validate proposed concepts. An analysis of response surface method (RSM) was conducted to illustrate the search for optimal solutions under relaxed conditions, which showed the potential of developed research.

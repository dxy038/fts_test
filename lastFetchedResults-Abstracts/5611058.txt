This paper aims to find the most optimal Grey-Fuzzy routing algorithm within multinomial time about the NP-complete problem of multi-objective optimization QoS routing. With the help of Grey-Fuzzy theory, this algorithm achieves an O(mn) time complexity through integrating the QoS metrics to a Grey-Fuzzy synthetic attribute according to its membership degree and grey degree. Our algorithm can use different optimization strategies according to various services dynamically. The final paradigm shows that this algorithm is feasible and can find a none-inferior or even the optimal solution. Also, it has certain expansibility, robustness and tolerance to inaccurate network information.

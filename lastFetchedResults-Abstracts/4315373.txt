Aimed at the problem of multi-objective optimization, solution on the oversaturated signalized intersection by using fuzzy logic control (FLC) is presented. The essential and characteristics of multi-objective optimization in urban traffic signal control are analysed. The performance measures of minimizing average delay, stop times and average queue length are established, according to the initial queue length, real-time arrival rate and departure rate. Given real-time traffic information, the FLC controller decides on whether to extend or terminate the current green phase based on a set of fuzzy rules. Compared with the conventional fixed time traffic controller, the FLC is proved to be useful and effective with the simulation results and have good performance in the average delay of vehicles, and particularly be applicable to over saturated intersection.

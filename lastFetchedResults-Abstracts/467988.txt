OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine the contribution of plasma lipids to the pathophysiology of cyclic mastopathy, before and after consideration of diet and sex hormones.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-four women with severe cyclic mastopathy (case patients) and 29 women without cyclic mastopathy (control subjects) recorded their breast symptoms daily during 1 menstrual cycle. During each menstrual phase (follicular, early luteal, late luteal, and menstrual) they prospectively completed 2 24-hour dietary diaries, provided blood for lipid and hormone assays, and underwent anthropometric measurements.
RESULTS: Mean age was 34 years. Premenstrual breast swelling and tenderness were significantly more severe in case patients (P< .0001). Cyclic change (late luteal vs follicular) of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol differed between case patients and control subjects, with case patients having a relative excess of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the premenstrual phase (P = .01). Dietary fat intake was greater throughout the cycle in case patients (37.5 vs 33.7% of calories, P = .02), and case patients reported increased appetite in the premenstrual phase (P = .01). In multivariate analyses the contributions of mean dietary fat intake and of cyclic change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were independently significant, with odds ratios for upper versus lower quintiles being slightly >5.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with cyclic mastopathy had a relative excess of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol during the symptomatic late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and a higher fat intake throughout the cycle than did control subjects. These observations support the hypothesis that lipids (notably high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and a high-fat diet play a role in the pathophysiologic characteristics of cyclic mastopathy.

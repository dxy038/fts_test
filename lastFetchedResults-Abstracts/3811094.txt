A new direction-oriented interpolation method is proposed and then applied to de-interlacing. The proposed method introduces the upper spatial direction vector. (USDV) and the lower spatial direction vector (LSDV) to obtain more accurate direction of the highest spatial correlation. Using the USDV and the LSDV, the proposed method reduces possibility of wrong decision for the highest-correlated spatial direction. Line-based directional interpolation is performed after the direction vector is found. Extensive simulations conducted for images and video sequences show the efficacy of the proposed method over the previous methods based on the ELA and over the line averaging method in terms of the objective and subjective image quality.

A novel evolutionary algorithm based on quantum computing concepts is applied to engineering optimization problems. Quantum computing mimics behavior of atoms in processing information. Quantum inspired algorithm is a concept, which employs certain elements of quantum computing to use in a wider class of search and optimization problems. The main parts of a quantum-inspired algorithm are the qubits (quantum equivalent of bits) and the quantum gates. Qubits hold the information in a superposition of all the states, while the quantum gates evolve the qubit to achieve the desired objective, which is, in optimization the maximum or the minimum. The paper addresses the ability of the Quantum-Inspired Evolution Algorithm (QIEA) to solve practical engineering optimization problems. QIEA, which is developed by authors, is based on their previous work and it is extended to acquire the floating-point representation of the information. The RQIEA is tested on a four benchmark engineering optimization problems. The results showed that the new algorithm has the ability to compete and even overcome other well known methods.

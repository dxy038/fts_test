Incorporating sensor nodes with data aggregation capability to transmit less data flow in wireless sensor networks could reduce the total energy consumption. However, the penalty from data retransmissions due to collision could jeopardize the advantages from data aggregation. In this paper, for the first time, we consider the energy consumption tradeoffs between the data aggregation and retransmission in wireless sensor network. By using the CSMA-CA MAC protocol, the retransmission energy consumption function is well formulated. We propose a rigorous non-linear mathematical formulation, where the objective function is to minimize the total energy consumption of data transmission subject to data aggregation tree and data retransmission. The solution approach is based on Lagrangean relaxation in conjunction with the optimization-based heuristics. From the computational experiments, it is shown that the proposed algorithms could construct more energy efficient data aggregation tree with MAC layer retransmission mechanism than existing data centric algorithms up to 93%.

Inroduction & Objective: The protein source of high quality protein supplements commonly used in community sport. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect12 sessions of circuit resistance training with whey protein on apolipoprotein M- HDL cholesterol levels and lipid profile in non-athletic men. 
Material and Methods: This type of application and research of quasi-experimental design with a control group and the group receiving whey protein (50 gr) that immediately after each practice was given orally to the subjects, respectively. The training program for 12 sessions follow: three sessions in each week with one hour circuit resistance training in each session. Data analyzed using SPSS-18 and independent and dependent T student tests and the used a significance level of 0.05.
Results: Significant decrease of apolipoprotein M- HDL total cholesterol level and HDL3 cholesterol were observed in comparison with prior phase (P=0.01). Significant increase of HDL2 cholesterol was observed circuit resistance training group comparison with prier phase (P=0.03).
Conclusion: This study showed that circuit resistance training affecting but positive effects have on the lipid profile changes in untrained young men.

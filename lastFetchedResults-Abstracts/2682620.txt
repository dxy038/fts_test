One of the main concerns in flight performance is to determine the highest level of capabilities for flying vehicles to perform the assigned missions. The objective of the current research is to utilize the maximum aerodynamic and propulsive capabilities of a flying robot. In this regard, the problem of optimal performance during all phases of a mission profile is proposed. By integrating a multi objective heuristic optimization algorithm with constrained optimization approaches, all phases of a typical mission profile have been optimized. The major advantage of the proposed approach is that it provides the optimal time history for all state variables as well as the optimal flight path and the amount of required fuel.

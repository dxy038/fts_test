The application of nonelectrical diagnostic techniques to analyze solid dielectric insulation, especially from aged cable, was the objective of two projects initiated by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). These projects, RP-7897-01 at the University of Connecticut (UConn) and RP-7897-02 at Institute d´Recherche d´Hydroquebec (IREQ), which were started in the mid-1980s and are now reaching completion, focused on analytical test method application and study. A brief description of the work is given.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

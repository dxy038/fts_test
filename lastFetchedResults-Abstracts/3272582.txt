We present in this paper the architecture of an energy-efficient high-voltage compliant microstimulator and recording interface dedicated for intracortical visual prosthesis. The system consists of a capacitive-link based bidirectional transceiver, an inductive-link energy recovery unit, a flexible microstimulation module including a high-impedance microelectrode driver, and a recording interface based on an ultra-low power analog-to-digital converter. Two different technologies, IBM CMOS 0.13&#956;m, and DALSA Teledyne 0.8&#956;m 5V/20V CMOS/DMOS, are used to implement the device in 2 chips. The microelectrode driver is incorporated with an array of highly-configurable high-voltage switches, which are supplied with &#177;13 Volts. The measurement results show that the system delivers up to 180&#956;A through emulated microelectrode-tissue interface impedance with an average value of 100k&#937;. The measured static power consumption of the high-voltage chip is 0.735mW.

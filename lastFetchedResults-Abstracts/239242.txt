The traditional energy-resources allocation problem is concerned with the allocation of limited resources among the end-uses such that the overall return is maximized. In the past, several techniques have been used to deal with such a problem. In this paper, the energy allocation process is looked at from two points of view: economy and environment. The economic objectives include costs, efficiency, energy conservation, and employment generation. The environmental objectives consider environmental friendliness factors. The objective functions are first quantified and then transformed into mathematical language to obtain a multi-objective allocation model based upon pre-emptive goal programming techniques. The proposed method allows decision-makers to encourage or discourage specific energy resources for the various household end-uses. The case of Lebanon is examined to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed technique.

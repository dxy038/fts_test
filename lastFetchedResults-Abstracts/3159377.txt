After the establishing of lapping trace equation with planet mechanism, based on the simulated trace distribution state, the problems about the lapping trace density were analyzed, and the machining parameters were chosen by the method of numeric calculation, then the objective of lapping the work-piece such as: silicon slice, thin glass sheet etc. uniformly and with high speed can be obtained.

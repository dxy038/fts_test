The present study was carried out with the objective of validating linked SSR markers to Rf genes and adopting Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) for restorer/non-restorer line detection in Wild Abortive (WA) type of Cytoplasmic Male Sterility (CMS). Twelve SSR markers reported to be linked to Rf genes were analyzed in the mapping population of NedaA/Pajouhesh. Among these, three markers, namely, RM258, RM171, and RM3148 proved to be associated with Rf genes. In this study, on a set of rice lines including 2 restorers, 4 maintainers, and 9 conventional varieties (totally 15 genotypes of rice), MAS with RM258 and RM171, a major Rf locus on chromosome 10, and RM3148, another Rf locus on chromosome 1, both of the Rf alleles in Hashemi and Deylamani varieties were amplified the same as restorer lines. However, Pouya, Khazar, and Shastak had one Rf locus (partial restorer). Cultivars Shiroudi, Tabesh, Fajr, and Shafaq were identified as non-restorer (maintainer) lines. Results demonstrated that these markers could be used for screening of genotypes to identify restorers and non-restorer lines in hybrid rice breeding programs.

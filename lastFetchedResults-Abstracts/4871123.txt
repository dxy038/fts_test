The connection-oriented data service has been previously introduced in the IEEE 802.6 standard to support variable bit rate applications for which a certain guarantee on quality of service is required. So far, the proper tuning of the parameters of this service remains an open issue. In this work, we undertake the study of this service with the main objective of defining the needed mechanisms to properly set-up the parameters of the connection oriented service according to various quality of service requirements

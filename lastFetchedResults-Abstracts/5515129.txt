Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) and Cloud Learning Environments (CLEs) aim at offering learners a personalised and responsive e-learning experience. Towards this objective, we propose the use of evolving e-learning ontologies in order to enrich the knowledge base of these learning environments with valid metadata. In particular, we define a process for the evolution of e-learning ontologies, capturing changes that occur in the learning domain, the learning resources, or the profiles of learners. The purpose of this evolution process is to ensure the validity of the metadata of the learning environmentÂ´s knowledge base, so that valid and updated recommendations can be provided to learners.

Cloud computing allows users to access resources on demand. The size of data centers increase with the increasing demand for resources by users. Increase in the size of data centers is directly proportional to energy consumption. The total energy requirement has to be minimized by distributing virtual machine requests over data centers optimally, with the consideration of prices of distribution of virtual machines. These two parameters are taken into account to frame the objective function for the Virtual Machine Distribution across Data Centers. Here both servers and workloads are classified as IO bound and CPU bound. A greedy algorithm framework has been used to obtain sub-optimal solutions for virtual machine distribution problem. Simulation results obtained indicates in favor of best fit allocation.

This contribution presents a modulator and demodulator design of a 5.8 GHz Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transponder. Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is used as modulation scheme for the bidirectional data communication. Thus, the transponders analog frontend consists of an envelope detector and a comparator for the upstream (reader to transponder) and a backscatter modulator based on a single transistor for the downstream (transponder to reader).

Survivability of optical burst switching (OBS) network was concerned. Bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) protocol which had the ability of fast failure detection was adopted in the failure detection for OBS links and nodes. Moreover, a BFD-triggered failure detection mechanism combines with Fast Reroute (FRR) is proposed and simulated. Simulation results show that the solution stated above can deal with both link failure and node failure in OBS networks.

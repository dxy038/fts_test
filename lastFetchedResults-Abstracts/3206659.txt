A broadcast scheme based on probabilistic flooding technique for mobile wireless networks is proposed in this paper. This new broadcast scheme for wireless mobile networks combines the agility of the probability based schemes and the simplicity of the MPR schemes, where the dynamic broadcast routes are created based on a node´s resources and connectedness. The proposed scheme does not place the responsibility of selection solely on the source and the maximum length of communication is only 1-hop node length. This set of protocols is expected to optimize the broadcasting against nodes´ mobility and ensure fault tolerance within the network. The main objective is to address the broadcast storm problem of simple flooding scheme while extending the network lifetime. The proposed approaches have been implemented and compared with pure probabilistic flooding, and simple flooding schemes.

In this paper, a novel mathematical model is proposed to deal with job scheduling in cellular manufacturing system considering deterioration items. First, a nonlinear integer programming is proposed then transferred to a linear one. The objective function of the proposed model is two-fold. The first part is related to production planning cost such as production cost, inventory holding cost, backordering cost and deterioration cost, and the other part is related to scheduling cost in cellular manufacturing system such as cells setup cost and inter-cell movements. Machine availability and planning horizon are also considered. Due to the complexity of this problem, solving the model using classical optimization methods needs a long computational time so applying branch and bound method is just possible in small problems. So, the performance of the proposed model is verified based on some test problems.

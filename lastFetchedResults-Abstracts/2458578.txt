The ARIES-AT blanket has been developed with the overall objective of achieving high performance while maintaining attractive safety features, simple design geometry, credible maintenance and fabrication processes, and reasonable design margins as an indication of reliability. The design is based on Pbâ€“17Li as breeder and coolant and SiCf/SiC composite as structural material. This paper summarizes the results of the design study of this blanket.

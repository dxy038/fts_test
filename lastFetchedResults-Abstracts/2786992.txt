This paper addresses the problem of proving stability for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), where vehicles communicate via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless technology. The control objective is to guarantee that the vehicle platoon moves with a common reference velocity given a desired spacing policy. The proof of exponential stability of the adaptive cruise control strategy is provided in the presence of time-varying delays and communication structures beyond the classical predecessor-follower architecture. Numerical simulations are included to illustrate and support the theoretical results.

The difficulty in interpreting ultrasound images and the scarcity of trained ultrasonographers to manipulate a transducer to the optimal position are the basic premises for establishing the SYRTECH project (Tele-Scanning Robot System). The principle objective of this project is to enable an expert ultrasonographer to perform an ultrasound scan examination on a remote patient using master and slave stations. The master is the doctorÂ´s post and the slave is the robotic system supporting the scan probe. The clinical expert is then able to interpret the transmitted images and move the slave arm in order to obtain the best orientation of the ultrasound beam on any anatomical part of the remotely located patient. This paper presents the master/slave system developed in our laboratory and the chosen robotic solution

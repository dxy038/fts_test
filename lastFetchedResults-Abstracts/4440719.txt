We have developed and evaluated a novel tool based on haptics and virtual reality technology for augmenting the teaching of palpatory diagnosis. This novel tool illuminates palpatory diagnosis concepts by touch on a laptop PC using affordable haptic interfaces. There are six training modules each targeting a specific aspect of palpation. The difficulty level for all modules is adjusted automatically by measuring userÂ´s performance in real-time. The haptic interface used in this study was the PHANTOM Omni<sup>&#174;</sup> (SensAble Tech., Inc.) and it was modified to enable manipulation with only one finger. 22 osteopathic medical students (16 first- and 6 second-year) participated in the evaluation of the system. The majority of the participating students (&gt;;90.9%) thought that future practice with the system may help them develop their palpatory skills. The majority (&gt;;77.3%) of the students also thought that the instructions on the module screens were clear. When the students were asked about the user interface, most of the students (&gt;;86.4%) responded that it was clear and easy to interpret. Evaluation results also showed that when the students were asked whether they would like to use the modules in the future for training at least 90.9% of them answered &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;Maybe&#8221;. The achievement of purpose ratings for individual modules changed between 6.27 and 8.82 on a 10-point scale. This system can be used for unlimited student practice for improving skills from Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine laboratory and also as a repeatable and objective measure of palpatory skill to track student progress.

Background and Objective: Overweight and obesity are the major health problems in the world. Increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is very important due to the effect on blood lipids composition and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the blood lipids status and its association with body mass index among adolescents in Qazvin city, Iran.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 318 individuals aged 10 to 18 years in Minoodar City of Qazvin were selected using cluster randomized design. Demographic, anthropometric and biochemical data were collected. Data were analyzed using t-test and ANOVA.
Results: The results showed that 9.7% of the participant adolescents were underweight, 15.7% were overweight and 4.8% were obese. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and elevated LDL cholesterol were 19.6%, 11.3% and 12.9%, respectively, and HDL cholesterol levels were lower than the recommended amount in 23% of the subjects. There was a significant correlation between the level of blood triglyceride and body mass index (P = 0.02).
Conclusion: The overweight and obese adolescents had higher concentrations of blood triglycerides compared to the adolescents with optimal weight. Therefore, it seems that weight control is an effective way to reduce blood lipid metabolism disorders in adolescents.

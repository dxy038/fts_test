Determining burn patients’ need for inpatient rehabilitation at discharge is difficult and an objective clinical indicator might aid in this decision. The functional independence measure (FIM) is a validated outcome measure that predicts the need for rehabilitation services. This study evaluated the utility of the FIM score for discharge planning in burn patients. A retrospective chart review and FIM score determination was performed on all major burn patients discharged from a regional adult burn centre between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2000. From 164 adult burn patients discharged, 37 met the American Burn Association criteria for major burns. One patient had insufficient data. Therefore, 36 patients were studied (mean age 47.3 ± 17.4 years, and mean body area burned 27.4 ± 12.9%). All 17 patients with FIM scores greater than 110 were discharged home, and patients with FIM score of 110 or lower were discharged to another institution (rehabilitation hospital n = 14, other acute care hospital n = 4, or a nursing home n = 1) p < 0.0001. A discharge FIM score of 110 or lower was strongly associated with the need for inpatient rehabilitation, while a FIM score greater than 110 indicates the patient is independent enough to manage at home. Further prospective studies will be necessary to validate these findings.

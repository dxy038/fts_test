The purpose of this study is to compare contrast-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) portograms to Doppler sonography in detection of portal venous abnormalities. Thirty-five consecutive patients, who were suspected of having portal venous system abnormalities, were examined with MR portography and Doppler sonography. Vascular abnormalities were identified in 27 of 35 patients. There was statistically significant agreement between the results of MR portography and Doppler sonography. The major limitation of contrast-enhanced 3D MR portography was its inability to provide objective hemodynamic data regarding flow direction and flow pattern.

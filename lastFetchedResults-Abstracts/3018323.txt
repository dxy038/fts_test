This paper presents an overview of the architecture and algorithms implemented in IBMÂ´s text-independent speaker verification system developed for the 2002 NIST speaker recognition evaluation, particularly for the 1-speaker detection task using cellular test data. We describe individual components including a Gaussianization front-end, celluar-codec post-processing, modeling, discriminative optimization and scoring steps. A combination of multiple, data-perturbed systems using a discriminative objective so as to achieve optimum performance for a low false alarm operating region obtained the top performance in the NIST 2002 1-speaker detection task.

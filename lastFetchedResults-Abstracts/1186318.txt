We present a generic method/model for multi-objective design optimization of laminated composite components, based on vector evaluated particle swarm optimization (VEPSO) algorithm. VEPSO is a novel, co-evolutionary multi-objective variant of the popular particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). In the current work a modified version of VEPSO algorithm for discrete variables has been developed and implemented successfully for the, multi-objective design optimization of composites. The problem is formulated with multiple objectives of minimizing weight and the total cost of the composite component to achieve a specified strength. The primary optimization variables are – the number of layers, its stacking sequence (the orientation of the layers) and thickness of each layer. The classical lamination theory is utilized to determine the stresses in the component and the design is evaluated based on three failure criteria; failure mechanism based failure criteria, Maximum stress failure criteria and the Tsai–Wu failure criteria. The optimization method is validated for a number of different loading configurations – uniaxial, biaxial and bending loads. The design optimization has been carried for both variable stacking sequences, as well fixed standard stacking schemes and a comparative study of the different design configurations evolved has been presented.

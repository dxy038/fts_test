Sheep infected with the abomasal parasite, Haemonchus contortus, have reduced growth rates, decreased wool production, and anemia, and heavy infections may result in death. Anthelmintic treatment can remove worms, but the cost of treatment and prevalence of drug-resistant worms has led to greater focus on genetic resistance of the host to parasitism. Variation in parasite resistance exists within and among sheep breeds, and Caribbean hair sheep have greater resistance than most conventional wool breeds. Our objective was to investigate differences in gene expression between 24 parasite-resistant hair and 24 susceptible wool lambs to determine genetic mechanisms involved in resistance to H. contortus. Half of the animals of each breed were infected and sacrificed at 3 or 27 days post-infection; the remaining animals were uninfected controls. Breed differences in abomasum and abomasal lymph node tissue gene expression were assessed using bovine cDNA microarrays. Over 60 transcripts differed between breeds for each tissue and infection status. Genes differentially expressed between hair and wool sheep 3 days PI were assessed for gene function and mechanisms for greater immune cell infiltration, abomasal tissue repair, Th17 response, and anticoagulation were present in parasite-resistant hair sheep. By 27 days PI, hair sheep had greater expression of genes involved in gut motility, inflammatory cytokines, and cell proliferation and differentiation compared to wool sheep. Changes in these processes indicate Caribbean hair sheep have a stronger inflammatory response when infected with H. contortus which may facilitate the increased parasite resistance observed in these sheep.

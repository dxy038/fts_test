Asurvey of literature on karyotype analysis of male black rat (Rattus rattus) indicates that there is no unique consensus
on number and morphology of chromosomes. Several workers have reported the diploid chromosome number (2N) in black rat
as 38, 40 and 42. It was found that different strains of laboratory rats showed differences in the morphology of chromosomes.
Because of the fragment demonstration of chromosomes polymorphism and the geographic variations at its karyotype, the black
rat (Common house rat) has proved to be an interesting animal for chromosomal studies. The present investigation was
undertaken with an objective of determining its diploid chromosome number and describing the nature of its chromosomes. The Rattus rattus
was administered with 0.02% of colchicine for inducing mitosis. After 2 hours of colchicine treatment, the rat was
sacrificed by using anesthetic ether and dissected out the femurs. The present experimental results indicated that the diploid
chromosome number of Rattus rattus is 2n=38 and the karyotype formula is16m+ 4sm+ 16a +1X+1Y.

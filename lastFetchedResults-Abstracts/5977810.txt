An approach for estimating the three most important design parameters of computational devices has been proposed. On the basis of the proposed approach, a developer can estimate the reliability, speed and cost parameters with a &#8220;global optimization criterion&#8221;. This allows him to choose the optimal structure of the designed computational devices in the early design stage. As an example, different types of flip-flops have been investigated. Their global optimization criterion parameters have been estimated. An analysis of the investigationÂ´s results shows that the values of these parameters depend on the specific realization structure of the devices, and the input transition as well. The proposed approach can be applied using evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms

The main objective of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the seroprevalence of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) in a population of non-vaccinated beef cattle in the livestock region of Yucatan, Mexico and to determine potential risk factors related to the seroprevalence. Also, we estimated the intraherd correlation (re) and design effect (D) of IBR seropositivity. Cattle were selected by two-stage cluster sampling. Blood samples were collected from 564 animals from 35 herds. Sera were tested for antibodies against IBR using the serum-neutralisation test. Information regarding the herd and each animal sampled were recorded through a personal interview with the farmer or farm manager. The data were analysed using fixedeffects logistic multiple regression. Thirty-four of the 35 herds had at least one seropositive animal. The animal true seroprevalence was 54.4%. Animals in large herds or in production had higher odds of seropositivity than those in small herds or growing. The re and D were 0.17 and 3.62, respectively.

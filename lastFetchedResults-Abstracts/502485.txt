In the world today, the concept of citizenship has become attractive and has drawn attention of the most social and political scholars. Yet such attention and attitude toward citizenship is not merely related to scholarsâ€™ efforts alone but rather the concept itself merits attention because it is also an efficient tool in management and planning. Thus, today most issues and problems such as poverty, gender, inequality and even ecologic problems are analyzed from a citizenship perspective. It is in this vein that this article also focuses on efficiency of citizenship concept in the area of urban management. This article attempts to portray the position of citizenship in Tehran through some historical studies and research data. Our findings show that the concept of citizenship has not been meaningful and comprehensible for a considerable number of people and that there are some obstacles in the society which prevent people from achieving the consciousness about the rights and responsibilities; to reach a sense of citizenship. It seems evident that a sense of citizenship can be realized and promoted by removing the obstacles and by provision of objective and subjective conditions in the different segments of the society. Urban management can solve many urban problems through citizen-based programs.

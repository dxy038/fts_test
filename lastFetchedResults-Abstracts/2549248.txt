Objective: We used sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide (NO) releasing molecule,
to understand its effect on viability and proliferation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells (BM-MSCs).
Materials and Methods: This experimental study evaluated the viability and morphology
of MSCs in the presence of SNP (100 to 2000 ?M) at 1, 5, and 15 hours. We chose
the 100, 1000, and 2000 ?M concentrations of SNP for one hour exposure for further
analyses. Cell proliferation was investigated by the colony forming assay and population
doubling number (PDN). Na+, K+, and Ca2+ levels as well as activities of lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine
transaminase (ALT) were measured.
Results: The viability of MSCs dose-dependently reduced from 750 ?M at one hour and
250 ?M at 5 and 15 hours. The 100 ?M caused no change in viability, however we observed
a reduction in the cytoplasmic area at 5 and 15 hours. This change was not observed
at one hour. The one hour treatment with 100 ?M of SNP reduced the mean
colony numbers but not the diameter when the cells were incubated for 7 and 14 days. In
addition, one hour treatment with 100 ?M of SNP significantly reduced ALT, AST, and ALP
activities whereas the activity of LDH increased when incubated for 24 hours. The same
treatment caused an increase in Ca2+ and reduction in Na+ content. The 1000 and 2000
?M concentrations reduced all the factors except Ca2+ and LDH which increased.
Conclusion: The high dose of SNP, even for a short time, was toxic. The low dose was
safe with respect to viability and proliferation, especially over a short time. However elevated
LDH activity might increase anaerobic metabolism.

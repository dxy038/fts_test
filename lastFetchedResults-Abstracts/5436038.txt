Games are often used as a tool for teaching the elements and strategies of a problem. The objective of this paper is to define the sensor deployment problem as a game. The rules, game mechanics, and attributes are defined to abstract real life deployment situations while lowering the learning time to allow study of complex scenarios. This paper defines the fundamentals of the game and challenges the reader to study, solve, and define new strategies for sensor deployment problems. It is a fun and simple game, which has an element of entertainment, yet provides a foundation and framework for studying sensor deployment problems.

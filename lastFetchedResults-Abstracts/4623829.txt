Simulation is a widely accepted tool in complex systems design and analysis. However, it is essentially a trial-and-error approach, and is therefore, time-consuming and does not provide a method for optimization. Metamodeling techniques have been recently pursued in order to tackle these drawbacks. The main objective has been to provide robust, fast decision support aids to enhance the overall effectiveness of decision-making processes. This paper proposes an application of simulation metamodeling through artificial neural networks (ANNs). The proposed approach is composed of two main steps assisted successively by the &#169;Neuro Software. The first one consists of building the appropriate ANN model over second-order linear regression model. Based on this model, the second step is a reverse simulation metamodeling that will be used as an optimization tool. To validate the proposed approach, a real case study is adopted from literature (Yang and Tseng). It concerns an anonymous integrated-circuit (IC) packaging company in Taiwan. The case study problem is to maximize throughput performance. The comparative results with Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based metamodel results; illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Background and Objective: Impairment of alveolar mononuclear cell function due to cigarette smoking may increase the rate of respiratory infections. However, increased susceptibility of smokers to infections of other organs implies that tobacco effect is not restricted to the respiratory immune competent cells. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of smoking on urinary tract infection.
Subjects and Methods: This prospective case-control study was performed among 51 cigarette smokers (as cases) and 51 non smokers (as controls), from Sept 2005 to Sept 2006 in Ahvaz. There was no sampling, all included population, were randomly selected based on attending the study. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed by urine culture (colony count 105 bacteria per ml (male/female) with sensitivity 90% and specificity 95%). A questionnaire including demographic and clinical characteristics was filled for each individual. Data were analyzed in SPSS 13 by chi square test, P<0.05 were considered significant. Results: The incidence rate of urinary infection in smokers and non smokers were 27.5% and 21.6% respectively (P>0.05). The rate of two or more attack of urinary tract infection due to relapsed infection in smokers and non-smokers were 50 % and 27.3% respectively (P<0.05). Infection with more than one microorganism in smokers and nonsmokers were 71.4% and 12.5% respectively (P<0.05).

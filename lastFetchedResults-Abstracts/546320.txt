Due to a special producing procedure, cold-formed sections have curved corners. In the current design codes for cold-formed steel members, the presence of curved corners is ignored and its width is considered to be flat. The objective of this study is to show the effect of the corner bending radius on the local elastic buckling capacity of cold-formed sections in compression. For this purpose, two major cold-formed sections, namely, boxes (closed sections) and channels (open sections), have been studied. The Energy Method is used to predict the elastic buckling load of such sections by considering the torsional and warping properties of curved corners.

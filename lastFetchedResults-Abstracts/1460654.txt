Previous studies on carbon gasification have not included high unburned carbon content fly ashes, and therefore it remains unclear why not all fly ash carbon samples are equally suitable for activation. The concentration of active sites is well known to influence carbon gasification reactions. Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the effect of the concentration of active sites on the behavior of fly ash carbon samples upon steam activation. Six fly ash carbons were selected to produce activated carbons using steam at 850 Â°C. The concentration of active sites was determined by non-dispersive infrared analysis (NDIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD analyses were also conducted to determine the crystallite size. It was observed that the concentration of active sites played a more significant effect on the surface areas of activated carbons in the carbon burn-off zone of &gt;60%. Statistical analysis was used to relate the surface areas of activated carbon variances with carbon burn-off levels.

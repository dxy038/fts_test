The present work proposes three intelligent Load frequency controllers to control and regulate the power output and system frequency by controlling the speed of generator. Controllers are tested on two area thermal thermal interconnected power system. A multi objective function is created by two criterions Integral Square Error (ISE), and Integral of Time Multiplied Absolute value of the Error (ITAE). All of these objective functions are optimized by using Genetic algorithm (GA). Parameters for an area are determined by using these two controllers; both controllers use GA and the third controllerÂ´s parameters are calculated by an objective function which is formed by the combination of conventional objective functions. The aim of proposed controller is to restore the frequency to its nominal value in very short time. However proposed controller is tested and aimed for shortest settling time and minimum peak overshoot. It is found that the proposed controllers exhibit satisfactory over all dynamic performance when compared with conventional controllers. Two sets of observations are generated, in first observation set robustness of controller is tested by the step change in load, second observation test gives the effect of speed regulation on the frequency response. It is found that proposed controller provides a satisfactory balance between frequency deviations and transient oscillations.

The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effects of 14 years of weathering exposition on the microstructure and mineral composition of cementitious roofing tiles, still in service, reinforced with fique fibres (Furcrae gender). The results show that tiles under weathering exposition presented higher water absorption and apparent void volume than tiles under laboratory exposition. The continuous hydration of cement and natural carbonation filled the smaller pores but contrarily the large pores remained in the porous fibre to matrix interface in the samples exposed to weathering. On the other hand, their microstructure presented lower air permeability than samples aged in the internal environment of the laboratory. Besides, in the weathering aged tiles takes place a more intensive hydration process as it was identified greater amount of hydrated phases than in the laboratory aged specimens. The present results contribute to understanding the consequences of tropical weathering on the fibre-cement degradation.

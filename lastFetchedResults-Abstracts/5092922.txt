Availability of production equipments is one major issue for manufacturers. Predictive maintenance is an answer to prevent equipment from risk of breakdowns while minimizing the maintenance costs. Nevertheless, conflicts could occur between maintenance and production if a maintenance operation is programmed when equipment is used for production. The case studied here is a flow-shop typology where machines could be maintained once during the planning horizon. Machines are able to switch between two production modes. A nominal one and a degraded one where machine run slowly but increase its remaining useful life. We propose a mixed integer programming model for this problem with the makespan and maintenance delays objective. It allows to find the best schedule of production operation. It also produces, for each machine, the control mode and if necessary the preventive maintenance plan.

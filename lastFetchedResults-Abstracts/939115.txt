Disinfection for drinking water reduces the risk of pathogenic infection but may pose chemical threat to human health due to disinfection residues and their by-products (DBPs) when the organic and inorganic precursors are present in water. More than 250 DBPs have been identified, but the behavioural profile of only approximately 20 DBPs are adequately known. In the last 2 decades, many modelling attempts have been made to predict the occurrence of DBPs in drinking water. Models have been developed based on data generated in laboratory-scaled and field-scaled investigations. The objective of this paper is to review DBPs predictive models, identify their advantages and limitations, and examine their potential applications as decision-making tools for water treatment analysis, epidemiological studies and regulatory concerns. The paper concludes with a discussion about the future research needs in this area.

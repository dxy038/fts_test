The objective of the present work is to propose a numerical and statistical approach, using computational fluid dynamics, for the study of the atmospheric pollutant dispersion. Modifications in the standard k–ε turbulence model and additional equations for the calculation of the variance of concentration are introduced to enhance the prediction of the flow field and scalar quantities. The flow field, the mean concentration and the variance of a flow over a two-dimensional triangular hill, with a finite-size point pollutant source, are calculated by a finite volume code and compared with published experimental results. A modified low Reynolds k–ε turbulence model was employed in this work, using the constant of the k–ε model Cμ=0.03 to take into account the inactive atmospheric turbulence. The numerical results for the velocity profiles and the position of the reattachment point are in good agreement with the experimental results. The results for the mean and the variance of the concentration are also in good agreement with experimental results from the literature.

The Double Gate (DG) MOSFET has been proposed as potential alternative to the conventional bulk CMOS structure for extended CMOS scalability beyond 30 nm partly due to its immunity to short channel effects. So, the objective of this work is to provide an accurate drain current model based on an automatic parameter extraction method with PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) for Current-Voltage-based MOSFET models. Extracted parameter values reproduce I-V characteristics within 5% RMS error for wide range of gate lengths. It is shown that the I-V characteristics predicted by our analytical model are in close agreement with 2-D numerical simulation results.

Introduction & Objective: Varicocele is often mentioned as a common cause of testicular atrophy. The aim of this study was to evaluate varicocele-related testicular atrophy with Duplex sonography.
Materials & Methods: Seventeen patients with testicular atrophy due to varicocele were included into the study.
Results: Echogenisity of the atrophic testis was homogeneous. Mean peak systolic velocity (PSV) in intratesticular arteries for atrophic and normal testes were 5.57 ± 2.03 cm/s and    6.49 ± 1.37 cm/s, respectively. The difference was not significant (P  >  0.05).
Conclusion: Varicocele-related testicular atrophy is not associated with testicular parenchymal heterogeneity, and does not affect the intratesticular and testicular arterial psv.

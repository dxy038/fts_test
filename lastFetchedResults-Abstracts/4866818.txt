This paper describes a virtual reality and haptic interface between human and the atomic force microscope (AFM), which allows the operator to sense and touch the surface and nanoparticles during the manipulation with an AFM tip. The tip-sample interaction forces and intermolecular forces between the tip and surface are modeled based on Lennard-Jones potential and JKR theory, respectively. Our objective is to provide a 3D virtual reality interface capable of displaying topography of surface for the users and allow them to predict the results for the manipulation

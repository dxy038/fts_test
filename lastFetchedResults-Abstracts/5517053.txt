The network-planning of a middle-voltage distributed system includes branch planning and switch allocation. This two main aspects determinate the economy and reliability of a planning scheme. Therefore, taking the economy and reliability optimization as the two objectives, a multi-objective optimal model for branches and switches united planning of a distributed system is established in this paper. Based on the Pareto optimum theory, and by the specific genetic operators of Partheno-genetic algorithm (PGA), the proposed model is solved efficiently in specified connection mode. By constructing a rational fitness function and performing elitist preservation strategy, a well-proportioned Pareto solution set is obtained. From which the final network planning scheme can be found according to different actual engineering conditions. A typical example is used to verify the proposed model and algorithm to be effective. The results indicated that the proposed method can satisfied the different demands in engineering, and provides theory basis to flexible network planning of the distributed system.

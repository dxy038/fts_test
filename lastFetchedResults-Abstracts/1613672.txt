Background & Objective: Recently, a new technology, i.e. Web 2.0, has emerged and it is increasingly used in education. Wiki is one of the web 2.0 application which is used in E-learning. Wiki is a simple, easy editable, interactive application that enhances learning, so this study was conducted to investigate the effect of using wiki on learning information searching skills on medical students in Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran.

  Methods: The study population included the medical students who have chosen the information technology (IT) course in the second semester in 2013. The course was held in four groups, two groups were selected randomly. One group was considered as test group, teaching through wiki (wikispaces). The second one was the control group, traditional teaching (lecture). We asked about students’ attitudes toward learning through a researcher-made questionnaire.

  Result: The most of the students (71.9%) have used at least one of the web 2.0 technologies and 21.9% used Wikis. The mean scores of two groups increased and the difference between the mean scores was significant. The mean and standard deviation of the students’ scores before and after training through Wiki enhanced from 2.80 ± 1.85 to 12.85 ± 4.26, whereas it was 3.83 ± 4.30 to 13.75 ± 3.25 in the traditional group (P  <  0.001). There was no significant association between two teaching methods (wiki and traditional) (P = 0.560) and the improvement of both groups was almost equivalent but most of students (55%) preferred training by wiki.

  Conclusion: Teaching through Wiki had a positive effect on learning. Regarding Wiki capabilities, it can be used as a supplement method for teaching.

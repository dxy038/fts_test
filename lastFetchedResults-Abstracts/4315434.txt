Recently, accidents such that seniors fall down from the bed in care facilities or hospitals are increased. To prevent these accidents, we propose an awaking detection system using Neural Network (NN) in hospital use. In this paper, to increase detection capability of the proposed system, the feature extractive method is contrived with including dynamic information and static one. Furthermore, we adopt a face extractive method into our proposed system to execute more detail extraction of the objective personpsilas picture from the background. We show its feasibility with experimental results.

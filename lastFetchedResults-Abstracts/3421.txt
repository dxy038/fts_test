An internally irreversible Ericsson engine, with a realistic regenerator, has Abeen analyzed. The study considers internal irreversibilities with the Aintroduction of turbine and compressor thermal-efficiencies and pressure-drops Apresent in realistic regenerators. The effects of internal irreversibilities on Athe power output and thermal efficiency of the cycle have been determined using the finite-time thermodynamics. Maximum power-density, rather than Amaximum power, was used as the criterion for optimization, with the objective Aof having a more efficient small-sized engine. C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

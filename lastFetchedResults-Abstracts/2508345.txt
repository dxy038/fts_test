Background: Medical X-rays are the largest man-made source of public exposure to ionizing radiation. While the benefts of Computed Tomography (CT) are well
known in accurate diagnosis, those benefts are not risk-free. CT is a device with higher patient dose in comparison with other conventional radiation procedures.
Objective: This study is aimed at evaluating radiation dose to patients from Computed Tomography (CT) examination in Mazandaran hospitals and defning diagnostic
reference level (DRL).
Methods: Patient-related data on CT protocol for four common CT examinations
including brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic were collected. In each center,
Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI) measurements were performed using pencil ionization chamber and CT dosimetry phantom according to AAPM report No. 96
for those techniques. Then, Weighted Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIW),
Volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI vol) and Dose Length Product
(DLP) were calculated.
Results: The CTDIw for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic ranged (15.6-
73), (3.8-25. 8), (4.5-16.3) and (7-16.3), respectively. Values of DLP had a range of
(197.4-981), (41.8-184), (131-342.3) and (283.6-486) for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic, respectively. The 3rd quartile of CTDIW, derived from dose distribution
for each examination is the proposed quantity for DRL. The DRLs of brain, sinus,
chest and abdomen & pelvic are measured 59.5, 17, 7.8 and 11 mGy, respectively.
Conclusion: Results of this study demonstrated large scales of dose for the same
examination among different centers. For all examinations, our values were lower than
international reference doses.

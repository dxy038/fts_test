This paper introduces an effective way to build efficient miniature C-band filters using high-permittivity ceramics. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of such filters using commercial electromagnetic simulators and a conventional fabrication process. For the demonstration, the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology was chosen. Compared with planar solutions, this configuration offers good quality factors and good electrical performances as a consequence. However, its dimensions are large, leading to unacceptably large footprints for many applications. The solution proposed in this paper is based on a ceramic substrate with a permittivity of 90, which allowed us to work with shorter wavelengths. In comparison with a standard alumina substrate (permittivity &#949;<sub>r</sub>= 9.9, this approach makes it possible to reduce the footprint up to nine times. Two prototypes were realized on a Trans-Tech ceramic substrate (thickness = 635 &#956;m, &#949;<sub>r</sub> = 90, and tan&#948; = 9 &#183; 10<sup>-4</sup>. The first prototype is a folded sixth-order SIW filter including a cross coupling combining coplanar waveguide probes and a thin microstrip line on an InterVia substrate. The second one is a folded eighth-order SIW filter without cross couplings. Here, we compare the sixth-order prototype with an identical one built on alumina. The eighth-order filter, which had no alumina counterpart, is a potentially useful alternative for situations where complex technological steps must be avoided.

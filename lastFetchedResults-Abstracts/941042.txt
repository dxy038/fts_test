Personal NO2 exposure measurements were achieved during two campaigns in a large northern France city. These
campaigns were following an innovating approach based on sequential exposure measurements by diffusive samplers
distinguishing four categories of microenvironments (bhomeQ, bother indoor placesQ, btransportQ and boutdoorsQ). The objective
of these campaigns was to obtain NO2 personal exposure data in different microenvironments and to examine the determinants
of personal exposure to this pollutant. Each campaign comprised two 24-h sampling periods: one during a working day and the
second during the weekend. The average total NO2 personal exposure ranged from 17 Ag m 3 for the summer weekend
samplings to 38 Ag m 3 for the winter weekday samplings. The highest levels were found in transports and outdoors, the
intermediate ones in other indoor places and the lowest in homes. Despite their weak levels, indoor environments contributed
for more than 78% to total NO2 personal exposure because of more time spent in these living places. A Multiple
Correspondence Analysis (MCA) highlighted the determinants of NO2 personal exposure in the bhomeQ and btransportQ
microenvironments. This led to a classification of NO2 personal exposure levels according to different means of transport:
from the lowest to the highest exposure levels, train, tramway or underground, bicycle, car or motorcycle. In homes, the rise of
NO2 personal exposures is mainly due to the use of gas stoves and gas heating and the absence of automatic airing system. A
classification of NO2 personal exposure levels was set up according to the characteristics of homes. An analysis of correlations
between the home NO2 personal exposures and outdoor concentrations measured by fixed ambient air monitoring stations
showed weak relations suggesting that the data of these stations are poor predictors of NO2 personal exposures in homes.

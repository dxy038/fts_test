The objective of this research was to evaluate bromide leaching in a field under corn, wheat and alfalfa. Potassium bromide (300 kg/ha) was uniformly applied and 15 mm ofwater was sprinkled over the plots in the first and second years. Plots were leached 8 times during the first year and 9 times in the second year (each time with 100 mm of water). Soil samples were collected at 0-30, 30-60,60-90 and 90-120 cm depths two days after each leaching practice. Bromide concentration in soil samples was measured using an ion selective electrode. Moisture content in each plot was measured using a neutron meter to a depth of 120 cm and after calculation of evaporation from soil surface, the net water applied was determined. CXTFIT software and Regional Stochastic Model (RSM) were used to simulate leaching under field conditions.
The results showed that flow velocity and dispersivity of treatmens were not significantly different from the control in the first year, indicating that treatments had no effect on preferential flow. Control treatments were not significantly different in the first and second years. In the second year, flow velocity in wheat, corn and alfalfa treatments were 1.54, 1.86 and 2.21 times higher than flow velocity in die control, respectively. Dispersivity in alfalfa and corn treatments were 4.30 and 5.30 times higher as compared to the control. The increase in flow velocity and dispersivity is caused by an increase of preferential flow in the second year. The root channels remaining in soil at the end of the first year may also have increased preferential flow. After adding 25 cm of water, 30% of bromide leached from the top 50 cm soil in all plots in the first year and control plots in the second year but the values in the second year were 47, 67 and 70% of bromide leaching from the top 50 cm soil in wheat, corn and alfalfa plots, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce an efficient target tracking scheme through a dynamic sink oriented tree (SOT) algorithm for multiple mobile sinks. The SOT is maintained by the partial link reversal algorithm to adapt to the mobile sink environment. The main objective of our proposed algorithm is to efficiently deliver location information of targets to the multiple mobile sinks. Since our protocol can construct and dynamically maintain the SOTs although the sinks moves continuously, data aggregation from target nodes to sink can be efficiently achieved through the SOT, and also, in-network processing of the aggregation process is naturally achieved. In addition, the tracking coverage of each mobile sink is wider by dynamically merging each sinkÂ´s SOT. Also, we evaluated our protocol in terms of how robust it is by examining the packet loss rate with respect to the sink speed.

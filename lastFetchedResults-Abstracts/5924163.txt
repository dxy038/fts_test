Image processing techniques for assessing the retention of fluorescent pigment mark in live fish are discussed. Two retention indices have been developed to facilitate the objective assessment of the design parameters for a spray marking machine under development for use in fisheries management. One index is based on the ratio of mark area to body area in a fish, while the other is based on the sum energy of marks over a batch of fish. The growth of fish has been simulated in order to determine its effect on the dilution of mark density, and its effect on the variation of mark pattern

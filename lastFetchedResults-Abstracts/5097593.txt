Unbalance active distribution network (UADN) is the combination of unbalance distribution network (UDN) and distributed generations (DGs) such as gas generator, wind turbines, fuel cell, photovoltaic system, etc. Regarding to unbalance structure, different kinds of DGs models and bidirectional power flow, some network parameters such as amplitude voltage, voltage unbalance Factor (VUF), and power losses of network will alter accordingly. A suitable power flow analysis will provide a platform to analyse these behaviours in steady state condition. This paper offers appropriate method for handling DGs in a Power flow program which is developed using MATLAB&#174; for practical unbalanced distribution network at Iran and investigate the impact of DG location and DG control mode (as PV and PQ mode) on voltage profile, reducing power loss and VUF.

Focuses on the current roles of metrology systems associated with a shallow trench isolation (STI) run-to-run (RtR) controller and recent advances AMD has made applying new, ODP scatterometry-based metrology to this application. It will compare industry standard metrology techniques to ODP, with the objective of identifying the STI metrology system or systems that will produce timely and reliable data streams with the largest quantity of process information at the highest possible signal to noise (S/N) ratio

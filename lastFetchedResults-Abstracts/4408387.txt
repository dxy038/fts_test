Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are new emerging multi-hop wireless networks that offer low-cost high-bandwidth community wireless services. Much work has been done so far in order to enhance the performance of these networks. In this paper, by using the optimization framework provided in [1], we study the impact of using some advanced wireless communication techniques on the performance improvement of WMNs. These techniques are using multiple radios/multiple channels (MR-MC), dynamic power control, and rate adaptation. Accordingly, we use network optimization algorithms based on joint routing, link scheduling and static channel assignment. Simulation results show using power control, rate adaption and MR-MC strategy improves network efficiency in terms of throughput, load balancing and average delay. Then with consideration of fairness max-min and load balancing min-max in objective function, we try to improve network efficiency as well as to get better the algorithm rectitude by changing demands profile.

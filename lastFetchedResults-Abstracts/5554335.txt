The U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program in Natural Resources (UJNR) has a general objective of promoting development and conservation of natural resources through cooperative activities. Forms of cooperation include joint research projects, such as deep-sea diving, and the reciprocal exchange of scientific information, technical data, specialists, study tours and research equipment. Technical documents are continually generated by various UJNR panel activities. The U.S.-People´s Republic of China (PRC) Cooperation in the Field of Marine and Fishery Science and Technology has completed a joint Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary study and is beginning a joint study of interannual variability of tropical oceans and global atmosphere (TOGA) in the western Tropical Pacific Ocean. U.S.-Chile Cooperation is beginning. In addition to Chile´s participation in TOGA, a notable 3-year project entitled Tsunami Hazard Reduction Utilizing System Technology (THRUST) is to establish a real-time tsunami warning system served by satellite communication. Hopefully a THRUST system will monitor the entire Pacific Rim when a Japanese stellite joins in to cover the western Pacific.

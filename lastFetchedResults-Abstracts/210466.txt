Objective: Hypercholesterolemia is a known risk factor for erectile dysfunction (ED). Lipid
lowering agents may improve ED in hypercholesterolemic men. The aim of the present study
was to evaluate the effects of lipid lowering agent atorvastatin in treatment of ED m
hypercholesterolemic men.
Subjects and Methods: In this prospective controlled clinical trials a total of 1\
hypercholesterolemic men with ED were enrolled the study. They were treated with
atorvastatin (20 mg once daily for a period 4 months). All the patients were evaluated by
history, clinical interview, physical examination and laboratory analysis both at the beginning
and end of the study. International index of erectile function (]IEF) questionnaire and
nocturnal penile tumescence testing rigidity (NPTR) tests were also performed for each
patient, prior to and after the study.
Results: Eleven patient were entered the study with a mean age of 54 Â± 3 years, of whom 10
patients completed the study. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) decreased in a statistically
significant manner after treatment period (mean difference= 39.1%, P< 0.005) in all of the
patients. All the patient reported subjective improvement in erectile function (P<O.OO I), lIEF
questionnaire showed significant changes in total erectile function and sexual performance
(mean difference> +4.7, 95 % CI 2-8-6.2, P< 0.001). NPTR test showed statistically
significant improvement in rigidity activity units (RAU) in the basal area of penis (P<O.OO I).
A significant statistical relation was recorded between improvement in erectile function and
lipid lowering effect of atorvastatin (P< 0.005).
Conclusion: The lipid lowering agent atorvastatin has a dual favourable effect in treating
both hypercholesterolemia and erectile dysfunction. Better sexual performance can elevate
both the sense of well being and quality of life in these men, more extended and multicentric
studies need be designed to evaluate this effect

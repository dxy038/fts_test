Multimedia Data Management Systems (MMDMS) enable accessing, storing, organizing and retrieving multimedia content effectively and efficiently. The primary objective of the paper is to describe the software architecture of Middle East Technical University Multimedia Data Management System (METU-MMDMS) to facilitate future research on MMDMSs. There is a lack of published descriptive architectures for similar systems. Therefore, describing a particular MMDMS architecture, investigating the design decisions, rationale and the variability points that are parts of the MMDMS architectural design, showing that the prepared MMDMS architecture documentation has enough substance to account for the required scenarios are discussed in this paper.

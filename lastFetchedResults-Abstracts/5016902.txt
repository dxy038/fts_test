In this paper, the combination of genetic algorithm and a new variable step-size algorithm for a second-order adaptive IIR notch filter is presented. The objective of the new algorithm is to optimize the filter coefficient. The results of computer simulation show that the new algorithm provides a good performance such as fast convergence rate, low mean square error and noise robustness. In addition, the new algorithm is also applied to cancel 50-Hz power line interference in the recording of electrocardiograms signal.

A new numerically efficient global optimization algorithm utilizing grid computing technique and surrogate objective function (SOF) is developed. The algorithm combines particles swarm optimization (PSO) with a SOF constructed by using Multi-quadric radial basis function. For the computation of the objective function values for sampling points, grid computing technique is adopted employing the same number of personal computers connected to Internet with that of the sampling points.

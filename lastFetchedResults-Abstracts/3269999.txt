In this paper, a Java object-oriented package (abbreviated JLCNN) is presented. Its objective is to implement several low complexity neural networks architectures, for further use in various embedded systems applications. The main advantages of the JLCNN package are the rapid development of various applications based on low complexity neural architectures and the easiness in porting such neural architectures on various computing platforms. As any other object-oriented library it allows reducing the development time for a new software product and provides convenient code maintenance, reusability and portability. The library is also useful for research and educational purposes, as a basic kernel on which new modules can be easily added. For instance it may be expanded to image processing applications.

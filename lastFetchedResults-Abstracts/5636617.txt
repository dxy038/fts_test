The objective of this project is to develop a Quadrupedal (four legs) robot with speech recognition to control the movement. There are only three words of command to be recognized, which are &#8220;forward&#8221;, &#8220;backward&#8221;, and &#8220;left&#8221; command. Fourbar linkage is used as the basic mechanism for the robotÂ´s legs and comparison of sum of absolute error is used on the speech signal spectrum taken from its short time fourier transform.

A novel framework for enhancing the resolution of a low-resolution multispectral or hyperspectral image using a high resolution panchromatic image or multispectral image is proposed in this paper. This framework can be further used to perform more general types of image fusion. To create the enhanced image, a convex objective function is minimised, which preserves both the pixel affinity learnt from the high resolution image and spectral information from the low resolution image. A fast approximation method is discussed. Quantitive and qualitative analysis against existing methods shows that our method is comparable to state of the art with faster running time and greater flexibility. MATLAB code for our proposed method and the compared methods are freely available in the FuseBox package.

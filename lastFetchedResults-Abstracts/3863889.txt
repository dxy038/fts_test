Information economics is a new system of economics, overriding the classical school of economics, and at the same time it is a future economics. Three basic concepts of economics constitute the framework of information economics. The first of them is the spirit of giobalism-the ideas of spaceship, quality of time, and coexistentialism. The second is information productivity. The development of computer and communication technologies has made posible mass production of objective-oriented, logical, normative information. The third is time value-a new view of values. By time value is meant the value that is created through objective-oriented utilization of free time at the disposal of human beings. Just as each new theory of economics has a new vision, information economics has a vision-Global Futualization Society as the society where a large variety of voluntary communities will flourish on a global scale at a time, and the individual will seek to realize self-actualization in each community.

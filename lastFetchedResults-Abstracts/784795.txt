Objective: This study investigated the correlation between the chronological age, telomere
length in peripheral blood leukocytes and blood laboratory data of female patients with mild hypertension
to identify laboratory data that reflect the biological aging of individuals. Design: Cross-sectional
population-based study. Setting: Outpatient clinic of the Department of Cardiovascular, Respiratory, and
Geriatric Medicine Kyushu University Hospital at Beppu in Japan. Participants: Outpatients with mild
hypertension treated with a low dose of amlodipine. Measurements: The laboratory data of female patients
were collected and the telomere length parameters in their peripheral blood leukocytes were determined by
Southern blotting. Any correlations between the laboratory data and the telomere length parameters were
assessed. Results: The patients showed a positive correlation between the telomere length and the high
density lipoprotein, albumin, creatinine, hemoglobin levels, red blood cell counts, and a negative
correlation with the globulin level. The extent of subtelomeric methylation of long telomeres tended to
correlate negatively with the telomeric attrition. Only the creatinine level correlated with subtelomeric
methylation, but not with telomeric length. Conclusion: HDL and the albumin/globulin ratio were potential
indicators for individual somatic genomic aging. Creatinine may therefore be a useful indicator for a
predisposition for telomeric attrition.

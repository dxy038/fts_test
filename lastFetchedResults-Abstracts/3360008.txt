In this paper, a novel solution method is proposed for the optimal topology control problem in AC framework with N-1 reliability. The resultant new topology of the proposed method is guaranteed to yield a better objective function value than the global solution of the problem with the original topology. In order to prove our statement, semi-definite programming relaxation is formulated to find a lower bound to the objective function value of the problem. The proposed method is favorable for parallelization to increase the computational efficiency, and the parallel computing flowchart is presented. Computational time of the algorithm for IEEE test cases is reported. An in-house power market simulator is developed to simulate a market environment complete with optimal topology control mechanism. Simulations held by participating human subjects are analyzed under the subtitles of the total operating cost, real power losses, and locational marginal price (LMP) variance. A simple example is illustrated to show that the resultant network topology may increase the real power losses while still providing a lower operating system cost than that of the original topology.

The objective of this work is to design and optimize an Ultrawideband planar rectangular printed antenna with band notched behavior intended to get rid of the 5-6 GHz frequency band for WLAN compatibility purposes. The antenna has a large bandwidth covering the frequency band from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz, and the radiation patterns are similar to those of a conventional dipole antenna. In order to improve the impedance bandwidth and high frequency radiation characteristics the shape of radiation patch and the ground plane are modified. By properly designing the dimensions of bevel slots on the lower edge on the radiation patch and on the upper edge of the ground plane wide bandwidth is achieved. A small radiation patch on the bottom side of the substrate will produce band notched characteristics. Simulated results suggest that the proposed antenna is suitable for UWB applications because of its compact size and high performance.

Nowadays a plethora of three-dimensional (3D) systems claim usersÂ´ increasing preference for delivering 3D content. In recent years an increasing number of systems utilize autostereoscopic techniques and hence provide glasses free viewing and adequate resolutions in full color. In addition certain autostereoscopic techniques like Integral Imaging provide two-dimensional (2D) parallax and further increase anticipation for high fidelity 3D content viewing to professional and home users. In this paper we extend the results of previous research to provide perspective distortion rectification for Integral Images generated using hexagonal instead of square lenses. In the proposed method we demonstrate the utilization of a fundamental property of distorted coplanar hexagonal lattices in the image rectification framework that improve the rectification accuracy and robustness. Finally we provide experimental results over a number of images to evaluate the accuracy of the method using objective metrics.

The use of simulation technology is well known in the field of engineering. On a daily basis, engineers use e.g. block oriented simulation systems to develop controllers or FEM analysis methods to test and verify component layouts. By contrast, the use of 3D simulation technology based on kinematics, rigid body or sensor simulation so far seems to be limited to only a few specific application areas like robotics. But especially "3D" simulation technology has the potential to evolve from a support tool to a core engineering technology acting as a new focal point in engineering processes. It is now the goal of eRobotics to introduce a continuous and systematic computer support into the entire lifecycle of complex systems. This "computer support" will be provided by 3D simulation technology which requires the development of new architectures for 3D simulation frameworks, setting new benchmarks in performance, flexibility, modularity, integration capabilities and realism. These frameworks will also close the gap between virtual and real worlds, allowing for smooth bidirectional transitions between them. This paper introduces the basic concepts of eRobotics, summarizes new requirements on 3D simulation technology and introduces a new reference implementation which meets the formulated requirements.

A statistical method to determine short-term power dispatch from a wind power generating station is proposed. The station is incorporated with an energy storage facility and the scheduling of the station power dispatch is based on wind speed and tariff forecasts. The objective is to maximize the income of the station. The design of the schedule takes into account the errors in the wind power forecasts while the energy storage facility buffers the imbalance between the actual generated wind power and the station scheduled output power. From the statistically evaluated power and energy status of the energy storage facility, the optimal capacity of the storage facility is also determined which will meet specified confidence level for the short-term power dispatch.

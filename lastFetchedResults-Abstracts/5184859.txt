The propagation of the lead ion plasma from the cathode to the surrounding space, and the retarding effect of the biased grid to the plasma propagation are discussed. In the present work, lead ion plasma generated from a short duration impulse vacuum arc is taken as the study objective. It was appeared that the propagating velocity of the lead ion plasma is about 6.0&#215;10<sup>3</sup> m/s. The propagation can be retarded by the grid with both polarity of the bias voltage, but the electrons are easily retarded than the ions showing there exist large amount of high energy ions in the plasma

The main role of Security Risk Analysis (SRA) is to identify the relevant vulnerabilities in order to put the organization in a better position to manage the faced uncertainties. In fact, SRA is achieved by a team of different experts. In this work, we call the team by Security Analysis Team (SAT). Many SRA processes have been developed. However, despite their simplicity, the processes are not usually applied appropriately. The main limit of the existing process is the neglect of studying the interaction between the SAT members and their divergent skills. As a collective work, the degree of success of the SRA depends on the level of synergy produced by the SAT. To reach this synergy, some key concepts have to be established. The idea is not to avoid conflicts or to reach a consensus; but to prompt the team members interact in a constructive way. The objective of this work is first to develop an expert weighing process with relevant refinement techniques to reach reliable weights. In addition, we look for increasing the synergy of the SAT through SRA exercises. It could be guaranteed using dynamic criteria. Hence, the real contribution of an expert and its best moment of intensification are established. Within this context, this paper presents a model that proposes weighing expertsÂ´ opinions. It selects the AHP as an appropriate tool, according to SRA requirements. It suggests some refinement approaches to avoid biases and to guaranty objective evaluation. It includes mathematical and psychological enrichment.

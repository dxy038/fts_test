This paper deals with a comparison of an optimal solution of equipping a MV distribution network when different financial equivalents of supply interruption are taken into account. The comparison elicits from the optimization studies performed for real feeders of 22kV overhead lines. The reliability of each feeder section is simulated by the non-sequential Monte Carlo method. Statistical distributions used in the simulation are based on a failure database covering a 10-year period. The comparison is carried out for an optimization task whose objective is allocation of telecontrolled switching elements (telecontrolled section switches and reclosers). The results are presented for a single feeder and for a representative set of real feeders. Due to the fact that the selection of the financial equivalent of supply interruptions (the value of supply interruption) is strongly connected to a regulation framework, current regulation of supply continuity in the Czech Republic and its expected evolutions are summarized.

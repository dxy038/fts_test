Objectives: There have been numerous attempts to construct non-monetary indices of social and economic satisfaction by combining in a single statistic a variety of different factors that are thought to influence human well-being. Method: The concept of Quality of Life (QOL) as an aggregate measure of people's well-being in a certain country, region, or social stratum. The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a new methodology that links the results of subjective life-satisfaction surveys to the objective determinants of quality of life. We use this methodology and numerical taxonomy to ranking the quality of life in Iranian provinces.
Findings: Assigning the different weights and emphasizing on economical, environmental and social components of quality of life, shows that the general rank of provinces (except in some cases) have not been changed. Results: Our results show that the Tehran, West Azerbaijan and Khuzestan have best QOL Index respectively. Hence we can use the ranking of provinces in decentralization of Tehran population by encouraging the immigration from Tehran to other High Quality Provinces.
Key Words: Quality Of Life, Wealth, Factor Analysis, Numerical Taxonomy

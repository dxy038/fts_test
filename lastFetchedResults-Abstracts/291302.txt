Several biological therapies (monoclonal antibodies, designer molecules, recombinant cytokines) have been tested for clinical efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease, and some have been found to be effective. Anti-TNF-α (anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha) antibody therapy is an important treatment modality in the treatment of active and fistulating Crohn's disease and should be considered in patients who fail standard medical therapies. Treatment with TNF-α-neutralizing antibodies is associated with immunosuppression that may lead to opportunistic infections and reactivation of tuberculosis, and patients should undergo Mantoux testing prior to treatment. Several other monoclonal antibodies, including anti-IL12 and anti-IFN-γ, are currently in development for Crohn's disease. Other new approaches includeex vivo generation of regulatory T lymphocytes and antibodies that target and kill (subpopulations of) memory T lymphocytes.

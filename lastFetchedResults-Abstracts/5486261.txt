In this paper, we present a successful operation of Gallium Nitride(GaN)-based three-phase inverter with high efficiency of 99.3% for driving motor at 900W under the carrier frequency of 6kHz. This efficiency well exceeds the value by IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor). This demonstrates that GaN has a great potential for power switching application competing with SiC. Fully reduced on-state resistance in a new normally-off GaN transistor called Gate Injection Transistor (GIT) greatly helps to increase the efficiency. In addition, use of the bidirectional operation of the lateral and compact GITs with synchronous gate driving, the inverter is operated free from fly-wheel diodes which have been connected in parallel with IGBTs in a conventional inverter system.

This paper considers the tradeoffs between packet header size, network state and accuracy of representation in wireless networks which use trajectory based routing techniques. The models presented here are applicable in sensor networks for which trajectory based routing techniques have previously been proposed. We begin with simple discrete models to make clear the tradeoff between header size and network state. We show that the problem of accurate representation of a trajectory with the objective of minimizing the cost incurred due to header size and network state is difficult to solve optimally. Therefore, we present two heuristics to solve this problem. We note that this work leads to further interesting problems when applied to practical systems

Wind Energy has been existent for many centuries and has advanced in both products and technologies. The objective of this study is to identify the future adoption, products, and technologies for Residential and Industrial consumers in a form of a graphical Technology Roadmap. Technology Roadmapping (TRM) is a high level planning tool used for strategy planning, implementation and aligning technologies and products with overall business objectives. The study considered the following aspects as the basis of the roadmap (market drivers): environmental concerns, rising cost and dependency on fossil fuel, business opportunities, government involvement and availability of natural wind resources in the Pacific Northwest (NW). The results of this study show, as implementation and the shift towards renewable energies unfold, specifically wind energy, we will notice a considerable reduction in the fluctuation and high cost of utilities, increased efforts towards the alarming concerns of global warming and environment degradation, evolving technologies, and its products as a dependable alternative energy resource. This paper also highlights the benefits in utilizing wind energy to residential, commercial and industrial consumers within the Pacific NW.

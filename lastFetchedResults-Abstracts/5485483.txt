With the premise of supplying comfortable and healthy environments in buildings, minimization of energy consumption of building energy systems is the important and urgent objective of mankind. Due to the vast amount of energy consumption of AC (air-conditioning) systems in buildings, the reasonable design, optimal operation and efficient management of AC systems are inevitable and necessary to the reduction of the total social energy consumption. Most AC engineering systems nowadays are designed according to the design norms issued by the corresponding national department. These design norms are based on static and reduction objective model with many assumptions and simplifications that are suitable for manual work. For the sake of safe allowance, AC engineering systems designed from these design norms are usually having the large systematic capacity and energy consumption than the systems should be. Improvements on current design norms by introducing dynamic and accurate means to reduce the energy consumption of AC systems are referred as an important and necessary manner. Commissioning is recognized as an important verification process needed for design, construction, operation and maintenance of HVAC systems. By commissioning work, dynamic simulation technique is employed, the unnecessary over energy consumption of AC systems designed according to design norms can be clearly indicated and the improving direction of design norms can also be pointed out. In this paper, both dynamic simulation technique and static design norms are used for the design of AC system within the same building, design results from these two manners are compared, the concept of ?deviation of systematic index? is established, the reduction potential and improving direction of energy consumption of AC design norms is clearly indicated. Our work can be used as references and improvement guidelines to designers and technicians for systematic design.

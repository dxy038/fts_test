The objective of this article is to present a comparative evaluation and analysis related to the possible application of the main incentive policies, particularly net metering and feed-in tariffs, into microgrid systems. This is done in order to promote their implementation, expansion and consequent integration to medium and low voltage systems. To complement the study carried out, it was deemed essential including the response of the simulations related to the performance of a microgrid during its islanding (pre-planned and unintentional) process from the network. Today, the expectation about the performance of microgrid systems is high, especially if it is considered that its nearest ally, the smart grid technology, is having a rapid development. From the simulations conducted to assess the microgrid dynamic response, it became clear that microgrid systems may face some difficulties including unsuccessful attempts during the islanding process from the network.

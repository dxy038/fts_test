Software as a service (SaaS) is the main service model in cloud computing and has been generally recognized. More and more traditional software turns to SaaS applications. For SaaS provider, it hopes that it can provide better service performance to tenants while attain more profit. But the two goals are contradictory. So in this paper, we model the SaaS application service provisioning problem as multi-objective optimization problem and propose a service provisioning strategy based on Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) for SaaS applications in cloud. The experiments show that compared with random strategy and greedy strategy, the service provisioning strategy proposed in this paper can effectively improve the service performance and profit.

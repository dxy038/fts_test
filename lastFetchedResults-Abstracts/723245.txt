The absolute stereochemistry of the new antifungal and antibacterial antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp.201 has been established by achieving the total synthesis of the product. A series of analogues have also been synthesized by changing the side chain and their bioactivity assessed against different microbial strains. Among them, 1e (R = C8H17) was found to be the most potent with MIC of 8 μg/mL against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 12 μg/mL against Escherichia coli and 16 μg/mL against Bacillus subtilis 6 μg/mL against Proteus vulgaris. This was followed by 1b (R = C5H11) with MIC of 10–20 μg/mL range and 1d (R = C7H15) with MIC of 14–24 g/mL, whereas 1a (R = C4H9) and 1f (R = C18H35) were found to be completely inactive. Besides, 1c (R = C6H13) showed certain extent of antibacterial activity in the range of 24–50 μg/mL. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was very sensitive to 1e (R = C8H17) with MIC of 8 μg/mL. Antifungal activity of analogues 1d (R = C7H15) and 1e, (R = C8H17) against Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani were found promising with MFCs in the 15–18 μg/mL range.

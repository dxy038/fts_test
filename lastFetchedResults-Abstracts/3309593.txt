The objective of this study is to understand and analyse the concept of software Cloning and its detection. Software cloning is a perception in which source code is duplicated. Code clones and its detection is one of the emerging and most dominant areas of research in the field of software engineering. There exist a number of techniques to detect clone in software. The aim of this study will be given on acquiring and analysing the concept of hybrid clone detection technique. An algorithm is devised for detecting duplicity in the software by using hybrid software clone detection technique. This algorithm will first compute the required software metrics that provide sufficient information regarding the software application and then depending on software metrics matches the potential clone will be detected. It uses byte code to calculate the metrics of Java source code instead of using any intermediate representation. The reason of using byte code is that it is platform independent and represents the unified structure of the code. While detecting clones token based approach is applied on potential clones.

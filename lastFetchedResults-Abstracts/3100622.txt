In many applications of ad-hoc wireless networks, one often has to broadcast the same message to all nodes. The major goal of any broadcasting algorithm is to minimize the number of retransmissions, i.e., to accomplish the goal with the minimum amount of traffic in the network. In addition to reducing the bandwidth expense needed to convey the message to all the nodes, this objective will try to minimize the total amount of energy spent by the nodes on this communal task. This is of paramount importance in sensor networks, which are often built of disposable nodes, whose life-time is directly determined by the efficiency of their power management scheme. In this paper, we present a heuristic broadcast algorithm dubbed EPDP, for enhanced partial dominant pruning, and demonstrate its superiority, in terms of the total number of retransmissions, over other solutions addressing the same issue.

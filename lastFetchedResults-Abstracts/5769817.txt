Design of MV networks has two aspects: mechanical and electrical. The objective of mechanic design is to determine the tension of wires, or equally their sags, in such a way that in various climates the designed network operates reasonably. On the other hand, the target of the electrical design is to fulfil the electric constrains including current, voltage, and losses constrains. For instance, the voltage drop must be less than 2% in urban; and less than 4% in rural areas. In the case of current, there are two constrains for steady state and faulted conditions. This paper discusses electric design of MV distribution networks with respect to the mentioned constrains and presents a technique for selection of the cross section of the conductors due to rules of Iran ministry of power.

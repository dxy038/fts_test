It is difficult to obtain images we want on the Web due to enormous data that exist in the Web. A present image detection systems are keyword detection which is added to the name of keyword for images. Therefore, it is very important and difficult to add the keyword for images. In this paper, keywords in the image are analysed by using the factor analysis and the sandglass-type neural network (SNN) for image searching. As images preprocessing, objective images are segmented by the maximin-distance algorithm. Small regions are integrated into a near region. Thus, objective images are segmented into some region. After this images preprocessing, keywords in images are analyzed by using factor analysis and a sandglass-type neural network (SNN) for image searching in this paper. Images data are compressed to a 2-dimensional space by using these two methods. This 2-dimensional data space is presented by a graph. Thus, keywords are analyzed in detail.

With the boiler combustion inspection and diagnosis became much more important day after day, the image technology had been applied in this field. Several image characters had gotten from the fire image and apply rough set decision-making rules to form the decision-making table. In the table the image characters are condition attribute and the hearth combustion statuses are decision-making attribute. The weight coefficients of the condition attribute to the decision-making attribute are determined by the approximation set conception in the rough set theory. Thus, the judgment is objective and provides forceful proof for the boiler combustion diagnosis. At last, an experiment has been done with a group spot fire images gained from different combustion status, and compare the experiment results with the spot status. It shows that the method is feasible

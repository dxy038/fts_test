The web browser has become one of most accessed process/applications in recent years. The latest website security statistics report about 30% of vulnerability attacks happen due to the information leakage by browser application and its use by hackers to exploit privacy of an individual. This leaked information is one of the main sources for hackers to attack individualÂ´s PC or to make the PC a part of botnet. A software controller is proposed to track system calls invoked by the browser process. The designed prototype deals with the systems calls which perform operations related to read, write, access personal and/or system information. The objective of the controller is to confine the leakage of information by a browser process.

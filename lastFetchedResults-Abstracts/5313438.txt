The objective of this paper is to extend a novel low complexity method for optimizing switch control developed by the authors earlier to work with delay dominant systems and demonstrate that the method works in practice with a refrigeration test system. The extended method solves switching problems for high order systems which can be approximated as a first order with a delay as well. The extension of the method is realized with an observer to retrieve the delay-free information. Experimental validation of the extended method is carried out with a test system. A comparison to a baseline relay controller with fixed bounds shows that the optimizing switch control outperforms the baseline.

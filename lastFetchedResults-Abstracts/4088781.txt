The relationship between autocorrelators and heterocorrelators is examined. A review of the encoding algorithms, recall operations, stability proofs, and capacity arguments of first- and higher-order autocorrelator, commonly referred to as Hopfield associative memories (HAMs), and referred to as bidirectional associated memories (BAMs), is presented. Higher-ordered BAM´s and first- and higher-ordered intraconnected BAM´s are introduced. The encoding, recall, and stability procedures of each are discussed. Simulation results that compare the storage capacity and storage efficiency of three heterocorrelators, the heteroassociative HAM (HHAM), the BAM, and the intraconnected BAM (IBAM), are presented. The simulation suites were conducted for first-order, direct second-order, and general second-order heterocorrelators with a total pattern dimensionality of 4, 10, 20, 50, and 100. Each suite consisted of between 150 and 1000 separate program executions

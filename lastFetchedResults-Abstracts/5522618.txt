The objective of this letter is to study the effect of multipactor on the dielectric resonator filter response. First, a dual-mode cylindrical dielectric resonator waveguide filter is designed and Multipactor breakdown threshold of this filter has been obtained by using effective electrons approach in Monte Carlo method. Then multipactor current density in the radial space between the internal dielectric and the external metallic cavities is calculated. The magnetic field generated by the multipactor current is calculated and its equivalent volume impedance is applied to the solution boundaries and is used in the filter simulation. The simulated results are obtained using the Ansoft simulation software high-frequency structure simulator and clearly show the effect of multipactor on the frequency response of the filter.

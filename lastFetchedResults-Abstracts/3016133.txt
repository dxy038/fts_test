The objective of data quality control (QC) is to ensure consistency within a single data set or throughout a historical database. This is a vital step to be taken with any data set before scientific analysis can be proceed. A redesign of data quality procedures for temperature and salinity profile data undertaken by the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) during the past year has resulted in new data validation standards and procedures. New data QC and editing software has been developed and is being applied to all new and archived shipboard and aircraft temperature and salinity profile data collected or held by NAVOCEANO. The initial QC effort (Level 1 effort) is in progress. Level 1 effort is an assessment of the approximately 8 million profiles held in the NAVOCEANO archives for outlying and invalid profiles by comparison of profiles from relevant environments. The subsequent Level 2 effort entails more detailed investigations and further analyses for editing the previously flagged profiles. The MATLAB-based data edit programs use Master Oceanographic Observation Data Set (MOODS) 2000, a revised internal standard data file format, which will ease the use and exchange of data. The new file structure also stores numerous data quality flags and histories of collections for incorrect or missing metadata, deviations from climatological statistics, and profile data quality.

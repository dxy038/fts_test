A method for designing codebooks for vector quantization (VQ) based on minimum error visibility in a reconstructed picture is described. The method uses objective measurements to define visibility for the picture being coded. The proposed VQ is switched type, i.e., the codebook is divided into subcodebooks, each of which is related to a given subrange of error visibility. Codebook optimization is carried out on the basis of a particular definition of visible distortion of the reconstructed image. Subjective judgment of the test results, carried out at 0.5 b/pel bit rate, indicates that the proposed VQ enables low-distortion images to be reconstructed even when subcodebooks with a small number of codewords are used, thus reducing the codebook search time to about 10% of that required by a fixed VQ (both inside and outside the training set)

The objective of the IEEE/IAS Pulp and Paper Industry Committee since its inception has been "To advance the theory and practice in the electrical field as related to the design and management of electrical systems". They have been doing just that for over 50 years by providing a forum, the annual technical conference, for engineers to exchange information that helps them do their job better. With the inception of the new IEEE/IAS Pulp and Paper Industry Committee, Forest Products Subcommittee or FPS there is an opportunity to extend the knowledge transfer even further by adding a related group of engineers and technicians that bring their own experiences to the forum. It seems reasonable then to ask what these two industry segments have in common and how their affiliation through participation in this Subcommittee and the broader committee would be beneficial to each other.

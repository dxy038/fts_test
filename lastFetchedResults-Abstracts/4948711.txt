In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) called MODE-LD+SS, which combines Differential Evolution with local dominance and a scalar selection mechanism for improving both its convergence rate and its distribution of solutions along the Pareto front. In order to assess the performance of the proposed approach, we use a set of standard test functions and performance measures taken from the specialized literature. Results are compared with respect to three MOEAs representative of the state-of-the-art in the area: NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D.

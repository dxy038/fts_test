Vehicle efficiency relates to pollutants and cost savings in third world countries. In
terms of sub-compact cars, the vehicle characteristics are governed by the engine and
road load characteristics. The main objective was to evaluate the coefficients of rolling
resistance and drag on a moving sub-compact car and to compare the results from
engine tests on a dynamometer. Tests were conducted on a local sub-compact car to
measure engine speed, throttle position and air fuel ratio while Global Positioning
Systems (GPS) recorded data of the vehicle’s speed and position. Also, dynamometer
testing was carried out to determine the vehicle characteristics. The results of an on the
road roll down test and cruising test were combined to get the road load characteristics
of the vehicle. A comparison of the road loads obtained with the actual engine
dynamometer test was found to have about 5% error. The experimental errors show the
validation of the tests. The tests show the dynamometer’s relation to real life road loads

This work presents the synchronizer based on pulse comparation, between variable and fixed pulses. This synchronizer has two variants, one operating by both transitions at the bit rate and other operating by positive transitions at half rate. Each variant has two versions namely the manual and the automatic. The objective is to study the four synchronizers and evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal Noise Ratio).

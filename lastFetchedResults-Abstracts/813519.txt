After the 9.11 disaster in New York, we have become more aware of the catastrophic threats in our communities. While the 9.11 disaster was not directed toward the oil industry, oil production facilities may pose an attractive target for terrorism. This study focuses on assessing the security risk of man-made disasters for critical assets in the oil industry. This research modifies conventional risk assessment methods for including terrorism and sabotage scenarios by Joshan model. The objective of this risk assessment is to identify possible security hazards, threats and vulnerabilities facing each target asset, and to find the adequate countermeasures to protect the public, workers, national interest, environment, and companies. This model includes five steps: asset characterization, threat assessment, vulnerability analysis, risk assessment and new countermeasures. Joshan-Pro, an in-house software, is introduced for security vulnerability assessment in critical asset protection.

The paper proposes a conflict resolution strategy based on optimization. In concurrent design based on a constraint network, designers determine the parameters, within advantageous intervals by using their experience and preference, which results in frequent conflicts. A conflict relaxation model is designed to meet the conflict resolution requirements, which extends the conflict degree to a continuous state from the on-off condition of satisfy and conflict, then builds an objective describing the present conflict degree. As opposed to traditional fuzzy programming methods, the method determines the conflict bottleneck and solves it with a minimum cost of design interval changes with extendability of the design intervals. With a constraint network, the quantitative effect of the downstream constraints can be considered before determining the design parameters. Furthermore, potential conflicts can be solved to avoid significant redesign. A bogie design example illustrates the usefulness of the method

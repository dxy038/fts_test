In this paper, a new approach based on hybrid particle swarm-based-simulated annealing optimization (PSO-B-SA) for solving thermal unit commitment (UC) problems is proposed. The PSO-B-SA presented in this paper solves the two sub-problems simultaneously and independently; unit-scheduled problem that determines on/off status of units and the economic dispatch problem for production amount of generating units. Problem formulation of UC is defined as minimization of total objective function while satisfying all the associated constraints such as minimum up and down time, production limits and the required demand and spinning reserve. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can outperform the other solutions.

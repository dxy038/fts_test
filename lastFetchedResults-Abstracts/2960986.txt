Dutch consumers use various types of commodities, such as electricity, gas, water and heating. In practice, all these commodities are located in one central space, together with the incoming TV-cable and telephone lines. In 1994, Nolec, Schlumberger, Landmark (design office) and NUON (a large Dutch electric utility) started a pilot project to establish whether a meter cupboard could be developed with smaller dimensions and greater functionality. It also had to be suitable for energy management by consumers. The objective was to locate the incoming electricity, gas and water supplies and communication functions in one meter cupboard, thus saving considerable space. All relevant information concerning the consumption of these commodities had to be able to be read on the spot from the associated meters or remotely from a central display or PC. It also had to be possible for both the supply board and the consumers to control the consumption. The pilot project was a complete success. Holec and Schlumberger therefore decided to establish a co-operation to produce and market this integrated unit under the name MULTIMA.

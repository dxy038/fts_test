This paper presents a memetic algorithm for optimization of urban transit route network. The objective of this research is to minimize the users cost and the unsatisfied user demand. The local search operator of the memetic algorithm combines three types of moves: 2-opt moves, exchange of two stops and relocation of one stop. The move of the most direct travel passengers increased in terms of the operation time of routes is chosen as a local search to improve the convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm has been tested with problems reported in the existing literature, and the results show that the algorithm could improve the solution to the transit route network optimization problem in acceptable time and reasonable computing resources.

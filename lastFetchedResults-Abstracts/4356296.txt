The active fault-tolerant control approach relies heavily on the occurred faults. In order to improve the safety of the reconfigurable system, a methodology to incorporate actuator health in the fault-tolerant control design is proposed for a tracking problem. Indeed, information about actuator health degradation due to the applied control is considered in addition to fault estimation. The main objective is to design a fault-tolerant control system which guarantees a high overall system reliability and dependability both in nominal operation and in the presence of faults. Such an objective is achieved by a control performance index, which is proposed based on system reliability analysis. The fault-tolerant controller is synthesized by using a linear matrix inequality approach.

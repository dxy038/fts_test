Inroduction & Objective: Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disease in nervous system, which is known with a variety of movement disorders. Factors such as oxidative stress are the main causes of degeneration subestentia nigra dopaminergic neurons and emergence of Parkinson's. Ellagic acid avoids adverse effects of oxidative stress that leads to cell death. The aim of this study is investigate the effect of ellagic acid on movement disorders in animal models of Parkinson's disease.
Materials and Methods In This study were used 40 adult male rats that were divided randomly into 8 groups: Control, Parkinson's, and three Parkinson groups that once daily for 14 days received the gavage from doses 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg of ellagic acid. Results were presented as mean ± SEM, one-way Anova variance and LSD test. Parkinson's disease was induced with injection of 8 µg of 6_ hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA)  nerve toxin in 2 ml of saline containing 1% ascorbic acid in the middle-anterior bundle (MFB) of the left cerebral hemisphere of rats.
Results: lesion by 6-OHDA in the left brain MFB caused up to 14 days after injury animals after subcutaneous administration of apomorphine 2/5 mg/kg, could rotate 360 degrees to the right with rate of >  10 rpm. and  in the motor tests (Rotarod performance, catalpsy and  Stride length) showed significant differences with compared to the control group. Treatment of animals with Parkinson's disease by different doses of ellagic acid compared with untreated PD group caused a significant improvement in motor activity. doses 25 and 50 mg/kg of ellagic acid showed most effects of treatment.
Conclusion: ellagic acid, probably due to strong antioxidant property and interfere with receptor activity in motor pathways can be used to improve and reduced movement disorders, Parkinson's.

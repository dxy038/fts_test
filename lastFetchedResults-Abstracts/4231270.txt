An experimental system used to study the spectral content of sea spike echoes generated in a wave tank is described. Some illustrative data are presented. The objective is to determine the spectral evolution of radar returns from a disturbed water surface and to relate any spectral changes to changes in the geometry of the surface feature responsible for the backscatter, thereby determining the dynamic transfer function for surface scattering events. In order to obtain high resolution radar data and water surface geometry data simultaneously, a two-channel, ultrawideband radar based on a microwave time-domain reflectometer (TDR) is used in concert with a scanning laser slope gauge (SLSG). Data from these experiments are presented to illustrate the dynamic nature of the sea spike transfer function.

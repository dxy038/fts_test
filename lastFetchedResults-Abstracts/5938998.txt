This paper presents a multi-criteria decision model to evaluate the suitability and the feasibility of alternative options in industrial re-engineering projects. In the model each option is characterized using a combination of linguistic and numerical attributes, which jointly determine the financial feasibility and the risk of that option. The difference between linguistic and numerical attributes, which are naturally incommensurable types, is resolved by means of fuzzy representation. This way a single, combined rating can be produced for each option and objective. The structure and use of the model are illustrated focusing on the selection among alternative energy sources for industrial users, in support of their current effort to reduce the overall UK gas demand.

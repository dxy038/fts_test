This article presents the increasing bandwidth of a flambeau-shaped monopole antenna for UWB application. The prototype antenna has small size of about 38&#215;45 mm<sup>2</sup> and fabricated on a simple FR-4 PCB with a CPW-fed structure. This antenna is supported UWB (Ultra-wideband) applications as required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with the frequency range of about 3.1-10.6 GHz, covering of IEEE 802.15.3a and also IEEE 802.16a standards. The structural simulation technique was used to analyze the antenna characteristics, utilizing the commercial software Computer Simulation Technology (CST). The measured input impedance bandwidth (return loss &lt;;-10 dB) of the prototype antenna was 162.52% for the frequency range of about 2.49-24.09 GHz. The radiation patterns were bidirectional along the proposed frequency band.

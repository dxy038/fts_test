The phenomenology of time attempts to investigate how is constituted the internal time consciousness. In fact phenomenology of time-consciousness concerns itself with the structure of the act of perceiving that allows us to apprehend a temporal object as unified across its manifold moments. In this approach time is no longer the measure of motion, the psychological characters of soul and even the transcendental presuppositions of cognition. Husserl distinguishes three
levels of time for our consideration: (1) world[ly] or objective time; (2) personalistic or subjective time; and (3) the consciousness of internal time. According to Husserl our experience of temporal objects consists of three aspects: 1. protention, 2. retention and 3. primal impression. Protention is a process by which anticipations are formed concerning what will shortly be experienced (in primal impression). 2- Retention is
a process by which something that is experienced-as-present remains in consciousness and sinks back. 3- Primal impression which is the component of consciousness that is narrowly directed toward the now phase of the object. The primal impression cannot be thought independently of its temporal horizon. Thus all experience entails a temporal horizon. This article attempt to explain Husserl's account of time-consciousness.

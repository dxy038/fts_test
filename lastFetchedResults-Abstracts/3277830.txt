A major challenge consists of considering all stakeholders of the future Smart Grid, each with their specific and possibly opposing objectives. A distribution network operator aims at guaranteeing power quality criteria while consumers aspire lowering their power consumption bill. This fundamental issue currently delays the transition from small-scale research projects to a large-scale all-encompassing smart distribution grid. This paper describes a double-layered control methodology using the available flexibility of the majority of discrete smart appliances currently in use. The effect of striving for the objectives separately as well as in combination is examined. The results show that the targeted objective(s) strongly influence(s) the performance in terms of cost effectiveness as well as number of voltage issues.

Objective: To determine the results of incisional hernia repair with polypropylene mesh.Material and Methods: This prospective cohort study was carried out at Isra University Hospital over a period of 7 years between June 2000 and May 2007. All adult patients presenting with a primary or recurrent incisional hernia were included in this study. Post operative complications and recurrence rates were noted. Results: Seventy patients underwent incisional hernia repair with onlay mesh re-enforcement preceded by primary repair. Gynaecological / Obstetrical procedures accounted for 77% of all operation resulting in incisional hernia with lower midline incision (64%) being the most common incision. Ten percent of the patients developed seroma formation, 8.5% had skin necrosis of wound margins, 5% had superficial wound infection and 4.2% had haematoma formation. Only one patient developed recurrence during the follow up of one year. Conclusion: Incisional hernia is more common in lower midline especially after gynaecological / obstetrical and emergency surgery. Primary repair with onlay mesh re-enforcement is safe and easy procedure with acceptable morbidity.

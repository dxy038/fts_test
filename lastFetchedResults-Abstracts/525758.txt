This study was carried out to investigate the effect of operator's age, formal educational and technical level on variable costs of conventional tractors at Arak town countries. To achieve this objective, cluster random sampling method was used and questionnairs were completed for 700 selected conventional tractors (400 universal tractors, U650 and 300 Massey Ferguson tractors, MF285) at three areas (Markazi, Vafs and Khondab) in the region. Based on the collected data for the selected tractors, they were categorized in four groups. MF285 up to 10 years old, MF 285 up to 15 years old, U650 up to 15 years old and U650 up to 20 years old. Extracted data from the questionnairs was then analyzed using SAS statistical software. Results showed that sum of the repair and maintenance, fuel and oil costs for U650 tractores up to 20 years old was significantly greater than that of the other three categories. There was no significant difference between formal educated operators, but with trained operators these costs were reduced significantly. Which might be due to on time periodical maintenance service of tractors used by trained operatores. However, the trained operators were expected more wage than other operators. In some cases, repair and maintenance as well as fuel and oil costs showed a decreasing trend for tractors drived by older operators. Overall, variable costs were considerably reduced with older operators which benifited from technical training. Inversely, for tractors used by older and trained operators the operator's cost was increased.

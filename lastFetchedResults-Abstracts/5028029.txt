BEAST is a bidirectional efficient algorithm for searching trees that performs soft-decision maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding of block codes. The decoding complexity of BEAST is significantly reduced compared to the Viterbi algorithm. An analysis of the asymptotic BEAST decoding complexity verifies BEASTÂ´s high efficiency compared to other algorithms. The best of the obtained asymptotic upper bounds on the BEAST decoding complexity is better than previously known bounds for ML decoding in a wide range of code rates.

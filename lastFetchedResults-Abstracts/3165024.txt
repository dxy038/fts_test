The objective of this paper is to determine the potentialities of an optimal detection scheme within the framework of mobile location. A method for detecting the first arriving path from a multipath environment as a mean of enhancing subscriber location is described. A binary hypothesis test is performed, some expressions for Constant False Alarm Rate (CF AR) detectors are derived and their performances are evaluated for different configurations. The use of Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) is also commented and some preliminary results are shown.

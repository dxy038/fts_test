Interleaved bidirectional transmission with adjacent channel spacing of 25 GHz is demonstrated over nonzero dispersion shifted fiber. Errorfree transmission is performed over five 80-km spans. Construction rules for an ultradense bidirectional link with simultaneous suppression of four-wave mixing and Rayleigh-induced crosstalk is are outlined.

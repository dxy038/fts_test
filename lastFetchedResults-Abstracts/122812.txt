BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in emergency and cardiac care unit due to some problems for medical team including nurses. The objective of this study was to determine the individual problems of nurses working in cardiac care unit and thus with recognizing these problems, the manner of care will be done better.
METHODS: Data regarding demographic charactristics and different parameters of all employed nurses (68 persons) in emergency and cardiac care units of Babol hospitals were gathered and surveyed by questionnaires and then compared by Fisher exact test, Chi square and Cochran tests. FINDINGS: In this study, over half of these nurses had problems. There was not a significant difference between individual problems of nurses in emergency and cardiac care units on the basis of questions related to knowledge, skills and experiences but this difference was meaningful about some questions related to motivation, attitude and supporting of persons who were responsible (p<0.05). Also, there was not relationship between individual charactristics of nurses who worked in two wards and their problems. Furthermore, with omitting all individual charactristics and problems, statistical test did not show any significant difference.
CONCLUSION: According to this study, interruption between knowledge and application in some cases makes some problems. Also, some attitude and motivated problems during their duties in hospital are effective in efficiency, practice and decision of nurses in cardiopulmonary arrest.

The paper describes a response surface methodology (RSM) as an efficient approach to parametric model building and design optimization. Design optimization is a critical important step in the design and evaluation of BLAC motors. The objective in design optimization is to search the design space to determine the values of design variables that optimize the performance characteristics subject to system constrains.

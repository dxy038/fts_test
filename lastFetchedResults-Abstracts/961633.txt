The present study is performed with an objective to acquire a deeper understanding of the properties of nickel-plated polyester fabric after
conducing low temperature plasma treatment. Low temperature plasma treatment with oxygen and argon gases was employed to render a
hydrophilic property of woven polyester fabrics and facilitate the absorption of a palladium catalyst in order to provide a catalytic surface for
electroless nickel plating. The properties of plasma-induced electroless nickel-plated polyester fabrics were evaluated by various standard testing
methods in terms of both physical and chemical performances

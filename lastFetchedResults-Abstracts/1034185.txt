In this paper, a procedure for bi-objective optimization design of functionally gradient materials (FGM) is presented. Different microstructures formed by two primary materials are evaluated by a micromechanical analysis method. Macroscopically, FGMs are optimally designed by using these microstructures. Instead of using conventional simply assumed power law material distribution functions, a generic material distribution function is used. The bi-objective FGM optimization design procedure is highlighted by a flywheel example. A parametric formulation is used for both the geometric representation and the optimization procedure.

Background
Because of limited resources and common barriers to widespread screening, the Surgery Service of the Indianapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center has focused its colorectal screening program on patients undergoing hernia repair. Our objective was to examine the success, safety, pathology results, and educational benefit of this nontraditional screening program.
Methods

The study was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database (1991 to 2002). Initial screening colonoscopy was performed on 263 average-risk Veterans Affairs patients, 217 (83%) in conjunction with hernia repair. Visualized polyps were removed or biopsied during colonoscopy and pathology reports for all specimens were examined. Results were compared with published screening studies.
Results

Complete colonoscopy, defined as cecal intubation, was performed in 93% of initial screening colonoscopies. There were no major complications, including perforation, excessive bleeding, or death, from colonoscopy. Initial colonoscopy showed adenomas in 67 patients (25%), hyperplastic polyps in 34 (13%), and invasive cancer in 4 (1.5%). Follow-up endoscopies revealed cancer in 2 additional patients, 3 and 5 years after initial screening.
Conclusions

This program is an important training resource for surgical residents. Screening colonoscopy performed in conjunction with hernia repair has produced results consistent with more conventional methods. The Surgery Service at the Indianapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center is providing colorectal cancer screening with a high degree of safety and success in the face of limited resources and common barriers to implementation of widespread screening.

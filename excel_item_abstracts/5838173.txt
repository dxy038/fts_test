Motor moment fluctuation is one of the major factors that can deteriorate the low-velocity stability of a turntable system, so as to decrease the control accuracy of the turntable motion. The turntable system is controlled by a current loop and a velocity loop, so we propose a new method to use the PI control strategy in the current loop and the active disturbance rejection controller in the velocity loop to restrain the motor moment fluctuation. This active disturbance rejection controller is composed of a tracking differentiator, an extended state observer, a nonlinear state error feedback controller, and etc. The parameters of the controller are optimally designed, and the simulation results show that this control strategy can effectively restrain the turntable fluctuation from the motor moment fluctuation and better improve the systemÂ´s low velocity performance than the typical PID control strategy.

This paper presents the performances of an original longitudinal magnetization system, designed to assure the magnetic flux concentration on the tube wall. This magnetization system is made of several small peripheral solenoids disposed around each tube, parallel to the tube axis, and was used to investigate the interaction between the arc and the magnetic field in case of MIAB (Magnetically Impelled Arc Butt) welding of low carbon steel thin-walled tubes. The main research objective was the development of process parametrical windows for assuring qualitative joint achievement. Macro- and micro-structural analysis accompanies the hardness tests made on corresponding welded samples, demonstrating the operational process maps in producing sound MIAB joints. The paper also discusses the process main stages based on corresponding images resulting from process monitoring, from arc initiation to the emergence of molten metal when upsetting starts and the weld is formed.

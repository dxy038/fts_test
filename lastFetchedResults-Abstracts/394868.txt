This study examined the test–retest reliability of the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) in patients with binge eating disorder (BED). Short-term (mean days=4.8; SD =3.6) test–retest reliability of the EDE was examined in a sample of 86 patients with BED. Test–retest reliability was excellent for objective bulimic episodes (correlation=.84), but poor to unacceptable for subjective bulimic episodes and objective overeating episodes (correlations=.51 and .39, respectively). Test–retest reliabilities were good for the EDE-Q scales (correlations=.66 to .77), albeit somewhat variable for the individual EDE-Q items (.54 to .78). These findings support the reliability of the EDE-Q for patients with BED. The EDE-Q has utility for assessing the number of binge eating episodes (objective bulimic episodes) and associated features of eating disorders in patients with BED. The results for subjective bulimic episodes are consistent with previous studies in suggesting that these eating behaviors may not be reliable indicators of eating disorders for patients with BED.

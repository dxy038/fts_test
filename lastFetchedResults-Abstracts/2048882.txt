Abstract
Objective: The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of response inhibitation training on working memory in male students with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder.
Materials & Methods: The present research was a quasi-experimental study by pre-test, post-test design with control group. Forty male students with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (8 to 10 years old) were selected by convenient sampling method from schools of Varamin and Gharchak province. They were divided into experimental and control group (each consists of 20 individuals) randomly and equally. The experimental group participated in response inhibitation training in 10 sessions (two sessions weekly; each lasts for 60 minutes), while control group did not. Cornoldy Working Memory Test were used for assessment of all participants. Data were analyzed by analysis of covariance through SPSS version 16. 
Results: Findings showed that response inhibitation training had positive and significant effect on the working memory of students with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (P<0.001).     
Conclusion: The results indicated that response inhibitation training program has led to the improvement of working memory of male students with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder. It is suggested that specialists with planing and implementation of response inhibitation training program promoted working memory of students with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder.

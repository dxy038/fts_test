The main objective of this paper is to introduce a novel method of feature extraction for character data and develop a neural network system for recognising different Latin characters. In this paper we describe feature extraction, neural network development for character recognition and perform further neural network analysis on noisy image segments to explain the qualitative and quantitative aspects of handwriting

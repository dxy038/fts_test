Aroma is an important quality characteristic in Muscat grapes and constitutes a major concern for viticulturist and grapevine breeders. For this reason, Muscat aroma variability was characterised in a segregating progeny and in a collection of table grapes, to assess the usefulness of the presence or absence of rose oxide for predicting Muscat genotypes. Simple tasting and an analysis of free and bound aroma compounds, including rose oxide, linalool oxide, linalool, Î±-terpineol, citronellol, nerol, geraniol, benzyl alcohol and 2-phenylethanol, were carried out. The association between Muscat score and the compounds considered as active odorants according to their odour activity values was also evaluated. The results obtained pointed to a highly significant correlation between the presence/absence of rose oxide in grapes and the presence/absence of Muscat aroma. Thus, this analysis could be a useful tool for identifying Muscat cultivars in a more objective way than sensory analysis.

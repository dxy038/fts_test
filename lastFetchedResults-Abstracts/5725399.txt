Combined Cold Heat and Power (CCHP) is a breakthrough to achieve energy saving and emission reduction. By introducing the heat equivalent, the cold, heat and power are transformed equivalently, and then new objective function is proposed about generation cost and environmental cost of CCHP. In order to reduce unnecessary energy wasting and the random of supplying cold heat and power in different operation condition, so the coordination cost of cold heat and power is set up according to the theory of changing price with time. So a multi-objective optimization model of energy-saving dispatch is formulated based on generation cost, environmental cost and coordination cost of CCHP, and then we solve the problem with the fuzzy optimization programming. The results show that the model is vital in economic dispatch, especially after considering coordination cost, not only can effective manage the need of power and realize peak load shaving. The more important is to be able to change energy production and operation way due to the mismatching of cold heat and power load. It also provides the reference for the promotion of energy -saving dispatch of CCHP.

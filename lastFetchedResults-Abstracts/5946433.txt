Research on bio-mechanical features of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex in Human Wrist can provide theoretical basis for injury prevention, rehabilitation, artificial materials replacement and etc. Method. Use the biomaterial micro-scale test system to conduct stress-relaxation test and one-dimensional tensile failure test on eight cases of fresh specimens from adult male Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex in Human Wrist. Findings. 1. For the various structures and parts of TFCC there is significant difference in the stress relaxation rate. Comparison among parts of carpal fibrocartilage plates shows significant differences in elastic response, while ligamenta and tendon sheath comparison shows no significant difference. 2. The elastic response of all parts of wrist fibrous cartilage is quite different; The difference is little for ligamenta and tendon sheath. The visco-elasticity of the dorsal part of the wrist fibrous cartilage is stronger than that of the palm part. The dorsal part may bear large load; Visco-elasticity and capability to bear load do not differ greatly for ligamenta, tendon sheath and other parts of soft tissues. The fracture stress is relatively large for the dorsal ulnar plate of the wrist fibrous cartilage, and relatively small for extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath. 3. The constitutive equation constant was calculated for each part of the wrist fibrous cartilage, ligamenta and tendon sheath, and as a further result, the normalized stress relaxation function, elastic respons- and the constitutive equation are derived. Interpretation. The causes of injury in the ligamenta and tendon sheath mainly relate to the form of sports and range of motion. The fracture stress is larger in fibrous cartilage back foot, while it is smaller in the carpi-ulnaris tendon sheath. The former is not easily to be injured in motion, while the latter is prone to be injured.

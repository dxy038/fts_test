This article describes mathematical programming models that have been developed and employed to evaluate configuration strategies for metropolitan ATM telecommunication networks. The models determine the optimal placement of ATM switch hardware and fiber optic transport. The objective is to satisfy point-to-point traffic demand at minimum cost while ensuring specified performance under a core failure contingency. Model results suggest that a simple architecture based on two core switch locations provides a robust, near-optimal solution.

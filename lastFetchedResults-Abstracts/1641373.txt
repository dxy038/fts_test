This research concerns the using metal powders and MDF production wastes as alternative sources to natural fibers in manufacturing woodâ€“plastic composites (WPCs). The objective of this work was to investigate the influence of various levels of MDF dust and aluminum powder (AlP) on physical and mechanical characteristics of MDF dust/polypropylene composite. Polypropylene was used as a thermoplastic matrix, and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) as a coupling agent. Hot pressing method was used to prepare samples with 1 g/cm3 nominal density. The mechanical and physical properties were measured according to the technical specifications CEN/TS15534 and ASTM standard D 570, respectively. It was found that mechanical properties decreased and water absorption and thickness swelling increased with increasing amount of MDF dusts and AlP. Applying field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), the aluminum powder and composite morphology was studied.

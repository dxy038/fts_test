Objective
enesis is a pivotal process on which solid tumor growth is substantially dependent. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is the most potent natural anti-angiogenic factor, which has seldom been studied in bladder tumor, and whose functioning pathway remains unclear. We have thus investigated PEDF expression in relation to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and microvessel density (MVD) with immunohistochemistry.
s
dies of PEDF and TNF-α were examined by Western blotting before immunohistochemistry. Sixty-four urothelial tumor sections and 23 normal controls were stained and expression of PEDF, TNF-α, and MVD were studied.
s
sed PEDF expression and increased TNF-α expression was noticed in tumorous tissue compared with healthy urothelium. Lower PEDF expression was related to higher tumor grade but stage. Increased TNF-α expression was noticed in recurrent, larger tumors as well as in tumors with progression in grade and stage. Expression of PEDF and TNF-α was correlated in bladder tumor. PEDF or TNF-α was correlated with MVD negatively or positively, respectively, in cancerous tissue and tumorous grouping without correlation in papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential.
sion
sional change of PEDF and TNF-α is in relation to angiogenesis of bladder tumor, especially in bladder cancer development.

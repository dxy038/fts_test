This manuscript addresses the problem of comparing PI(D) autotuning methods on an objective basis. First the problem is formalised and motivated, and a methodological framework to tackle it is proposed. An evaluation method is then introduced, restricting the analysis to model-based methods; the treatise of characteristics based ones is deferred to future works. Finally, some simulation examples are reported, where the proposed approach is used to select the ´best suited´ method, among a set of well established ones, for a given tuning problem.

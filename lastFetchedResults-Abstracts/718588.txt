Objective: Environmental pollution is of major concern today and lead is considered to be one of the most important environmental pollutants. Long-term contact with lead causes harmful effects to humans. This study seeks to determine the effects of Curcuma longa (turmeric extract) consumption and exercise training on glutathione peroxidase and protein carbonyl in kidney and spleen tissues from rats exposed to lead. 
Methods: We randomly classified 60 male rats into the following six groups of 10 rats per group: 1) control; 2) sham (turmeric extract solvent); 3) lead; 4) training + lead; 5) turmeric extract + lead; and 6) training + lead + turmeric extract. The training program for groups 3 and 6 consisted of running on a level treadmill for 40 sessions (eight weeks at five sessions per week) at a speed of 22 to 15 m/min for 26 to 64 minutes. Turmeric extract (30 mg/kg) was injected three times per week for eight weeks. Amounts of glutathione peroxidase and protein carbonyl were measured by ELISA.
Results: The amount of protein carbonyl in the kidney and spleen tissues of the lead group increased compared to the sham, training, combined and extract groups. Rats in the combined, extract and practice groups (F=4.787; P=0.002) had lower levels of protein carbonyl in their kidney and spleen tissues compared to the sham group (F=6.970, P=0.000). Glutathione peroxidase levels in the kidney and spleen tissues were less in the lead group compared to the sham group. However these levels in the training, extract, and combined groups increased compared with the sham group (respectively, in kidney and spleen P=0.051, F=2.466 and P=0/086, F=2.11).
Conclusion: Intake of turmeric extract and exercise alone did not cause complete inhibition of the oxidative effects in kidney and spleen tissues. However, exercise and consumption of turmeric extract can be effective in reducing the harmful effects of lead.

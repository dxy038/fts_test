This presentation will describe the Air Force Research Laboratory Highly Integrated Photonics Program (AF HIP) and its objective to integrate on a monolithic device, all of the optical components required to serve as a bus coupler in an all optical data communication network. Monolithic integration (chips fabricated out of a single material system) remains the ultimate vision for integrated optics

In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristics for increasing the contrast of images. In this way, the contrast enhancement is obtained by globally transformation of the input intensities. ACO is used to generate the transfer functions which map the input intensities to the output intensities. SA as a local search method is utilized to modify the transfer functions generated by ACO. GA has the responsibility of evolutionary process of antsÂ´ characteristics. The results indicate that the new method performs better than the previously presented methods from the subjective and objective viewpoints.

Background: Cervical cancer is still one of the most common cancer among women in developing countries. Pap smear is effective screening test that can identify preinvasive neoplastic condition .
Objective: This study was down because of comparison of pap smear alone and pap with acetic acid in diagnosis of cervical neoplasm.
Methods: 1600 women who presented for gynecolgic examination in Buali and Imam Khomeini gynecologic centers , underwent cervical screening with pap smear and nake-eye examination of cervix after cervical acetic acid wash for 30 second . The patients were married and<45 years old, without pregnancy , history of CIN or cervical cancer and cryo therapy, cautery and cone biopsy. Papsmear was initially done for all patients then the cervix was washed with acetic acid 3% for 30 seconds . All cases with abnormal Papsmear and epithelium whitening of cervix underwent colposcopy and biopsy . Finally , the sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive value of each test were determined.
Findings: In our investigation 1600 patients were studied that 104 patients were done colposcopy and biopsy . Twenty - three patients had abnormal pap . Sixty patients had white epithelium that their pap smear were normal. Results of sixty biopsy were 13 cases of CIN and one case of invasive cancer and 46 cases had benign biopsy.

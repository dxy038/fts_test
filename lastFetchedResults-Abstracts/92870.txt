The objective of the present study was to determine whether parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is present in the equine follicular fluid and if so, how it is related to the follicular development in the horse. For this purpose, ovaries were collected from 40 Thoroughbred and Thoroughbred Cross mares at slaughter during the period from February to May. Normal growing follicles were dissected from the ovaries of each mare and their diameters measured. A total of 174 follicles was used in this study. The follicular fluid was aspirated from each follicle and assayed for PTHrP, oestradiol (E), testosterone (T) and progesterone (P). The follicles were classified as either oestrogenic or non-oestrogenic if the follicular fluid content of oestradiol was >40 or <40Â ng/ml, respectively. PTHrP concentrations were significantly (P<0.05) higher in oestrogenic follicles, but T and P concentrations did not differ. Furthermore, E:T ratio was significantly (P<0.05) greater in oestrogenic follicles compared to the non-oestrogenic ones. The mean diameter of oestrogenic follicles was significantly (P<0.05) greater than that of non-oestrogenic ones. The higher concentrations of PTHrP observed in the follicular fluid of healthy oestrogenic follicles suggest that it may have a role in the control of ovarian function.

The objective of the present study was determined on the concentration of seven important elements
and chemical composition of the organic compound from Medlarâ€™s fruit (Iran) using ICP-AES and GC-MS
techniques. The mineral content of samples was determined by standard addition method and RSDs lower than
3.75. The detection limits of the method for the 7 elements were 0.04-4 ?glG1. In Medlar fruit, the concentration
of Calcium with compare to K, Mg, Na, Fe, Zn and Cr was more. Fourteen organic compounds of the Medlar's
fruit were characterized. The results have shown that the main fatty acid is linolelaidic acid with percentages
of 24.01. The percentages of oleic acid and palmitic acid in this fruit were 11.45 and 6.97, respectively.

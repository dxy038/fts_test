Recognizing the strategic importance of embedded computing for industry and society, the European Commission formed, together with industry, academia, and national governments, the European technology platform ARTEMIS (Advanced Research and Technology for Embedded Intelligence and Systems) in 2004. It is one goal of ARTEMIS to develop a cross-domain embedded system architecture, supported by design methods and tools, to significantly improve the functionality, dependability, and cost-effectiveness of embedded systems. The GENESYS (Generic Embedded Systems) project, carried out by a consortium of twenty industrial and academic partners coming from different embedded system domains, developed a blueprint for such an architecture that should be applicable in the industrial domain as well as in the multimedia domain. This blueprint (GENESYS) has been strongly influenced by the concepts of and the experience with the time-triggered architecture. It is the objective of this contribution to give an overview of the cross-domain architecture GENESYS.

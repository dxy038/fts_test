Background. Although minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) is being employed for revascularization of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with the left internal mammary artery (LIMA), little objective data exist regarding graft patency. Because the procedure is performed on a beating heart through a limited access approach, concerns have been raised regarding the ability to perform as accurate an anastomosis compared with conventional coronary artery bypass (CAB).
Methods. A prospective study of consecutive patients undergoing MIDCAB LIMA to LAD was undertaken. All procedures were performed through a limited anterior thoracotomy incision with a stabilization device. Selective angiography of the LIMA graft was performed intraoperatively or in the immediate postoperative period.
Results. One hundred and three patients underwent the MICAB procedure. Angiographic evaluation of the anastomosis was obtained in 100 patients (97%). Angiographic graft patency was 99%, with perfect graft patency (no stenosis greater than 50%) being 91%. Three grafts were revised in the operating room. One patient underwent reoperation and 3 more underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. There were two noncardiac mortalities (1.9%), both with patent grafts.
Conclusions. Immediate graft patency after MIDCAB is acceptable, and comparable with conventional CAB data, although meaningful comparison is difficult. The significance of early angiographic findings and the role for early angiography remain to be defined.

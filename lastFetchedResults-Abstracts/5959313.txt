In this article, a new interactive information transmission model of learning based on Visual Simulation System for digital campus is created and researched. Fundamental conception and technological features of digital campus as well as the general framework of its visualization subsystem are introduced. A practical case of visual campus simulation system of Guangxi University of Technology is described. The main issues of simulation application based on Creator and Vega are discussed in detail and some applications of the visual campus system are also given Education resource authoring in virtual studio is also introduced. Our main objective is to determine specific circumstances enabling objects to be defined for this special modeling. We begin by introducing application of features in models for virtual teaching, and then discuss issues in local and global education, focusing on the advantages of virtual education.

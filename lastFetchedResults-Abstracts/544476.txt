Objective: To study the effects of different matrices and co-culture systems
on cultured limbal stem cells (LSCs).
Materials and Methods: Limbal explants were co-cultured with limbal
fibroblasts (LF) and/or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) on filter inserts
coated with amniotic membrane (AM), matrigel (MAT) and collagen type I
(COL).
Results: This study revealed that AM facilitated the cell migration and
expansion significantly in comparison with other matrices. However, the
gene expression profile of stemness markers of LSCs showed no significant
differences among the experimental groups. The data indicated that at least in
two-dimensional culture systems, the mentioned matrices have no significant
effect on switching the expression of genes involved in differentiation process.
In addition, the results of the two co-culture systems in case of different
feeders, including MEF and LF were similar in growth rate and also preserving
stemness quality of cultured limbal cells.
Conclusion: To exclude the pollution of transplantable cultivated cells with
probable mouse viruses, LF with human origin is recommended as feeder.
Hence, limbal explants grown on AM in co-culture with LF will promise a quick
and safe model for preparing undifferentiated epithelial sheets suitable for
transplantation.

Existing self-tuning algorithms imply an optimal-control or -regulation objective. The paper describes a self-tuning technique which uses a classical pole-assignment method which is nonoptimal. The approach has the same `self-tuning&#194;&#191; property as do optimal self-tuning regulators, but is fundamentally more robust. In particular, pole assignment can be applied to nonminimum-phase situations in which conventional self tuners will fail. This point is of great practical significance, since nonminumum-phase behaviour is commonly encountered in self-tuning applications. A second, but closely related, feature of the pole-assignment self tuner is its ability successfully to regulate systems with unknown, possibly varying, transport delays, in situations where other methods have great difficulty.

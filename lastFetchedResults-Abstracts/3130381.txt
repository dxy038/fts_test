A novel main circuit topology of three phase parallel type multi-objective controllable current quality disturbance generator is proposed in this paper. Basing on the differences of function module, the generator is divided into fundamental power module and harmonic power module. The fundamental power can generate power frequency current and less than the power frequency current. Harmonic power module can generate various harmonic current disturbance. Each power module is composed of single-phase PWM rectifier unit and H-Bridge multilevel inverter. The three phase inverter is decoupling controlled. H-Bridge multilevel inverter are controlled by carrier phase shifting sinusoidal pulse width modulation(SPWM). Design a hardware controller , basing on FPGA, used as the core in the system and cooperating with DSP and CPLD. Finally, build a simulation model on the platform of PSCAD/EMTDC. Basing on model analysis, simulation has been done on harmonic current, current fluctuation, active power regulation and reactive power regulation. The results show that the main circuit topology and control strategies are feasible and effective.

In this paper, a design of a controller based on the NN-SANARX (Neural Network based Simplified Additive Autoregressive exogenous) model is considered on the basis of a prototype of a real liquid level tank system. Structure of the neural network is chosen using two different methods of genetic algorithms with multi-objective optimization. The goal of the control algorithm is to track the desired level of the liquid in the upper tank.

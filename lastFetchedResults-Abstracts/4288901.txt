In this paper, we present a new algorithm-asynchronous self-adjustable island genetic algorithm (aSAIGA) for multi-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is built upon the coarse-grained architecture, which is divided into sub-processes and distributed amongst several island processors. In each sub-process, an asynchronous communication operation and a self-adjusting operation are adopted to enhance the algorithm in both speedup and global searching capabilities. Satisfactory results and significant speedup can be achieved by aSAIGA, as shown by simulation

A two-layer multi-objective compatible control algorithm is proposed for a class of conflicting multi-objective control problems. The first layer is devoted to obtaining a userÂ´s desired controlled objectives region, assured to be not only achievable but also Pareto-optimal. The second layer is devoted to achieve the objectives subject to system constraints from the controlled objectives region in the first layer by an iterative genetic optimization algorithm. Simulation illustrates that the two-layer multi-objective compatible control algorithm is effective for conflicting multi-objective control problem.

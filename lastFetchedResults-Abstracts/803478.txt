Background: Malva sylvestris (M.S) with various drug effects, especially on mucociliary system as dilutor drug and sputum collection is known.
Objective: This study examined the effects of M.S and Bromhexine HCL (B.H) in mucociliary system of trachea chicken.
Methods: In this experimental study five groups of Leghorn chickens were studied under identical conditions. Four groups received oral B.H & oral M.S extract & nebulas normal saline & nebulas M.S extract during 12 days, respectively andone group was considered as control. After 12 days the chicks were killed and the biopsy samples from the middletracheal were taken for histopathology study using PAS and H & E methods under light microscopy. Finally Image tools II Software were used for counting of size and number of mucous glands and cilia.
Results: Results of the analysis of data showed that nebulizing of M.S increases the number and the size of mucous glands, also the size of cilia compare to 3 groups: control, oral B.H, normal saline significantly. The oral M.S extract group showed significant differences in number of the mucous glands compared with other 3 groups.
Conclusion: According to more mucolitic effects of M.S extract than Bromhexine HCL and side effects for drugs mucolitic is recommended to be used that respiratory and inflammatory diseases of the M.S extract.

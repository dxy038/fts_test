The main objective of the paper is to characterize multipliers of summability fields of regular methods,
while relaxing the usual boundedness condition. For this purpose we use the sequence spaces of A-bounded
sequences and A-uniformly integrable sequences. Among the main results, it is shown that the space of
multipliers is closely related to the space of A-statistically convergent sequences and that A-statistical convergence
over  ∞ is equivalent to a regular matrix method. This observation eliminates the need for separate
proofs of several A-statistical convergence results.

Rapid evolution of pork production in Argentina requires new calibrations for predicting carcass lean meat percentage with the Fat-O-Meater (FOM) and Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP), first adopted in 1995. The second objective was to unify the lean percentage units with those applied by the European Union. Carcasses of 59 gilts and 56 barrows from different environments and breeds were tested. Carcass weights were from 65 to 117 kg, and lean content was from 38% to 62%. Predicting lean content by multiple regression equations, the coefficients of determination R2 were 0.801 and 0.794 for the FOM and HGP equations, and the residual standard deviations (RSD) were 2.40% and 2.45%, respectively. Both instruments had the same precision and were accurate enough to be adopted in national carcass grading classification. Hot carcass weight was not selected as a significant variable. The same prediction equations could be used for gilts and barrows. Quadratic terms did not improve predictions.

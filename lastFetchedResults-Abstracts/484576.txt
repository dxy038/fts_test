Background and Objective: Pyogenic granuloma (PG) is one of the common oral reactive oral lesions that often is generated in the tissues after mild trauma, in which connective tissues overgrowth with a very highly vascular stroma. The aim of this research is the study of its fairly common prevalence and fearful clinical features that may mislead the practitioner to faulty diagnosis. 
A series of 95 consecutive confirmed cases of oral pyogenic granuloma were selected after biopsy and histopathologic evaluation. The age, sex, anatomic location, consistency, etiological factor, pain and bleeding history, surface texture, and pedicle situation were recorded for them in a medical chart the data were analyzed by SPSS (11) statistical software. Chi-square test ( P<0.05). was performed to obtain the following results. 
PG is more common among females (64.2%) than males (35.8%), with increased prevalence in the second (27%) and fifth (23%) decades.It is more common in alveolar maxilla (56.8%) and anterior regions.
It has a consistency of (76.8%) with ulcerated (65.3%) and bleeding surface (58.9%) In 65% of cases, the lesions have been pedanculated. Only in 8.4% of cases the pain was reported in addition, the most common recognized etiology was calculus (20%).

Conclusion: Pyogenic granuloma is more common in females and in anterior region of jaws.  It is happened most in 2nd and 5th decades and in maxilla with ulcerated surface and had tendency to bleed without pain. The most recognized etiology is calculus.

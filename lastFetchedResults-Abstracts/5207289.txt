Tourism service composition combines various tourism elements for users, including transportations, catering, accommodation and other tourism service elements, in order to generate a one-stop tourism service that meets multi-objective needs of users. In doing this, it should simultaneously consider the historical travel data and the current preference of user to complete the composition. In addition, the composition process should be efficient enough to return results online for users in real time. In this paper, we establish a model of tourism service composition based on multi-objective optimization according to the parameters of tourism services. In particular, this model involves three optimization objectives: time, cost and quality of services. We then propose a single-objective-based optimization algorithm to effectively and efficiently solve the tourism service composition problem based on multi-objective optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison with the particle swarm optimization-based multi-objective optimization algorithm, our approach can obtain more accurate results and achieve the significant improvement in optimization efficiency.

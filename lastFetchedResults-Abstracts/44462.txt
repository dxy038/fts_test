The behavior under seismic loading of multiple-anchor connections to concrete was the ultimate objective of the research program discussed here. That research program addressed the static and dynamic behavior, under tension and shear (separately and in combination) of single and multiple-anchor connections to concrete. Effects of cracking and dynamic loading rates were addressed. This paper deals with the seismic response of multiple-anchor connections to concrete. Its most important conclusion is that multiple-anchor connections designed for ductile behavior in uncracked concrete under static loading will probably still behave in a ductile manner in cracked concrete under dynamic loading.

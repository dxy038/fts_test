Objective: To determine whether maternal placental perfusion occurs in the first trimester, this study compared veins in endometrium with those in decidua. We hypothesize that veins draining the placenta become dilated and contain syncytiotrophoblastic fragments. Study Design: Normal late-secretory endometrial biopsy specimens (n = 10) were compared with elective abortion decidua at 7 to 11 weeks (n = 100). Tissue sections were processed by routine staining and immunohistochemical studies. The cross sections of veins and glands were counted in 25 decidual biopsy specimens, and the number of syncytiotrophoblastic fragments in veins or glands was determined. Statistical significance by Ï‡2 or linear regression analysis was P< .05. Results: All sets of decidua had dilated veins; no secretory endometrium did. Intravenous syncytiotrophoblastic fragments were seen in 91 of 100 sets of decidua. There were more syncytial elements in veins (572/6845, 8.4%) than in glands (13/23,310, 0.06%) (P< .001). Conclusion: Decidual veins were distended and contained syncytiotrophoblastic fragments, consistent with maternal intervillous perfusion in the first trimester. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:455-9.)

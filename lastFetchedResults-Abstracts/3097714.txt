Intelligent techniques are present in an increasing number of applications related to the electrical power systems (EPS), due to its ability in dealing with complex and nonlinear problems. Amongst these problems is the voltage control of the Brazilian EPS, which is currently based on the experience of real time operators. With the objective of developing a decision support system capable of assisting in the decision process of real time voltage control, this paper presents a neural network based system that identifies, automatically, the necessary actions for the correct voltage control of EPS. The proposed system has been evaluated in the voltage control of the 765 kV transmission system, associated to the flowing of Itaipu hydro power plant generation, showing its potential results for a practical application.

Energy efficiency in wireless networks has taken an important role in recent years due to the global climate change and growing demand for higher data rates. Cooperative communications might be efficient in improving coverage of a cell whereas it can also contribute to the energy efficiency of wireless systems with the help of its distributed structure. Improving the energy efficiency of a wireless system by using cooperative communications is the main objective of this paper. We analyze deployment strategies for decode-and-forward (DF) networks in order to minimize the power consumption of a cell. Deployment strategies include choosing relay locations and finding the optimum number of relays. We conclude by showing the effect of using a relay in a cellular system as opposed to direct transmission in terms of energy efficiency.

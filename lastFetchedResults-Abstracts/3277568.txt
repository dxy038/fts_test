The objective of this research was to design and construct of the low - cost defibrillator analyzer. This research has adopted the principle of voltage divider and standard calibration curves of the relationship between the set of standard output energy, the standard maximum voltage and the standard maximum current versus the digital output of them. The designed and constructed the low - cost defibrillator analyzer was composed of 3 main parts: 1) the input part consisting of the paddle electrodes receptacle, 2) the signal conditioner and processing part including voltage attenuator circuit, surge protection circuit, and microcontroller ARM Cortex M3, STM32F107VCT 6 for processing of energy, peak voltage, peak current, pulse period and plotting the both monophasic and biphasic waveforms and 3) the display part consisting of LCD touch screen display for displaying the energy value in Joule unit, peak voltage in Volt unit, peak current in Ampere unit, period in millisecond unit and the waveform of the unit under test. The testing results were compared with standard defibrillator analyzer FLUKE Model Impulse 6000D showed the waveform, accuracy and to value measure can be highly related with the comparative devices. The results of standard calibration for accuracy of the load resistance and energy measuring by the laboratory of Calibration Services and Environmental Analysis Department, Technology Promotion Association (Thailand - Japan) that has been certified by the international ISO - 17025 shown that the average uncertainties of the 95 percent confidence level are &#177; 0.0053 Ohm and &#177; 1.2 joules respectively. The result of the user satisfaction of 13 people found that the mean satisfaction score was 3.8 out of 4. The production cost of the prototype is 25,000 baht.

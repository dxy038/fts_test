In this paper In this paper, which is one of the part of the development for the automation system in the navigation process, covers the car system. Local detection system based on pseudo-satellite was used to be able to detect the space coordinates and the absolute location with four ultrasonic transmitters and two receivers. Using this system we get the lateral dynamic model of a reduced car by using system identification methods and design a lateral controller. The system input is the steering wheel angle of the vehicle with constant speed and the output is the yaw of the vehicle. With system identification for a basis, to achieve a control objective, we design a controller using the model equation.

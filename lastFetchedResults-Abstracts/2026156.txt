It is generally accepted that the low quality of soil carbon limits the amount of energy available for soil microorganisms, and in turn the rate of soil carbon mineralization. The priming effect, i.e. the increase in soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition rate after fresh organic matter input to soil, is often supposed to result from a global increase in microbial activity due to the higher availability of energy released from the decomposition of fresh organic matter. Work to date, however, suggests that supply of available energy induces no effect on SOM mineralization. The mechanisms of the priming effect are much more complex than commonly believed. The objective of this review was to build a conceptual model of the priming effect based on the contradictory results available in the literature adopting the concept of nutritional competition. After fresh organic matter input to soils, many specialized microorganisms grow quickly and only decompose the fresh organic matter. We postulated that the priming effect results from the competition for energy and nutrient acquisition between the microorganisms specialized in the decomposition of fresh organic matter and those feeding on polymerised SOM.

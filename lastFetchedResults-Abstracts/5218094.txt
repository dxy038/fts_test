A lightering operation is a type of ship-to-ship (STS) operations to transfer crude oil or LNG from one vessel to another that is carried out and controlled by human operators. The final approach phase in lightering operations is particularly critical in order to avoid steel to steel contact. Operational safety and efficiency require sufficient instrumental measurements and adequate human operations. A major objective with the ongoing research activity on STS operations is to develop and implement a guidance and decision-support system for the ship navigation officers in charge of STS operations in order to assist in safe navigation and operation when in close proximity. Two field observation programmes focused on the final approach phase have been carried out on board Aframax tankers conducting lightering operations in the US Gulf in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Measurement and analytical results of these operations are shown.

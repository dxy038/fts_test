Objective: This study was to explore the predictors of college students´ attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help. Methods: 700 university students from different grades and majors were chosen as subjects to survey. Results: Attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help was taken as dependent variable, and analysis of variance among gender (2) and major (2) was made. Main effects of gender was significant, F (1, 615) =3.294, p&lt;;0.05.Main effects of major was significant, F (1, 615) =20.896, p&lt;;0.001. Interaction effects of gender and major were not significant, F (1, 615) =1.890, p=0.170. The result of regressive analysis was R=0.636, R<sup>2</sup>=0.405, F=29.641, p&lt;;0.001, it indicated that regressive equation was significance. Conclusion: (1) There are six variables, which can significantly predict the attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help and which can be arranged in the following order according to their predicative ability: whether or not seek help, interdependent self-construal, self- concealment, major, internal control and gender. (2) Female students´ attitude is more positive than that of the male students. (3) The attitude of students whose major is sports or art is more positive than that of the students whose major is not sports or art. (4) The attitude of students who have interdependent self- construal is more positive than that of students who have not interdependent self-construal. (5) High self- concealment students´ attitude is more negative than that of low self-concealment students. (6) Internal control students´ attitude is more negative than that of other control students.

Anisotropic conductive adhesives (ACAs) have been used in fine pitch electronics packaging for over a decade and provide a high density and low temperature bonding method in a range of niche applications. The principal objective of this paper is to provide significant insights into the basic conductive characteristics of ACAs based on a review of previously reported scientific research, and to identify the current challenges and future prospects for this technology. In order to provide a concise, structured overview of this topic, many detailed conductive models, mathematical solutions and research methodologies are presented based on the reviewed literature. These models can partially explain the conductive mechanisms of an ACA particle, but make a number of important simplifying assumptions. However, one model was developed and can be used to explain the conductive mechanism of an ACA particle more successfully. In conclusion, existing computational models, mathematical models and physical models have been used to estimate the resistance of an ACA particle and the particle contact area, and therefore constriction resistance, for a given degree of particle deformation, thereby almost achieving a model for the whole resistance of an ACA joint. The paper will close by identifying other research challenges remaining for this important electronics interconnection technology.

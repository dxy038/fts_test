This paper addresses thrust allocation optimization applied to semi-submersible platform for energy conservation. Here we suggest a sequential quadratic programming method based on simplex evolution technique (SESQP), where we consider thruster rate, forbidden sectors into simplex solution space and take account operational constraints into objective function minimized thrust typically. The method is illustrated by simulation experiment for a certain semi-submersible platform equipped with azimuth thrusters. The example shows flexible performance and reduced energy consumption.

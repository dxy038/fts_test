After analyzed the running mode of city light rail vehicles, the author expounds the necessity of using energy-storage regeneration braking system. Then this paper puts forward a new regeneration braking system using Ultra-capacitor as energy storage element. The system uses bidirectional converter between Ultra-capacitor and traction inverter DC link, to make sure that capacitor can store the energy produced by regeneration braking system when the general regeneration braking can not be achieved, and provide energy to traction inverter DC link when vehicle is working in the traction condition. In this case, it can ensure that light rail can realize the regenerative braking in the conventional braking, and the light rail vehicle reduces the energy consumption obviously.

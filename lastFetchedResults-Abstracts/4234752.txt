This paper presents an efficient method for placement of shunt capacitor in a harmonic polluted power system. The planning problem is formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem. In the approach also considers probabilistic characteristics of voltage, current and impedance of fundamental and harmonics in a power system. The objective function is the total system power loss. The shunt capacitor siting indices are computed to find the most suitable shunt capacitor locations. Simulation results obtained by testing an actual distribution system show that the proposed method is robust and computationally efficient.

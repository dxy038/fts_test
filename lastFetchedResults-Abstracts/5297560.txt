In many situations, economic dispatching with group and resource constrains is of considerable importance in electrical power system regulation. In this paper, an economic dispatching problem modeled by scheduling pattern under the consideration of group technology and resource constrains is investigated. In the proposed model, the setup time and processing time is constrained by resource, and the objective function is to minimize total resource consumption of setup time and jobs under makespan constrains. Based on some properties of the problem, an example is given to illustrate it.

We study scheduling unit-length packets with soft deadlines. In our setting, packets arrive over time and a packet may have different values contributed to the objective when it is delivered at different time. In one time step, at most one packet is allowed to be sent. Our goal is to maximize the total value achieved by delivering packets. Based on various application requirements, we propose two models: a general model and a B-bounded model. In this paper, we design optimal offline algorithms and two simple online algorithms, MATCH and GREED, and give their competitive analysis.

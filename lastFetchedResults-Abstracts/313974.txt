Background
Microprocessor-controlled knee joints appeared on the market a decade ago. These joints are more sophisticated and more expensive than mechanical ones. The literature is contradictory regarding changes in gait and balance when using these sophisticated devices.
Methods

This study employed a crossover design to assess the comparative performance of a passive mechanical knee prosthesis compared to a microprocessor-controlled knee joint in 15 subjects with an above-knee amputation. Objective measurements of gait and balance were obtained.
Results

Subjects demonstrated significantly improved gait characteristics after receiving the microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee joint (p < 0.01). Improvements in gait were a transition from a hyperextended knee to a flexed knee during loading response which resulted in a change from an internal knee flexor moment to a knee extensor moment. The participantsâ€™ balance also improved (p < 0.01). All conditions of the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) demonstrated improvements in equilibrium score. The composite score also increased.
Conclusions

Transfemoral amputees using a microprocessor-controlled knee have significant improvements in gait and balance.

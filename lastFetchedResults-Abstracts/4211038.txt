This paper focuses on the problem of regenerator placement in cloud-ready Elastic Optical Networks (EONs). We assume that the EON supports different modulation formats (MFs) under impairment constraints that are represented as the maximum transmission reach of the MFs. High spectrum effective MFs provide shorter transmission range what in the case of larger distances triggers the need to use regenerators. We propose new algorithms for regenerator placement in EONs. To address the fact that cloud computing services are provisioned by data centers (DCs) with the use of anycasting, the proposed algorithms include information on DC location and ratio of anycast traffic in the network. Evaluation of proposed algorithms is made in the context of dynamic traffic scenario with the objective to minimize blocking probability experienced in a network with regenerator location yielded by a particular placement algorithm. Results of experiments show that the cloud-aware location of regenerators can significantly reduce the blocking probability as well as reduce the number of used regenerators comparing to classical approaches.

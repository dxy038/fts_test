This paper gives an overview of bidirectional optical splitter characteristics. It outlines the basics of passive optical network infrastructure, describes the most common attenuation mechanisms in optical fibers and the testing methodology for measuring optical splitter performance. The paper compares two types of Planar Light wave Circuit (PLC) splitters and provides measurement results for samples of both.

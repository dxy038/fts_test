Presenting an historical paper on a broad technical subject such as this can be a more difficult task than describing the details of a technical contribution. The former is subjective while the latter, with its logic, mathematics, and measurement data is (usually) objective. Individual points of view of historical highlights, differ, so it is important that some background on the author of such a paper be known by the reader to give him an aid in evaluating the perspective of the points of view presented.

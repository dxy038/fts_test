A compact wavelength-division (de)multiplexer is proposed and demonstrated experimentally to achieve doubled channel number and halved channel spacing by utilizing a bidirectional arrayed-waveguide grating integrated with an Mach-Zehnder interferometer optical interleaver. As an example, an 18-channel wavelength-division (de)multiplexer with a channel spacing of 200 GHz is designed and fabricated. The measured excess loss is about 8 dB and the channel crosstalk is -15 ~ -18 dB. The footprint of this fabricated (de)multiplexer is about 520 &#956;m &#215; 190 &#956;m.

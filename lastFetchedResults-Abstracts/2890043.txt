A comparative analysis for the gray scale image encryption technique is presented in this paper and more focus on security management of the bulk data (i.e. image) transfer in the secure way. This will provide authentication for user, ethical code, accuracy and safety of images which is travelling over internet while an image based data requires more effort during encryption &amp; decryption. The most proposed architecture for encryption and decryption is developed with the same objective of an image using suitable user defined key. There are various methods by which image can be encrypted and decrypted to ensure the security. But here in this paper image encryption and decryption is performed using two major transforms i.e. Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform and Discrete Linear Canonical Transform.

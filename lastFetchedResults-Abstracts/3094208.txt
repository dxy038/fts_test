The multiple component synchrony measure (MCSM), a multivariate objective response detection (MORD) technique in the frequency domain, was applied to EEG signals during somatosensory stimulation of the right posterior tibial nerve collected from derivations [Fpz´-Cz´] and [C3´-C4´] of 10 adult volunteers. Stimuli were applied at the rate of 4.91 Hz and at the motor threshold intensity level. Detection was identified based on the null hypothesis of response absence rejection - when the estimates exceed the critical values (significance level alpha=0.05 and M=100, 400 and 800 epochs). For these three M values, detection was obtained in at least 80 % of the volunteers for the frequency range from 34.3 to 54.0 Hz, within the gamma band. With M=400, however, response could be detected in all subjects for this frequency range. Similar performance was observed for M=800. These findings indicate that MCSM is capable of objectively identifying stimuli response

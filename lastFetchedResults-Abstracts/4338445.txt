This paper presents a new and efficient methodology for network reconfiguration with optimal power flow based on Benders decomposition approach. The objective minimizes the power losses, balancing load among the feeders and subject to the constraints: capacity limit of the branches, minimal and maximal limits of the substation or generator, minimum deviation of the nodes voltages and radial operation of the networks. A variant of the generalized Benders decomposition algorithm is applied for solving the problem, since the formulation can be embedded under two stages. The first one is the master problem and is formulated as mixed integer non-linear programming. This stage determines the radial topology of the distribution network. The second stage is the slave problem and is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem. This stage is used to determine the feasibility of the master problem solution by means of an optimal power flow and provides information to formulate the linear Benders cuts. The model is programmed in GAMS mathematical modeling language. The effectiveness of the proposal is demonstrated through an example extracted from the specialized literature.

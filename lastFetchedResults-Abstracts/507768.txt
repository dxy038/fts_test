Assembly line balancing problem is an approach of assigning a set of tasks to an ordered
sequence of workstations. This assignment needs to be made in such a way that the
underlying precedence constraints are not violated and efficiency measures are optimized
subject to the restriction of the cycle time constraint. Research works, reported so far, mainly
deal with the minimization of balancing loss, subject to precedence constraints. Lack of
uniqueness in those optimum solutions and pressing demand to include system loss in the
objective function have led to the present work of minimization of both balancing and system
loss. As there is no standard measure for system loss, the current work proposes a measure
for system loss and offers solution to this bi-objective problem.

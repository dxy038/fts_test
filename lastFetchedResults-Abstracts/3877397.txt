The authors describe a solid-state, silicon integrated, bidirectional flow sensor for respiratory applications. The sensor is a thermal vector sensor. The electronic circuitry for obtaining bidirectional sensitivity is presented together with actual application to a healthy volunteer put on mechanical ventilation. The sensorÂ´s input flow range is from -60 to +60 L/min, and its rise-time is &#8804;40 ms and fall-time is &#8804;60 ms. The effect of changes in gas composition as used in mechanically ventilated patients on the sensor output signal are estimated to be less than 2%. The temperature sensitivity is about -1.5% per degree Celsius.

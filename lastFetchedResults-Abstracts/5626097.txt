The objective of this paper is to parse object trajectories in surveillance video against occlusion, interruption, and background clutter. We present a spatio-temporal graph (ST-Graph) representation and a cluster sampling algorithm via deferred inference. An object trajectory in the ST-Graph is represented by a bundle of &#8220;motion primitives&#8221;, each of which consists of a small number of matched features (interesting patches) generated by adaptive feature pursuit and a tracking process. Each motion primitive is a graph vertex and has six bonds connecting to neighboring vertices. Based on the ST-Graph, we jointly solve three tasks: 1) spatial segmentation; 2) temporal correspondence and 3) object recognition, by flipping the labels of the motion primitives. We also adapt the scene geometric and statistical information as strong prior. Then the inference computation is formulated in a Markov chain and solved by an efficient cluster sampling. We apply the proposed approach to various challenging videos from a number of public datasets and show it outperform other state of the art methods.

This paper presents a novel concept to solve optimal power flow (OPF) problem in the presence of series flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) controller which is thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC). In the proposed algorithm, a two stage initialization process have been adopted and also it gives optimal solution with less number of generations which results in the reduction of the computation time. Numerical results are carried out on IEEE 30-bus system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for different objective functions with TCSC. The OPF results of proposed algorithm is compared with existing algorithm. The results reveal better solution and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

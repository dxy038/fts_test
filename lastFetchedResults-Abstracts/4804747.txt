In power system, remote measurement data are sent to control center to estimate system state. These data can also be used to estimate parameters of transmission line when errors occur to them. In the case that the measurements contain noises, the estimated parameters may deviate the true value seriously. This paper proposes a hybrid method to estimate the parameters of transmission line. The method consists of Genetic Algorithm and Tabu Search, and integrates the advantages both of them. A correction term, based on design parameters, is brought into the objective function to improve the estimating capability. This method has strong search ability and independence on the initial value, and suits for parallel computing. The simulation results of IEEE 14 bus system illustrate this method effective.

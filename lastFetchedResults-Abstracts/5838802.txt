A constrained H<sub>2</sub> control scheme for active suspensions with time-domain constraints is suggested. The H<sub>2</sub> performance is used to measure ride comfort with white noise and impulse road disturbances. Time-domain hard constraints are captured directly using the concept of invariant ellipsoid. Hence, conflicting control objectives are specified separately in the framework of multi-objective control and solved using LMI optimization. Analysis and simulation results for a 2 DOF quarter-car model show possible improvements on ride comfort, while respecting time-domain hard constraints.

Electroencephalographic characteristics are useful in assessment of the functional status of specific neuronal connections relative to postmenstrual age. Interhemispheric burst synchrony (IBS) is a measure of the functional connectivity between the hemispheres in the maturing preterm brain. An algorithm was developed to assess IBS and was used in a prospective, longitudinal EEG study on 18 very preterm infants (&lt; 32 weeks gestational age) with normal follow-up at 2 years of age. The preterm infants underwent weekly 4-hour multi-channel EEG recordings, resulting in n = 77 EEGs. After automated detection of bursts, the algorithm defines the start and end of interhemispheric synchronous burst activity, based on selection criteria found in literature. The algorithm was designed to emulate visual inspection, providing objective results in an automated manner. This approach may be applied in clinical use and open novel avenues to automated analysis in EEG monitoring and, moreover, it may facilitate assessment of the functional status of interhemispheric connections. As such, assessment of low interhemispheric synchrony may be associated with brain injury.

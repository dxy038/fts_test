The objective of the digital maintenance information (DMI) system is to improve the capabilities of maintenance organization by providing generic techniques with an integrated electronic deliverable information system for use with ATE (automatic test equipment). The system integrates multiple maintenance information sources into a single easy-to-use information system. Integrated diagnostics relative to ATE has focused on the improved operator interfaces, embedded training, maintenance aiding, information handling and presentation, and documentation. The author presents a system which integrates these functions into a DMI system. The primary application is the presentation of video, graphic, schematic, and instructional text and data in the form of interactive scripts which are displayed to the ATE operator in a PC environment. These scripts visually demonstrate operator support functions during testing including unit-under-test hookup, alignment and adjustment procedures, probing steps, and repair actions. Embedded training in the use of the system, online help, DMI diagnostics, heuristic data collection and retrieval, and electronic network analysis aides are provided using an integrated expert system

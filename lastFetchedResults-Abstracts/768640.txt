Biodiversity conservation is confronted with two major problems: how to define and measure biodiversity, and how to optimize the in situ conservation of biodiversity. Here we outline a conceptual framework for biodiversity conservation that is directed towards these problems. The framework combines a phylogenetic evaluation with a multi-species risk analysis and defines the objective of conservation biology as the minimization of the future loss of biodiversity.

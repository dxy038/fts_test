This paper presents a fast method for use in power system online voltage security assessment. The objective here is to quickly assess the effects of large numbers of contingencies (line outages) to determine the worst case. The methodology is intuitively focused on the relationship between a node voltage and the availability of reactive power in the local neighborhood, and it also takes advantage of other information from the power flow solution. The concept of electrical distance is introduced for choosing the corresponding voltage control area locally around the contingency event. For the calculation of post-contingency electrical distance and power flow, the computation efficiency can be achieved by utilizing many mature algorithms from static security analysis (SSA)

A Kinect-based learning system for educating learners on Chinese cultural festivals is developed in this study. The primary design principle involves integrating augmented reality with situated learning to allow users to learn through immersion into a story setting, increasing their interests in learning and improving their learning outcomes. The system features the following characteristics: (a) Key elements of situated learning theory are used to design learning activities and content (b) Augmented reality functions are used to integrate virtual characters into real-life settings. This allows for actual spatial and physical experiences, assisting users to fully immerse in the story and settings, thereby developing student motor and cognitive skills. The Lantern Festival is used as the learning objective of this study, and students from two classes of fourth-grade level at Shengli Elementary School in Tainan City are recruited as the study participant In the experiment, the students are divided into a control group receiving traditional teaching and an experimental group that employs the system developed in this study. Finally, in addition to evaluating questionnaires and multiple intelligences of students, this study aims to assess their pretest and posttest results for determining student learning outcomes.

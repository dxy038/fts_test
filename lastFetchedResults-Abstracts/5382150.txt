The increasing demand of an intermediate storage of electrical energy in battery systems, in particular due to the use of renewable energy, has resulted in the need of more intelligent power supply systems. Bidirectional DC/DC power converters with galvanic isolation and efficient and low harmonic distortion AC/DC conversion to connect the mains line to the load are usually required in multiple applications. In this paper a three-port power supply system which interconnects the single-phase line with both an active load and a battery is proposed. Considering the specifications of a particular application, different topologies for the power supply system have been analyzed. After a theoretical evaluation, the optimum of the studied configurations has been developed and tested in all modes of operation demanded by the application. To accomplish all the requirements of the different operation modes of the power supply system, digital control has been used to control the bidirectional converter and the global system.

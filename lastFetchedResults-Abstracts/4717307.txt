A deep space satellite formation can be specified in terms of the relative satellite positions and absolute satellite orientations. Redundancy in the relative position specification generates a family of control topologies with equivalent stability and reference tracking performance. We give a characterization of this equivalence and show that there exists a control topology which achieves a global tracking objective using only local controllers. This local relative topology can be implemented without requiring communication between the formation spacecraft.

A major goal of robotic is to develop machines that perform useful task independently with minimal supervision The objective of this project is to investigate the current issues in implementing the design of an automatic robotic lawn mower used to cut grass in house gardens with a specified area . It was achieved by doing research on current issues in designing robotic movement mechanism with electronic control circuitry and programming the controller.

This paper presents a dapper Matlab implementation of solving multi-objective topology optimization of diffusion problems using the finite volume method. Except for the common objective, some constraints like center of gravity and the manufacturing demands, which are rarely discussed before, are included in this paper. Although specific attention is given to the heat conduction and its applications in this paper, the approach presented can be easily extended to solving other associated diffusion problems. We discussed the basic mathematical model of topology optimization, finite volume analysis, sensitivity derivation, the mathematical programming and some crucial aspects of the Matlab implementation. Some interesting testing examples are provided comparing with those done by the classical FEM-based approach. The complete Matlab code is given in the Appendix and intended for educational purposes.

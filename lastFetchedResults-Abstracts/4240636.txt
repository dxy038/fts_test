The block-matching algorithm (BMA) is the most popular motion compensation technique in video coding. However, it may not provide acceptable quality at very low bit rate. Recently, the mesh-based motion compensation (MBMC) has received wide attention. It represents more general types of motion such as deformation, rotation and zooming, thus it provides better performance than BMA. This paper presents a simple but effective MBMC method that offers better objective and subjective quality than the conventional BMA and other mesh-based techniques.

Automatic sizing of analog integrated circuits (ICs) remains an open challenge. This work shows an hybrid approach for finding optimal sizes of analog ICÂ´s elements, by combining the g<sub>m</sub>/I<sub>D</sub> technique for determining the parameter ranges for a given biasing levels, and using those to limit the search space through performing multi-objective optimization with evolutionary algorithms. That way, the NSGA-II optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the width (W) and length (L) of MOSFETs of an operational transconductance amplifier, which (W/L) search spaces are found by applying equations and biasing conditions to the g<sub>m</sub>/I<sub>D</sub> technique. From simulation results, we conclude on the appropriateness of g<sub>m</sub>/I<sub>D</sub> to accelerate the computational time of evolutionary algorithms for optimizing analog ICs.

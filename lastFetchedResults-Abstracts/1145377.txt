Auralizations are commonly used today by architectural acousticians as a tool to model acoustically sensitive spaces. This paper presents investigations employing an auralization methodology known as multi-channel auralizations, to determine the benefits of using an increasing number of channels in such auralizations. First an objective evaluation was conducted to examine how acoustic parameters, such as reverberation time, vary when using “quadrant” (one fourth of a spherical source) or “thirteenth” sources to create the binaural room impulse responses. Large differences in the values were found between the different sections of the sphere, on the order of several just noticeable differences. Two subjective studies were then pursued, first to determine if auralizations made with an increasing number of channels sound more realistic and have an increased perceived source size, using solo musical instruments of varying directivity indices as the sources. Overall, subjects perceived the auralizations made with an increasing number of channels as more realistic, whereas results for perceived source size are less clear. The second subjective study assessed the ease with which subjects could identify the source orientation from the auralizations as a function of number of channels. Results indicate that more channels made it easier for subjects to differentiate between source orientations.

Field measurements of dielectric properties of hypersaline deposits were realized over an arid site located in Death Valley, CA. The dielectric constant of salt and water mixtures is usually high but can show large variations, depending on the considered salt. We confirmed values observed on the field with laboratory measurements and used these results to model both the amplitude and phase behaviors of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal at C- and L-bands. Our analytical simulations allow reproducing specific copolar signatures observed in both Airborne SAR (AIRSAR) and Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR-C) data, corresponding to the saltpan of the Cottonball Basin. More precisely, the main objective of the present paper is to understand the influence of soil salinity as a function of soil moisture on the dielectric constant of soils and then on the backscattering coefficients recorded by airborne and spaceborne SAR systems. We also propose the copolarized backscattering ratio and phase difference as indicators of moistened and salt-affected soils. More precisely, we show that these copolar indicators should allow monitoring of the seasonal variations of the dielectric properties of saline deposits at both C- and L-bands. Because of the frequency dependence of the ionic conductivity, we also show that L-band SAR systems should be efficient tools for detecting both soil moisture and salinity, while C-band SAR systems are more suitable for the monitoring of soil moisture only. Through the study of terrestrial evaporitic environments by means of spaceborne SAR systems, our results could also be of great interest for defining future planetary missions, particularly for the exploration of Mars.

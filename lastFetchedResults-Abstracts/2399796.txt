Objective
estigate the effect of laser surface treatment of cast titanium alloy on microstructure and mechanical properties.
s
ll- and plate-shaped cast titanium specimens were prepared for mechanical testing and microstructure analysis. After the cast surfaces of each specimen were laser-treated using a dental Nd:YAG laser machine at 240 V and 300 V with and without argon gas shielding, tensile testing and microstructure analysis were conducted. Hardness depth profiles were also made from the cross-section of laser-treated cast specimens. Microstructural and chemical analysis were performed by means of the SEM, XRD, AES and WDS.
s
sults of tensile testing and Vickers hardness depth profiling showed that laser treatment improved the mechanical properties. Bulk microstructure of as-cast titanium was mainly composed of Î±-grains with acicular and widmanstatten patterns. The laser melted zone was characterized by columnar beta grains. When the emission voltage of laser increased to 300 V, a larger grain size was promoted. The XRD analysis indicated that the beta phase formation was clearly noticeable after laser surface treatment. Supplementary marked peaks of the TiO, TiO2 and Ti2N were detected without argon gas shielding. When argon shielding gas was used, the presence of titanium oxide was significantly reduced and the peaks of titanium nitride disappeared.
icance
treatment on cast titanium surfaces showed significant enhancement of mechanical properties and modification of microstructures, and therefore could produce reliable titanium metal frameworks for dental prostheses.

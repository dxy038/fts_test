This paper investigates the problem of optimal wavelength allocation and fairness control in all-optical wavelength-division-multiplexing networks. A fundamental network topology, consisting of a two-hop path network, is studied for three classes of traffic. Each class corresponds to a source-destination pair. For each class, call interarrival and holding times are exponentially distributed. The objective is to determine a wavelength allocation policy in order to maximize the weighted sum of users of all classes (i.e., class-based utilization). This method is able to provide differentiated services and fairness management in the network. The problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) to compute the optimal allocation policy. The policy iteration algorithm is employed to numerically compute the optimal allocation policy. It has been analytically and numerically shown that the optimal policy has the form of a monotonic nondecreasing switching curve for each class. Since the implementation of an MDP-based allocation scheme is practically infeasible for realistic networks, we develop approximations and derive a heuristic algorithm for ring networks. Simulation results compare the performance of the optimal policy and the heuristic algorithm, with those of complete sharing and complete partitioning policies.

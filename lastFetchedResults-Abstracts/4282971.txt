Process control is an important aspect area to be studied as many industries are dealing with it. A water level control system (AUWLC) is implemented by the Mechatronics Engineering, Assumption University, Thailand. This paper will be beneficial to the reader to understand the actual system with links between feedback control system loop diagram and an actual system model. The main objective of this project is to control the water level in the tank and adjust the set point by using a mobile application. The PID control is applied to this project. The data is obtained from the sensor and is sent to the amplifier, where the amplifier will then amplify the voltage for further manipulations. The PLC is able to control the motor, which fills up the tank according to the set point adjusted from mobile application.

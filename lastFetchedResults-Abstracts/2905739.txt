This paper proposes an optimal model for expansion, integration and allocation of renewable distributed generation in insular distribution systems. Furthermore, storage systems are included. The model aims to minimize renewable distributed generation (photovoltaic and wind) investment, operating costs and energy losses. The constraints include voltage limits, feedersÂ´ capacities, renewable DG units per node and storage systems. In addition, load demand, solar irradiation, and wind speed are considered as stochastic inputs. The problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model. The objective function and the constraints are linearized to obtain the optimal solution. A real case study shows the applicability of the model in an insular distribution system.

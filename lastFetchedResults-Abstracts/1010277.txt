Shell-and-tube heat exchangers (STHEs) are the most common type of heat exchangers that find widespread use in numerous industrial applications. Cost minimization of these heat exchangers is a key objective for both designer and users. Heat exchanger design involves complex processes, including selection of geometrical parameters and operating parameters. The traditional design approach for shell-and-tube heat exchangers involves rating a large number of different exchanger geometries to identify those that satisfy a given heat duty and a set of geometric and operational constraints. However, this approach is time-consuming and does not assure an optimal solution. Hence the present study explores the use of a non-traditional optimization technique; called particle swarm optimization (PSO), for design optimization of shell-and-tube heat exchangers from economic view point. Minimization of total annual cost is considered as an objective function. Three design variables such as shell internal diameter, outer tube diameter and baffle spacing are considered for optimization. Two tube layouts viz. triangle and square are also considered for optimization. Four different case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The results of optimization using PSO technique are compared with those obtained by using genetic algorithm (GA).

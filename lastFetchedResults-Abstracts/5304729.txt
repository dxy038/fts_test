We start from a Web-oriented system for evaluating, presenting, processing, enlarging and annotating corpora of translations, previously applied to a real MT evaluation task, involving classical subjective measures, objective n-gram-based scores, and objective post-edition-based task-related evaluation. We describe its recent extension to support the high-quality translation into French of the large on-line Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS) presented as documents each made of a Web page and a companion UNL file, by applying contributive on-line human post-edition to results of machine translation systems and of UNL deconverters. Target language Web pages are generated on the fly from source language ones, using the best target segments available in the database. 25 documents (about 220,000 words) of the EOLSS are now available in French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic and Japanese. MT followed by contributive incremental cheap or free post-edition is now proved to be a viable way of making difficult information available in many languages.

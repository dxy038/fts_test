The primary objective of this paper is to classify the operator functional states (OFS) in the control of human-machine system. In a lab environment, 11 subjects were employed to simulate a set of process control tasks in an automated cabin air management system (aCAMS), recording psychophysiological signal and performance appearance. The fuzzy C means classification algorithm is used to classify operator functional state, which is divided into three categories, corresponding to the status of &#8220;good&#8221;, &#8220;Medium&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221;, and finally gives the exact classification of results, and given their respective categories the degree of membership. By selecting the appropriate input, fuzzy C means classification accuracy can be achieved within an acceptable scope. The final classification based on the results is used to adjust control strategies, achieving intelligent human-machine interaction.

This paper presents a new method for composite power system reliability analysis. This method is based on an adaptation of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The adaptation consists of applying swarm intelligence not to search for an optimum, but to search the state space preferentially for failure states so that system reliability indices can be determined. Another aspect of the adaptation consists of using multiple objectives to exercise better control over the particle dynamics. This new formulation, called multi-objective particle swarm (MOPS), is shown to be very effective in its intelligent search for system loss of load states. This paper develops the MOPS formulation, describes its implementation and demonstrates it on the modified IEEE reliability test system

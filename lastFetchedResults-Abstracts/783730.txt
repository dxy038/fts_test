Objective This prospective longitudinal
study of a representative community sample of children
and adolescents (N = 269) examined the long-term
course and predictive power of psychiatric symptoms
in childhood/adolescence for diagnostic outcome
(ICD-10) 18 years later at adult age. Method At both
cross-sectional assessments, baseline (1980–1984) and
the 18-year follow-up (2001–2004), psychiatric symptoms
were assessed using the ‘Standardized Psychiatric
Interview’ (Goldberg et al. in Br J Prev Soc Med 24:18–
23, 1970). At follow-up, study participants were reassessed
with the standardized M-CIDI (Wittchen and
Pfister in Manual und Durchfu¨hrungsbeschreibung des
DIA-X-M-CIDI, Swets and Zeitlinger, Frankfurt, 1997)
interview. Results The participation rate at 18-year
follow-up was 82% of those alive. The frequency of
clinically relevant depressive symptoms and symptoms
of anxiety or phobia was considerably higher when the
participants were younger (baseline assessment at
childhood, adolescent age) as compared to their scores
in adult age. Increased levels of somatic symptoms,
fatigue, irritability, sleep disturbances, depression,
anxiety and worry as well as phobic symptoms in
childhood/adolescence were related to a higher risk of
suffering from a psychiatric disorder in adulthood.
Depressive symptoms predicted both mood disorders
and substance use disorders in adulthood. Phobias
predicted later anxiety disorders. Conclusion These
data spanning almost two decades add significant
information to the existing literature on the course of
mental disorders in the community during the transition
from adolescence to adulthood

Objective (s): There is evidence that a significant proportion of People Living with HIV ( PLWH) still practice unsafe sex and this remains a challenge for HIV prevention. To effectively promote their consistent use, it was necessary to understand their sexual practices and experience of barriers to condom use. This qualitative study explored perceptions of PLWH regarding condom use barriers in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were held with a purposively selected group of 26 PLHIV (22 male and 4 female) recruited from three HIV care clinics in Tehran. Data were analyzed using the content analysis approach.
Results: Nearly all participants reported that their major barriers experienced were that condoms reduced their sexual satisfaction and caused hindered their sexual interest. Less than half of people noted to: embarrassed to buy condoms and unavailability of condoms during sexual contact. Nine percent of male patients practiced unprotected sex in the last sex.
Conclusion: Risk-taking sexual behavior has been shown to decrease among HIV-infected individuals when intervention strategies are implemented in HV health care settings. Prevention efforts targeting HIV-positive to assist them in adopting and maintaining safer sexual behaviors need to be intensified.

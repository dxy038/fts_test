This study focuses on the comprehensive procedure for cell formation process. The paper complies with fuzzy clustering, multiple objective decision making and multiple-attribute decision making approaches. Based on these, we develop suitable models in these areas. First, a wide range of objectives in cell formation problem are introduced and analyzed considering lean production goals and aspects. Then they are categorized in to three main targets in cellular manufacturing applying fuzzy clustering method. These objectives contain targets of a fuzzy multiple objective decision making model (FMODM). Appending related constrains to the model, we achieve several solution via the FMODM system. These solution can be analyzed and be ranked through the other decision making system entitled fuzzy multiple attribute decision making (FMADM). A case study also argues related real-world problems.

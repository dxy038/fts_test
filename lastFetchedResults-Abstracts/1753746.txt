The objective was to evaluate the use of two indirect IgG-ELISA tests (with recombinant proteins MPB70 or MPB83, respectively, as capture antigens) as confirmatory tests for diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in a herd of naturally infected dairy cows. Results for ELISA-MPB70 and ELISA-MPB83 were similar (kappa statistic = 0.92) on Days 0 (day of intradermal injection with purified protein derivatives, PPD), 7, and 21. The kappa statistic between ELISA and the Comparative Intradermal Tuberculin Test, as well as ELISA sensitivity and specificity (relative to culture or PCR as standards) were: 0.7, 34.4% and 75% on Day 0; 0.25, 53.8% and 66.6% on Day 7; and 0.01, 1.8% and 77.7% on Day 21, respectively. In conclusion, although ELISAs using MPB70 or MPB83 as antigens were not reliable indicators of infection status, especially on Days 7 and 21, they were of potential value as complementary tools to intradermal PPD testing.

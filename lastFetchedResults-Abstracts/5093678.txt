Dental resin composites are widely used for restoration of teeth. A major disadvantage associated with dental composites is polymerization shrinkage. This shrinkage induces residual stresses at the bonded margins of the restoration and if large, may endanger the coherence of the tooth. Thus, strategies that would alleviate the shrinkage stresses are of great importance. The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of several approaches, including use of a compliant bonding agent and modifications to preparation design, on the magnitude of residual stresses. Four composite restorations are considered for analysis; a bonding agent was simulated and both its thickness and modulus were varied at two levels

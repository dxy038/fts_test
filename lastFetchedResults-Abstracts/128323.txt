Background and Objective: Unwanted hair has been one of the problems that many researches have done about it. There are several ways for removal of unwanted hairs including laser. Laser hair removal is a new method in this field and the main objective of this study was to assess its effectiveness in Iranian patients.
Materials and Methods: This study was done on 58 patients attending Isfahan's Shahid Beheshti Laser Center for laser hair removal. In the first session, diode laser (42-61 J/cm' , 810 nm wave length, 200 msec pulse duration, 5 mm spot size) was used and if there was not any severe skin reaction, it was repeated up to four times at 1-1.5 month intervals. The main outcome measure was the number of hairs per cm' counted from digital photographs taken before the treatment and one month after the last treatment. All patients were followed up to 4 months after their last laser session.
Results: Fifty-eight patients with mean age of 30 years, Fitzpatrick skin types of IT, III and IV and predominant black unwanted hairs were treated with a 810 nm diode laser. The mean hair reduction was 64% and the most reduction was seen in patients with skin type IV (70.4%). The most common side effect was transient post laser erythema (34.5%). There was a weak and negative but significant relation between the clearance rate and energy fluence (r=-0.29, P<0.05)_ However, the relation between the age of the patients and clearance rate was positive (r=0.42, P<0.05).
Conclusion: 810 nm diode laser is an effective and safe hair removal method in Iranian patients. The effect of energy fluence and age of the patients on the final hair reduction in the patients merits further attention in future studies.

Citrullus colocynthis (CCT) is used in traditional medicine to inhibit the implantation of embryos. The objective of this study was to determine the number of embryos per pregnancy and the mortality rate in pregnant mice. 115 vaginal plug-positive mice were divided into 4 groups. The animals were given 30, 60 and 120 mg/kg hydroalcoholic extract of CCT until 17th day of gestation. Control group was fed with solvent. At the day 17, the animals were sacrificed and the number of pregnant mice and embryos per pregnancy were counted. We found that while in 30 mg/kg group the mean number of embryos per pregnancy was around 10, no embryo was found in other groups. Furthermore, 3 out of 30 mice in 30 mg/kg group died, while in 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg groups the number of death was 7 and 14, respectively. In conclusion, CCT reduces the number of embryos and increases the mortality rate in pregnant mice in a dose-dependent manner.

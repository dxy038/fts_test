Background: Air quality and concentration of airborne particles in internal wards of hospital are considered as factors affecting the health of patients and medical staff.
Objective: To determine the air quality and airborne particles concentrations in internal wards of Qazvin Bu-Ali Sina hospital.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Qazvin Bu-Ali Sina hospital from September to December 2015. Sampling gathered twice a week with hand held real time instrument (micro-dust pro. model HP3275-05, Casella Co), using by airborne particles samplers probe with a diameter of less than 2.5 and less than 10 microns in the air flow 3.5 liters per minute for 10 minutes. Air Quality Index was measured with "Air Quality Index calculator" software and analysis of results was done using statistical paired-T and Pearson tests.
Findings: The highest average concentration of 24-hour airborne particles with a diameter of 2.5 and 10 micrometer was 46.38 and 13.49 micrograms per cubic meter respectively in men hearts ward and the lowest was in the laboratory and eyes wards. There was a positive significant correlation between the concentration of suspended particles with size less than 2.5 micrometers in indoor and outdoor environment (r=0.93).
Conclusion: The findings indicate poor ventilation and impact of outdoor air quality and internal emission sources on internal wards air quality. Facilitating the spread and transmission of infectious agents grounds for infection transmission outside the hospital, in addition to endangering the health of staff and prolonging period of patientsâ€™ hospitalization.

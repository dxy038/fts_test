Cooling, Heating, and Power (CHP) systems have the potential to make better use of fuels than other technologies because of their ability to increase the overall thermal energy efficiency. Feasibility of CHP systems is generally driven by economic savings. In addition, economic evaluation of CHP systems is based on site energy use and cost, which could lead to misleading conclusions about energy savings. Since energy savings from CHP systems only occurs in primary energy, the objective of this investigation is to demonstrate that feasibility of CHP systems should be performed based on primary energy savings followed by economic considerations. This paper also evaluates the effect of the power generation unit (PGU) efficiency over the primary energy reduction when a CHP system is utilized. The advantages of operating CHP systems under a primary energy operational strategy, such as the proposed Building Primary Energy Ratio (BPER) strategy, are also discussed. Results show that for some cases economic savings are attained without the corresponding primary energy savings. However, the use of the BPER operational strategy guarantees better energy performance regardless of economic savings. Regarding to the PGU efficiency, an increase of the efficiency reduces the primary energy use more than proportionally. For example, increasing the PGU efficiency from 0.25 to 0.35 (increase of 40%) can reduce the primary energy use from 5.4% to 16% (increase of 200%).

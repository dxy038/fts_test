Class imbalance limits the performance of most learning algorithms since they cannot cope with large differences between the number of samples in each class, resulting in a low predictive accuracy over the minority class. In this respect, several papers proposed algorithms aiming at achieving more balanced performance. However, balancing the recognition accuracies for each class very often harms the global accuracy. Indeed, in these cases the accuracy over the minority class increases while the accuracy over the majority one decreases. This paper proposes an approach to overcome this limitation: for each classification act, it chooses between the output of a classifier trained on the original skewed distribution and the output of a classifier trained according to a learning method addressing the course of imbalanced data. This choice is driven by a parameter whose value maximizes, on a validation set, two objective functions, i.e. the global accuracy and the accuracies for each class. A series of experiments on ten public datasets with different proportions between the majority and minority classes show that the proposed approach provides more balanced recognition accuracies than classifiers trained according to traditional learning methods for imbalanced data as well as larger global accuracy than classifiers trained on the original skewed distribution.

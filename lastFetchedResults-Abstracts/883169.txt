Objective: Schizophrenia is a harmful disorder with an unknown etiology that causes dysfunction and interferes
with work, school and the patient's communications. The prevalence and incidence rate of schizophrenia varies in
different countries. The aim of the current study is to investigate the epidemiology of schizophrenia in Bandarabbass
in 2009.
Methods: This descriptive and retrospective study was conducted in 2009 in Ebnesina Mental Hospital and patients
who were diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV criteria were enrolled (198 patients). Then, by
using a checklist prepared by a psychiatry specialist, the data was extracted from the medical records. The gathered
data was analyzed by SPSS 19 using the descriptive statistics test.
Results: The mean age of the 198 participants was 36.5±11.591, and 69.2 percent of them were male and 30.8
percent were female. Also 60.6 percent of the patients were married and 76.8 percent were unemployed. Four
percent had diabetes and 3 percent were hypertensive and 84.3 percent didn't have substance use comorbidity.
Hallucinations were seen in 45.4 percent of the patients and 60.1 percent experienced delusions.
Conclusion: As discussed above, many of the symptoms were different in Bandarabbass and this confirms that race
plays a significant role in schizophrenia and its symptoms. Therefore more research must be performed about
schizophrenia in different regions. Since the presentation of this disorder varies, unique treatments according to
patient’s race might be needed.

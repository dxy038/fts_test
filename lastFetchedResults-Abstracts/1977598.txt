In the Islamic criminal code essentials’ section (2013); we are observing the
fundamental changes and innovations relating to the formercode. The
objective of the legislator in increasing the essentials’ section is that it defends
the society against the criminal phenomenon in different discussions of
criminal laws and rights, especially, the regulations dominant on punishments
by adopting reformist approaches by respecting the interests of the criminal.
The institution of deferment of the sentence is a modern formation that has
been extracted and adopted from French law and has no background in law
texts of our country. The mentioned institution that is used only in connection
with the non-dangerous criminals (especially children), has been regulated
and adjusted to prevent the criminal labelingof such criminal group, and
assisting to reform them.

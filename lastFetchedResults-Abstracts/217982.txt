Objective- Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a reportedly uncommon genetic disorder of endocardial
morphogenesis and is being increasingly recognized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
echocardiographic features, including mechanical dyssynchrony indices of patients with LVNC versus idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).
Methods- Between December 2004 and February 2006, we evaluated 116 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy
candidated for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) at our institution. The patients were divided into LVNC
and IDC without LVNC groups, according to the diagnostic criteria for LVNC. Transthoracic echocardiography
was done for all the patients, and pre-ejection periods as well as inter- and intra-ventricular delays were measured
and the asynchrony index was calculated.
Results- Seventy-seven patients were male. LVNC was diagnosed in 23% of the patients. There was no significant
difference in the patientsÙ¾f age and mean age of the patients (46 plus-minus 16.5   years in LVNC vs. 51.13 plus-minus 16.43 years in
IDC). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction in the LVNC group was 16.65% plus-minus 6.6% and in the IDC group it was
18.91% plus-minus 7.3; mean age in the LVNC group was 46 plus-minus16.5 years and 51.13 plus-minus 16.43 years in the IDC group, with
no significant difference between the two groups.
Conclusion- LVNC is increasingly being reported and has become an important differential diagnosis in heart failure
patients. Our study showed that there was no significant difference in the mechanical dyssynchrony indices
between the two groups (Iranian Heart Journal 2009; 10 (2):15-19).

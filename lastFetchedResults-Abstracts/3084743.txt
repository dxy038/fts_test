The I-ImaS (intelligent imaging sensors) is an European Union project whose objective is to design and develop intelligent imaging sensors and evaluate their use within an adaptive imaging system. The system employs an in-line scanning technology approach and use of CMOS active pixel sensors developed specifically for high spatial resolution, efficient light collection and large dynamic range. This paper discusses the principle of the data acquisition (DAQ) system and the characterisation of the I-ImaS sensors, both optically and using mono-energetic X-rays.

This Study determines the protein carbonyl cause cellular damage and glutathione, Vitamin A, E, C act as antioxidant. Study carried out in different categories of pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis  of newly sputum culture positive diagnosed pulmonary categorie I (n=100), extra pulmonary patients categorie (n=35) before  and after DOTS treatment of 6 months, categorie II (n=100), categorie III (n=100) and in normal control subjects (n=100). Protein carbonyl levels were significantly increased in pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis patients. The activity of Vitamin A, E, C activity were found to be significantly decreased in subjects of all categories of pulmonary and extra tuberculosis pulmonary. Negative correlation between carbonyl protein content, with Vitamin A,E,C, and Vitamin A,E,C was seen in pulmonary tuberculosis, p < 0.001. Increased defence mechanism which was due increase oxidative stress by carbonyl content in tuberculosis. The changes were reversed after 6 month antitubercular treatment in patients with good recovery but increase oxidative stress was not completely reversed.

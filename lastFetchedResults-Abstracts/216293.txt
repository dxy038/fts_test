Background/Objective: Eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare cause of lung disease in adulthood. The relatively non-specific clinical presentations of this disease process make the diagnosis a unique challenge. Herein, we reported on clinical and radiological manifestations of this rare clinical entity in 18 patients. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 18 patients with acute eosinophilic pneumonia in Masih Daneshvari Medical Center. Diagnostic criteria were based on clinical, laboratory and imaging findings. Results: The most clinical manifestations were cough and weight loss 15 (0.83) followed by dyspnea 13 (0.72). The most frequent imaging findings were diffuse opacities (reticulonodular or alveolar infiltration) in 11 (0.65), consolidation in six (0.33) and ground-glass opacities in four (0.28) patients. Conclusion: Diffuse rather than peripheral air-space opacities in imaging of a patient presented with dyspnea, cough, sputum, constitutional symptoms and eosinophilia should make us to think about eosinophilic pneumonia as one of differential diagnoses.

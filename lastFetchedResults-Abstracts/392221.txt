Objective: Acute maxillary sinusitis is one of the most common diseases in human. Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) produced also physiologically in the body, are normally neutralised by antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD). Infection is one of the causes of increased ROMs production. The most important mechanism of tissue damage produced by ROMs is the peroxidation of lipids found in cell membranes and it may be estimated by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The purpose of this study, is to investigate tissue damage caused by ROMs in maxillary sinusitis in 24 rabbits. Methods: Experimental sinusitis was induced by blocking the right nose and inoculating Staphylococcus aureus into the right maxillary sinuses. Left maxillary sinuses were the control group. Animals were divided into three groups and killed at 3, 5 and 7 days. Mucosas of each maxillary sinus were examined histopathologically and MDA levels were determined. Blood samples were obtained preoperatively (control blood) and on killing days (experimental blood). Serum MDA levels and erythrocyte SOD activities were determined. Results: All the infected sinuses displayed signs of the inflammation. MDA levels and SOD activities in the experimental blood samples were significantly higher than those of the control group (P<0.05). Mucosal MDA levels in the experimental group were significantly higher than the controls (P<0.01). Conclusions: In maxillary sinusitis caused by S. aureus an increased ROMs production was observed and it may contribute to tissue damage of sinusitis.

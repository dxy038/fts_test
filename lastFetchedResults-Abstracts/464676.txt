OBJECTIVE: The prototype of surgical treatment for vulvar vestibulitis has been the Woodruff vulvoplasty. A simpler surgery could be less morbid, technically easier, and equally effective. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve patients underwent vestibular revision, nine with local anesthesia. They were followed up for between 6 months and 6 years. Outcome was judged by ease of healing and relief of tenderness. This was a feasibility study. RESULTS: Ten of 12 patients had complete resolution of vestibulitis. Two others had improvement. Other causes of dyspareunia remain in 2 subjects. Issues of patient histories, postoperative healing, and functional outcome are reported. CONCLUSION: A simple surgery seems well suited to this problem. Additional causes of dyspareunia need to be recognized preoperatively and clarified. Development of granulation tissue in areas of wound separation can create sites of continued pain. Postoperatively, reflex vaginismus should be expected and needs therapy to complement the surgical treatment. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;174:1701-7.)

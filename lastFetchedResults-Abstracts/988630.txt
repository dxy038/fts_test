Introduction: Consultation and guidance is a process of learning which is done
through the relationship between two individuals. In this mutual relationship,
the counselor, through his scientific and occupational skills and qualification,
tries to help the students using the methods corresponding to their needs. The
main objective of this study was to provide a framework for the management
of the advisors’ plans in the university based on the analysis of different schools.
Methods: This research is a cross-sectional and descriptive-analytic study.
Data were collected both qualitatively (centralized groups at the presence of
advisors in universities) and quantitatively (self-assessment of teachers and
students’ evaluation). Sampling was done randomly from all students of Shiraz
University of Medical Sciences. All the teachers who were advisor took part in
this study.
Results: This study was conducted in eight schools of Shiraz University of
Medical Sciences simultaneously and 974 students and 125 teachers took part
in it. At the time of data collection, 25.5 percent of the students declared that
the advisors have provided allocated time to them and 45.4 percent believed
that the advisors helped the students to understand the importance of the
courses.
Conclusion: The emergence of weaknesses and strengths of the academic
advising program and the guidance through teacher’s self assessment, not
only may be the sign of realization of programmed objectives, but also may be
the starting point for qualitative improvement of the situation. Moreover, in
order to improve the advisory services and guidance, it is necessary to regard
consultation as a scientific subject which needs training.

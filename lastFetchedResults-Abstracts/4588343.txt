In this paper we discuss the bacterial network communication design with respect to metabolic information processing. The potentialities of designing routing network schemes based on bacteria motility will depend on the genes coding for the intracellular and intercellular communication molecular devices. An additional element is given by the &#8220;mobilome&#8221; which is related to horizontal gene transfer. First, by using a multi-objective optimization procedure, we search for the optimal trade off between energy production, which is a requirement for the motility, and the biomass growth, which is related to the overall survival and fitness of the bacterium. We use flux balance analysis of genome-scale biochemical network of Escherichia coli k-13 MG1655. Then, as a second case study we analyze the electric properties and biomass trade-off of the bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens. This bacterium is usually grown on a graphite electrode. It constructs an electric biofilm where electrons move across the nanowires. Geobacter species produce higher current densities than any other known organism. Our methodology could estimate the evolutionary potential and help in designing optimal multi scale properties from networks to behavior. Moreover, we point to genetic design and synthetic biology as key areas to develop bacterial nano communication networks.

Since AlzheimerÂ´s Disease (AD) has a huge socio-economic impact, attempts to reduce this impact are being searched. However, studies on AD have shown that the fight against this disease requires a great effort of several actors who should contribute to the success of the patient care process. As computer scientists, we aim to contribute to this fight by assisting the decision-makers in the AD domain to choose the optimal decision in each given situation. Our objective is to capitalize knowledge so that we can provide more powerful and more efficient systems. We then propose an approach to build AD Clinical Decision Support Expert Systems (CDSES) based on the fuzzy specialization of the knowledge of this disease.

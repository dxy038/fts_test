Ge is a candidate for replacing Si, especially for pMOSFETs, because of its high hole mobility. For Si-pMOSFETs, negative-bias temperature instabilities (NBTI) limit their lifetime. There is little information available for the NBTI of Ge-pMOSFETs with Ge/GeO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> stack. The objective of this paper is to provide this information and compare the NBTI of Ge- and Si-pMOSFETs. New findings include: 1) the time exponent varies with stress biases/field when measured by either the conventional slow dc or pulse I-V technique, making the conventional V<sub>g</sub>-accelerated method for predicting the lifetime of Si-pMOSFETs inapplicable to Ge-pMOSFETs used in this paper; 2) the NBTI is dominated by positive charges (PCs) in dielectric, rather than generated interface states; 3) the PC in Ge/GeO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can be fully annealed at 150 &#176;C; and 4) the defect losses reported for Si sample were not observed. For the first time, we report that the PCs in oxides on Ge and Si behave differently, and to explain the difference, an energy-switching model is proposed for hole traps in Ge-MOSFETs: their energy levels have a spread below the edge of valence band, i.e., E<sub>v</sub>, when neutral, lift well above E<sub>v</sub> after charging, and return below E<sub>v</sub> following neutralization.

This study introduces a method of using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimum design for an antenna array consisted of two L-shaped folded monopole antennas (LFMA), which operate in the 2.4 GHz (2400~2484 MHz) IEEE 802.11 b/g band of WLAN. By proposing an efficient multi-objective function to PSO, LFMA array is optimized to an effective optimal shape which has the mutual coupling between two antennas reduced largely and the entire physical volume miniaturized to 55 % of the fundamental model.

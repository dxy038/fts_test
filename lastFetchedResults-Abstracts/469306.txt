Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in endometrial cancer patients with hysteroscopic injection of tracers.
Study design
Eighteen patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma were submitted to hysteroscopic injection of technetium-99mâ€“labeled colloids and blue-dye subendometrially around the lesion followed by lymphoscintigraphic scans. The SLN was detected by direct visualization of blue-dye marked nodes and by a radio-guided surgery (RGS).
Results
Seventeen hysteroscopic procedures were satisfactory regarding the visualization of the uterine cavity. The compliance to the procedure was acceptable in 15 cases, with no severe complication. A hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed in all cases, and pelvic lymphadenectomy in 14 cases. The RGS detected a total of 45 SLN with a mean of 3 SLN/patient (range 2 to 4). Blue-dye uptake was observed in 6 (33%) cases. No case presented blue-dye uptake and radioactive-colloid negativity.
Conclusion
The results seem promising for further controlled studies.

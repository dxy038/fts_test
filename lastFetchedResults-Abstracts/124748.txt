Objective: To evaluate the effect of P l /P2 ratio on fertilization and embryo quality and developmental rate in intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients.
Material and Methods: During this study P1/P2 ratio of 71 patients referring for IVF and ICSI were evaluated by protein extraction, gel-electrophoresis and western blot. Results: Increase in P 1/P2 results in a reduction in fertilization rate and decrease in embryo quality in ICSI patients.
Conclusion: It can be concluded that altered P 1/P2 ratio affects fertilization rate and embryo quality, which subsequently effect implantation and pregnancy outcome.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Copper nanoparticles are being extensively used in medical sciences, food supplements and industrial fields. However, their potential toxic effects on human health and the environment remain undetermined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxic effects of copper oxide nanoparticles on kidney and heart tissues of mice. 
METHODS: In this experimental study, 42 adult female mice, weighing 30±3 g, were randomly divided into control, sham and four experimental groups. The mice in the experimental groups intraperitoneally received copper oxide nanoparticles with doses of 300, 400, 500 and 600 mg/kg. After autopsy, the hearts and kidneys of mice were separated and weighed. For histopathological examinations, heart and kidney tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 
FINDINGS: Kidney weight in control and sham groups, compared to experimental groups receiving nanoparticle doses of 300, 400, 500 and 600 mg/kg, reduced to 21±0.02, 19±0.02, 20±0.02 and 22±0.01 g, respectively, while no significant changes were observed in the heart weight. Histopathological examination of kidney and heart after the intraperitoneal injection of copper oxide nanoparticles showed signs of cytotoxicity including congestion, necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, compared to the control group.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed that copper oxide nanoparticles cause damage to the kidney and heart in a dose-dependent way.

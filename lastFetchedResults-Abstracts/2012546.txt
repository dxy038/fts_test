paper presents a low-cost compact planar microstrip-fed monopole antenna and its four-element array design for ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communication and target detection applications, respectively, operating in the frequency span of 3-11GHz. A prototype was fabricated and then measured based on optimal parameters. The results of reflection coefficient (S11) and radiation patterns are shown and discussed. There is a good consistency between the simulated S11 and the measured one. In addition, a 1×4 linear array design with a size of 100×34mm2 is proposed to achieve a higher gain. Simulation shows that the array gain is increased about 6 dB in comparison with the single element through the whole UWB frequency range. The proposed array has an average of -15 dB side lobe level (SLL) in the mentioned range. And also, a -23 dB SLL is achieved by applying Dolph-Chebyshev amplitude distribution at 6 GHz. Simulation results confirm that the antenna exhibits a constant bidirectional radiation pattern with a high and flat gain in case of the array design.

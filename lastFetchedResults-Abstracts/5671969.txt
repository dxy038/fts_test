In our elderly-dominated society, there is considerable expectation for a growing need for home, medical, and nursing care services to assist this aging society, both from the physical and psychological points of view. Among these services, special importance has the rehabilitation process and specifically the clinical assessments of motor abilities. The current rehabilitation process, however, lacks of objectiveness. Our research is aimed at the development of a portable bioinstrumentation system that can objectively measure and assess the physical and physiological effects of the rehabilitation therapy, both in the hospital/rehabilitation center and at home, by integrating the analysis of human motion into the analysis of physiological indexes. More specifically, objective of this research is to develop a wearable bioinstrumentation system capable of an objective analysis of the physical and psychological conditions of the user during the activities of daily life.

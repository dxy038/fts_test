A collection of slides from the authorÂ´s conference presentation is given. Two FRR (fast re-route) schemes are compared: Haskin achieves better resource allocation, while One-to-One Backup could lead to shorter overall switching times. Variable-length Us allow for a greater flexibility (i.e. improved optimization function), except for some cases of ring topology. A non-uniform distribution of spare capacity within the network has a cost to pay (i.e. lower objective function) The model optimizing the overall switching time is more likely to be used in networks with wide resource availability and/or stringent constraints on QoS. The designed tool addresses robustness to single node and link failure with: Recovery time as in SONET/SDH, efficient resource allocation (SP), low computational cost.

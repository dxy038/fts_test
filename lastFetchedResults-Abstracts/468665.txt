OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare maternal and neonatal complications in spontaneous versus in vitro fertilization twins.
STUDY DESIGN: Twin gestations that were delivered from 1995 to 2000 were reviewed. Cases consisted of 56 in vitro fertilization twins, each of which was matched to two control mothers by age and parity. They were compared regarding various maternal and neonatal complications.
RESULTS: In vitro fertilization twins were more likely to have preterm labor compared with control twins, with no difference in the incidences of pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, placenta previa, or preterm premature rupture of membranes between the two groups. The cesarean delivery rate was significantly higher in cases of twins who were conceived by in vitro fertilization (76.8% vs 58.0%, P = .026), despite a similar rate of elective cesarean delivery and the incidence of nonvertex twin A in both groups. The preterm delivery rate was significantly higher (67.9% vs 41.1%, P = .002) and the gestational age was significantly lower (35±3 weeks vs 36±3 weeks, P = .043) in cases compared with control subjects. Both twins were, on the average, 230 g lighter in the in vitro fertilization group compared with the control group. However, intrauterine growth restriction was more frequent in the control group (36.6% vs 25%, P = .044). There was a significantly higher incidence of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, respiratory distress syndrome, a need for mechanical ventilation, and pneumothorax in cases compared with control subjects.
CONCLUSION: When compared with spontaneous twins, in vitro fertilization twins are more likely to be delivered by cesarean delivery and to have a higher incidence of preterm birth and prematurity-related respiratory complications with a longer nursery stay.

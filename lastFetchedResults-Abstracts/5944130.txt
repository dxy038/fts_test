This paper presents the issues encountered in the development of a robot based on the biometric influence of a bear. One of the main aims of this research was to explore the possibilities of a robot, which could move between the different styles of motion. The bear offers a unique example of an animal with high mass and bulk, which can move between being a quadruped and a biped. Our earlier research had explored the development of a robotic dog. A quadruped robot design, suitable for use as a player in the RoboCup Four Legged League, which used the parameters of the existing Sony Aibo robot as a starting point. The outcomes of this research have been discussed in papers by Chalup and Lawrence. The current research has extended the previous platform development and reset the objective to a robot with both bipedal and quadrupedal motion possibilities. The original objectives of developing a high quality design with enhanced research programming possibilities, which also coveys a positive and engaging image of Science and Engineering through its form, were maintained. This is specially so, when considering the robotÂ´s ability to create interest in the general public, who will view the robot from a perspective outside of discipline specific interests. The introduction presents the biological inspiration for the current design, including the preparation and material production considerations. This is followed by a discussion of specific features of the robotic bear design, which has been given the name HyKim, followed by a conclusion.

The energy management system (EMS) is the core of an electric power control center (EPCC) to manage and control the power system in a secure and economical way. Because the power system nowadays is large and interconnected (in the space dimension), the operational state is continuously varying (in the time dimension), and the control objectives are numerous (in the dimension of objectives), an EMS has to meet the various requirements in all these three dimensions for power system operation. A new generation of EMS (N-EMS) is developed for this purpose. This short paper introduces briefly how this newly developed N-EMS is used to prevent contingencies from evolving into a blackout. Special attention has been paid to the coordination in spatial, temporal and objective dimensions of the N-EMS. This N-EMS has been put into real practice in Chinese control centers and some results from the field are presented to show how the N-EMS is helpful in blackout prevention.

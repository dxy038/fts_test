Acacia nilotica is a tree of international significance both as a beneficial plant and as a species prone to thicket formation and negative impacts on savannas throughout much of its range. While fire has been identified as a useful tool for controlling negative impacts of some Acacia species in Africa, A. nilotica adult trees are apparently fire tolerant. The effects of fire on seed bank mortality, viability and germination, and on juvenile plants of this species are unknown. We undertook a study to investigate the impacts of fire on seeds and first and second year seedlings in Australian Astrebla savannas. The primary objective was to determine the effects of control burns applied during the early stages of invasion and thicket formation. Because of high rates of seedling dessication post fire in 1997, supplementary watering was undertaken until fire mortality could be measured the following year. High seed mortality occurred for seeds located either in cattle dung (100%) or on the soil surface (c. 80%). Germination of those seeds that survived was enhanced following exposure to fire. Very high fire mortality (99%) was observed among first year seedlings and moderate mortality (60%) for second year seedlings even after a low intensity burn. Negative impacts on major pasture species were minimal. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to A. nilotica fire ecology and to the efficacy of fire as a tool for managing this species

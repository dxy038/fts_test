Users of mobile communication networks tend to make higher demands upon quality of mobile communication services. Therefore it is important for GSM network operators to know the factors that determine the quality perceived by users of GSM speech services.

Also a universal combined quality parameter, the quality of service index is proposed. This parameter eases quality comparison of different GSM network options and it enables objective quality evaluation in operational GSM networks

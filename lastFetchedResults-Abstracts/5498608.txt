This paper presents a one switch silicon carbide JFET normally-ON resonant inverter applied to induction heating for consumer home cookers. The promising characteristics of silicon carbide (SiC) devices need to be verified in practical applications; therefore, the objective of this work is to compare Si IGBTs and normally-ON commercially available JFET in similar operating conditions, with two similar boards. The paper describes the gate circuit implemented, the design of the basic converter in ideal operation, namely Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) and Zero Derivative Voltage Switching (ZVDS), as well as some preliminary comparative results for 700W and 2 kW output power delivered to an induction heating coil and load.

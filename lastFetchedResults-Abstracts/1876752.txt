Objective
st-induced renal dysfunction is an iatrogenic complication that occurs more frequently in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo, controlled trial was completed to assess the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in decreasing the incidence of contrast-induced renal dysfunction in patients with an acute coronary syndrome and renal insufficiency who underwent coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention.
s
imilar intravenous hydration protocols, 20 patients received N-acetylcysteine (treatment group) and 20 patients received placebo (control group) in a twice per day dosing regimen with one dose before and three doses after contrast media exposure.
s
o groups were similar at baseline on demographic and clinical characteristics, and preexisting renal insufficiency. Contrast-induced renal dysfunction, defined as an increase in serum creatinine greater than 44 Î¼mol/L (.5 mg/dL) and/or 25% above baseline within 48 hours, occurred in 7.5% of the cohort, with 2.5% in the treatment group, and 5% in the control group, for an absolute difference of 2.5%. There was no difference in serum creatinine or creatinine clearance at 24 hours or at 48 hours between the treatment and control groups.
sion
results suggest that this cohort gained no added protection to renal function with the use of N-acetylcysteine.

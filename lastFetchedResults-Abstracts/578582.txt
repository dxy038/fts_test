Due to the importance of supplier selection issue in supply chain management (SCM) and ,also,  the increasing tendency of organizations to their social responsibilities, In this paper, we survey the supplier selection issue as a multi objective problem while considering the factor of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a mathematical parameter. The purpose of this paper is to design a model so that suppliers are selected and quota is allocated to them while raising their social responsibility to the maximum expected extent. Supplier selection objectives such as cost minimization, quality maximization and on-time delivery maximization have already been surveyed. In this paper, we add objectives such as CSR maximization, maximization of advantages of domestic supplier selection and minimization of sum total distance to suppliers, to the prior objective functions while considering the quality and on time delivery constraints. Observance of CSR is lineally related to quality and on-time delivery and will lead to their increase. The model is presented in linear and integer programming in two states, single product and multi product, then it is solved by Multi Objective Decision Making (MODM) methods (Utility Function, STEM and Goal Programming) and answers are obtained and compared.

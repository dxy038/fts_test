Sacroilitis is an inflammatory disease, which is often caused by Brucella species (mainly by Brucella melitensis, and B. abortus), Mycobaterium tuberculosis or inflammatory diseases such as ankylosing spondilitis. It is rarely associated with Staphylococcal infections. In this report, a case of a 24-year-old sailor with a history of low back pain is presented who was initially suspected to suffer from ankylosing spondilitis or brucellosis. Further evaluation of this case revealed septic sacroilitis due to Staphylococcus aureus and was successfully treated with vancomycin.

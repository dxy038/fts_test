The paper proposes an active traffic and congestion control mechanism in MPLS (MPLS ATCC) and its model, which integrate the characters of the multiprotocol label switch (MPLS) and an active network. MPLS ATCC moves the endpoint congestion control algorithms into the network. The comparison with traditional TCP shows that MPLS ATCC can find and control the congestion in time, reduce the round-trip delay, edit the ingress traffic. MPLS ATCC therefore achieves the objective of improving the total throughput and the utility of the buffer

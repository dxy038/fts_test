This paper proposes a new utility-based connection admission control algorithm called UCAC for real-time services in packet-switched OFDM wireless networks. The main idea of the algorithm is to periodically adjust the acceptance ratios according to the system information including channel condition in the physical layer, queue status in the radio link layer and traffic load in the network layer. By using the cross-layer approach, the algorithm takes the connection-level and packet-level performances of users into consideration. Furthermore, a user utility function is defined as the measure of how efficiently the bandwidth resource is used. The objective of the acceptance ratios adjusting is to maintain the maximum total user utility while guaranteeing the packet-level and call-level QoS requirements for real-time services. The performance of the algorithm is validated by extensive simulation results.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt is the most commonly used technique for management of hydrocephalus, although complications occur occasionally. One of these complications is catheter migration into the intestine, vagina, umbilicus and scrotum. In this article we present a rare case of catheter migration into the scrotum.
CASE: A 2-month-old infant underwent surgery for congenital hydrocephalus at the Imam Khomeini hospital of Orumieh, Iran and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was implanted. Postoperative course was uneventful. Monthly follow up visit revealed no problem regarding to shunt during first 3 months period after operation, but 7 months after surgery parents noticed scrotal swelling in their child. X-ray study disclosed catheter tip in scrotum. Surgery was performed for repositioning of catheter tip and herniorrhaphy. Three days after surgery patient discharged without any complication and during one year follow up period we didnâ€™t notice any problem in the patient.
CONCLUSION: Catheter migration of ventriculoperitoneal shunt into the scrotum is a rare event but prompt surgical obliteration of patent processus vaginalis and catheter repositioning is strongly recommended to avoid shunt malfunction.

KEY WORDS: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications, Peritoneal catheter migration, Patent processus vaginalis- hydrocele.

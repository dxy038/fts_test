This paper investigates the optimal selection of processing parameters for motion table performance. The main objective of the mechanism of a one-axis servo motor table is to avoid vibration, thereby reducing experimental error. This experimental controller uses a grey-based Taguchi method to make a quality evaluation of three table characteristics; displacement, arriving time, and torsion. It is shown that the multiple response performance characteristics are greatly improved through this study.

For multi-objective optimization problems, an improved multi-objective adaptive niche genetic algorithm based on Pareto Front is proposed in this paper. In this Algorithm, the rank value and the niche value are introduced to evaluate the individuals. The evolution population adopts the adaptive-crossover and adaptive-mutation probability, which can adjust the search scope according to solution quality. The experimental results show that this algorithm convergent faster and is able to achieve a broader distribution of the Pareto optimal solution.

The objective of this paper is to extend application of Laplace-Carson transform (LCT) to the realization of linear time-varying (LTV) systems. We propose using the unilateral and bilateral two-dimensional Laplace transform (2DLT) for realization of LTV systems, which exhibit a circular symmetry. Application of two-dimensional Laplace and Fourier transforms to LTV systems results in a bifrequency realization. In particular, it is shown that the 2DLT of LTV systems is, in fact, a Hankel transform of order zero.

Planning of distribution networks is usually accomplished using a cost-based conventional model that minimizes the total cost of construction and reinforcement of substations and feeders. The resulted expansion plan designed by this cost-based model is not necessarily the best choice for an electrical distribution company (DISCO) in the nowadays deregulated structure. This happening is mainly due to the fact that the utility seeks to maximize its profit in this competitive environment. On the other hand, this model does not consider the upcoming new challenges ahead of distribution systems, such as smart grid and distribution automation technologies. This paper presents a novel profit-based model for multistage distribution network expansion planning considering distribution automation. The objective function to be maximized is the net present value of the companyÂ´s profit. The problem is solved employing the genetic algorithm approach as a promising technique in solving such optimization problems. The proposed method effectiveness is finally evaluated on an illustrative 24-node test network and the obtained results and discussions are then presented.

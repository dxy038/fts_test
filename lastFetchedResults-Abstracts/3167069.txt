The MATLAB formulation for the parametric geometry of the deflector configuration has been validated with CST MWS simulations, after incorporation of the radiation pattern, polarization mismatch and the transmission coefficient of the deflector elements in the former. A close agreement between the extended MATLAB formulation and CST MWS simulations gives confidence in the former to study the trade-offs in a passive electromagnetic deflector using the multi-objective genetic algorithm approach; the latter being too computationally intensive for the same. The effect of fabrication misalignment among different layers of the deflectorÂ´s PCB and angle of incidence on the transmission coefficient of the deflector is also investigated.

The objective of the study is to establish the potential of Odina gum as a novel pharmaceutical aid for development of controlled release drug delivery systems. The influence of varying the proportion of the gum, the nature of diluents and their ratio in the preparation was also evaluated. Compatibility of the drugs with the gum was studied using FTIR and DSC. In vitro dissolution studies indicated that various proportions of Odina gum ranging from 10% to 70% are required depending on the nature of the drug. Furthermore, a blend of lactose and microcrystalline cellulose were also required to tailor the release profiles for attaining controlled release of both the moieties. Swelling studies were carried out to support the drug release mechanism. Peppas model was found to be the best fit model. Hence swelling and diffusion were concluded to be the basic mechanisms modulating drug release from the gum based matrices.

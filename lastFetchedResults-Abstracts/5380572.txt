A new approach using the converter switching functions to the modeling and analysis of the bidirectional actively controlled DC-DC converters is presented in this paper. This modeling technique helps to obtain the dynamic equations which can be used to computer simulate the performance of the converter. With the aid of the harmonic balance technique (HBT), the detailed steady-state performance analysis of the converter is undertaken and compared with results obtained from full-order. The results obtained from HBT compare favorably with those generated from computer full-order simulation results. Finally, the converter equations generated using HBT is used to determine the minimum loss operation of the bi-directional actively controlled DC-DC converters.

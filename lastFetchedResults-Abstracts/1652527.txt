Residential wood-framed construction failures account for the majority of economic losses following hurricanes. A common failure in these constructions during high wind events is loss of roof sheathing, especially in corner areas. Less common perhaps, but usually catastrophic, is the failure of the roof-to-wall connections in these structures. The main objective of the current research project is to evaluate the in-situ capacity of roof-to-wall connections and sheathing to rafter fasteners in light-framed wood constructions. The unique opportunity provided by Clemson University to access four residential structures located within a residential complex enabled the collection of perishable yet statistically significant data on the strengths of existing residential structures. The uplift capacities of 100 roof-to-wall toenail connections and 34 plank sheathing units were evaluated from field and laboratory tests. Realizing the key role of probability distributions in developing fragility estimates and loss prediction models, distribution fits and parameters for these structural components are postulated. One conclusion drawn is that the uplift capacities of two and three nail connections are best described by a lognormal distribution. The initial stiffness and the vertical displacement at peak load of both two nail and three nail connections follow a normal and Weibull distribution respectively. The uplift capacity of plank sheathing follows a lognormal distribution. An analytical model designed to approximate the uplift behavior of toenail connections is developed to facilitate modeling of roof systems. These probabilistic and analytical models developed by this study allow for the performance of detailed reliability based studies on light-framed wood roof structures.

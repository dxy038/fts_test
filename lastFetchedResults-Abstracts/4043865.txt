The commenter maintains that the above-titled article (see ibid., vol.23, no.3, p.22-3, 1990) on unobtrusive real-time system monitoring fails to demonstrate much appreciation for the software side and as a result provides a somewhat misleading view of the state of the art in real-time system monitoring. He states that the article fails to mention that modern real-time application software written in a high-level programming language rarely conforms to the static structure assumed by the monitor. The authors reply that their article clearly states that the principal objective is to develop a hardware-based noninvasive real-time monitoring system to ensure minimal interference in the execution of a target real-time distributed computing system. They point out that the monitor does not assume that the application software has to be a static structure and present an argument in support of this claim.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

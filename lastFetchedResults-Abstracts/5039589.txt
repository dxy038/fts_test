In this paper, the concept of coordination is introduced within the framework of two-level large-scale systems and a new fuzzy approach based on Interaction Balance Principle, in conjunction with Tamura´s optimization method, is used for coordination of overall system. For this purpose, the overall optimization problem is first decomposed into m sub-problems, where each is optimized using Tamura´s method, in which the functional optimization of the first level sub-systems are changed into parametric optimizations. Then, in the second level, the coordination of the overall large-scale system is done using Interaction Balance Principle which modifies the objective functions using a fuzzy optimization and coordination technique. It is shown that the speed of convergence of interaction errors exceeds substantially those obtained using the classical Tamura´s method.

The objective of this research is to specify Ischemic Stroke Area by using statistical methods and probability to divide image data into 2 areas, normal and abnormal areas of the brain, in order to automatically assign the Threshold level of Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) images from CBV (Cerebral Blood Volume) and CBF (Cerebral Blood Flow) images and apply to Digital Image Processing to analyze data images. The results will be shown in N-Match (normal tissue areas), D-Match (dead tissue areas), Mismatch (blood clot tissue areas) and Undefined area. Then, separate the brain into left and right to specify Ischemic Stroke Area. From experiments with 5 patient samples with 256&#215;256 pixels images, N-Match, D-Match, Mismatch and Undefined values depend on Threshold value gathered from the difference of Mean and Standard Deviation values of CBV and CBF images. As a result of experiment, it is possible to sort elementary information of left and right side of the brain to specify Ischemic Stroke Area to compare the results with brain specialists.

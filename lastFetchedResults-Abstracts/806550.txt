Chaos synchronization of two identical Chua systems with the same fractional order is studied by utilizing the Pecora–Carroll (PC) method, the active–passive decomposition (PAD) method, the one-way coupling method and the bidirectional coupling one. The sufficient conditions for achieving synchronization between these two systems are derived via the Laplace transformation theory. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the theoretical analyses.

Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of training visual perception skills on improving reading abilities, including comprehen-sion and word recognition in texts among students with dyslexia. Method: The present research is a semi-experimental study and the research plan is of unequal control group type. Diagnostic Tests of Reading and Andre Rey Test were administered to two groups of 30 third grade primary school stu¬dents with dyslexia who were selected from primary schools using multi-step cluster sampling. Data analysis was carried out using independent t-test to assess the difference in the means of the two groups (experimental and control) in posttest. Results: The findings indicated a significant difference in the pretest and posttest scores of the experimental and control groups (p=0.05). The dyslexic students who received visual perception training after pretest, achieved higher scores in posttest. In other words, these findings led an improvement in reading in dyslexic students. Conclusion: Results indi¬cate that training visual perception skills could enhance reading performance in students with dyslexia. Also, reinforcing visual perception skills could im¬prove comprehension and word recognition in texts in students with dyslexia. Training visual skills can improve reading performance and therefore, lead to significant improvement in reading ability and comprehension in students with dyslexia. Therefore, it can be concluded that training visual skills is an appropriate educational method for all students with dyslexia who have problems in visual perception.

In this paper, we establish an economic production quantity (EPQ) based inventory model by
considering various types of non-perfect products. We classify products in four groups of
perfect, imperfect, defective but reworkable and non-reworkable defective items. The demand
is a power function of price and marketing expenditure and production unit cost is considered to
be a function of lot size. The objective of this paper is to determine lot size, marketing
expenditure, selling price, set up cost and inventory holding cost, simultaneously. The problem
is modeled as a nonlinear posynomial geometric programming and an optimal solution is
derived. The implementation of the proposed method is demonstrated using a numerical
example and the sensitivity analysis is also performed to study the behavior of the model.

This paper addresses a robust predictive control of additive discrete time uncertain nonlinear systems. The controller design is characterized as an optimization problem of the &#8220;worst-case&#8221; objective function over an infinite moving horizon. A sufficient state feedback synthesis condition is provided in the form of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization and will be solved online at each time step. A simulation example is exploited to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

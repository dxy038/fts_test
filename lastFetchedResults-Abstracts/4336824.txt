With the application of polyethylene film, &#8220;white pollution&#8221; has been becoming worse and worse. In recent years degradable film has become popular in Northern regions of China. Photo-biodegradable polyethylene (PBD-PE) film, containing starch made in Nanjing of China, has been developed and applied in agriculture to find out its field effect. It can increase soil temperature, preserve soil moisture and increase yield as the common polyethylene films with better effect than control. In addition, it can be degraded environmentally after these functions are fulfilled.The application period of this kind of photo-biodegradable films is around 130~200days, which basically satisfies the needs of such agricultural cultivars as maize, wheat and etc.. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of this sort of PBD-PE on the soil water, soil temperature, the physic-ecological index of wheat and the yield. The final aim is to reveal its mechanism of saving water and increasing yield and provide certain basis for the application of PBD-PE. We are conceived that it is one of the important measures to protect field eco-environment from &#8220;white pollution&#8221;.

Recently, computation, communication and control are deeply and pervasively embedded into physical and engineered components of network system, to advance entire networked system performance and dependability. In such systems, the growing complexity of network structure result in need of increasing system reliability. Network reliability modeling and analysis need not only capture the complex dynamic process of network systems, but also need the facilities for applying, understanding and computing. The objective of this paper is to develop a suitable modeling and analysis framework to study the ad-hoc network reliability. Using the mutual transformations of reliability functions between the time-domain and the frequency-domain, we adopt frequency-domain analysis approach to model network reliability. The advantages of the proposed approach over the traditional time-domain approaches include capability to capture higher order moments of system characteristics, scalability to analyze reliability of complex network systems, efficiency in calculation and practicability in computer simulation, etc. Finally, numerical experiment results show the feasibility and efficacy of this approach.

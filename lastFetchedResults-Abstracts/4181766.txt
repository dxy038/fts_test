To assure the quality of software by running test cases and evaluating the results is one of the difficult parts of the entire software development project. The difficulty usually comes from the lack of appropriate supporting tools and the complexity of the software. In the past ad hoc supporting tools were made for each project and test results were usually not used across projects. This conventional way of test and evaluation (T &amp; E) is time consuming, and the most important decision "When is this software ready to ship?" is left to the engineers depending on his/her experience. Our objective is to build a knowledge-based T &amp; E environment such that test cases, test results, object snapshots and other information are accumulated in a database. These longitudinal data can be automatically tracked and analyzed to provide decision support information. As a result, test results can be reviewed repeatedly and software quality can be assured by analyzing these data from various perspectives. We describe the details of object testing in our testing environment

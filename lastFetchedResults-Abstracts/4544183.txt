We investigate the effects of optical amplifiers in the presence of intraband crosstalk arises in FBG-OC-based bidirectional optical cross connects (BOXCs) for bidirectional WDM ring networks (BWRNs). Theoretical analysis is carried out to evaluate the performance limitations due to ASE of optical amplifiers in bidirectional WDM ring networks. We analyzed here two configurations of FBG-OC-based BOXCs: 2 &#215; 2 BOXC and 4 &#215; 4 BOXC in the presence of optical preamplifiers for bidirectional WDM ring networks and evaluate the bit-error rate (BER) and power penalty (PP) due to intraband crosstalk and ASE noise. Receiver sensitivity is significantly degraded which causes additional BER and power penalty due to signal-ASE beat noise induced in optical amplifiers in the presence of intraband crosstalk arises in BOXC. It is found that BER and power penalty, due to ASE-signal beat noise accumulated through multiple nodes along with intraband crosstalk induced by fiber Bragg gratings, both are significantly increased not only with the number of wavelength channel increased for both bar and cross state of BOXC but also with the number of amplifier increased. BER and power penalty are not affected with the position number of the wavelength channels in the bar state while in the cross state, if the position number of the wavelength channels is increased, the BER and power penalty both are increased.

Optimization of available satellite power and transponder bandwidth is utilized to minimize the Earth station G/T in satellite channel per carrier (SCPC) systems. The corresponding optimum transponder output backoff is obtained. Applications in system design are given. In a previous paper [1] the channel capacity of a satellite transponder handling single channel per carrier (SCPC) transmission was derived. The link carrier-to-noise (C/N) ratio was maximized over the output backoff and the maximum bandwidth available was determined. Given the bandwidth per channel for each carrier, the channel capacity was obtained. The objective of the present investigation is to derive the minimum G/T of the Earth station in SCPC systems by optimum utilization of available satellite power and transponder bandwidth. Applications in system design are discussed.

The paper presents an industrial case study. Crude distillation unit (CDU) and delayed coking unit (DCU) are important plants in oil refineries, presenting huge energy consumption, especially due to high flowrates of process material streams. Any acceptable solution for energy saving is important in this context. The idea of thermal coupling between these two plants is good as they have potential to exchange energy, but the problem is to choose the most appropriate way to do it. The objective of this work is to present the possibility to exchange energy between the two plants, continuing a previous work [Energy saving by integration of CDU-delayed coke plants, third Conference, Process Integration, Modelling and Optimisation for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction––PRES 2000, P7.72], where a part of the solution was already presented. The difficulty to find a solution arisen from the fact that DCU is working semi-continuous. More insights in the process allowed finding new possibilities, more attractive for rational use of energy, with better applicability. A feasibility study will be performed to give also economic sound of all the implications for the modifications proposed.

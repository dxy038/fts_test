One of the key enabling technologies of the modern grid is energy storage that has characteristics that will benefit consumers, businesses, and utilities. The objective of this discussion is to give an update of a DOE funded smart grid demonstration project deployment of energy storage at DTE Energy. The goal of the DTE Energy project is to install 20 Community Energy Storage (CES) systems in an electric distribution circuit to demonstrate the use and benefits of a CES system and to test the ability to integrate refurbished plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) batteries into the CES demonstration project.

The objective of this study was to validate (SANCO/12495/2011 and NTC-ISO/IEC 17025) multi-residue multi-class methods using QuEChERS sample preparation and GC–MS for the analysis of regulated pesticides in tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), tamarillos (Solanum betaceum) and goldenberries (Physalis peruviana). These Latin American products are representative and widely produced in Antioquia (Colombia). Sample preparation followed the UNE-EN 15662 method (150 mg MgSO4, 25 mg primary secondary amines and 25 mg of octadecylsiloxane for cleanup; graphitized carbon black was added for tomatoes). Extracts were injected using a programmed temperature-vaporizing injector. The residues were validated over a range from 0.02 mg/kg to 0.20 mg/kg, with 24 analytes validated in tomatoes, 33 in tamarillos and 28 in goldenberries. An initial risk assessment was enabled by monitoring 24 samples in the municipalities of El Peñol, Marinilla and San Vicente Ferrer. Risks were found for tomatoes, but no significant risks were found for tamarillos or goldenberries.

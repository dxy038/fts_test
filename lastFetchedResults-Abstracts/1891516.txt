 The objective of this study is synthesis and characterization of the chitosan-silica composite
(CSC) and use them as an adsorbent material for peat water treatment. The resulting composite was characterized
by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and zeta potential. The sorption experiments were carried out in
batch mode to optimize various parameters such as contact time, dose of CSC, pH and temperature. In
addition, adsorption isotherms of humic acid onto the CSC were also evaluated with the Langmuir, Freundlich
and Sips approximations. Kinetic data were tested using the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order kinetic
models and intra-particle equations. The results from this work showed that the adsorption of humic acid was
found to increase with increase in contact time and temperature while acidic pH was more favorable for the
adsorption of humic acid from peat water. The optimum dosage of CSC was 5 g. Equilibrium data were best
described by the Langmuir isotherm model, with maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 120.2 mg/g at 25
oC and pH 4.12. The kinetics of the adsorption process was found to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic
model, with a rate constant in the range of 0.034 - 0.105 g/mg/min, while intra-particle-diffusion were the main
rate determining step in the humic acid adsorption process. Thermodynamic parameters data indicated that the
humic acid sorption process was non-spontaneous and endothermic under the experimental conditions, with
the Gibbs free energy (“Go) in the range of 1.05-3.89 kJ/mol, enthalpy (“Ho) and entropy (“So) of 24.69 kJ/
mol and 69.62 J/mol, respectively and the activation energy was 23.23 kJ/mol. The CSC investigated in this
study thus exhibited as a high potential adsorbent for the peat water treatment.

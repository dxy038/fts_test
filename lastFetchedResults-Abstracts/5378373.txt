A new actuation approach coined as the "progressive wave method" (PWM) was proposed (C.K. Lim et al., 2005). The novelty lies in recognizing propagating electromagnetic wave generated from energized electromagnets in free space and visualizing them as "virtual gears", which is analogous to mechanical gears employed in conventional gearing system. The heart of motion generation rest in the contactless meshing of the "virtual gears" created from electromagnets and permanent magnets. This technique offers a simpler alternative in the directional and velocity control aspect. This paper details the design of a novel omni-directional wheel. The primary objective was to implement this innovative wheel in replacement of traditional robotic platform using differential steering system with omni-directional wheels. The design focuses on exploiting the PWM and incorporating the motor drive within the wheel itself. A prototype was developed and the proposed working principle was validated

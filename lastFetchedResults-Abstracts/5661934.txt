In this paper, we present a video encoding scheme that uses object-based adaptation to deliver surveillance video to mobile devices. The method relies on a set of complementary video adaptation strategies and generates content that matches various appliance and network resources. Prior to encoding, some of the adaptation strategies exploit video object segmentation and selective filtering in order to improve the perceived quality. Moreover, object segmentation enables the generation of automatic summaries and of simplified versions of the monitored scene. The performance of individual adaptation strategies is assessed using an objective video quality metric, which is also used to select the strategy that provides maximum value for the user under a given set of constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme on standard surveillance test sequences and realistic mobile client resource profiles.

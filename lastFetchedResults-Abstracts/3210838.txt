The environment is an essential element of every living as well as non living thing. In order to save environment, monitoring is necessary at regular interval. Continuous monitored data of any specific region need to be analyzed for further reference. It would be constructive and helpful if visualization can be done through geographic information system (GIS) along with the map of the region. This paper proposes an interface of constant environment monitoring of a region using Python programming language in GRASS GIS. The major objective of this paper is to access GRASS map using Python script without starting GRASS from the outside. This interface is capable of displaying stored data from the database for each deployed sensor, as well as its neighboring sensors. Previously deployed sensors can be moved on the basis of coordinate (latitude and longitude) and this movement can be shown through this interface at runtime.

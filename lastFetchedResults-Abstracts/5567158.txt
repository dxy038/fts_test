We present a novel approach for extending the bandwidth of narrow band antennas exploiting geometry evolution. The geometry of the antenna is allowed to evolve subject to constraints on the shape feasibility. The sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the coordinates of a number of control vertices are utilized to determine how the shape evolves. We illustrate our approach by showing that a narrow band antenna can be evolved to an Ultra Wide Band (UWB) antenna using our approach.

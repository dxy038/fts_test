The objective of this paper is to propose models enabling to study the behaviour of Ethernet switch for networked control systems. Two scheduler policies are analyzed: the static priority and the WRR (weighted round robin). The modelling work is based on coloured Petri nets. A temporal validation step based on the simulation of these modelling, shows that the obtained results are near to the expected behaviour of these scheduler policies.

This paper presents approaches for effectively computing all global minimizers of an objective function. The approaches include transformations of the objective function through the recently proposed deflection and stretching techniques, as well as a repulsion source at each detected minimizer. The aforementioned techniques are incorporated in the context of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, resulting in an efficient algorithm which has the ability to avoid previously detected solutions and, thus, detect all global minimizers of a function. Experimental results on benchmark problems originating from the fields of global optimization, dynamical systems, and game theory, are reported, and conclusions are derived.

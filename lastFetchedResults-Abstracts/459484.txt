The main goal of women's self-defense training is to strengthen women's capacity to defend themselves against potential attacks. Yet, the effects of women's self-defense training extend considerably beyond this objective, including physical, psychological, and behavioral impacts. Twenty quantitative studies that assess the effects of self-defense training on female participants are reviewed in this article. The evaluation outcomes focused on in this review include: psychological/attitudinal (assertiveness, self-esteem, anxiety, perceived control, fear of sexual assault, and self-efficacy) and behavioral outcomes (physical competence and avoidance behaviors). Limitations of these evaluations will also be highlighted. Finally, suggestions for the development of future self-defense training programs will be presented, along with a discussion of implications for future research evaluating women's self-defense programs.

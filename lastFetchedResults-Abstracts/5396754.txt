Based on other peopleÂ´s study of steam network, a network which integrated with process units was obtained. This dissertation has proposed a constrained multi objective model, and NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm - II) will solve it quickly. A real industrial example has been analyzed and the improvements are identified.

The United States Army has been actively considering deficiencies in the present communication system since the Korean conflict. In 1954 the concept of a Universal Integrated Communications System (UNICOM) was evolved. The fundamental objective of UNICOM is the achievement of an integrated, world-wide switching system, flexible in structure, and designed to meet the needs of substantially all military users. UNICOM is being developed around a concept that is highly flexible in nature. The Central Processor, a high-speed, digital, special-purpose communication computer, controls the message switch, the digital circuit switch, and the analog switch of the engineering test model now under development.

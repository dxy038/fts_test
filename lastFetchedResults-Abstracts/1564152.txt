In this paper, we introduce the notion of a weak sharp set of solutions to a variational inequality problem (VIP) in a reflexive, strictly convex and smooth Banach space, and present its several equivalent conditions. We also prove, under some continuity and monotonicity assumptions, that if any sequence generated by an algorithm for solving (VIP) converges to a weak sharp solution, then we can obtain solutions for (VIP) by solving a finite number of convex optimization subproblems with linear objective. Moreover, in order to characterize finite convergence of an iterative algorithm, we introduce the notion of a weak subsharp set of solutions to a variational inequality problem (VIP), which is more general than that of weak sharp solutions in Hilbert spaces. We establish a sufficient and necessary condition for the finite convergence of an algorithm for solving (VIP) which satisfies that the sequence generated by which converges to a weak subsharp solution of (VIP), and show that the proximal point algorithm satisfies this condition. As a consequence, we prove that the proximal point algorithm possesses finite convergence whenever the sequence generated by which converges to a weak subsharp solution of (VIP).

We present an energy efficient sensor manager for differentiated coverage of dynamic object group changing their positions with time. The information about the location of the object group is provided to the sensor manager. The manager invokes optimization algorithm whenever the obtained coverage falls below a threshold to sleep schedule the sensor network. Multi-objective Optimization (MO) algorithms help in finding a better trade-off among energy consumption, lifetime, and coverage. Here the motion of the particle is modeled to follow a polynomial variation and with a constant acceleration. We formulate the scheduling problem as a combinatorial, constrained and multi-objective optimization problem with energy and non-coverage as the two objectives to be minimized. The proposed scheme uses a recent variant of a powerful MO algorithm known as Decomposition based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA/D). Systematic comparison with the original MOEA/D and another well-known MO algorithm, NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) quantifies the superiority of the proposed approach.

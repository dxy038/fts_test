In this paper, we consider an &#8467;<sub>0</sub>-norm penalized formulation of the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP), aimed at extracting the leading sparse generalized eigenvector of a matrix pair. The formulation involves maximization of a discontinuous nonconcave objective function over a nonconvex constraint set, and is therefore computationally intractable. To tackle the problem, we first approximate the &#8467;<sub>0</sub>-norm by a continuous surrogate function. Then an algorithm is developed via iteratively majorizing the surrogate function by a quadratic separable function, which at each iteration reduces to a regular generalized eigenvalue problem. A preconditioned steepest ascent algorithm for finding the leading generalized eigenvector is provided. A systematic way based on smoothing is proposed to deal with the &#8220;singularity issue&#8221; that arises when a quadratic function is used to majorize the nondifferentiable surrogate function. For sparse GEPs with special structure, algorithms that admit a closed-form solution at every iteration are derived. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms match or outperform existing algorithms in terms of computational complexity and support recovery.

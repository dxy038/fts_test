Introduction: Primary dysmenorrheal is described as pelvic pain during menstrual bleeding in the absence of an identifiable pathologic lesion. It is a common gynecologic problem among women in reproductive age groups. Our objective was to compare the effect of vitamin E and Fennel extract on primary dysmenorrheal. 
Methods: In this randomized single blind, placebo-controlled trial, 65 single female students who suffered from primary dysmenorrheal were randomly assigned into 3 groups of Fennel extract, vitamin E and placebo. Groups used treatment four times a day from the onset of bleeding and continued through three days for two consecutive menstrual periods. The vitamin E group took 100 unit capsules and Fennel extract group took 46 mg capsules with commercial name of Fenalgin. 
Results: In the Fennel extract group, one month and two months after treatment, mean of pain duration significantly reduced compared to before treatment (P < 0.001) but in the vitamin E group, the  pain duration mean decreased only  two months after treatment (P < 0.02). The comparison of the first cycle means of pain duration, shows a significant difference between the three groups (P=0.033). 
Conclusion: The results show that fennel extract is more effective than vitamin E in reducing the duration of pain in primary dysmenorrheal.

The design of sophisticated control systems have led in the past ten years to the necessity of satisfying more than one design criterion. Thus, it is natural to think that those criteria can be met in an optimal manner. If several criteria have simultaneously to be optimized, one is in presence of a Multi-Objective Optimization problem. However, the search process of an optimum requires a very high computation burden and the convergence can be very slow. In this paper, the most popular Pareto methods are compared by solving a parametric MOO problem of controller design.

This paper aimed to develop a quantitative and objective method to analyze and evaluate human factors in aviation maintenance process. Firstly a detailed classification and causing analysis on human errors in aviation maintenance was carried out basing on SHEL and Reason Model; then an integrated evaluation solution was proposed out by using fuzzy and AHP method together. Then the solution was applied into practice for an evaluation case. Finally it concluded that Noise &amp; vibration, Professional ethics &amp; responsibility, Safety information sharing and Completeness of software &amp; document took the four largest weights to the four first-level indices respectively. This comprehensive evaluation method was expected to be using in practice and provide effective support to prevent human errors and improve safety in maintenance organizations.

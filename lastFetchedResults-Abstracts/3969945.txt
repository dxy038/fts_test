The response of a Silicon On Insulator (SOI) Microdosimeter and a silicon PIN diode were tested at the TSL quasimonoenergetic neutron beamline at Uppsala university. The objective was to determine the response of both the SOI Microdosimeter and silicon PIN diode to a high energy quasi-monoenergetic neutron field for potential future application of the devices in aviation dosimetry. PIN diode angular response dependence was also measured to determine the suitability of PIN diodes in a multidirectional high energy neutron field as encountered in aviation environments. Simulations of the response from the SOI Microdosimeter and PIN diode to the field using GEANT4 were obtained to assist in interpreting the experimental measurements.

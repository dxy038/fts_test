The objective of this work was to conduct treatability studies on rinse wastewater from process lines of a typical nickelplating plant for reuse. The study comprised of three steps: (1) a plant process review and the treatability of different combinations of simulated spent rinses in the laboratory; (2) a variability monitoring of a combined rinse at the plant and a treatability study on a combined rinse in the laboratory; (3) a pilot study for reclamation of the combined rinse on site. The study established an optimum dual membrane ultrafiltration (UF)/reverse osmosis (RO) process for treating a combined liquor of spent alkaline, acidic and nickel-plating rinses which resulted in a treated water of a quality suitable for reuse as substitute for town water for the purpose of rinsing. The results of this study provided a good guide to the selection of a UF pretreatment combined with an RO membrane unit as the treatment system. The pilot plant had successfully operated for 6 months, consistently producing a high quality product water (<95 (mu)S cm1) at an overall water recovery of 67.5%. The quality of reclaimed water was better than town water used at the factory. The product water from the pilot plant has been used as substitute of town water for in-process rinsing at the factory with no detrimental effects for 3 months.

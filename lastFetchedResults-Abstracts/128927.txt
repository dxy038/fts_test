BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the follicular response in induction of ovulation with the use of low dose human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) in patients with clomiphene citrate resistant PCOs.
METHODS: This semi-experimental study was performed on I2 patients with clomiphene citrate resistant PCOs in Fathemeh Zahra infertility center. Induction ovulation was started with 37.5 (IU) of H.MG daily and then was increased by 75 IU according to follicular response. Patients were exactly monitored by vaginal sonography.
FINDINGS: Eight patients showed suitable follicular response to induction, of whom 2 conceived. In 4 patients, their cycles had cancelled because no follicular response was observed in spite of increasing dose to 75 IU until midcycle Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (O1-ISS) was not observed in any of them.
CONCLUSION: Administration of low dose HMG can be used successfully to stimulate follicular growth in patients with clomiphene citrate resistant PCOs.

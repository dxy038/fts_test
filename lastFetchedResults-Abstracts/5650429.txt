When establishing the Pareto-optimal front, effective multicriteria optimization involves simultaneous parallel search for multiple members of a genetic algorithm population. In one of these approaches due to Eiben and Lis (1997) rather than conducting multiple independent single objective searches, all the individuals in the population, &#8220;speciated&#8221; by criterion, explore the problem space expecting that the increased parallel processing of schemata improves effectiveness to find more solutions in the Pareto-optimal range. The present paper investigates the problem of using a genetic algorithm on a set of test functions which allows a multisexual population, multiple parents and multiple crossovers per mating, attempting to build a Pareto optimal set of larger size. Also, while creating a new population a selection process for replacement favours those new created solutions that are inclined to appertain to the Pareto front. As a result, the performance of the method produce an evenly distributed and larger set of efficient points

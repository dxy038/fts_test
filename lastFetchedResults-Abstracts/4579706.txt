This paper presents a novel approach to achieving BPS functionality using AIGaN/GaN HFETs and for the first time presents experimental data showing the power bidirectional capability of the devices. We present the first detailed study of the bidirectional power switching capability of single and dual gate AIGaN/GaN BPS. One approach to achieve a symmetrical voltage blocking capability in AIGaN/GaN HFET is to place the gate electrode in the middle of the source-drain spacing.

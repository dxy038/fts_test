Objective
lorimetric in situ hybridization (CISH)-based matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-to-E-cadherin (ECD) ratio (MER) has been revealed as an excellent marker for the disease stage in prostate cancer. The one aim of this study was investigating a new method for estimation of MER by bicolor fluorescent ISH (bicolor FISH) with a computerized fluorescence detector-based system. Another aim was examination of relation of MER by bicolor FISH with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C).
s
color FISH technique used cyanin 5 (cy5)-labeled MMP-2 and âˆ’9 probes, and a cyanin 3 (cy3)-labeled ECD probe on needle biopsy specimens from 67 prostate cancer cases. The ISH was followed by computerized detection of the signal intensities and cy5-to-cy3 ratios using a fluorescence detector. VEGF-C expression was examined using cy5-labeled VEGF-C by computerized detection.
s
color FISH-based MER was well correlated with CISH-based MER (P &lt; 0.0001). The bicolor FISH-based MER correlated with Gleason score and pathologic stage of the cases. VEGF-C mRNA expression was associated with the pathologic stage and maximum lymph vessel density (LVD). The LVD was associated with VEGF-C expression at the tumor area where the maximum MER was detected (P &lt; 0.0001).
sion
R was correlated with the VEGF-C expression and LVD, indicating lymph node metastasis of prostate cancer. Therefore, this computer-assisted MER is a useful marker for preoperative prediction of disease stage, especially lymph node metastasis, of prostate cancer.

A new microstrip antenna with a back-to-back configuration relative to a slot on a ground plane is proposed. The proposed antenna has an omnidirectional or bidirectional radiation pattern in a horizontal plane. The characteristics of the proposed antenna were clarified by experiments. The input impedances and radiation patterns were measured as parameters of the slot length. Good input impedances and radiation patterns have been obtained. The proposed antenna is suitable for a base station in many wireless communications, and for a portable telephone

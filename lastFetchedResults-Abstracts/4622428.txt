Summary form only given, as follows. Commonly, the bidirectional beam propagation method is applied for modeling flat surface Bragg gratings or the stair-case approximation is used for curved Bragg gratings. An algorithm for the 2D bidirectional beam propagation method, which overcomes the stair-case approximation, is presented for curved Bragg gratings. Application of complex Pade&#180; approximants, perfectly matched layer boundary conditions, TE and TM polarization formulations are considered.

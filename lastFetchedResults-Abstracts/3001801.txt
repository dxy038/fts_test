Explosive welding is a method for joining two metal components together with minimal distortion, and a high-strength interface that is virtually free of foreign contaminants. One major advantage of explosive welding is that it can be used to link two metals considered as "incompatible" by conventional techniques. However, the strong dependence of the bond characteristics on several welding parameters leads to some unique nondestructive evaluation (NDE) requirements. The objective of this work is to develop an ultrasonic NDE scheme for evaluating the quality of the bond in a Cu-Al explosive weld, and linking this scheme to a model of the interfacial profile

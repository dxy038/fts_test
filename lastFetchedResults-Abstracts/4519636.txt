Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are resource constrained system. Efficient use of resources especially, energy is most important for their life extension. Clustering is a well known technique for achieving high scalability and efficient resource allocation in WSN. One of the fundamental issues in cluster based networks is to determine the optimal number of clusters with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption. Considering its importance, a GK clustering approach is used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The study considers the deployment of 100 nodes in 100&#195;&#151;100 m<sup>2</sup> area for both random and random uniform distributions.

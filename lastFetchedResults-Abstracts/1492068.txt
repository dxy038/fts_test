The objective of this research is to investigate the seismic performance of the composite joint consisting of square concrete filled thin-walled steel tubular (CFTST) column and steel beam with end plate and blind bolts. The cold-formed square tube in each CFTST column connection was fabricated by seam welding together four pieces of lipped angle with nominal wall thickness 1.5 mm or 3 mm. Four exterior joint specimens were tested under axially compressive load on the top of the columns and cyclic loads on the beam tip. The experimental parameters in the study were the thickness of the steel tube and the type of end plate. The seismic response of the blind bolted moment joints to CFTST columns was analyzed and evaluated in terms of the hysteretic behavior, failure modes, stiffness and strength degradation, ductility, and energy dissipation capacities of the joints. To improve the tension behavior of the blind bolted moment connections to the thin tube wall, the anchorage action of reinforcing rebar welded to the bolts with concrete-filled steel tubes was also investigated to consider the effect of cyclic loading. The experimental and analytical results indicated that when the end plate thickness is not less than 3 mm, the flush or extended end plate joints to CFTST columns exhibited large hysteretic loops and excellent seismic performance, such as ductility and energy dissipation capacity. The proposed innovative blind bolted joint was verified as a reliable and effective solution applied in mid- and low-rise buildings through properly design and detailing.

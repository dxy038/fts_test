As the robot application range extends constantly, its working condition is getting more complex, which is always unknown, dynamic and unstructured. Through exploring the behavior -based robot control technology, the intelligent avoiding barriers control system design of an autonomous mobile robot is presented. And the implementation technology of this scheme was introduced; In the designed mobile robot control system, behavior-based control is integrated with the concept of fuzzy control theory, the multiple objective missions are realized through fuzzy control and priority-based decision. Experiment results show its effectiveness and real-time ability.

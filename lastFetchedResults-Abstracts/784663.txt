Objective: This study aimed to compare dietary intake of older people with dementia receiving day
care at regular day care facilities (RDCFs) or at so-called green care farms (GCFs). Design and settings:
A comparative cross-sectional study was performed at 10 GCFs and 10 RDCFs in the Netherlands. Participants:
30 subjects from GCFs and 23 subjects from RDCFs, aged 65 years or over, were included in the study. Subjects
from GCFs were mostly married males who were aged younger than the subjects from RDCFs who were mostly
widowed females. Measurements: Dietary intake of the subjects was observed and/or recorded both at home and
during their time at the day care facility. Results: In the GCF group, average total energy intake was significantly
higher than in the RDCF group (8.8 MJ/d vs. 7.2 MJ/d). Also total carbohydrates and protein intakes were higher
in the GCF group than in the RDCF group (with 257 g/d vs. 204 g/d, and 76 g/d vs. 65 g/d respectively). In
addition, average total fluid intake was significantly higher in the GCF group than in the RDCF group (2577 g/d
vs. 1973 g/d). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that after taking possible confounders into account,
day care type was still significantly related to the intake of energy, carbohydrates and fluids. Conclusion: This
study suggests beneficial effects of this new type of day care on dietary intake by community-dwelling older
people with dementia.

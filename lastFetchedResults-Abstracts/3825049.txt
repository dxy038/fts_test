A classification of ac drive technology is presented. A series of diagrams show how the various types of ac drives have evolved into families that meet various application requirements. The objective is to provide a convenient graphical format from which suitable drive types for classes of applications are readily apparent. The diagrams are organized around the input and output power circuit topology with the type of semiconductor power switch as the primary classification element. All other drive properties, such as motor type, control strategy, power level, voltage level, and regeneration capability, are incorporated by segmenting and highlighting portions of the basic diagrams. A discussion of drive properties is also presented and integrated with the graphical presentations.

The objective of this research is to determine the relative performance levels of several different detectors when the transmitted signal is propagated through the ocean and received by a large, passive array. The transmitted signal is narrowband with a Rayleigh envelope and known carrier frequency while the received signal is calculated by modeling the ocean as a waveguide with a realistic sound velocity profile. The contaminating noise is modeled as temporally independent and spatially dependent non-Gaussian noise. It is shown that the optimal Bayes detector and the locally optimal Bayes detector have similar performance levels if the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is small enough. When the SNR becomes large, the performance levels of the two detectors are substantially different for small probabilities of error

This paper holds as its core objective the report of the research developed towards the conceptualisation and prototyping of an Information Visualisation system capable of providing a quick and accurate view of the set of data collected by the SAPO Broker web service regarding access activity in the SAPO news website. SAPO Broker, a real-time monitoring application that collects data generated by every type of activity within the SAPO Web Portal. The research presented and its results undertook two major challenges: i) design a visual metaphor capable of integrating news related collected data for a specific target audience, technology setup and context of use; ii) design user friendly and context valid interaction tools able to assist data analysis and help improve news editorial related tasks. Throughout this paper the need for transdisciplinary teamwork and diverse scientific knowledge correlation is reinforced, as we believe it should be when the core issue is Information Visualisation.

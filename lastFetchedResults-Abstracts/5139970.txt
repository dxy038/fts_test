A three person game, the Target, the Missile and the Defender (TMD) for high order players is formulated and solved. The Missile that is attacking the Target has an objective to minimize its miss distance to the Target, while the Target is trying to maximize the miss distance from the Missile. The Defender is trying to intercept the Missile prior to its arrival to the Target. That is, the objective of the Defender is minimizing its distance to the Missile while the objective of the Missile is to maximize its distance from the Defender and at the same time not to jeopardize its effort to intercept the Target.

Usage of multimedia applications is increasing day by day in human social life, medical, military and businesses. Providing the expected quality of service (QoS) to end users is a challenging work for multimedia experts and companies in high technology environment. Delivering the good quality of services (QoS) to end users in distributed systems is based on multiple reliable components of software and hardware. Furthermore, human perceived quality of services are also depended on multiple factors such as multimedia application platform, middleware components and quality of service component architectures. This work addresses the quality of service components architecture particularly assessing the quality of service as perceived by end users. This paper discussed major components of QoS architecture in sense of perceiving the quality to end user and described the role of objective and subjective methods. For testing the quality-of-service for multimedia application, this paper evaluated subjective and objective methods and selected the successfully subjective method for assessing the video quality by end users. Furthermore, described the experiment results and data which collected for assessing perceived quality of multimedia by end users.

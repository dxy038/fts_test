The paper presents two approximate models for analysis of transient plane wave coupling to horizontal thin-wire conductor above two-layer soil. The first approach is based on quasi-static image theory and the second one is based on the transmission line theory. Our objective is to analyze the current distribution and the rms error that arises when using the proposed approximate models with respect to rigorous electromagnetic approach. Detailed parametric analysis indicates the applicability domain of the proposed approximate models in practical EMC studies.

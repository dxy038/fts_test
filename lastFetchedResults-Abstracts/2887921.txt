Image phylogeny deals with tracing back parent-child relationships among near duplicates, images that share the same semantic content. This approach results in a visual structure showing the inheritance of semantic content among images, called phylogeny tree. In this paper, we extend upon the image phylogenyÂ´s original formulation, which considers that an image may inherit content from only a single parent, to deal with situations whereby an image may inherit it from multiple different parents. Our objective is to find the multiple parenting relationships in a set of images, a problem which we refer to as multiple parenting phylogeny. The proposed solution works by first identifying near-duplicate groups and reconstructing their phylogenies; then among the found groups we determine the one(s) representing the composition images; finally, we detect the parenting relations between those compositions and the source images used to create them.

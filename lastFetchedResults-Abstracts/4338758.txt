Global climate change has become an indisputable objective fact. But climate change has significant regional difference, and water resource is the lifeblood of agriculture. Hence, on the basis of the impact study of global climate change on agriculture, strengthening the impact study of regional climate change on the agricultural irrigation water has very important practical significance. This study selected the large agricultural county of Shehong of Sichuan province as regional research object. It analyzed the impact of regional climate change on agricultural irrigation water and the impact of human factors outside climate change on agricultural irrigation water. The negative impact of climate change on agricultural irrigation water can be mitigated to some extent by human factors.

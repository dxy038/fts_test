Objective

Serial seizures occur commonly in inpatient epileptic children. This type ofseizure due to its characteristics has a significant impact on the patientâ€™s health.Untreated serial seizures lead to status epilepticus; therefore, finding a moreeffective treatment for such patients is essential. This study was performed tocompare the outcome of intermittent intravenous diazepam in the pediatricneurology clinic and intravenous midazolam in the pediatric intensive care unit(PICU), in order to introduce an alternative treatment for serail seizures.

Materials & Methods

In this study, 38 inpatient children aged 6 mo-15 years with refractory serialseizures were treated by first line antiepileptic drugs and then randomlytreated with either intermittent intravenous diazepam in the neurology ward orintravenous midazolam in PICU.

Results

Fourteen (70%) diazepam group patients and 13 (72.2%) midazolam grouppatients had good response to treatment, there was no significant differencebetween the two groups. Four midazolam group patients and two diazepamgroup patients needed mechanical ventilation and were intubated duringtreatment, with no significant difference between the two groups. Durationsof mechanical ventilation and PICU and hospital stay were not significantlydifferent between the two groups.

Conclusion

Intermittent intravenous diazepam is an effective alternative therapy formidazolam drip in the treatment of serial seizures due to similar therapeuticeffects and fewer side effects.

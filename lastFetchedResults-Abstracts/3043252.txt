The main objective of this paper is to show how a global approach combining EM simulations, classical circuit analysis and thermal analysis can be useful to help the design of complex modules. The module under test is an all integrated 40 Gb/s optoelectronic transmitter which combines MUX-driver-EAM in a single module, developed within the framework of the ERMIONE French RNRT project. We first present a 3D EM analysis and a classical circuit one of a part of the transmitter module. Then a rigorous thermal study applying a 3D finite element method is used in order to understand the thermal behavior of the module components. Finally, the ERMIONE transmitter was presented.

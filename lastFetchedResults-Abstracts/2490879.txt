Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontitis are inflammatory conditions with
a bidirectional association. This pilot study aimed to evaluate whether T2DM and glycemic control
interfere in inflammatory markers profiles in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in periodontitis patients.
Materials and Methods: Fourteen diabetic periodontitis patients were enrolled in this study, seven
with adequate glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]  < 8.0%) (DMA + P) and seven with
inadequate control (HbA1c ?8.0%) (DMI + P). Seven chronic periodontitis patients without diabetes
formed the control group (P). GCF was obtained from diseased sites (probing depth  > 6 mm) of
an entirely hemiarch, pooled and cytokines levels determined using multiplex beads immunoassay.
Clinical periodontal parameters were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test and levels of cytokines by
Kruskal-Wallis and Dunnâ€™s multiple comparison tests with confidence level of 95% (P  <  0.05).
Results: Cytokines profile of GCF obtained from deep periodontal pockets presented high levels
of inflammatory cytokines, and there were no statistical differences between levels of interleukin-6
(IL-6), IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-? according to presence of diabetes or percentage of HbA1c
among the groups, despite groups with T2DM and periodontitis exhibit higher levels of PD.
Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, inflammatory mediators in GCF are dependent
to the local response and do not correlate with the diabetic status.

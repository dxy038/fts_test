The Gaussian kernel has played a central role in multi-scale methods for feature extraction and matching. In this paper, a method for shaping the filter using the local image structure is presented. We propose an optimization formulation that densely estimates the filterÂ´s affine parameters by minimizing an objective constructed from differential feature responses and seek iterative, approximate solutions. A consequence of shaping the filters is affine invariance of the differential feature vector and it is shown that the shaped responses improve recognition performance.

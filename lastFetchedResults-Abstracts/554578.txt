This paper uses the Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) technique to investigate the damping
control function of an Interline Power Flow Controller
(IPFC) installed in a power system. For this purpose, the
linearized Herffron-Phillips model of a Single-Machine
Infinite Bus (SMIB) system is established and a
performance index which is defined based on the system
dynamics is applied as an objective function to evaluate
the potential of various IPFC control signals upon the
power systemâ€™s different operating conditions. The
results in time-domain simulation analysis reveals that
the designed PSO based IPFC controller tuned by the
proposed objective function has an excellent capability in
damping power system low frequency oscillations and
enhance greatly the dynamic stability of the power
systems. Moreover, the system performance analysis
under different operating conditions show that the m1
(magnitude of injected voltage) based controller is
superior to the other based controller.

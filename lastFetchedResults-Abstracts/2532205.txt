Objective(s): Over the past two decades, considerable interest has been focused on utilizing biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for biomedical applications. In this study, production of human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles using desolvation technique that were simultaneous loaded with high amounts of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and 5-flourouracil (5-FU) was investigated. Materials and Methods: 5-FU loading (%) and SPIONs entrapment efficiency (%) were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The design expert software used to analyse the interactive effects of pH, 5-FU and SPIONs concentrations. Results:The optimum conditions found to be pH of 8.2, drug concentration of 1.5 mg/ml and SPIONs concentration of 2.79 mg/ml. Under the mentioned optimum conditions, particles with the size of 111.8 nm, zeta potential of -37.1 mV, 5-FU loading of 15.8% and SPIONs entrapment efficiency of 41.1% were obtained. In vitro cumulative release of 5-FU from the nanoparticles was evaluated in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Results indicated that 85% of the 5-FU released during 95 h, which revealed a sustained release profile. In addition, Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) analyses confirmed the superparamagnetic properties of magnetic albumin nanoparticles manufactured under the optimum conditions. Conclusion: According to the findings,SPIONs and 5-FU loaded HAS  nanoparticles arepromising for use as  novel targeted delivery system due to proper magnetic and drug release behaviours.

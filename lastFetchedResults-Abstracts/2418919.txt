Differential evolution (DE) is a simple but powerful evolutionary optimization algorithm with continually outperforming many of the already existing stochastic and direct search global optimization techniques. DE algorithm is a new optimization method that can handle non-differentiable, non-linear, and multimodal objective functions. This paper presents an efficient modified differential evolution (MDE) algorithm for solving optimal power flow (OPF) with non-smooth and non-convex generator fuel cost curves. Modifications in mutation rule are suggested to the original DE algorithm, that enhance its rate of convergence with a better solution quality. A six-bus and the IEEE 30 bus test systems with three different types of generator cost curves are used for testing and validation purposes. Simulation results demonstrate that MDE algorithm provides very remarkable results compared to those reported recently in the literature.

Abstract Background 
Prevention of myocardial siderosis is a key step to reduce rate of mortality in thalassemic patients. Our objective was to study association between echocardiography parameters and serum ferritin level in patients with major thalassemia. Materials and Methods 
Sixty-six patients with major thalassemia were studied in Amir Kabir hospital, Arak, Iran. Serum ferritin levels were measured during 3 months in patients with no symptoms of infection. It was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Ejection Fraction (EF), Fractional Shortening (FS) and Early/Late ratio (E/A) were studied by echocardiography.
Results 
Fifty two percent were female and 48% were male. Mean age was 16 ± 9 years and the age range was3-26years. Mean serum ferritin level was1912 ± 1748 ng/dl and its range was from 303 to 8333 ng/dl. There were significant correlations between serum ferritin level and EF(r=0.3 and P=0.05) and also between serum ferritin level and FS. 
Conclusion
 Due to significant association between serum ferritin level and echo parameters, it is beneficial that all patients with major thalassemia undergo echocardiography to gain better understating about cardiac function.

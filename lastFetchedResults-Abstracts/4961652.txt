For the search task in a circular region of multiple mobile robots, the paper put forward covering-feature of search environment and formation integrity as two objective functions for multiple robots. Searching region area and the distance between formation geometric center of multiple robots and the circular region center were used to express quantitative indexes to the two above objective functions. Meanwhile, it took collision avoidance of static obstacles and motion coordination among multiple robots as restrictions. Then it established multi-objective planning model of search paths for multiple mobile robots. Evaluative functions of multi-objective optimization were established by fuzzy theory. Finally, several groups of simulation show that the planning model can fulfill search task in objective region effectively.

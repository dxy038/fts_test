Software systems are becoming more and more complex due to the integration of large scale distributed entities and the continuous evolution of these new infrastructures. All these systems are progressively integrated in our daily environment and their increasing importance have raised a dependability issue. While Service oriented architecture is providing a good level of abstraction to deal with the complexity and heterogeneity of these new infrastructures, current approaches are limited in their ability to monitor and ensure the system dependability. In this paper, we propose a framework for the autonomic management of service oriented application based on a dependability objective. Our framework proposes a novel approach which leverages peer to peer evaluation of service providers to assess the system dependability. Based on this evaluation, we propose various strategies to dynamically adapt the system to maintain the dependability level of the system to the desired objective.

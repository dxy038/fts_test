The failure of companies in product development process has led them into presenting
new methods to challenge this problem today. These companies can not produce
product and like before expect public attention; rather they have to make sure about
product success to some extent before its real launch. In this study along with designing
a conceptual model, a Bayesian model was presented in which framework customer
suggestions was changed into product development ideas and used as a basis
for risk aversion. For the first thing to do, mobile cellphone was chosen as the research
product and then using hypothesis tests the relationship between product total
objective characteristics and subjective attributes was measured. The results showed
relationship between product objective characteristics and customer subjective inferences
and both of them with purchase likelihood. In addition to that, with the aid of
Bayesian methods, different respondents interests in mentioned characteristics was
determined and classified into different demographic groups.

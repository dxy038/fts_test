Background and Objective: Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile multisystem vasculitis syndrome. This study designed to assess clinical and laboratory findings of children diagnosed as Kawasaki disease hospitalized in two major pediatrics departments of Abuzar and Golestan hospitals affiliated to Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences. Subjects and Methods: According to the criteria of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for Kawasaki disease, all children who were diagnosed as Kawasaki from Oct 2001 to Apr 2004 were enrolled. History taking, physical examination and laboratory assessment were performed and standard treatment was carried out. Echocardiography was performed for all patients at the time of diagnosis and two weeks later.
Results: Twenty five subjects had the definite diagnosis of Kawasaki. The mean age was 30 ±19.55 month; male/female ratio was 1.77: 1. Hospitalization was more frequent in winter season, especially in January. The most common presenting symptom (except fever) was maculopapular rash and the most common diagnostic criteria was bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis. Leukocytosis with polymorphonuclear predominance, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive CRP were present in patients in acute phase of the disease.
The mean serum hemoglobin level was 10.4 g/dl before treatment. The mean platelet count
2 • 2 rose from 418000/mm in acute phase to 621000/mm in convalescence period (P<0.05). Six
of 25 patients (24%) showed coronary involvement all mild coronary artery ectasia- in
echocardiography. Laboratory findings were not differed statistically between the groups with
and without coronary artery involvement (P>0.05).
Conclusion: Clinical and laboratory findings of Kawasaki in this area is similar to other centers and were not affected with coronary artery involvement. Sci Med J 2011; 9(6):543-552

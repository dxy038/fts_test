Health effects of human-body exposure to the near field of a mobile communication device have been investigated with knowledge of the electromagnetic power absorption in human heads during cellular-telephone use. One of the most powerful numerical calculation methods for biological electromagnetic compatibility (Bio-EMC) problems is the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. However accurate models of curved structures, which are closely related to the antenna characteristics, are difficult to realize in the FDTD method. Because recent devices have more complex antennas, it is not easy to precisely evaluate dose characteristics in the human body exposed to the near field from such devices by only using the FDTD method. The objective of this study is to establish a numerical hybrid method combining the advantage of different numerical calculation methods such as the MoM/FDTD method proposed in the literature in order to accurately analyze the complex Bio-EMC problem. In this paper, novel iteration procedures are introduced into the previously reported hybrid MoM/FDTD method. We also show the validity of application of this method to Bio-EMC problems.

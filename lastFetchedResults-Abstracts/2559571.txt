This paper reports new findings on how financial ratios and risk factors of corporations
are correlated with cash holdings in Korea and Malaysia. Financial risk and risk factor
effects of low cash holding firms and high cash holding firms are similar in both stock
exchanges. The means of all variables are higher in high cash holdings firms. The
significant results in the form of higher values of financial ratios and risk factors are
related to the objective of meeting liquidity needs of firms by providing flexibility to meet
uncertainties in the demand for cash flows in the future. The lagged cash flow variables
have a significant impact on current cash holdings. Liquidity and repayment ability in
Korea and low cash holdings firms in Malaysia have similar findings. These findings add
new insights into how cash holding size is associated with key firm-specific and economic
factors such as exchange rates and inflation factors.

Describes a system able to support managers in their bidding process. Our objective is to develop a system supporting decision makers during this process. Managers need information concerning products and associated processes involved in the system development. This system is developed during the European ESPRIT project DECIDE (DECIsion support for optimal biDding in a competitive business Environment). The objective of this project is to develop a generic toolkit to support bidders in their negotiation process for innovative products or services. This process could be divided into different sub-tasks: price evaluation, cost evaluation, utility analysis of a product and designing a technical solution for a product taking into account the process required to elaborate this solution. We focus on the last part of this process. Our objective is to build a prototype which allows bidders to design a technical solution very easily taking into account previous solutions related to another bid

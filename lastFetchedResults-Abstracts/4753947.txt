The MODIS BRDF and albedo science data product (MOD43B) has been providing provisional quality products to the science community since October 2000. The operational algorithm relies on multi-date MODIS observations and a semi-empirical kernel-based bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to provide global one kilometer measures of BRDF, albedo (spectral and broadband) and nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR)

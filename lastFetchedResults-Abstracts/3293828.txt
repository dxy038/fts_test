The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is the fundamental access method defined in the IEEE 802.11 Standard for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). With this standard, the Access Point (AP) and the mobile stations consume a significant amount of energy to contend for access to the shared wireless channel. In order to improve the energy efficiency of WLANs, we investigate in this paper a simple and backwards compatible mechanism, called Bi-Directional DCF (BD-DCF), that enables bidirectional communications between wireless stations with a single channel access invocation. The key idea is to let the AP or any mobile station transmit a data packet together with the acknowledgement upon the successful reception of a data packet. This approach reduces the communication overhead, the channel contention, and better balances uplink and downlink transmission opportunities. We evaluate the performance of the proposed BD-DCF by means of computer-based simulation considering different traffic loads, degrees of traffic symmetry, data packet sizes, and data rates. The results presented in this paper show that the BD-DCF protocol can improve the energy efficiency of DCF up to 50%.

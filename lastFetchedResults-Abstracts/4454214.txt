In this paper, an approach based on the particle swarm optimization is used to multi-objective optimize the global compliance and global condition index of the 4PUS-RPU mechanism. The kinematic analysis of the mechanism is first analyzed. Then the compliance model of the mechanism is derived and the sum of the leading diagonal elements of the compliance matrix, which is also known as the global compliance, is used as a criterion to evaluate the mechanismÂ´s rigidity. Secondly, the global condition index, which is derived based on the Monte Carlo method, is used as a criterion to evaluate the workspace of the mechanism. Increasing the workspace of mechanism will increase the compliance of the mechanism; here the global compliance and the global condition index of the mechanism are optimized simultaneously based on the particle swarm optimization. Finally the optimized results are analyzed and compared.

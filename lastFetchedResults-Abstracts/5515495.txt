The Discrete-Event Modeling and Simulation (DEVS) formalism has been successfully used to model systems whose behavioral state changes based on trigger events. The purpose of this project is to explore the extension of DEVS beyond the modeling of event driven systems, focusing on the application of DEVS to changes in human behavior as driven by emergency events. The objective is to build a modeling and simulation framework for human behavior in emergencies that could easily be extended and built upon in the future. Here we introduce the development of a suite of Cell-DEVS models representing aspects of human behaviors, and the simulation and a detailed analysis of this suite of models. This suite of models explored random and controlled human behaviors, as well as implementing psychological conditions such as herd following. The end state is the development of a repository for these models to serve the DEVS community.

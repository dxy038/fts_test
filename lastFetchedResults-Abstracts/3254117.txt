Classical objective of wind turbine control is to maximize the power extracted from wind. However, with the increase in wind turbine size the structural loads become a limiting factor for safe wind turbine operation and wind turbine operating life. In this paper we investigate the design of a model predictive controller that reduces wind turbine loads at the expense of wind turbine power variability. By appropriate tuning of the model predictive controller we show that the trade-off between load reduction and power variations is favorable.

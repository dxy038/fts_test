This paper describes and analyzes a new concept for transmitting file-based services (podcasts) via broadcast networks to mobile terminals. Since podcast services do not rely on a bidirectional network connection during execution, this service type is well-suited for a unidirectional broadcast deployment. However, due to the heterogeneous terminal capabilities of mobile terminals, it is necessary to adapt the file-based services to different types of services. This is achieved by following a modular broadcast podcast concept which subdivides file-based services into self-contained modules. Depending on the particular capabilities of the terminal, predefined sets of modules forming service profiles may be selectively received by the devices. First, the paper introduces the concept of podcast transmission via broadcast networks, followed by the description of a service modularization example. Based on the example, the performance of the transmission concept is analyzed and compared to other non-modular broadcast transmission concepts. Finally, a short description of the terminal software platform is given.

Climate change is becoming one of the most important challenges facing our generation. Many industries and enterprises have begun steps for carbon emissions reduction and management. Manufacturing and industrial processes produce large amounts of greenhouse gas and use more electricity than any other sector, which push manufacturing enterprises to apply renewable energy to mitigate emissions from their production and operations. This paper addresses a low-carbon production scheduling problem considering renewable energy. A low-carbon production scheduling system architecture is proposed. A mathematical model of the addressed problem is presented with the objective of minimizing the total carbon emissions during the whole planning horizon. A low-carbon production scheduling algorithm of the addressed problem is designed. Computational experiments have demonstrated the proposed low-carbon production scheduling considering renewable energy.

Targeting at our countryÂ´s Civil Engineering experiment teaching situation, we searched and developed the Civil Engineering Virtual Experimental Platform based on the guiding ideology of using virtual experiment instead of traditional real experiment. The development is under the guidance of Iterative Development and based on unified modeling language (UML). Each iteration accords to the process from business modeling, system analysis, system design to system implementation. We complete the work by many times iterations. The plat realized the simulation of real experiment is by the interaction of the Plat and user. Taking concrete compressive strength test for an example, we introduced the whole process. Comparing with real experiment, the Civil Engineering Virtual Experimental Platform has advantages of saving resources, being repeatable and having no objective condition limitations. The Plat has been used in practical teaching and achieved good effect. It has significance on Civil Engineering practical teaching and wide application prospect.

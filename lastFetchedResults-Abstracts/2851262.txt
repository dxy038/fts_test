Nowadays, development and advancement of industrial control systems play an important role in efficiency and performance improvement of industrial systems. In this paper, the control system of greenhouse electrical lighting by using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is studied. Optimization of the mentioned control system based on Real-Time Pricing (RTP) of electricity in the smart grid can be improved efficiency and performance of greenhouse lighting system as an industrial application is investigated. Using the multi-objective optimization versus the single-objective optimization has more justification due to variety of objective functions in the mentioned application. Moreover, it increases choices for Decision Makers (DMs) in the system design. The simulation results verify a significant improvement of control system output characteristics, performance indices, solution choices and flexibility by using the multi-objective optimization approach.

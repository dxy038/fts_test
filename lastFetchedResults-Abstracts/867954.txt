This paper describes a conceptually simple but practical business planning method to cope with uncertain information. The model is constructed by a set of possible scenarios and divided into multiple objective functions. Although the resulting model is more complex than traditional stochastic programs, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to offset the difficulties pertaining to the stochastic and multiobjective programming problems. The method provides a wider range of possible solutions. Then the decision maker selects the least conflicting solution among scenarios by incorporating any additional information regarding the problem. An interactive multiobjective programming approach based on a circumscribed ellipsoid interior point algorithm is proposed as an efficient method to solve the problem.

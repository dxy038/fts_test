Based on bidirectional lamp tracking and utilizing performances of Monte Carlo method, A novel algorithm is proposed here which makes it easy for an user to simulate the bright region of lamp-source on the testing screen. Comparing with the forward lamp integral method, this model is not only applicable to reflectors of any figure but also far more rapid than using forward working. Simulations show that this algorithm is not only effective but also feasible.

Objective: Type D personality is based on negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI). The purpose
of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Persian version of 14-item Type D personality
scale (DS14).
Methods: The study included 191 normal participants and 176 patients with myocardial infarction (MI).
They all filled out the Persian version of DS14, containing 7-item NA and SI subscales; 71 normal subjects
completed the neuroticism and extroversion subscales of Eysenck questionnaire. Besides, 71 participants filled
out the DS14 twice over a 2-month period.
Results: In this study, 35.8 % of MI patients and 24.6% of healthy people were classified as Type D. Factor
analysis of Persian version of DS14 yielded the two-factor structure; all of the NA and SI items loaded between
0.65 to 0.80 in patients and 0.48 to 0.79 in healthy people on their corresponding factor. Testâ€“retest stability of
the NA and the SI subscales were 0.86 and 0.77 respectively over a 2-month period. High internal consistency of
Cronbach's alpha coefficient has been found to be 0.84 in patients and 0.87 in healthy people for the NA subscale
and 0.86 in patients and 0.75 in healthy people for the SI sub-scale. The construct validity of NA and SI
sub scales were confirmed against neuroticism (r = 0.65) and extroversion (r = -0.62) subscales of Eysenck
questionnaire respectively.
Conclusion: Persian version of DS14 is an acceptable, reliable and valid measure of dimensions of Type D
personality.

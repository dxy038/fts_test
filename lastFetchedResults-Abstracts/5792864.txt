Multi-objective optimization aims at simultaneously optimizing two or more objectives of a problem. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are widely accepted and useful for solving real world multi-objective problems. When we have two or more conflicting objectives of a problem then we can apply MOEA. MOEA generates a set of non-dominated solutions at the end of run, which is called Pareto set. The Pareto front contains set of Pareto solutions. Any MOEA aims to improve (i) convergence of population towards true Pareto front and (ii) diversity of solutions belonging to Pareto set. Generally, an external archive is used by MOEAs to maintain a set of non-dominated Pareto set solutions. Sometimes, Pareto set contains more number of solutions than the size of archive. This paper presents survey of various methods used by different MOEAs for reducing the size of Pareto set while maintaining solutions diversity. It presents comparison of these methods along with their advantages and disadvantages. The paper concludes by giving limitation of crowding distance based method in various scenarios.

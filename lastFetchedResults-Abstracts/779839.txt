The International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) is a
specialized institute of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The objective is to make
IIEP’s databases interoperable (in-house databases which include
activity records, grey literature documents, institutional archives
and the external bibliographic database) to allow the user to optimally
retrieve resources. Initially, methodology used was based
on an FRBRER model. To account for the processes of time and
the complexity of the levels of work, FRBROO and CIDOC (Comit´e
international pour la documentation) Conceptual Resource Model
(CRM) were envisaged. Finally, an FRBROO model was developed.

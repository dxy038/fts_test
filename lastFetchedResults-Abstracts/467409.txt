Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, side-effect profile, and follow-up rates in women who obtain a medical abortion in a nonresearch setting. Study Design: From December 1, 2000, to June 30, 2001, we prospectively followed 218 women who had been evaluated in our private office for medical abortion. Women received either mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 1 to 2 days later by self-administered misoprostol 800 μg vaginally or methotrexate 50 mg/m2 intramuscularly followed 3 to 7 days later by self-administered misoprostol 800 μg vaginally. Results: Of the 174 women who had a medical abortion, 148 women (85%) chose mifepristone/misoprostol, and 26 women (15%) chose methotrexate/misoprostol. In women up to 49 days of gestation, complete abortion occurred by the first follow-up visit in 82 of 86 women (95%; 95% CI, 89-99) and in 21 of 25 women (84%; 95% CI, 64-95) women, respectively. In women who used mifepristone/misoprostol from 50 to 63 days of gestation, complete abortions occurred in 56 of 59 women (95%; 95% CI, 86-99) women. Four women (2%; 95% CI, 1-6) were lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Medical abortion with mifepristone/misoprostol and with methotrexate/misoprostol can be provided in a nonresearch setting with efficacy similar to that reported in the medical literature for research protocols.

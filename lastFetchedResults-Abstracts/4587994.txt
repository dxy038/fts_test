The paper presents a novel structure for operator of vacuum load-disconnection switch. The fundamental principles and features of this new design are discussed in detail. This is a multiple objective optimization problem, and generic algorithm method is used for the design. It is shown that generic algorithm based optimal design for operator of vacuum load-disconnection switch is feasible and effective, as confirmed by practical design and analysis.

Currently available video traces for scalable encoded video with more than one layer are a convenient representation of the encoded video for the evaluation of networking mechanisms. The video distortion (RMSE) or quality (PSNR) for individual video frames in these traces, however, only allow for the calculation of the video quality of correctly received video frames. For lossy network transport, only a rough approximation can be made. The objective video quality is typically calculated as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) between the unencoded original video data and the encoded and subsequently decoded video data.

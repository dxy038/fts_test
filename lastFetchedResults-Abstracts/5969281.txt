Through the analysis and study on the problem about JIT procurement of enterprise group, a JIT procurement and supply model structure of enterprise group was constructed, and JIT procurement mathematical model which is based on procurement cost and delivery time was also founded. On the basis of adaptive genetic algorithm, an original algorithm for multi-constraint JIT procurement mathematical model which chose the procurement cost and delivery time as the optimization objective was proposed. Finally the algorithm is applied to solve the practical problem and the solving result verifies the validity and efficiency of the model and the solving algorithm.

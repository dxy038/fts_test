A novel multi-band image interpolation method is proposed. It recovers the final image based on Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) rule by using the multi-band image information. Both sub-image features and the multi-band cross-correlated information are used for the estimation. Then we demonstrate the decomposition models which could generate highly-correlated sub-images achieve good performance when adopted in our method. Our method not only considers the properties in sub-images, but incorporates the correlated characteristics among decomposed images in multiple bands, which outperforms conventional single image MMSE estimation methods. Both subjective and objective experimental results prove the validity of our method used in image interpolation.

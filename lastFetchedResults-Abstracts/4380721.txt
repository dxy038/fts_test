An energy distribution network is a critical infrastructure that any compromise has an enormous impact on daily lives and the economy. The objective of this work is a computerized tool for distributed monitoring, dynamic re-configuration and control of DC distribution topology. This paper describes the double bar bus DC system exploiting the event-driven, service-oriented architecture, and real-time metering with nonuniform time sampling as an example of neighborhood optimization. We build a system with the capability to assess the resilience of and to rebuild better resilient grid partitions at run-time. The result is an intelligent system distributing loads between two buses dynamically in a way to keep self-sustainable and/or non-interruptible portion running at one bus by moving few other loads to the second bus. In standalone modality, the tool assesses the survivability of microgrid with high penetration of renewable energy. Running in cooperation with grid management tools, the same software can reconfigure optimally the local topology at run-time.

The objective of this study was to develop a practical numerical calculation model for the &#8220;rainfall-runoff&#8221; process at the hilly-gully region in the Loess Plateau of China. Field survey on topographic and geographic conditions and hydrological observation were carried out at the Liudaogou Basin located at the northern Loess Plateau. Kinematic wave model was applied to develop a numerical calculation model for the &#8220;rainfall-runoff&#8221; process and the model was applied to the observed data and verified. Validation of the numerical method results indicated the practical value of the proposed numerical calculation method for the &#8220;rainfall-runoff&#8221; process at the hilly-gully region in the Loess Plateau.

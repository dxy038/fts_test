The objective of this study was to determine the magnitude of microbial functional potential and community structure between three different WWTPs using the Lorenz curve method and to find the effect of seasonal variation on patterns of substrate utilization. Lorenz curve method was sensitive enough to detect short-term changes in microbial functional diversity between Riqqa, Umm Al-Haiman and Al-Jahra activated sludge systems and showed seasonal variations of the utilized carbon sources. Gini coefficient ranged from 0.21 to 0.8. Lorenz curves seemed particularly suitable to present microbial heterogeneity in term of inequality and to highlight the relative contribution of low-and high functional diversity for the three different types of mixed liquors. Correlation analysis of the experimental data show that the complement of the Gini coefficient was strongly and positively correlated with the Shannon index (rxy = 0.89), evenness (rxy = 0.91), and AWCD (rxy = 0.95) at the 95% level of significance (Î± = 0.05).

Home is the initial need of human and settlement is a basic requirement in human communities. Since past times, it was the aspiration of human to meet these needs suitably and to some extent has always challenged human communities and has made changes in its different dimensions.  These changes in from, design, material and knowledge of settlement construction are going to be investigated. The purpose of this research is to assess the adaptation of new construction with the indigenous architecture and also the satisfaction rate of the people for the new architecture. So, in line with approaching the objective of this research, the economic, sanitary, stability, cultural, functional and physical components of both categories for new and indigenous housing have been taken into consideration. Our statistical community is the villages of the central part of Delfan County. About 17 villages of more than 50 households where the new construction have taken place are accidentally selected. In the meantime, by using cuchran formula, sample volume of 133 heads of family was chosen. In line with assessing the adaptation of new constructions with indigenous architecture and also studying the peopleâ€™s satisfaction of new architecture, the T test, vilkakson test and also way analysis model were used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of categories on new architecture. The results of Vilkakson test show that in all categories except for the compatibility with the social situation of family from cultural category, there is no adaptation in new constructions and local architecture. Also the T test shows that people have satisfaction with the physical, stability and sanitary categories in new construction but are not satisfied with the cultural, economic and functional categories. Finally, the way analysis test shows that cultural category has had the most direct effect and the economic category has had the most indirect effect on new construction.

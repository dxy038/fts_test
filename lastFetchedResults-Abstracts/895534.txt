
Objective: Methoxsalen is a natural photoactive compound which is found in many seed
plants. A number of epidermal proliferative disorders can be treated by methoxsalen along
with long wave ultraviolet A (UVA).   
Materials and Methods: In an experimental study, we aimed to demonstrate the effect
of methoxsalen, UVA and their combination on oogenesis Balb/C mice. There were two
experimental groups and a control group. The experimental groups were composed of i.
a short term group with treatment duration of 15 days and ii. a long term group with treatment
duration of 5 weeks. Both the long term and short term experimental groups
were
further
subdivided
into a UVA
group, a methoxsalen group
and a methoxsalen plus
UVA

group.
After
treatment, mature females
in
prosterus
phase
of
ovarian cycle
were
scarified

with
ether,
while their ovaries were removed and prepared for histological studies.
Results: Both macro and microscopic studies showed significant anomalies (p < 0.05)
among experimental group ovaries as compared to control group. The obtained results
showed a significant decrease in the following factors:  number and diameter of

corpus
lutei, Graafian follicles, diameter of granulosa cell layer and oocytes, number

of

primordialØŒand primary and growing follicles, while we observed an increase in
number of atretic follicle. Furthermore, our findings confirmed an increase in theca
diameter only through UVA treatment. Methoxsalen also reduced circulating estrogen
levels in blood serum, significantly. Other cases of teratogenecity, such as follicles
with three oocytes and disorganization in corpus luteum cells were observed. 
Conclusion: The result suggests that UVA, methoxsalen and their combination cause
health problems and cell injuries.

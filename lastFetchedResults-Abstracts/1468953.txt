Introduction: Metabolic syndrome is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of dairy products plays an important role in prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome. The objective of this review article is to examine the relation between dairy intake and its nutrients with metabolic syndrome and its components. Material and Methods: The key words “dairy”, “calcium”, “milk” with “metabolic syndrome”, “cardiovascular disease”, “obesity”, “type 2 diabetes”, “hypertension”, “oxidative stress”, “inflammation” were used for a search in the pub med database between 2000-2013. Appropriately designed epidemiological and interventional studies and review articles of quality were included. Results: Most studies showed that dairy consumption is inversely associated with metabolic syndrome and its components. Calcium, proteins, bioactive peptides and dairy fatty acids have protective effects on the metabolic syndrome. The main mechanism of calcium causing a decrease in a risk of metabolic syndrome is attributed to regulation of calcitrophic hormones, binding with bile acids, increased fecal fat excretion, regulation of intracellular calcium and change the metabolism of other electrolytes such as sodium. Milk protein, especially whey protein caused improved lipid profiles, hypertension, insulin sensitivity. Dairy fatty acids also improve oxidative stress, inflammation, inhibition of liver transcription factor and activates lipogenesis genes. Conclusions: Increased consumption of dairy products can decrease the incidence and development of metabolic syndrome and its components.

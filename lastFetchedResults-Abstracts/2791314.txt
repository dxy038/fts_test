In this study, target at sea detection is addressed using Hybrid Polarity (HP) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) architecture. Wave polarimetry concepts are used to define HP features that are used to observe targets at sea. The sensitivity of HP features to both targets and the surrounding environment is analyzed through some objective norms, namely the Figure-of-Merit (FoM), the sensitivity to the background variability, the dependence on sea state and targetÂ´s characteristics. Experiments undertaken on HP measurements emulated from Radarsat-2 and ALOS-PALSAR full-polarimetric actual SAR data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HP approach and the different sensitivity of HP features to targets and background sea characteristics. Following those results, a ranking the HP features performance is proposed which mainly highlights that HP features complement each other in the detection process. Finally, a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) approach is proposed to exploit two HP features for target detection in a unsupervised way.

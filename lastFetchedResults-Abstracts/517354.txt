The experimental study objective was the development ofchewable tablets with the calcium complex association, the minerals and vi-tamin D3for children, subject to the rules as stipulated by the RomanianPharmacopoeiaXthedition. Generating sources of calcium, used as raw ma-terials in the preparation of these tablets are natural products represented bycomplex mineral rich in calcium - LactovalR °HiCal (ratio of calcium and phos-phorus is 2,2:1, report the same as breast milk) and 30% bovine colostrums[1, 3], making the absorption of calcium should be increased. Also, in order to¯x and better absorb calcium in the body was added to make the preparationof these chewable tablets and vitaminD3.Was chosen as a method of preparing direct compression. Excipients fordirect compression are diluents-binder-disaggregated. They are unitary ex-cipients or co-processed products, multi-processed excipients together to meetthose properties: microcrystalline cellulose (Vivapur 102) Ludipress, lactose(Tablettose 80), Kollidon CL Isomalt DC 100. Was also added to a lubricant(magnesium stearate) and sweetener and °avoring to carry out the preparationof tablets and after 30 days as provided Romanian PharmacopoeiaXthand its2001 supplement, which comprises: organoleptic control, uniformity of weight,strength, disintegration and their friability. Working method chosen and makethe appropriate choice leads to tablets in terms of quality standards o±cinal

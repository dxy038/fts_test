The authors developed an integrated field TIR (thermal infrared) measurement system and methodology for validating land-surface temperature (LST) algorithms prepared for generating the EOS (Earth Observing System) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LST product. The system has been used for measurements of spectral TIR BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function)/emissivity and surface temperature of terrestrial materials in laboratory and field campaigns. The authorsÂ´ validation results indicate that it is possible to validate LST within 1&#176;K in favorable atmospheric and surface conditions

The objective of this project was to study the effects of salinity and dryness on germination and seedling establishment of two species namely Elymus junceus and Kochia prostrata under glasshous condition. For this purpose, two separate
trials were established using a split plot design. The different levels of salinity and irrigation duration were assigned as main plots and sub plots respectively. The first trail was conducted on a salty soil with four different salinity levels as 0.0, 6.78, 13.26, 18.4 milimol/cm and the second one was conducted on a unsalty soil comprising 25% manure, 25% sand and 50% field soil. In the first trial normal water was used for irrigation but for artificial ones the irrigation water was treated with NaCl and CaCl2 the same level of salinity in the first trial. The irritation interval was 10, 15 and 20 days.The effects of salinity on germination were determined in the first 14 days and later on the drought treatments in both trials were studied on seedlings. Three characters namely: germination percent taye, seedling growing and seedling weights were measured.The results showed that salinity and dryness decreased seedling growing and seedling weight in two species.Elymus junceus was more resistance to salinity and dryness effects than the other one. In 13.26,
18.4 milmoh/cm salinity levels no seeds germinated. In conclusion two species germinated in normal soil.

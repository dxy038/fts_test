Objectives: Previous work has demonstrated diffusion of the monomer triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) from resin composite through dentine in vitro. The objective of the present work was to examine monomer diffusion from bonding resins and resin composites used in combination.

Methods: Occlusal cavities were prepared in tooth crowns and restored with bonding resin-resin composite combinations. Aqueous samples from the ‘pulpal chamber’ of each tooth were removed at timed intervals for analysis by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.

Results: Bonding resins contributed to monomer diffusion. A TEDGMA-containing bonding resin used in combination with a TEGDMA-containing resin composite hastened and increased TEGDMA diffusion through dentine. A 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)-containing bonding resin used in combination with a TEGDMA-containing resin composite reduced TEGDMA diffusion only slightly compared with the resin composite alone and added substantial diffusion of HEMA.

Conclusion: The bonding resins tested contributed to monomer passage to the pulp space and did not prevent movement of monomer from resin composites to the pulp.

This paper proposes a multi-objective trajectory optimization method to be used in the planning of environmentally efficient commercial aircraft trajectories. The problem of finding environmentally efficient trajectories is treated as an optimal control problem that is solved by applying a direct method of trajectory optimisation. The method involves an inverse trajectory parameterisation technique, methods for the calculation of environmental objectives, and the use of a multiobjective version of the Differential Evolution algorithm. The principal benefit of the method relative to previous work is that it allows the fast generation of Pareto optimal fronts between several competing objectives. This allows the decision maker to make informed decisions about potential trade-offs between different environmental goals.

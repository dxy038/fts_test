The paper aims at analyzing a possible evolution of the Italian power generation mix. A scenario, ranging to 2030, has been analyzed in order to focus on the Italian energy policy whose long-term objective is a &#8220;25-25-50&#8221; electric energy generation mix (25% renewable sources, 25% nuclear and 50% fossil fuels). This scenario analysis has been carried out using the multi-regional model MATISSE (Markal-TIMES based) of the Italian power system. In this paper, the results of the study will be presented, showing, in line with the three &#8220;pillars&#8221; of the EU policy, how reaching the nuclear and renewable (RES) development targets affects fossil fuel dependency (security of supply), production costs (competitiveness) and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (sustainability).

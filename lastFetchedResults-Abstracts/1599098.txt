Objective: Thyroid dysfunction complicates the metabolic derangement observed in Diabetes Mellitus (DM). It is necessary to recognize and treat it, when present, in order to achieve stability of metabolic control in these patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DM on thyroid hormone levels and other biochemical variables.
Materials and Methods: To determine the incidence of abnormal thyroid hormone levels in diabetics in Nepalgunj medical college and Hospital (Nepal), blood samples from 100 diabetic subjects and 100 non-diabetic controls were taken between 1st February, 2012 to 31st January, 2013 for investigation of free triidothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum cholesterol,  serum triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), blood urea, serum creatinine, total protein, albumin, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). 
Results: Our findings showed that the level of FT3 and FT4 were significantly lower while the level of TSH was significantly higher in type 2 diabetics as compared to non-diabetics. From the 100 diabetic subjects that were studied, 29% showed abnormal thyroid hormone levels (24% hypothyroidism and 5% hyperthyroidism).The incidence of hypothyroidism was more in females (16%) as compared to males (8%) in type 2 diabetes.
Conclusion: Failure to recognize the presence of these abnormal thyroid hormone levels in diabetics may be a primary cause of poor management often encountered in some treated diabetics.

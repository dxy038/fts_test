This paper presents a review of optimization techniques for Renewable Energy Resources (RERs) optimization framework. Review of probabilistic power flow, voltage/VAR control, modeling of voltage VAR problem has been presented. Various objective functions and formulations for Voltage/VAR problem has been presented in this paper. Summary of different OPF methods and their formulations for voltage / VAR problem has been presented. Various examples of stochastic programming using Recourse model, Simple Average Approximations, Chance Constrained Programming and chance constraint are presented in this paper.

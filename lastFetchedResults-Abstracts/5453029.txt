The paper adopts "adaptive inverse control (AIC)" algorithm to correct the output current waveform of the voltage source inverter in the active power filter (APF). Generally the goal of the control theory is to make a given dynamical system behave in a user-specified manner as accurately as possible. This objective may be broken down into two separate tasks: control of plant dynamics and control of plant disturbance. Conventionally, one uses feedback to treat both two problems simultaneously. Compromises are necessary to achieve good solutions. "Adaptive inverse control" presents such a new concept to treat the two control tasks separately without compromise. All of the required operations are based on adaptive filtering techniques. In this paper adaptive inverse control is used to correct the output current waveform of the voltage source inverter, and filtered-x LMS adaptive inverse control algorithm is used to identify the parameters and design the controllers. It demonstrates that the adaptive inverse control system can adapt to the variance of the electric network and would be more predominant than the conventional control strategies.

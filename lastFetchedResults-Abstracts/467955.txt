OBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that cesarean section improves the long-term neurologic outcome of children with meningomyelocele. On the basis of this belief, a trial of labor is not offered in many centers. We hypothesized that there is no difference in immediate or long-term outcome by route of delivery for the fetus with meningomyelocele delivered in a tertiary care center.
STUDY DESIGN: All fetuses (n = 60) with meningomyelocele delivered at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between 1971 and 1995 were analyzed. Thirty-six cases were available for long-term follow-up. Motor, sensory, and anatomic levels were converted to a numeric scale. Variables were compared by one-way analysis of variance, χ2 analysis, and Fisher’s exact test with significance at P< .05.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences by route of delivery for gestational age of delivery, birth weight, meningomyelocele size, or neonatal mortality (vaginal: 1/22 = 4.5%, cesarean section: 2/17 = 11.8%, P = .82). An antenatal diagnosis was made with similar frequency in the two groups (vaginal: 15/21 = 71.4%, cesarean section: 13/15 = 86.7%). In addition, the length of long-term follow-up was similar (vaginal: 54.7 ± 11.1 months, cesarean section: 33.7 ± 8.6 months). There was no difference in long-term neurologic outcome as determined by the change in motor level, the change in sensory level, or when comparing the final motor level with the anatomic level.
CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to detect differences between either immediate or long-term outcome for the infant with isolated meningomyelocele when stratified by route of delivery. A multicenter randomized trial should be required before the acceptance of cesarean section as the optimal route of delivery for the fetus with meningomyelocele.

In order to meet South Africa´s future electricity demand, Eskom has initiated a process to evaluate the feasibility of various power generation options. Coal fired generating options are envisaged to remain a fundamental part of South Africa´s power generation options. ISEP (integrated strategic electricity planning) indicated that new base load power generation will be required no later than 2011 to accommodate expected future loads. Eskom Transmission Investment Committee was thus requested to issue a budget cost estimate for the transmission infrastructure required to integrate Bravo Power Station Scheme into the Eskom Transmission network. To derive the required cost estimate, a feasibility study was to be done. Bravo Power Station Scheme will be located about 15 km North of Kendal Power Station in the Eskom generation pool. It is expected that Bravo would consist of either 4200 MW or 5400 MW generating capacity; i.e. 6times700 MW units or 6times900 MW units. This paper will present results of the study that was done to determine the optimal transmission integration proposal. Loadflow and transient stability studies were done to assess network constraints. Options were studied to remove constraints where they exist while responding to the objective of power evacuation into the grid..

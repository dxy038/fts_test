Objective
Various epileptic syndromes may present in adolescence and Juvenile Myoclonic
Epilepsy (JME) is known to be the most common idiopathic generalized epileptic
syndrome presenting itself with different types of seizure activity. The exact
etiology of JME is still unknown, but hypoxia, storage disease, toxic-metabolic
disorders, drug reactions, and neurodegenerative disorders have been revealed
to cause disease manifestation. Previous research shows that JME includes
5â€“10% of all cases diagnosed with epilepsy. It is estimated to include 18% of
idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Females are at higher risk of developing this
condition. Levetiracetam (LEV) is an anti-epileptic drug that has become one
of the most used drugs for the management of epileptic syndromes. It has less
drug interactions, milder side effects, and broad-spectrum efficacy to make it
an ideal drug to control seizures. Different mechanisms of actions have made
LEV a novel anti-epileptic drug. This new medication can be used as a mono- or
add-on therapy to previous anti-epileptic drugs. One of the clinically valuable
pharmacological aspects of LEV is that it can be started at a high therapeutic
dosage and is well tolerated. The median starting dosage varied according to
patients underlying disease, age, and disease severity. We have also discussed
the effect of LEV on other epileptic syndromes, which showed promising results
in both adults and children. In childhood epilepsy, there is evidence proving
that a higher rate of behavioral disturbances with neurological disorders can be
improved by LEV therapy. Finally, our review showed the beneficial effects of
LEV on seizure-control in different epileptic syndromes especially as a monotherapy

This study is to empirically test the effect of strategic alignment of information systems on firm performance in the healthcare industry. By analyzing the objectives of healthcare information systems appeared in letters to shareholders, we find that firms implemented information systems with multiple objectives have higher performance than firms implemented information systems with a single objective. We also find that firms have mainly implemented information systems for the objectives of efficiency and satisfaction, rather than for internal or external growth objectives. The results suggest that heath care firms can exploit benefits from information systems with strategic alignment, especially throughout efficiency and satisfaction objectives.

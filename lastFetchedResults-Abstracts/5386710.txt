This paper presents an evaluation of a new adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller used for speed and flux regulation for an induction motor drive system as compared to classical control methods. The proposed controller has the merits of sliding mode control: fast response, robustness to plant parameter variations and simplicity of implementation and it also avoids the problems of chattering and the need of a large control effort achieve the control objective by means of using and optimization technique to vary the gains of the sliding mode controller according to the position of the operating point on the state trajectory. The proposed controller is compared to conventional PI, conventional sliding mode and fuzzy sliding mode control. The results for a 5 HP, 3-phase, 220 V induction motor show very low control effort compared to sliding mode methods and parameter insensitivity compared to the PI controller

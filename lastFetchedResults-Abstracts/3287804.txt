This paper presents the development of a flexible public lighting system which aims to monitor and control electronic ballasts. The system consists of dimmable electronic ballast for high pressure sodium lamps (HPS) with power meter, and a control board with 2.4 GHz digital radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) protocol, and data transmission module using SMS. The system has bidirectional communication between the central control and the master units using SMS messaging. Further, the master units send and receive information to and from the slave units via ZigBee modules and coordinates with the central controller the operation of each lamp in their region. This system can measure and report power and energy consumption to a central controller, and to dim, turn on and turn off the lamps individually, controlling the power consumption of the illumination system.

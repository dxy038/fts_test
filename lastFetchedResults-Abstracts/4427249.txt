A framework for the joint parameters tuning of several controllers in coupled multi-loop control systems is presented. It is based on the design of a cooperative dynamic game, which is solved by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, combined with a game theoretic solution concept. For each controller, an objective function is deQned and parametrically optimized. Several performance indices e.g. ISE, ITSE and ISTSE are used as objective functions and the optimization results are compared by means of a simulation example.

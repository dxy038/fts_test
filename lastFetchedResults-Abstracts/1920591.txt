The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, derived from unstable angina/nonâ€“ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction patient population, predicts 14-day cardiovascular events. It has been validated in emergency department (ED) patients with potential acute coronary syndrome with respect to 30-day outcomes. Our objective was to determine whether the initial TIMI score could risk stratify ED patients with potential acute coronary syndrome with respect to the 1-year outcomes. This was a prospective cohort study of patients presenting to the ED with chest pain who underwent electrocardiography. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (acute myocardial infarction) were excluded. Follow-up was conducted by telephone and record review &gt;1 year after the index visit. The main outcome was the 1-year mortality, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, or revascularization stratified by the TIMI score. Of 2,819 patients, 253 (9%) met the composite outcome. The overall incidence of the composite 1-year outcome of death (n = 119), acute myocardial infarction (n = 96), and revascularization (n = 90) according to TIMI score was TIMI 0 (n = 1,162), 4%; TIMI 1 (n = 901), 8%; TIMI 2 (n = 495), 13%; TIMI 3 (n = 193), 23%; TIMI 4 (n = 60), 28%; and TIMI 5 to 7 (n = 8), 88% (p &lt;0.001). In conclusion, in addition to risk stratifying ED patients with chest pain at the initial ED evaluation, the TIMI score can also predict the 1-year cardiovascular events in this patient population.

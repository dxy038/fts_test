Turn-milling is a newly emerging machining process, which tends to make use of the advantages of both turning and milling, wherein both the work piece and the cutting tool are given rotary motion simultaneously. The objective of the present experimental work is to understand the phenomenon of orthogonal turn-milling especially in relation to the effects of work piece revolution, cutter diameter and depth of cut. Surface finish of the machined surface and the optimum work speed at which the surface roughness was minimum has been studied. It has been shown that surface quality obtained by turn-milling process is better than that of conventional milling process. The experiments have been conducted for orthogonal turn-milling of mild-steel work piece with high speed steel milling cutters using planning of experiments technique to study the surface finish achieved.

Aquarius is an L-band active/passive sensor designed to globally map sea surface salinity from space [1,2]. Two instruments, a radar scatterometer and a radiometer, observe the same surface footprint almost simultaneously. The radiometer is the primary instrument for sensing sea surface salinity (SSS), while the scatterometer is included to provide a correction for sea surface roughness, which is a primary source of error in the salinity retrieval. Although the primary objective is the measurement of SSS, the instrument combination operates continuously, acquiring data over land and sea ice as well. An important feature of the data processing includes detection and mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), which is done separately for both active and passive instruments. Correcting for RFI is particularly critical over ocean because of the high accuracy required in the brightness temperature measurements for SSS retrieval. It is also necessary for applications of the Aquarius data over land, where man-made interference is widespread, even though less accuracy is required in this case. This paper will provide an overview of the current status of the Aquarius RFI processing and an update on the ongoing work on the improvement of the RFI detection and mitigation performance.

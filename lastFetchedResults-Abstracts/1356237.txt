Follicular fluid (FF) serves as a natural ‘culture medium’ for the maturation of both granulosa cells and oocytes. 
Ascorbic Acid (AA) known  to maintain reproductive integrity and reported to either accumulate in the follicular 
fluid or other ovarian cells. A  relatively higher bioavailability of AA within the graafian follicle as compared to 
serum suggests importance of AA in the graafian follicle biology. As a pre-eminent water soluble antioxidant, this 
molecule  has  also  been  reported  to  provide  protection  of  oocyte  and  granulosa  cells  against  cellular  injuries  but 
earlier  studies  were  limited  with  exogenous  supplementation.  The  present  study  evaluated  the  significance  of 
endogenous  FF-ascorbic acid  in aromatization and pregnancy outcome in non-PCOS women undergoing IVF-ET
treatment cycles. The positive correlationship of  FF-AA with clinical pregnancy rate observed in thisstudy clearly 
denotes  the  importance  of  maintaining  the  antioxidant  status  within  the  microenvironment  in  order  to  achieve 
pregnancy.  The  present  study  has  attempted  to  establish  for  the  first  time  a  successful  correlationship  between 
endogenous FF-AA levels with pregnancy outcome as against the exogenous supplementation theory and also aided 
to determine the critical requirement of AA within the follicular milieu for achieving the objective

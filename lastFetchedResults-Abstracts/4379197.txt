In this work, based on the local phase information of images, an objective index, called the feature similarity index for tone-mapped images (FSITM), is proposed. To evaluate a tone mapping operator (TMO), the proposed index compares the locally weighted mean phase angle map of an original high dynamic range (HDR) to that of its associated tone-mapped image calculated using the output of the TMO method. In experiments on two standard databases, it is shown that the proposed FSITM method outperforms the state-of-the-art index, the tone mapped quality index (TMQI). In addition, a higher performance is obtained by combining the FSITM and TMQI indices.

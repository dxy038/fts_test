For collecting data, Walton (1973) quality of work life, Spreitzer (1996) psychological empowerment and Hersey and Goldsmith (1980) productivity questionnaires were used. The data of the questionnaires were analyzed in descriptive and inferential statistics level comprising Pearson correlation coefficient test, step by step regression, simultaneous regression, multivariate analysis of variance and through Spss 16.5 software. The findings indicate that there is a positive and significant correlation among all aspects of quality of work life and psychological empowerment with staff productivity. In the step by step regression, the dimension of growth opportunity and continuous security as well as the dimension of influence had the best capacity to predict productivity. Among the demographic variables, only gender interaction × work experience and age interaction × gender have led to the difference in the average scores of the staff in productivity.

Sleepiness and fatigue are terms commonly used in clinical practice and research. At times sleepiness and fatigue are used interchangeably; however, each of them has distinct implications for diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this article is to review the psychometric properties of the measurements of sleepiness and fatigue. Although there are objective and subject measures to evaluate sleepiness, only rating scales are available to assess fatigue. Further research should be directed toward exploring the potential mechanisms underlying the measurements of sleepiness and fatigue. Establishing objective assessing instruments to evaluate fatigue and clarifying the relationship between objective and subjective assessments of sleepiness are crucially needed.

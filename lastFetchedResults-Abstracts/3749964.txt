A three-phase, multilevel rectifier using active voltage injection with one MOSFET device is presented. The injector consists of a bidirectional switch that modifies the behavior of a 12-pulse rectifier resulting in either 24-pulse or multilevel pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) operation. The resultant input currents are almost sinusoidal, the line current THD being 2.36% for 24-pulse operation and 1.06% for PWM operation. The MOSFET current is 2.9% of the load current. The circuit operation, idealized waveforms and modulation strategy are explained and experimental results are presented.

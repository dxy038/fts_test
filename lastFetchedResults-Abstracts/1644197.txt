Soil maps are the common sources of soil information for land evaluation and land use planning. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capability of conventional and geostatistical methods for mapping selected physical (sand, silt and clay) and chemical (carbonate calcium equivalent and pH) soil properties. Based on interpretation of aerial photographs, satellite images and field observations, five geopedologic map units were identified in an area of about 12 km2 in southern Jiroft. 100 surface soil samples (0-20 cm) were taken from a regular grid of 500 Ã— 250 m. The results indicated that geopedological map units were significantly different in at least one soil property. Differences of characteristics between units are resulting differences in geomorphic processes. Continuous soil maps prepared by the ordinary kriging also revealed continuous variations of characteristics in accordance with the changes in geomorphic processes. However, variations between units obviously recognizable in the boundary of units were not revealed by the geostatistical method. Based on results of this study, the conventional method is proposed for large areas (small scale maps) and geostatisticals method for small areas (large scale maps) are proposed for soil mapping.

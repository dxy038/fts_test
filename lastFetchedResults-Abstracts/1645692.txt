Inroduction & Objective: Deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, used to treat diseases of iron poisoning and affects process of angiogenesis. In the present research, the effect of deferoxamine on angiogenesis of chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane was assessed.
Materials and Methods: 40 fertilized eggs were divided into 4 equal groups: control group and experimental control 1,  experimental 2 and 3 treated with 10 and 100µm DFO, respectively. On day 8 of incubation, a gelatin sponge was placed on chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and was soaked with 10 µl of DFO (10 ?m) for group 2 and for group 3 with 10 µl of DFO (100 ?m). On day 12, number and length of vessels in all samples was measured by Image J software. The obtained data was statistically analyzed by means of SPSS software (v.19), ANOVA and t test P < 0.05.
Results: Mean number and length of vessels in the control and experimental control 1 cases didn’t show any significant differences (p  >  0.05). Comparison between mean number and length of vessels in the control and group 1 showed a significant decrease (p  <  0.05) and groups 2 was showed a significant decrease in the mean number of vessels compared with the control (p  <  0.05), but in this group, didn’t show any significant differences in the mean length of vessels compared with the control (p  >  0.05).
Conclusion: Deferoxamine cause inhibition of angiogenesis in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane.

The 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cellular mobile and wireless personal communication systems are expected to accommodate not only high quality voice services, but also a broad range of other multi-rate services. Of the various access protocols, wideband code division multiple access (CDMA) has emerged as the key air interface because of its high frequency utilization and suitability for handling multimedia and multi-rate services. We propose a simple, robust and effective objective function based multi-user detection (MUD) receiver. Numerical results over the AWGN and fading channels will show that significant capacity and performance improvement can be achieved compared with the conventional DS/CDMA receiver

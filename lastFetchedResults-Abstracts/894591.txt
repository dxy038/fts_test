The objective of the current research was to investigate the distribution of lipid, protein and moisture throughout the fillets of farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Differences in lipid, protein and moisture content were found amongst different portions of the fillet, being lowest lipid and highest moisture (9.86±0.72), (77.42±1.45) in the tail area and contrast highest lipid and lowest moisture in the middle area (11.28±0.79), (75.35±1.90) respectively (p < 0.05). Also recorded the highest amount of protein (42.92±1.52) in the tail area and lowest protein (41.23±1.89) in the middle area (p > 0.05). Significant positive regression was obtained between moisture and lipid content of each area, so it seems to calculate lipid content of each area by moisture content.

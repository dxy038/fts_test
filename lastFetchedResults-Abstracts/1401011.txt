The corrosion is a chemical phenomenon which can affect the quality of a glass surface, since the glass can fail as a result of its continuous exposure to a corrosive environment. If a glass surface is put into contact with water or with any aqueous solution, it may chemically react with this medium and this chemical exchange may spread all over the surface of the glass, hence causing some undesirable effects, particularly a change in mechanical strength as well as the transmittance.

ore, the objective of this work was to study the effect of water attacks on the transmittance of glass plates, which have been damaged by sand and then immersed in water at different temperatures and for different immersion times.

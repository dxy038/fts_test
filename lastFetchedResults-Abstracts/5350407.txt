Genetic algorithm(GA) has a good robust and global optimization capability. In this paper, a supercavitation regime problem is transformed into an equivalent shape optimization problem by defining the objective function as a square error integral of pressure difference. Through combining the commercial CFD soft ANSYS with GA, this problem has been solved efficiently. Comparisons show that genetic algorithm is feasible and effective used in supercavitation flow analysis, the method is good for the reduction of computational complexity and more digestible. Meanwhile the frame can be expanded to study the cavitator optimization in which the regime optimization can be as a sub-optimization.

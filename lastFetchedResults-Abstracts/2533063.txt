Background and Objective: Ischemic heart disease implies reduction of oxygen and blood supply in the myocardium. The most common cause of ischemia is atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. While numerous risk factors lead to coronary diseases, the mechanism of infectious agents in CAD remains unidentified.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 360 patients with and without coronary disease underwent evaluation in terms of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) seroprevalences. Serology was performed by means of ELISA assays. 

Results: Of 360 patients, positive serology was reported for CMV and HSV in 91.7 % and 93.3% with CAD as well as  66.1 % and 57.5 % without  CAD (P<0.001). The risk of coronary disease by cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex in people who had positive serology were 1.5% and 6.81% times, respectively. The risk in regard to the control of other significant variables was statistically significant (P<0.001). The risk of coronary disease pointed out an increase by 3% per age which was statistically significant. In men at risk of coronary artery disease, positive HSV serology was 4.8 times more than women and in patients  with a history of myocardial infraction, this risk was reported 6.47 % times more than the patients without  this history (P<0.001). 

Conclusion: Owing to possible association of viruses and bacteria in the process of atherosclerosis, furthur research is recommended to find out  the relationship of  other infectious agents with CAD   and the presence of microorganisms in the coronary atherosclerotic specimens.

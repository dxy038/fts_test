The main objective of the present work is an investigation of the heat transfer induced by the fire in a cylindrical sealed space. The thermal smoke flow geometry characteristics in cylindrical sealed space were discussed, LES and mixture fraction methods were applied to conduct numerical transient analysis. Computed results has validated the smoke flow course in simulation experiments. The study indicates that the heat transfer faster upper the fire source than around it. When the fire source location is near the wall, the smoke layer distributing were not distinct far from the fire source, and the heat transfer faster in transverse than longitudinal direction.

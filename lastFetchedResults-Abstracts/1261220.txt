Objective The objectives of this study were to assess the influence of the different types of laser cordectomy on vocal outcome and highlight the relationship between some perceptive, acoustic, and endoscopic evaluations. Study Design Retrospective observational study. Methods Thirteen patients, staged as having T1a tumor, underwent laser CO2cordectomy (1 patient type I and type II, 2 patients type II, 6 patients type III, and 4 patients type IV) between January and June 2010. Grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain evaluation scale; voice handicap index-10 questionnaire; multidimensional computer analysis of voice and speech; maximum phonation time; and stroboscopic examination were performed 12 months after the surgery. Correlations between jitter% and R, shimmer% and R, noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR) and G were studied. Patients were first divided into groups according to type of cordectomy performed and, later, according to stroboscopic findings. Wilcoxon test, Spearman index, and Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by post hoc analysis, were used. Results No significant differences were found in type III and type IV cordectomy groups. Jitter% and R values showed a correlation as did shimmer% and B values, and NHR and G values in type III cordectomy group. Moreover, shimmer% and NHR values significantly increase in direct proportion to the severity of the endoscopic status. Conclusions Results indicate that the type of surgery performed, functional compensation, and outcome measures were related, although for some data, there were no statistical evidence. Individual compliance could strongly influence vocal outcome in these patients.

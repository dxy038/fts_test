In this paper we propose to study, the validity of a (de) multiplexer the type PHASAR using electro-optical effect in telecommunication WDM around a central wavelength of 1550nm. The objective is to reallocate the different output channels of the PHASAR by a variation of effective index with an applied voltage. We present her numerical results, indicating a forward bias voltage of 592 V for 0.002 variation of index.

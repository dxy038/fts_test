Multi-Functional Bidirectional AC/DC T-type 3-Level Converter for Super UPS is investigated in this paper. The AC/DC converter is used as the interfaced between DC Bus and Energy Source or Load. According to the components (grid, gas turbines, AC loads) connected in AC side, The AC/DC converter operates at AC voltage source mode, Power source mode or DC voltage source mode. A control scheme for the Multi-Functional Bidirectional AC/DC converter is studied. Finally the design of the AC/DC converter is verified by experiment on a 100kW AC/DC converter prototype.

Objective: Recent studies have suggested that the rate of cesarean delivery in patients who have undergone a successful external cephalic version is higher than expected. This study compares the incidence of cesarean delivery in patients who underwent successful external cephalic version and patients with primary cephalic presentations. Study Design: We identified and reviewed the charts of 92 patients who underwent a successful external cephalic version. We identified a control population of 184 patients from the delivery room logs. We collected outcome data and information on additional risk factors that may affect cesarean delivery rates. Results: There were no significant differences between study and control populations. There was no significant difference in the cesarean delivery rate between study patients (22.8%) and control patients (23.4%). Conclusions: We could not demonstrate a significant increase in the cesarean delivery rate for women who underwent successful external cephalic version in comparison with patients in labor with primary cephalic presentations.

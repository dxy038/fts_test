Distributed generation (DG) is playing a significant role in the power systems nowadays, which is closely related to the implementation of new demand-side services in a Smart Grid environment. It is widely accepted that microturbine generation (MTG) system is one of the most suitable means in this area. The most important outputs of a MTG system are total fuel consumption and speed transient response. This paper presents a brief description of the microturbine (MT), permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), and also power conditioning and voltage control system. Afterwards, as the fast and suitable control system design is one of the main requirements of Smart Grids, studies for the purpose of calculating the best parameters for speed governor system have been carried out. It is done by Differential Evolutionary (DE) optimization method with the objectives of minimizing total fuel consumption and speed variation after daily load changing. This paper defines a problem on transient response and fuel consumption of MTs for a 24-hour load. The aim is to optimize the speed governor in order to minimize the fuel consumption and transient response of permanent magnet (PM) generator simultaneously. Besides these two objectives, the stability issue of the MTG system is also discussed in the paper. Differential Evolutionary Algorithm integrated with a multi-objective handling technique is employed to solve the defined problem. Several simulations have been done and the result shows the effectiveness of a fine-tuned speed governor by using the proposed method. Finally, this MT model has been added to a hybrid Microgrid to analyze its effects on frequency response of the system.

This paper presents an action selection method using fuzzy logic. The objective is to solve behaviour conflict in behaviour-based architectures for virtual agent navigation in unknown virtual environments. Two main problems have been identified: how to decide which behaviour should be activated at each instant; and how to combine the results from different behaviours into one action. The method uses fuzzy alpha-levels to compute behaviour weight for each behaviour and the final action is selected using the Huwicz criterion. The results clearly demonstrate the mapping of inputs to output with a near-optimum path in every navigation task.

The objective of this work was to determine experimentally the ion-implantation parameters and furnace annealing conditions required to produce high-efficiency solar cells. A comprehensive experimental study was conducted in which the optimum ion-implantation parameters were found by a systematic variation of the implant parameters (i.e., dose, energy, species) followed by detailed studies of solar-cell devices. Two furnace heat-treatment techniques were found which effectively anneal the implanted layers and at the same time preserve or improve the diffusion length in the bulk silicon. Detailed characteristics of both the junction and bulk properties of solar cells fabricated over the spectrum of implant parameters will be discussed. As a result of this study, optimized implant parameters and annealing conditions were found which allow for the fabrication of 14-15- percent (AM1) efficient solar cells.

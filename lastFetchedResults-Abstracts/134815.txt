Background: fibrinolytic agents like streptokinase (SK) and urokinase (UK) are urgent treatment of thromboembolism. Besides thrombolysis, these medications have side effect like: generalized lytic state, serum fibrinogen decrease, effect on body hemostasis and life threatening bleedings, allergic reaction and urticaria.
Studies have shown that some patients don’t response to SK, for example patients that have used SK one or two times or patients with streptococcal disease.
Objective: In this study, we studied the fibrinolytic activity of Amirkabiria odoratissima mozafarian to find the natural compounds that can be used in treatment of thromboembolism.
Method: Polyphenolic extract and the essential oil were prepared. Then essential oil was analyzed by G C. Mass. Fibrinolytic effects of SK (as positive control and comparison), extract and essential oil of Amirkabiria odoratissima mozafarian was studied by flourimetric method.
At first fibrinogen was labeled with FITC (Flourescein Isothiocyanate) and then labeled thrombus was produced in plasma with calcium ion.
Then SK (100-1000 unit/ml) and essential oil at V/V dilutions of (1/1, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000) and extract (1/1, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000) was added and after 15, 30, 60 min, fluorescence was measured.
Results: Results showed linear relationship between fluorescence and SK concentration between 300-700 unit/µl. Essential oil of Amirkabiria odoratissima mozafarian was effective in thrombolytic agent.
Conclusion: Results has shown that Amirkabiria odoratissima mozafarian extract has considerable fibrinolytic effects. So, study of different fractions of this plant extract and isolation and purification of the active fibrinolytic component is recommended.

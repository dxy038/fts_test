The results showed that, in the BTH region, winter wheat and maize were the major crop type in the summer and autumn growth season, accounted for more than 60% of the farmland and ensured 88% of food demand in BTH region. Cotton and fruit trees were planted less, mainly distributed in the southern area. There are also plenty of vegetable greenhouses around cities, supplying the city residents´ daily vegetables at a ratio about 48%.

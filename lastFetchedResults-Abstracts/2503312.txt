The groups had a significant difference in terms of brain-behavioral systems activity [F(5, 80)= 22.33, p  <  0.001] with significant differences in BAS and its subscales of drive and pleasure seeking, while no significant difference was observed between the two groups in BIS activity or BAS subscale of reply to reward. Also results demonstrated significant differences as the matter of psychological distress [F(3, 82)=26.26, p < 0.001] with difference in all of its dimensions.

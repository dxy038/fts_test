The chemical and physical effects of ultrasound with a frequency above 16 kHz, higher than the audible frequency of the human ear, have proven to be a useful tool for variety of systems ranging from the application of ultrasound in environmental remediation to the cooperation of ultrasound waves with chemical processing regarding as sonochemistry. Ultrasound opened up new advances in textile wet processing including desizing, scouring, bleaching, dyeing, printing and finishing and also nanoprocessing including nanopretreatment, nanodyeing, nanoprinting and nanofinishing. Use of ultrasound appears to be a promising alternative technique to reduce energy, chemicals and time involved in various operations. Over the past years there has been an enormous effort on using sonochemistry for the synthesis of nanomaterials on various textile materials. In situ sonosynthesis of nanoparticles and nanocomposites on different textiles is a pioneering approach driving future investigations. With such wide range of applications and vast ever increasing publications, the objective of this paper is presenting a comprehensive review on ultrasound application in textile from early time to now by the main emphasis on the sonosynthesis of nanomaterials outlining directions toward future research.

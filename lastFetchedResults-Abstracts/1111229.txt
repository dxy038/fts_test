An analysis of the effects of the thickness and grain size of polycrystalline thin films on substrates is presented with the objective of linking the film mismatch stress to the underlying characteristic size scales. The model is predicated on the notion that the relaxation of mismatch strain in the film is accommodated by the introduction of dislocation loops whose population, dimensions and interaction energies are controlled by the film thickness and microstructural dimensions. The model is capable of capturing the combined effects of these size scales by accounting for the interaction energies of the constrained dislocation structure, and provides quantitative predictions of the evolution of film stress during thermal excursions. The predictions of the analysis are compared with available experimental results for polycrystalline films of face-centered cubic materials on Si substrates. It is shown that the model correctly predicts the observed influence of film thickness and grain size on stress evolution during thermal excursions. Aspects of strain hardening in thin polycrystalline films with high dislocation densities are also discussed.

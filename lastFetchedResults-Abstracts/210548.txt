Studies of the association between the plasma concentration of
lipoprotein (a) and coronary heart disease (CHD) have reported
apparently conflicting finding.
The objective of the present study is to evaluate the association between
serum levels of LP (a) and ischemic heart disease as well as other
cardiovascular risk factors in a population - based study conducted on
local cross sectional. LP (a) serum was measured in 142 patients with
chronic stable angina who were under going clinically indicated coronary
angiography. Lipid profilefasting blood glucose, anthropometric and
clinical parameters were analyzed.
LP (a) levels were significantly associated with numbers of coronary
artery stenosis (CAD) in men, but no in women. Also, an direct
association between mean levels of LP (a) and number of CAD in men
younger than 55 years old inverse association in men older than
55ycars old were observed.
Our multivariate analysis found that LP (a) was considered an
independent predictor for severity of CHD in mcn, especially m
younger individuals.

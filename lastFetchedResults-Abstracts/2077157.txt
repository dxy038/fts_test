Our goal is to model and simulate forest dynamics in order to observe large-scale characteristics of the forest as they emerge from local competitive interplay among individuals. This objective can be reached by developing a spatial gap model. Spatialisation can be achieved from a space- or individual-oriented perspective. Because the choice of one approach over the other leads to consequences affecting the simulated dynamics that are difficult to assess a priori, we have decided to consider both and have thus developed two models: a cellular automata network and an individual-based model. Both models are simulated and respective temporal and spatial dynamics are analysed. Although simulation results are similar, some differences highlight underlying assumptions of each conceptual approach. The manner in which the two models complement each other is all the more interesting in that each one has its particular assets and can be used for different perspectives of development.

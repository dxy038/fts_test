This paper presents an application of Cuckoo search algorithm to determine location and sizing of Static Var Compensator (SVC). The objective of this problem is to reconfigure the electric power system by installing SVC devices. The objective function considers loss power, voltage deviation and operational cost of SVC and other operating constraints in power system. Cuckoo search algorithm is evaluated on two case studies and compared with the Teaching-learning-based optimization method. The results show that Cuckoo search algorithm is better than the Teaching-learning-based optimization and its performance is also better.

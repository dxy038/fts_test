Introduction: The increasing trend of research concerning bonds between Metal, porcelain, ... and dental tissue of enamel and dentine, to determine which bonding agent has a higher quality in particular conditions has been going on.
Objective: This research was carried out to compare three types of bonding agents Panavia Ex, Mirage bond Flc and Optibond in shear bond strengths porcelain and tissue of enamel.
Materials and Methods: In 60 samples of human teeth which were divided in three groups of A, B and C (each group consisting of 20 samples) porcelain was bonded to enamel with these three bonding agents, then they were put under the Instron machine with shear force of 0.5cm/min on the porcelain near the bonding place. According to the separation time of porcelain from enamel the bond strength power was obtained.
Results: After calculating the average figures and variance analyzing (Anova) and also using Scheffe, Duncan, Tukey Hsd Test, these results with were reported in groups A, B and C respectively: Panavia Ex 4.39 Mpa , Mirage Bond Flc 10.41 Mpa and optibond with the most shear strength of 15.90 Mpa
Conclusion: Regarding to the result of this research, optibond material was found to have a higher shear bond strength, comparing with the two other substances. Therefore it can be used to bond Inlay, Only and porcelain crown to the tissue of enamel.

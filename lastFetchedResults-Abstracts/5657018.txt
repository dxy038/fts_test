The practical significance that scientific combat service operation performance evaluation method may improve the aerial defense ability of the army and training efficiency of combat service operation people is described. The combat service operation evaluation index system of surface-to-air missile weapon system is established using Delphi method after knowing well the combat service operation process and the requirements of the combat service operation people. Then FAHP based on analytical hierarchal process and fuzzy integrated evaluation methods is advanced, and take a certain type of surface-to-air missile for instance, its combat service operation performance is evaluated. Through the final evaluation result, it is known that this evaluation method could evaluate the combat service operation performance better, and more objective than other evaluation method.

Since the very successful release of the worldÂ´s first mass-produced HEV (hybrid electric vehicle) in 1997, the number of HEVs as well as EVs (electric vehicles) has been gradually increasing in major cities around the world. Reliable and efficient power devices transferring energy between the battery and the motor/generator represent the heart of the electric power-train that realizes the electric-mobility concept. The objective of this presentation is to give a quick preview of the early mass-produced power modules for EV/HEVs and to highlight the advancement achieved so far in addressing the automotive severe reliability and high performance requirements. The presentation will also cover some of the power devices trends in terms of the major pillars comprising automotive power modules: (1) power chip technology, (2) packaging technology, and (3) functional integration as shown in Fig. 1.

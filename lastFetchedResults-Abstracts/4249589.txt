Ultra-Wideband (UWB) link emerges as a promising physical layer candidate for a wide range of wireless networks. In addition to the potential of very high data rate, the ultra-wide bandwidth also provides enhanced flexibility for transceiver designs with variable complexity, which is particularly suitable for networks with heterogeneous nodes. However, to establish physical communication links between nodes with distinct complexity requirements, asymmetric UWB transceivers need to be designed. Towards this objective, we investigate the communications between devices with different ADC/DAC sampling rates and reveal their similarity with multi-input multi- output (MIMO) systems. Then, the signal processing approaches can be readily applied to achieve optimality in terms of both channel throughput and bit error rate (BER). Analysis and simulations corroborate the effectiveness of our transceiver designs.

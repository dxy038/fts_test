Background: Jaundice is one of the most common problem in neonatal period and G6PD deficiency is one of the important causes of jaundice neonatorum.
Objective: To determine G6PD deficiency incidence in icteric neonates.
Methods: This I- year descriptive study was implemented on all the icteric neonates admitted in neonatal ward at Qods hospital (started from August 1999). Normal tests were carried out, besides G6PD activity was detected with kimiapajohan kits.
Findings: Following up 259 neonates, 21 cases of G6PD deficiency were reported (8.1% incidence). In deficient neonates, 19 cases were male and 2 ones were female . Septicemia was reported in 5 deficient cases. Mothers' drug records were negative in all of the deficient neonates. History of jaundice in other children were positive in 4 of 21 cases.

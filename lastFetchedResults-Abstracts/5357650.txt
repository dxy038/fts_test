In this paper we propose a sampling stage based on a bank of microwave filters for an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) receiver. The objective of the proposed frequency domain sampling scheme is to build an all-digital receiver. Frequency domain sampling (FDS) efficiently parallelizes analog to digital conversion, which leads to lower sampling rates on the acquisition system. Typically, the FDS unit performs signal projection on orthogonal frequency bands covering the whole spectrum of the received signal. However, designing filters that are orthogonal and yet capture most of the signal energy is very difficult in practice. In this paper we consider an FDS system which projects the received signal over a set of microwave filters which constitutes a non-orthogonal basis. We use frame theory to obtain a high quality reconstruction of the transmitted pulse which is then used to detect the UWB signal in a correlation detector. In the paper we also optimize the microwave filter response in order to maximize the convergence speed of the pulse reconstruction algorithm. Results show that the proposed receiver performs close to the matched filter bound even in highly dispersive channels.

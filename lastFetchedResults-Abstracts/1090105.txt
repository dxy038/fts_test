The objective of this study is to determine factors affecting
the technical efficiency of the inshore fisheries in Kuala
Terengganu. Data for the study was collected from a survey
conducted between June and August 2007 where 100 fishermen
in 14 villages were chosen by stratified sampling. Data envelopment
analysis (DEA) and Tobit analysis were employed to determine
the technical efficiency level and factors influencing technical
efficiency among the fishermen. Results of the study show that,
most fishing units exhibit a low degree of technical efficiency.
This implies that either fishing inputs were used inefficiently or
insufficient inputs were used in fishing activities. The mean
technical efficiency for the sample was estimated to be 55% for
the peak season and 40% for the non peak season. About 37%
and 62% of the fishermen had less than 40% level of technical
efficiency in peak season and non peak season respectively.
Management variables (planning, staffing and controlling) and
demographic variables (size of horsepower, size of family and
formal education) exert positive effects on technical efficiency
of inshore fisheries in Kuala Terengganu. These findings suggest
that there is much room for improvement in efficiency among a
large segment of the inshore fishermen. With appropriate training
and using more advanced technologies, fishermenâ€™ level of
technical efficiency can be raised.

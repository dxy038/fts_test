The unidirectional logistics distribution vehicle routing problem with no time windows is considered. It contains the vehicle capacity restriction, the longest distance restriction and the full loaded vehicle. The solution must ensure the non-full loaded factor is the least and the total distance is the shortest. A multi-objective optimization mathematical model for the problem is established. And the differential evolution algorithm is proposed for this problem. The optimal solutions to the model are obtained by selecting the appropriate encoding method. The results of simulation show that the differential evolution algorithm is an effective way for solving the vehicle routing problem.

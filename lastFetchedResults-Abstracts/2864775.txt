Recently, a single image haze removal scheme based on dark channel prior (DCP) is presented in [1] and is getting popular because of its satisfactory performance for most of cases. However, the DCP scheme has at least three problems: halos, high computational cost and over-exposure. In our previous paper [2], a dehazing algorithm with dual dark channels was presented where high computational cost and over-exposure problems are relieved. In this paper, the objective of proposed dehazing algorithm (PDA) is to relieve the three problems in [1] simultaneously. Four examples are given to verify the PDA where comparison with the DCP scheme is made as well. The simulation results indicate that the PDA is 87.87 times, on average, faster than the DCP in the given examples. Besides, in general better color situation is found for the PDA with similar visual quality and without the three problems in the DCP scheme.

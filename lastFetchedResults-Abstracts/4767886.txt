Control of refrigerant flow in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems is essential to improve their performance and to prolong their life. The introduction of electronic expansion valve has led to a new way of refrigeration flow control and allowed the exploration of the use of different control techniques. The objective of the paper is to report the application of fuzzy logic to control the refrigerant flow of refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. The work is based on a refrigeration unit and the design of the controller is highlighted. The performance of the fuzzy logic controller is compared with a well known existing commercial controller and it shows that the fuzzy logic controller has achieved better performance.

An efficient method for the synthesis of 3,5-branched octaarabinoside, which is a dimer of the tetrasaccharide present in motif B of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall, has been developed by using 2,3,5tri-O-benzoyl-(alpha)-D-arabinofuranosyl trichloroacetimidate, 5-O-acetyl-2,3-diO-benzoyl-(alpha)-D-arabinofuranosyl trichloroacetimidate, 1,2-Oisopropylidene-5-O-trityl-(beta)-D-arabinofuranose, dodecyl 2,3-di-O- benzoyl(alpha)-D-arabinofuranoside and phenyl 2,3-di-O-benzoyl-1-thio-(alpha)-Darabinofuranoside as synthons.

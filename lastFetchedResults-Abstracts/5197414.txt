A simulation tool with graphic interphase, to be used in the teaching of control strategies for induction machines, is presented. The interphase allows carrying both scalar and vector control simulation, with the objective of comparing the control dynamics characteristics for a completely graphic and interactive environment. A tool for the design of graphic interphases from Matlab was used. Consequently, there is no need for the user to be familiarized with programming instructions. The presented interphase is mainly used as a teaching tool.

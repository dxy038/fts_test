In this work, virtual backbone generation in ad-hoc networks under constraints of limited energy resources is addressed through a novel global optimization method. It is based on the maximal independent set approach which is stated as a multi-objective optimization problem to represent the different functional constraints of the backbone generation. A discrete version of a Particle Swarm Optimization strategy is proposed for searching Pareto optimal solutions under the multi-objective cost function. Finally, a diversity-based indicator is applied to prove that the Pareto frontier has a uniform distribution in the non-dominated solutions.

Based on high-speed and bidirectional communication network, smart grid can make the traditional power network reliable, economical and efficient operation with advanced sensing and measuring technology, modern control method and sophisticated decision support system. A kind of power information acquisition system (PIAS) is proposed. The power information can be collected, processed and stored by its data acquisition terminal, and then send to region server via ZigBee SZ02 according to server demands. PIAS can manage the power consumption information in specific region through local area network (LAN) and perform interaction with power company by using present public network. The testing and the calibration verify that the performance of data acquisition terminal is better than that of Watt-hour Meter with 0.2% accuracy.

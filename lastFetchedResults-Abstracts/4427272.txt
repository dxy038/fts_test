The location optimization model which is by established wireless sensor networks is a multi-objective and multi-constrained non-linear equation; and genetic algorithm as a evolutionary algorithm, it has merit of simple condition in application, strong ability in search capability, and particularly suitable for multi-objective, multi-binding solution, so it is very suitable for wireless sensor network nodes targeting the solution of optimization model. In this paper, the comparison of several localization algorithms is presented, and focus on the improvement of the algorithm of genetic algorithm. Nodes join or leave from the network have no effect on positioning by the genetic algorithm. Optimal function was obtained by the algorithm, and got simulated coordinates finally. The simulated coordinates is close to the actual by simulation of the new algorithm, and positioning accuracy is improved.

In this paper, we study surface slick characterization in polarimetric C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The objective is to identify the most powerful multipolarization SAR descriptors for mineral oil spill versus biogenic slick discrimination. A systematic comparison of eight well-known multipolarization features is provided. The analysis is performed on data that we collected during a large-scale oil spill exercise at the Frigg field situated northwest of Stavanger, in June 2011. Controlled oil spills and simulated look-alikes were simultaneously captured within fine quad-polarization Radarsat-2 acquisitions during this experiment. Multipolarization features derived from only the copolarized complex scattering coefficients are explored. We find that the two most powerful multipolarization features extracted from this data set are the geometric intensity, measuring the combined intensity based on the determinant of the coherency matrix, and the real part of the copolarization cross product, which is related to the scattering behavior of the target. We show that these two features can distinguish between the simulated biogenic slicks and mineral oil types such as Balder and Oseberg blend, and that the discriminative power seems to be persistent with time.

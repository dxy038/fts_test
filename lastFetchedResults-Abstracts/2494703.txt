Objective: To evaluate the capability of ascitic fluid dipstick results for pH, glucose, and
protein in order to predict a low serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) at the bedside of
the patient in the emergency department (ED).
Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted during one year in the
ED of Afzalipour hospital in Kerman, Iran. All patients with diagnostic or therapeutic
paracentesis of ascitic fluid were considered as eligible patients. Exclusion criteria included
clinical suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), any contraindications to
paracentesis, and patientsâ€™ refusal to participate in the study. Dipstick values were obtained
at the bedside, and SAAG was calculated after the determination of serum and ascitic fluid
albumin by laboratory. A low SAAG ascitic fluid was defined as the study outcome. We
also used our study population as a test group to evaluate an equation proposed in one
previous study: K = 0.012 Protein?0.012 Glucose?3.329 pH+23.498
Results: A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study. Based on multivariate regression
analysis, dipstick values for protein and glucose were independently predictive of a low
SAAG ascitic fluid (P = 0.23, OR = 1.04; and P = 0.001, OR = 0.81, respectively). The formula
proposed in one of the previous studies was tested by our data set, with sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) at 84%,
83%, 84%, and 80%, respectively.
Conclusion: Dipstick test of ascitic fluid for pH, glucose, and protein has an acceptable
sensitivity and specificity as a point of care test, but it cannot be recommended as a
substitute for SAAG determination based on the current findings.

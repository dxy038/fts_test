Background The objective of this analysis
was to determine the ways in which patientsâ€™
legal statuses at hospital admission and discharge
are associated with select sociodemographic and
clinical variables. This study specifically investigated
differences between patients who were voluntary
during both admission and discharge, patients who
were involuntary on admission but voluntary on
discharge (having converted to voluntary status
during hospitalization), and patients who were
involuntary during both admission and discharge.
Method Data were collected from the charts and
treating clinicians of 227 consecutively discharged
patients from two psychiatric units in a large, urban,
county hospital in the southeastern United States.
Based on results of bivariate tests, sociodemographic
and clinical factors were entered into a polytomous
logistic regression model to determine effect estimates
(adjusted odds ratios). Results In the bivariate
analyses, 15 variables were significantly associated
with the trichotomous legal status. In the model,
three factors were independently significantly associated
with legal status, while controlling for four
potential confounders: (1) whether or not the patient
was experiencing psychotic symptoms at discharge,
(2) whether or not the patient had documented
medical problems requiring medication at discharge,
and (3) the number of psychiatric medications.
Conclusions A generalized lack of treatment
engagement and adherence among involuntary patients
likely underlies significant differences between
the groups in terms of psychotic symptoms, diagnosed
medical problems requiring medications, and
number of psychiatric medications at discharge.
Studying legal status (and the process of legal status
conversion from involuntary to voluntary) and its
correlates is an important topic for further research

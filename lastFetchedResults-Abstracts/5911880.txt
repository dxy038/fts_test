We consider the problem of adaptive power allocation and modulation mode selection over fading channels. The objective is to maximize the long-term system throughput under the constraint of some average transmission power and delay by varying the transmission power and modulation mode according to the buffer and channel conditions. Here, we assume that the buffer length is great enough for overflow of packet to be ignored. So maximizing the system throughput is equivalent to minimizing packet loss due to transmission error. We formulate this optimization problem as a MDP and use dynamic programming techniques to obtain the solution. We also present a simplified scheduling scheme for package transmission and our results show that the minimum of the package loss is very close to that achieved by the optimal policy

OBJECTIVE: The time of day of meal ingestion, the number of people present at the meal, the subjective state of hunger, and the estimated before-meal contents in the stomach have been established as influences on the amount eaten in a meal and these influences have been shown to be heritable. Because these factors intercorrelate, the calculated heritabilities for some of these variables might result indirectly from their covariation with one of the other heritable variables. The independence of the heritability of the influence of these four factors was investigated with 110 identical and 102 fraternal same-sex and 53 fraternal mixed-sex adult twin pairs who were paid to maintain 7-d food-intake diaries.

METHODS: From the diary reports, the meal sizes were calculated and subjected to multiple regression analysis using the estimated before-meal stomach contents, the reported number of other people present, the subjective hunger ratings, and the time of day of the meal as predictors. Linear structural modeling was applied to the β-coefficients from the multiple regression to investigate whether the heritability of the influences of these four variables was independent.

RESULTS: Significant genetic effects were found for the β-coefficients for all four variables, indicating that the heritability of their relationship with intake is to some extent independent and heritable.

CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that influences of multiple factors on intake are influenced by the genes and become part of the total package of genetically determined physiologic, sociocultural, and psychological processes that regulate energy balance.

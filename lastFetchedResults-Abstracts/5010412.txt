Objective: By analyzing the movement kinematic of Zhang Zhongbo two straight vault cartwheel flip twist 1170&#176;, this paper focus on of technical characteristics of the action, in order to provide a theoretical basis and technical reference to the vault dymnasts and coachers. Methods: Analysis Zhang Zhongbo two exercises for image to obtain kinematic parameters. Results and Conclusion: the completion quality of the second movement Z2 is better than the first one Z1; Z2 complete 1125&#176; swivel, 45&#176; more complete than Z1; highest point of gravity center of Z2 is higher than the Z1, so is the average angular velocity greater twist; Z2 do better in the process control of body position than Z1, legs together more quickly, arms bent hold more timely.

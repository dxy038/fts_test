Objective: To determine whether there was an association between the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand test
(FTSS) and the global cognitive function assessed with Short-Portable-Mental-State-Questionnaire (SPMSQ)
among the EPIDOS cohort. Design: Cross-sectional study corresponding to the baseline assessment of the
EPIDOS study. Setting: Five French cities including Amiens, Lyon, Montpellier, Paris and Toulouse.
Participants: 7421 community-dwelling older women (mean age 80.41±0.04 years). Measurements: Time to
achieve FTSS, and SPMSQ score. Age, body mass index, high number of comorbidities, cardiovascular risk
factors, depression, regular physical activity, joint pain, quadriceps strength, visual acuity, use of psychoactive
drugs, serum albumin, vitamin D deficiency (i.e., serum concentration <10ng/mL), and the influence of seasons
and study centers were used as covariables. Subjects were divided into 2 groups according to SPMSQ score
(either impaired<8/10 or normal≥8/10). Results: Compared to their counterparts, the women with cognitive
impairment (n=1190, mean 81.51±0.45years) took more time in performing FTSS (17.8±0.9seconds versus
16.1±0.3seconds, P<0.001). There was a significant negative association of SPMSQ score with FTSS
(Unadjusted ß=-0.02(95%CI -0.03;-0.01), P<0.001; Fully Adjusted ß=-0.03(95%CI -0.05;-0.01), P=0.003;
Stepwise Backward Adjusted ß=-0.02(95%CI -0.04;-0.01), P=0.005), as well as with advance in age (ß=-0.04,
P=0.006) and vitamin D deficiency (ß=-0.34, P=0.011). The FTSS limit value in predicting moderate cognitive
impairment was set at 15 seconds by a sensitivity analysis (negative predictive value=86%). Conclusion: We
found a negative association of FTSS with global cognitive performance. Achieving FTSS in less than 15
seconds made unlikely the existence of a moderate cognitive impairment. FTSS could be used as a tool in
primary care medicine to exclude moderate cognitive decline

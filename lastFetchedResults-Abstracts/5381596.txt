In this paper, a new collision detection algorithm based on simulated annealing algorithm which is effective in searching optimal solution is presented. Basic principle of this new collision detection algorithm is as follows: The time variant parameter used for establishing objective function based on kinetic equation of missile and attacked objective is extracted firstly; Secondly, objective function adopted as condition of collision detection is constructed availing of extracted parameter; Finally, the optimal solution of objective function is got based on simulated annealing algorithm, and whether the collision happens is determined by the optimal solution. The simulated result proves this new algorithm is feasible.

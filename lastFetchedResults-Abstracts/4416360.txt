The boiler drum water level not only has a profound effect on the steam generated quality and the stream-water separation speed, but also is an important parameter ensuring safety in production. In designing the PID controller, the selection of PID parameters has a direct impact on the control effect. Normally, the choice mainly based on experience with certain subjectivity. In this paper, genetic algorithms is applied to the PID controller design of steam boiler drum water level, reasonable objective function and weighted coefficients are designed according to the control requirements, and relatively optimal PID Parameters are obtained which not only meet the demanding control requirements but also optimize the dynamic performance and make the system have strong anti-interference ability. Finally, validity of the algorithms proposed is verified through computer simulation.

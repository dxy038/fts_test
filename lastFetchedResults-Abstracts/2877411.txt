Several contemporary multi-objective surrogate-based algorithms use some kind of local search operator. The search technique used in this operator can largely affect the performance of the multi-objective optimizer as a whole, however, little attention is often paid to the selection of this technique. In this paper, we compare three different local search techniques and evaluate their effect on the performance of two different surrogate based multi-objective optimizers. The algorithms are evaluated using the well known ZDT and WFG benchmark suites and recommendations are made based on the results.

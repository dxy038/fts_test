A cooperative visual servo tracking controller is developed in this paper with the objective to enable an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to follow a desired trajectory encoded as a sequence of images (i.e. a prerecorded video) utilizing the image feedback from a moving airborne monocular camera system. An innovative daisy chaining strategy is used to resolve the relative velocity between the moving airborne camera (i.e., a camera attached to a remotely piloted aircraft), the moving UGV, and the desired time varying UGV trajectory. An adaptive Lyapunov-based control strategy is employed to actively compensate for the lack of known depth measurements and the lack of an object model

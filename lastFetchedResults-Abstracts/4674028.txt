Human-computer interaction plays a significant role for literate/illiterate and visually challenged users to access information. The mode of human-computer interaction could be speech, text, gestures, facial expressions, symbols etc., or a combination of these. An interaction could be in the form of a conversation including statements, questions, answers and expressions. A (uni-modal or multi-modal) conversational type of human-computer interaction is often referred to as a conversational system. A conversational system with speech as an input mode assumes significance as speech is a natural means of communication for human beings. The goal of a speech-based conversation (SBC) system is to provide information by conversing with a human-being in a natural fashion. Our objective is to develop speech based conversational systems for in formation access in an Indian language.

Unsharp Masking is an effective and simple method of contrast enhancement. This paper explores the Unsharp Mask using the Laplacian Operator. The proposed method optimizes the Laplacian coefficient, &#945;, and the Unsharp MaskÂ´s gain by maximizing the information content. The optimization process used was Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization. The proposed method was applied on both a global and local scale. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the classic Unsharp Masking method. The method is intended for gray-level images but can be applied to color images in general.

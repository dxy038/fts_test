The objective of this paper is to investigate the issues and concepts that arise when integrating wind power in China, and discuss the concrete approaches to the interconnection considerations. Significant penetration of wind power in the present power systems in China will have large influence on the operation and control of the grid to which the wind parks are connected. The interconnection of wind energy system, normally through a power electronic device, to the system brings challenges of its own. These challenges include power quality, active and reactive power flow, infrastructure, network stability, cost recovery and profitability. Many factors come into play when considering the economics of a wind generation project. The discussion in this paper is meant to provide a few generally accepted procedures used in wind generation projects. This paper also provides a technical assessment of the impact of distributed generation technologies on the power grid. Some of the considerations are addressed with the aid of the some successful projects in China

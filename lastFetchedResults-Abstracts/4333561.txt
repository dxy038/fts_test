Differential Evolution (DE) has recently proven to be an efficient method for optimizing real-valued multi-modal objective functions. Besides its good convergence properties and suitability for parallelization, DE´s main assets are its conceptual simplicity and ease of use. This paper describes two variants of DE which were used to minimize the real test functions of the ICEC´96 contest

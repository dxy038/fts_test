I have designed a computer input device for the visually challenged people using a special type of sensors known as Wearable sensors. This system is completely wireless, doesnÂ´t require a normal keyboard. My main objective is to help the blind people to type easily. This keypad will be portable and error made during typing can be easily rectified, which is not available in the older methods.

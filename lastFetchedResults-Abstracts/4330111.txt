The following work is concerned with the inclusion of battery degradation mechanisms in power management strategies applied to current-generation hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). Using a real, physical electric vehicle as a basis for validation, a simulation model was realized to describe the behavior of the HEV and its components, including a lead-acid battery bank, an internal combustion engine (ICE) generator and a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). This model is to be used in conjunction with a newly developed battery degradation model and included as part of a power management strategy aimed at reducing operating costs via an associated function, with the objective of studying the effects of battery lifecycle in such a strategy. As a first step towards the realization of this goal, this paper is aimed at describing the model of the HEV and its validation.

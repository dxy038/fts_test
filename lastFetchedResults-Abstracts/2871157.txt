Monitoring of physiological signals of an individual via remote and contactless means is an important scientific challenge, whose resolution will enable the development of novel, non-intrusive mHealth and wellness-management systems and services. In this paper, the performance of three blind source separation algorithms for the optical estimation of the heart rate have been studied. The objective is to perform a comparative evaluation of their accuracy and convergence capability, for the optical estimation of the heart rate.

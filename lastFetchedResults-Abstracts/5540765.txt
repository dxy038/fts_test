Heat exchanger network (HEN) is constructed by hot streams which need cooling and some cold streams which need heating in the atmosphere-vacuum distillation process of crude oil. HEN synthesis technology of atmosphere-vacuum distillation of crude oil provides a good approach to save energy and capital cost. The pinch analysis was adopted to diagnose the situation of energy-utilizing. The maximum energy recovery in HEN is achieved by pinch analysis method. The optimization model of minimum total annual cost including the cost of utilities and investment of heat exchanger as objective function for HEN was posed using mathematic programming approach. The application of HEN synthesis technology in an atmosphere-vacuum distillation showed great income in energy and capital cost saving.

Objective: This study presents, through an integrative review, a comprehensive account of the perceived concerns and learning needs of patients in the early recovery period after a coronary angioplasty. Scope: Nineteen studies involving the patient who has undergone coronary angioplasty were identified using CINAHL and MEDLINE. These studies were examined to compare samples, methods, findings, implications, and suggestions for future research. Findings: Overall the subjects believed that undergoing coronary angioplasty was positive and beneficial, and they viewed it as a minimally invasive, routine procedure. Informational knowledge, such as risk factor education and survival management, were considered of high importance. The majority of subjects modified their behavior, and the most common modification was in diet. Both learned knowledge and lifestyle changes decreased over time. Self-efficacy expectations and levels of anxiety were predictors of behavior changes and knowledge retention in the early recovery period after the coronary angioplasty procedure. Implications: Health professionals must emphasize the seriousness and long-term outcomes of untreated heart disease. Education programs should be individualized and streamlined. Spouses and significant others have informational needs and should be included in education programs. Learning needs in the acute care setting differ from those in the outpatient setting. Continuing education and resources need to be available for patients who are recovering from percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and their families, and should build upon knowledge obtained during hospitalization.

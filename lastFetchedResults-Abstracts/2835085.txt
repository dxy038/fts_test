In this paper, we consider FPGA architecture optimization to reduce power consumption. We study two FPGA routing architectures. The first architecture uses bidirectional Switch Box (SB) implemented using back-to-back tri-state drivers. The second one uses bidirectional SB implemented using tri-states and multiplexors. Experimentation shows that when we use bidirectional SB based on tri-states and multiplexers, power is reduced by 47% compared to SB implemented using back-to-back tri-state drivers. Furthermore, we show that larger circuits tend to realize larger power savings.

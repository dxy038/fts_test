Objective: Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) and microRNA-141 (miR-141) are emerging
molecules in prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis and have been shown to be involved
in androgen signaling. In this original research, we designed an experimental cell model
with androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells to comparatively assess the extent of androgen responsiveness
of PCA3-mRNA and miR-141 along with prostate specific antigen (PSA)-
mRNA and their release into culture medium. These molecules were also measured in the
plasma of the patients with early PCa which is considered to be analogous to androgenresponsive
cells.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, LNCaP cells were exposed to
androgen ablation for 48 hours and treated then with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for
24 hours. Expression of all three RNA molecules in cells, culture medium or plasma
was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
Results: Our results show that DHT differentially affects the expression of these molecules.
PCA3 was the most evidently induced molecule (up to 400-fold, p < 0.001),
while the effect was moderate for PSA-mRNA (up to 30-fold, p < 0.001). In contrast,
the stimulation of miR-141 was much weaker (up to 1.5-fold, p > 0.05). With regard
to the release into culture medium, a similar picture was observed except for PCA3.
PCA3 was below the detection level despite its high stimulation. DHT treatment led to
a significant release of PSA-mRNA (up to 12-fold). Similar to its induction pattern in
LNCaP cells, miR-141 was released at a limited quantity into the medium (up to 1.7-
fold, p=0.07). In plasma, only PCA3 differed significantly between the patients and
healthy subjects (p=0.001).
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that PCa-related RNA molecules respond differentially
to androgen stimulation suggesting differential regulation by androgens.

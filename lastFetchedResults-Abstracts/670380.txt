Introduction: Determination of produced cytokines, especially interleukin 10, interleukin 12, interferon gamma and TNF-? is an important tool in the review of safety responses against inducers such as illnesses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the immune system status in patients with mycobacterium infections such as tuberculosis and non-tuberculosis as compared to healthy controls and find the relationship of these values with the diseases and their distribution.
Methods: Blood sampling was performed on 87 infected patients with mycobacterium infection referring to the Mycobacteriology Research Center. Patients were divided into two groups of nontuberculosis mycobacterium (MOTT) (27 patients) and tuberculosis mycobacterium (60 patients). Also, 86 healthy controls were selected. Cytokines serum values were determined by ELISA test. 
Results: In this study, the control group included 86 people, the tuberculosis mycobacterium group included 60 people and the MOTT group included 27 people. IL-10and IFN-? levels were significantly more in infected people with mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium nontuberculosis infection as compared to the healthy controls , whereas the difference in serum TNF-? and IL-12 levels was not statistically significant.
Conclusion: According to the results obtained in this study, increased serum values of  IL-10 and interferon gamma are related with disease progression, while IL-12 and ?-TNF serum values are not affected significantly in disease.

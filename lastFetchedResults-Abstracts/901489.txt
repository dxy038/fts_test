ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The most common and important epidemiological index for the assessment of dental caries is the DMFT index. This index is an important factor for showing tooth and mouth health condition and has an important role in hygiene decisions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the DMFT index of first permanent molar in 12 years old students in Babol in order to be considered in health program planning.
METHODS: This cross sectional study was performed on 440 public school students aged 12 years old (220 girls and 220 boys) in Babol. They were selected using randomized multistage cluster sampling. Oral examination was carried out in sitting position and natural light and using dental mirror and explorer by senior dental students. Obtained data was recorded in the information form. For observing every decayed, missing and filling tooth in the first molar tooth number one is given. At the end these numbers were added together to achieve DMFT6. 
FINDINGS: The amount of DMF6 was variable from 0 to 4 and its mean was 1.59Â±2. It was more significant in the boys than the girls (p=0.002). Also the results showed that caries teeth were 80.4% (85.1% girls and 68.8% boys), extracted teeth were 6.7% (4.3% girls and 8.4% boys) and filling teeth were 12.8% (10.6% girls and 22.8% boys) of DMFT index. The difference between girls and boys was significant (p=0.008). The number of decayed permanent first molar in the mandible was more than maxilla and on the right side was more than left.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that DMFT6 is high in 12 year old students of Babol. So planning about the tooth and mouth health is recommended.

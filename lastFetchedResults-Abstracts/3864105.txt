Symmetric alpha-stable distributions are a popular statistical model for heavy-tailed phenomena encountered in communications, radar, biomedicine, and econometrics. The use of the symmetric alpha stable model is often supported by empirical evidence, where qualitative criteria are used to judge the fit, leading to subjective decisions. Objective decisions can only be made through quantitative statistical tests. Here, a goodness-of-fit hypothesis test for symmetric alpha-stable distributions is developed based on their unique stability property. Critical values for the test are found using both asymptotic theory and from bootstrap estimates. Experiments show that the stability test, using bootstrap estimates of the critical values, is better able to discriminate between symmetric alpha stable distributions and other heavy-tailed distributions than classical tests such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

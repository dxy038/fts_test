The author discusses superconductor-light interactions. After a brief introduction to the theory of superconductivity concentrates on aspects of particular interest to optical scientists. From the theoretical point of view the coherence of the superconductor wave function leads to interference effects. From an experimental point of view, various possibilities exist for optically controlling, and even creating, devices such as switches and Josephson junctions. The authorÂ´s objective is to present rapidly the theoretical background of superconductivity and light-superconductor interactions and go on to discuss various related experiments and devices

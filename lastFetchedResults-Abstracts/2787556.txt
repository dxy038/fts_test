In this paper, we investigate set Input to State Stability (set-ISS) in the context of multi-agent systems, specifically when agent interaction is spatial in nature. As a case study we consider an aggregative objective with collision avoidance, where it is assumed that interacting agents are symmetrically disturbed. By considering constraints on physical occupancy in the workspace, we obtain insights into the tradeoffs of disturbance, collective behaviors, and the parameters of interaction. Finally, a feedback loop is generated using the disturbance information yielded by set-ISS analysis to strengthen cohesion against disturbance.

Objective: Th e purpose of thi s study was the inve stig ation of
relationship between muscle imbalance syndrome in the lumbo-pelvic
area (Pe lvic Cross Syndrome) which includes the combination of
weakness of phasic muscle s and tightness of postural muscles,
lordosis and chronic low back pain .
Materials & Methods: This study was a comparative - crosssectio
nal and case - co ntro l resear ch. A co nvenie nce sample o f 600
subjec ts partic ipated in this study. Th e size of lordosis, strength of
abdominal and gluteal muscles and the ex tens ibility of iliopsoas and
back ex tenso r mus cles were me asured in each gr oup. Th e best c ut-o ff
values obt ain ed from Recei ver Operating Cha rac teri stic (ROC) c urve
analysis were used to ca tegorize subjec ts as having wea k or tigh t
muscl es in accordan ce with the assumption s. The lumbar lordosis in
subj ec ts with and with out pattern s of muscl e imp airments, and the
associ ation between lordosi s and low back pain was assessed . Data were
analyzed by us ing s tatistical methods such as : ICC, Kolrn ogr off Smirnoff.
Indep end ent T test and ANaYA.
Results: Th e Findings of this s tudy showed no significant difference in the
degree of lord osi s in subjects with and wi thout patt ern s of muscl e
impairment in pelvic cross sy ndrome (P=0.38) and no sig nifica nt di fference
in the lord osi s between subj ec ts with and without low back pain among
those with spec ific pattern s of muscle impairment in pel vic cross sy ndrome
(P=O.62). Data a lso showed no sig nific ant associat ion bet ween de gr ee of
lordosis and low back pain (P=0.2 5).
Conclusion: The findin gs o f thi s study did not support the Pel vic C ross
Syndrome theory, whi ch indi cates certain patterns of muscl e impairment
would lead to exagge rated LL and LBP. Ou r dat a show a rel ation ship
between muscl e impairment and occ urre nce of LBP, but probahl y not via
changing the degree of lumbar lordosis as it has been proposed in PCS
theor y.

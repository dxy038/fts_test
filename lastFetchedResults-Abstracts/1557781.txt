The aim of this work is to analyze the efficiency of a snow fence with airfoil snow plates to avoid the snowdrift formation, to improve visibility and to prevent blowing snow disasters on highways and railways. In order to attain this objective, it is necessary to solve particle transport equations along with the turbulent fluid flow equations since there are two phases: solid phase (snow particles) and fluid phase (air). In the first place, the turbulent flow is modelled by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) equations for incompressible viscous flows through the finite volume method (FVM) and then, once the flow velocity field has been determined, representative particles are tracked using the Lagrangian approach. Within the particle transport models, we have used a particle transport model termed as Lagrangian particle tracking model, where particulates are tracked through the flow in a Lagrangian way. The full particulate phase is modelled by just a sample of about 15,000 individual particles. The tracking is carried out by forming a set of ordinary differential equations in time for each particle, consisting of equations for position and velocity. These equations are then integrated using a simple integration method to calculate the behaviour of the particles as they traverse the flow domain. Finally, the conclusions of this work are exposed.

A class of coordinate descent methods is proposed for the joint detection of binary symbols of K users in a synchronous correlated waveform multiple-access (CWMA) channel with Gaussian noise. We consider the detection problem as one of optimizing a quadratic objective function with binary constraints on decision variables. The proposed coordinate descent methods, while still maintaining a low computational complexity, are shown to provide as much as two orders of magnitude improvement in the probability of error, especially in situations where the existing methods do not perform well. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the proposed methods can be further improved

Cable-Driven Parallel Robot has many advantages. However, the problems of cable collision between each other and environment, the lack of proper structure and non-positive cable tension prevent the spread of them. Therefore, connecting a serial manipulator to mobile platform improves the ability of  object manipulation. This paper investigates the multi-objective optimization structure design and comparative study of spatial constrained and suspended cable-driven parallel robot. Installed serial manipulators possess a full hybrid robotâ€™s features. The workspace volume, kinematic stiffness and sensitivity are three sets of optimization criteria. The workspace volume is calculated by a novel approach of combination constraints to  prevent cables colliding with each other, cable collision with moving platform, uncontrollability and singularity of the robot. First, the range of  forces and torque reaction of the serial manipulator to moving platform is examined. Then, the evolutionary optimization genetic algorithm is used for the multi-objective optimization of constrained and suspended spatial cable-driven parallel robot structure to achieve proper Pareto front confrontation. The Pareto front reconciliation of these three criteria will be discussed. The constrained and suspended optimized by the same criteria will be compared in the same conditions.  It is confirmed that the constrained structure significantly reduced actuation energy to manipulate a serial robot, supply greater workspace and manipulability. The result of this study used for manufacturing and development of a prototype spatial cable-driven parallel robot (RoboCab).

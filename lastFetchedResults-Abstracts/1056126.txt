Umbilical cord can be considered as a source of stem cells with a wide differentiates capacity. It also supplies the embryos 
with blood contains oxygen and vital nutritional elements and may change by some abnormalities during  embryo development. 
The study of different aspects of umbilical cord biology is critical for understanding of pathology and the way of its application 
in a stem cell therapy protocol. The objective of this study was to find the glycoconjugates distribution pattern in various regions 
of the umbilical cord. To do this, umbilical cords  from normal pregnancy were fixed, sectioned and stained with WGA, PNA, 
Concanavalin A, PHy, DBA, SBA and UEA lectins. The  lectins were FITC-conjugated. The slides were counterstained with 
DAPI and observed by fluorescence microscopy. The data showed amnioblasts were reacted with BSA, ConA,UEA, DBA and 
WGA and endothelial cells with BSA and UEA. Smooth muscle also took up BSA, UEA and WGA. Mesenchymal cells at the 
interarterial zone were stained with BSA, ConA and UEA. In conclusion, the staining pattern with lectins was different in various 
zones of umbilical cord. Any modification of this glycoconjugates distribution may be exerted effects  on the proper umbilical 
cord function or structure.

Objective
This study was undertaken to assess the pharmacodynamic profile, safety, and efficacy of tinzaparin during pregnancy.
Study design
Fifty-four pregnant women, 12 for treatment of thrombosis and 42 for thromboprophylaxis, received tinzaparin by once daily injection. Four-hour postdose anti-Xa results were analyzed by use of repeated measures statistical methods.
Results
One woman (3.4%) on the 175 anti-Xa U/kg dose and three women (20%) on the 50 anti-Xa U/kg dose required a dose increase during the initial dose titration phase to achieve target anti-Xa activity. No thrombotic events occurred.
Conclusion
The 175 anti-Xa U/kg dose is appropriate for treatment and for high-risk thromboprophylaxis throughout pregnancy. In pregnant women at moderate risk of thrombosis, a higher tinzaparin dose is required than in the nonpregnant state and 75 anti-Xa U/kg appears to be appropriate. The majority of women do not need a dose increase with advancing gestation.

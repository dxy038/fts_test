A RWA linear programming formulation was formulated and ILP solver was used along with good approximation techniques (heuristic) to solve the static RWA problem The objective was to maximize the one hop traffic, given a set of lightpath requests/traffic demand. However, the proposed heuristic has the limitation of stagnation. Thus we applied ant colony optimization (ACO) combined with heuristic algorithm to solve the assignment problem to obtain best assignment with highest objective value. The ACO based algorithm can outperform the comparison scheme and provide a better performance and more reliable than the proposed heuristic and ILP solver. The claim made in the paper for the proposed new heuristic and ACO are supported by experimental results

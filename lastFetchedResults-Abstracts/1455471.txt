Combustion at programmed temperature in a thermobalance is a rapid technique, which monitors coal burning characteristics and has shown its utility to classify coals according to their combustion performance. However, combustion profiles are affected by different coal properties and characteristics such as particle size, rank, maceral composition and mineral matter content, whose separate effects are difficult to determine. The objective of this work was to ascertain the influence of coaly and mineral matter composition and distribution on burning profiles as determined by thermogravimetric analysis, by using coals of different rank, and fractions of these coals obtained by density separation. Five coals ranging in rank from lignite to anthracite and with variable mineral matter content and composition were used in this study. Density fractions were separated from each coal to obtain samples with different organic/mineral matter proportions. Some of the factors influencing coal combustion profiles are widely recognised as the negative effect of increasing both rank and inertinite content on the reactivity. The favorable effect of mineral matter content on the reactivity has shown to be related to the maceral size within the density fractions and the intimate association organic/mineral matter that favors the diffusion of the reacting gas. Catalytic effects of the mineral matter could not be demonstrated.

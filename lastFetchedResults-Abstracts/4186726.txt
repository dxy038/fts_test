The state-of-the-art objective video quality metrics reported in the literature have so far been focused on TV signals with large frame sizes, full TV frame rates, and high compressed bit rates. The aim of this paper is to present the performance of three widely-known objective video quality metrics but tested on multimedia videos with small frame sizes, various frame rates, and low bit rates. The video quality metrics used were the NTIA video quality metrics (the "general" and the "videoconferencing" models), a modified Watson\Â´s DVQ metric, and the VSSIM metric. The test videos consist of both H.264 and MPEG-4 compressed videos with GIF and QCIF frame sizes, at various bit rates (24 kbps-384 kbps) and frame rates (7.5 fps-30 fps). Here, results and conclusions derived from the comparison of the three metrics will be provided.

Discrete cosine transform (DCT) has been proven to be a good approximation to the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) and has similar properties to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). It also possesses a better energy compaction capability which is advantageous for speech enhancement. However, frame to frame variations of DCT coefficients even for a perfectly stationary signal can be observed. Therefore a DCT-based speech enhancement system with pitch synchronous analysis is proposed to overcome this problem. It reduces the drawbacks of fixed window shift and the amount of shift in the analysis window is now based on the pitch period, thus increasing the inter-frame similarities. Furthermore, a Wiener filter using the a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with an adaptive parameter is also derived and implemented as an advanced noise reduction filter. This proposed speech enhancement system is evaluated in terms of several objective measures and the experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed system.

This paper proposes a vision for a new research domain emerging on the interface between design and manufacturing of VLSI circuits. The key objective of this domain is the minimization of the mismatch between design and manufacturing which is rapidly growing with the increase in complexity of VLSI designs and IC technologies. This broad objective is partitioned into a number of specific tasks. Often, one of the most important tasks is the extraction of VLSI design attributes that may be relevant from a manufacturing efficiency standpoint. The second task is yield analysis performed to detect process and design attributes responsible for inadequate yield. This paper postulates both, an overall change in the design-manufacturing interface, as well as a methodology to address the growing design-manufacturing mismatch. Attributes of a number of tools needed for this purpose are discussed as well

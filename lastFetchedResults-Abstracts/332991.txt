von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an unusual inherited chromosomal dominant disease characterized by CNS hemangioblastomas and visceral neoplasms. Multiple abnormalities may involve the abdomen including pathology in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands. The present case report describes a patient with renal cell carcinoma in von Hippel-Lindau disease. What was most unusual about this case was that the patient also developed pancreatic masses that were metastatic disease from renal cell carcinoma.

                                                                            The freezing of immature testis tissue and then the transplant of it can be considered as a major step in fertility preservation for young boys with cancer, the survival of animal generation exposed to extinction and cloning animalistic desirable species. One of the most prevalent of damages in during the freezing-thawing process is oxidative stress.
                                                                                                        Objectives:
                                                                            The objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant effects of selenium compound (Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>) on rate of seminiferous tubules injury in during of cryopreservation.
                                                                                                        Materials and Methods:
                                                                            In this experimental study, 8 BALB/c immature male mice (6 - 8 days old) were randomly selected, and the testes removed surgically (n = 16). The testes divided into 2 groups: experimental group, control group (opposite testes). For each of the two experimental and control groups, two types of soluble (freezing solution and thawing solution) were prepared. These solutions, which contain 2 mg/mL solution of Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> and control solution, were prepared in the DMEM (Dulbeccoâ€™s modified eagle medium) base medium. Of each group were 4 testes into fast freezing-thawing procedure and 4 testes were into slow freezing-thawing procedure. Then this testis for analyzing injury, after preparatory process, was stained with hematoxylin-eosin.
                                                                                                        Results:
                                                                            At the slow freezing-thawing procedure, seminiferous tubules injury significantly reduced in experimental group compared to control group. At the fast freezing-thawing procedure, seminiferous tubules injury significantly reduced in experimental group compared with of control group.
                                                                                                        Conclusions:
                                                                            It seems that Se due to its antioxidant properties, the harmful effects of freezing-thawing process reduces and protects seminiferous tubules from oxidative injury.

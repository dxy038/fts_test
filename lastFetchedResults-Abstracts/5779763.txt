Transmission of compressed video over error prone channels may result in packet losses or errors, which can significantly degrade the image quality. The error concealment (EC) is used to recover the lost data by the redundancy in videos. 1Seg is a recently widely used mobile TV service, which is one of services of ISDB-T (Integrated Services of Digital Broadcasting-terrestrial) in Japan and Brazil. In 1Seg, errors are drastically increased and lost areas are contiguous. Therefore the errors in earlier concealed MBs (macro blocks) may propagate to the MBs later to be concealed inside the same frame (spatial domain), so called spatial error propagation (SEP). Aiming at SEP reduction, this paper proposes a SEP reduction based EC (SEP-EC). In SEP-EC, besides the mismatch distortion in current MB, the potential propagated mismatch distortion in the following to be concealed MBs is also minimized. Compared with previous work, SEP-EC achieves better image recovery in both subjective and objective observation. The experiments under 1Seg broad-casting simulation confirmed this.

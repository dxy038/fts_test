In this brief, a two-stage approach for the design of 1-D stable variable fractional delay infinite-impulse response (IIR) digital filters is proposed. In the first stage, a set of fixed delay stable IIR filters are designed by minimizing a quadratic objective function, which is defined by integrating error criterion with IIR filter stability constraint condition. Then, the final design is determined by fitting each of the fixed delay filter coefficients as a 1-D polynomial. Two design examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method

In this paper a general methodology for obtaining static stiffness maps in lower mobility parallel manipulators is proposed. The main objective is to define a set of guidelines, which allow the experimental work to be optimized and computational time to be reduced. First, a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) mechanism will be used for methodology validation, since it is the stiffness of the basic kinematic chain of the manipulator that is to be analysed. Two mathematical models of this mechanism and an experimental prototype will be considered for the validation. After that, the methodology will be applied to a lower mobility (4-DOF) parallel manipulator. In this paper, the experimental prototype and its set-up is highly important because some particular features of the experimental analysis will be defined. This paper introduces a key experimental tool: the preload, which allows the clearances and possible assembling errors to be considered. The added value from the application of this procedure is the obtaining of graphs that describe, in an intuitive and useful way, the behaviour of the manipulator's stiffness inside its workspace as a function of the mobile platform position and orientation.

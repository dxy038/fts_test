With the increasing complexity of construction projects grows the challenge of securing safety and achieving desirable productivity as the chief priorities of the construction industry. Addressing these issues requires robust mechanisms for on-site real-time data capturing, information processing and decision-making. The current research aims to further investigate the concept of the Smart Construction Site where workers, equipment, and materials are continuously tracked, and the collected information is processed in near real time to update the design model and the simulation of upcoming tasks, and to provide navigation guidance and safety warnings in case of potential collisions. The objective of our research is to improve the productivity and safety of heavy construction projects by integrating 3D design models (e.g. highway models) with the managerial and operational processes of heavy construction using advanced agent technology and multi-agent systems, real-time simulation, and automated machine control.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inflammation plays an important role in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease. Based on clinical evidence and animal experiments have been preformed, magnesium may be involved in inflammatory processes. The objective of this study was to determine whether serum magnesium (Mg) level is associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) hospitalized in CCU.
METHODS: This cross sectional study was performed on 100 patients (45 males and 55 females) with coronary artery disease who were admitted in CCU ward in Ayatollah Roohani hospital, Babol, Iran. Demographic data were recorded by completing a questionnaire. Serum magnesium, CRP, LDL-C, HDL-C, TC and TG and CRP within first day of admission was measured with a spectrophotometer. 
FINDINGS: According to the obtained results the mean of serum level magnesium in males (2±0.05 mg/dl) was less than females (2.14±0.04 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). After making matched for age, BMI and risk factors were determined serum magnesium levels in patients with myocardial infarction (AMI) (1.9±0.04 mg/dl) significantly was lower than patients with angina (UA) (2.2±0.04 mg/kg) (p < 0.001). Also, inverse correlation was found between serum magnesium and CRP so that CRP values decreased as increasing the amount of serum magnesium (r=-0.703, p < 0.01) and significantly correlation between serum level magnesium and CRP with duration of hospitalization was observed (r = -0.55, p=0.01 and r = 0.5, p=0.01, respectively). 
CONCLUSION: It seems that with increasing serum level of magnesium, severity of inflammation and duration of hospitalization in patients with coronary artery disease was reduced. Probably, measurement and correction of magnesium concentration is involved in improving their clinical conditions.

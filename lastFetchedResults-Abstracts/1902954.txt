The main objective of this study was to develop an optimal cropping pattern for sugar beet growers in Fasa district (Fars province) and to investigate sugar beet importance in cropping pattern. Regarding the effect of risk on producer's decision, two risk sources including price and yield were considered. Data was obtained from Fasa district producers in 2008. In this study multi-objective mathematical programming was used. Results showed 7% difference between current income and optimal cropping pattern. However, they had difference in crop composition. In current pattern, 3.8 hectares out of 6.8 hectares belonged to sugar beet, while in optimal pattern, it reduced to 0.2 hectares. In general, in developed cropping pattern, sugar beet-wheat dominated production composition changes in favor of bean. These changes meet the goal of water use reduction up to 33% in addition to supply the current output. Results showed that farmers pay more attention to price risk in cropping pattern formulation. It was also determined that the inefficiency of sugar beet in using water as  a restricting input has lowered its ranking  in cropping pattern.

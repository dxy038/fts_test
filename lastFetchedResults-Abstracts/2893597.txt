Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) introduces a new direction in todayÂ´s wireless technology, providing an efficient mechanism of spectrum utilization by exploiting the unused spectrum without creating interference to the licensed users, namely primary users (PUs). In order to efficiently facilitate dynamic spectrum access (DSA) to the unlicensed users, namely secondary users (SUs), sensing the spectrum (not only unused but whole spectrum) is a necessary mechanism. In this paper, we propose a co-operative sensing framework, in conformation to the regulations stipulated by IEEE 802.22 WRAN standard. The objective of our work is to provide an efficient, yet, easily implementable spectrum discovery scheme following 802.22 standard. Through our work, we have shown that our proposed sensing framework achieves a lower probability of false detection and shows that the sensing procedure can be carried through less expensive receivers with lower sensitivity than those used in other traditional centralized sensing frameworks.

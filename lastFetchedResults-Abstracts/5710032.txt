Medium-sized and large private companies and public institutions usually have several operational units that enjoy increasing scope to define their own rules for the development of their activities, procedures and modus operandi. From the point of view of the development of specific software to support the activities of these organizations, this freedom means that systems must be sufficiently flexible not only to allow them to be configured to fulfil each unitÂ´s needs and specific modes of operation but also to meet the needs of interaction among them through information exchange. In the case of an application consisting of several subsystems, the existence of a data repository common to all these subsystems means that, although parts of the database are accessed by only one subsystem, the data are stored in a monolithic form, translating into a loss of autonomy of the subsystems involved. The objective of this work is to propose guidelines for the modularization of databases, for both corporate data center schemas and specific schemas for independent units. This modularization not only supports the solutions to the interoperability but also enables information systems based on the data models to be really flexible

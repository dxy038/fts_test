The objective of the PASSWORDS Project is to design and develop a prototype of an intelligent video image analysis system for video surveillance and security applications, based on concrete needs expressed by potential users. The goal of the system developed within PASSWORDS is to detect certain dangerous situations in some scenes (e.g. vandalism in a metro station), providing for example a remote operator with an alarm signal. This paper illustrates the different steps which compose the PASSWORDS system, focusing the attention on the image processing module

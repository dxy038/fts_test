
Objective: Psychological hardiness is a protective personality structure against life stresses
that plays a major role in resisting stressful events. Thus, the present research aimed to predict
the psychological hardiness based on mental health and emotional intelligence in students.
Methods: The method applied in the research was a descriptive-correlation type. A total of
348 students of Payame Noor University, Eleshtar branch, studying in the academic year of
2012/13 were selected through random sampling method. Data were collected through the
psychological hardiness, mental health, and emotional intelligence questionnaires and were
analyzed by the simple correlation coefficient and multiple regressions.
Results: Findings revealed that there was a positive and significant relationship between mental
health and emotional intelligence and its components (self-motivation, self-consciousness,
self-control, social awareness, and social skills) with psychological hardiness. Also, step
by step regression results indicated that self-motivation (β =0.386), self-control (β=0.229),
social skills (β=0.239), and social consciousness (β=0.210) are highly capable of predicting
psychological hardiness scores.
Conclusion: By promoting psychological hardiness through increasing mental health and
emotional intelligence, we can overcome stressful and anxious factors, as well as factors
resulting in most psychological problems.

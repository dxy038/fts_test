This book is an attempt to introduce electromagnetic applications to personnel with a non-electrical- engmeering background. The topics covered range from introduction of wave theory to different types of antennas. As the authors indicate, the objective of this book is not to confuse the non-specialist with detailed analysis, but to introduce him to the concepts of electromagnetics with regard to antenna applications. This book will certainly aid many electromagnetic specialists in tailoring courses for non-electromagnetic engineers. Specific topics in each of the 14 chapters are identified next.

Cross-layer designs for OFDMA systems have been shown to offer significant gains of spectral efficiency by exploiting the multiuser diversity over the temporal and frequency domains. In this paper, we shall propose a robust optimal cross-layer design for downlink TDD-OFDMA systems with imperfect channel state information at the base station (CSIT) and unknown interference in slow fading channels. Exploiting the ACK/NAK (1-bit) feedbacks from the mobiles, the proposed cross-layer design does not require knowledge of the CSIT error statistics or interference statistics. To take into account of the potential packet error due to the imperfect CSIT and unknown interference, we define average system goodput (which measures the average b/s/Hz successfully delivered to the mobile) as our optimization objective. We formulate the cross-layer design as a state-space control problem. The optimal power, optimal rate and optimal user allocations are determined as the output equations from the system states based on dynamic programming approach. Simulation results illustrate that the performance of the proposed closed-loop cross-layer design is very robust with respect to imperfect CSIT, unknown interference, model mismatch as well as channel variations due to Doppler.

Accurate segmentation of the 30+ subcortical structures in MR images of whole diseased brains is challenging due to inter-subject variability and complex geometry of brain anatomy. However a clinically viable solution yielding precise segmentation of the structures would enable: 1) accurate, objective measurement of structure volumes many of which are associated with diseases such as Alzheimer´s, 2) therapy monitoring and 3) drug development. Our contributions are two-fold. First we construct an extended adaptive statistical atlas method (EASA) to use a non-stationary relaxation factor rather than a global one. This permits finer control over adaptivity allowing 34 structures to be simultaneously segmented rather than just 4 as in [13]. Second we use the output of a weighted majority voting (WMV) label fusion multi-atlas method as the input to EASA in a hybrid WMV-EASA approach. We assess our proposed approaches on 18 healthy subjects in the public IBSR database and on 9 subjects with Alzheimer´s disease in the AIBL database. EASA is shown to produce state-of-the-art accuracy on healthy brains in a fraction of the time of comparable methods, while our hybrid WMV-EASA visibly improves segmentation accuracy for structures throughout the diseased brains.

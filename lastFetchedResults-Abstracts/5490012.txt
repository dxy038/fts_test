Global Gb logic developments involve major technology approaches in GaAs ICs, silicon ICs and Josephson junctions. With major performance advances occurring rapidly in each area, it is important to maintain objective comparisons of the technologies. Valid comparisons require evaluation against extended objectives which include not only power-delay products, but also other measures of total performance including interfacing capabilities, design flexibility, technology investment requirements, product reliability and manufacturability. These objectives will be the context in which recent Gb logic achievements will be surveyed and compared.

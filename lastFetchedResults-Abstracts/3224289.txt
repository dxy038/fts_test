Theory of computation is always been an issue for the students to understand. This paper present a algorithm which will simplify the method to design Deterministic finite automata that accept strings over input symbol a, b having exactly x number of a &amp; y number of b. Objective of the research is to make the method of teaching learning easier, simpler and understandable for students. In this paper we develop an algorithm to design finite automata that accept strings over input symbol a, b having exactly x number of a &amp; y number of b.

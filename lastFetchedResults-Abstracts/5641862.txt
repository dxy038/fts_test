The Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission has been providing L-band multi-angular brightness temperature observations at a global scale since its launch in November 2009 and has performed well in the retrieval of soil moisture. The multiple incidence angle observations are not obtained at fixed values and the resolution and accuracy change with the grid locations over SMOS snapshot images. Radio frequency interference issues and aliasing at lower look angles increases the uncertainty of observations and thereby affects the soil moisture retrieval that utilizes observations at specific angles. In this study, we propose a processing chain that uses a mixed objective function based on SMOS L1c data products to refine the characteristics of multi-angular observations. The approach was validated using simulations from a radiative transfer model and analyzed over three external targets: Amazon rainforest, Sahara desert, and Antarctic ice. These results could provide insights for selecting and utilizing external targets as part of the upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission.

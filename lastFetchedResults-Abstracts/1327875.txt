The paper focuses on the search for the optimal operation modes of a complex thermal plant. The system under analysis is basically made-up by four gas-fueled reciprocating engines with heat recovery. Each engine can drive simultaneously an electric generator as well as the compressor of a heat-pump/chiller. The plant is interconnected to the electric utility grid, both to receive additional power and to deliver power in excess. In addition, each heat-pump/chiller can be driven electrically, using the electric generator as a motor. For any given load condition, a large number of operation modes are possible. The problem of finding out the configuration that minimizes the economic cost of operating the system is dealt with. This cost is regarded as the objective function to be minimized in a typical constrained optimization problem. Statement and solution of this problem are discussed. Numerical examples are included and commented.

In this correspondence, we address statistically robust multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay design problems under two imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios: (1) a ll nodes have imperfect CSI and (2) the destination node knows the exact CSI, while the other nodes have imperfect CSI. For each scenario, we develop robust source and relay matrices by considering a broad class of frequently used objective functions in MIMO system design and the averaged transmission power constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the improved robustness of the proposed algorithms against CSI errors.

A systematic procedure for the design of a new controller for an electronic tap changer has been described in Part I of this paper. The objective of this paper is to introduce quick measurement techniques of voltage amplitude and a phase angle for the controller and recommend the most convenient technique. One major assumption in the design of the controller in Part I of the paper was that a quick technique was available for detecting the amplitude and phase angle of the sinusoidal variables. In order to validate the design procedure, a designed prototype electronic tap changer is built and tested

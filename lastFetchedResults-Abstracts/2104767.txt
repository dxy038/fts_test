The objective of this study was to determine cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression profiles in tracheobronchial lymph nodes from pigs singularly infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MHYO), or coinfected with both. Twenty-eight pigs were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) negative controls (NEG), (2) inoculated with MHYO (IMHYO), (3) inoculated with MHYO and PCV2 (CoI), and (4) inoculated with PCV2 (IPCV2). MHYO infection significantly (P &lt; 0.05) stimulated innate cytokines, IL1B and IL8. PCV2 infection significantly stimulated expression of IFNG, IL8, NOS2A and chemokines CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10. IFNB, IL1B and IL12 were slightly increased with PCV2 infection and IFNA and IL4 were significantly downregulated. Compared to NEG pigs, coinfection resulted in a significant increase in expression of IFNG, IL1B, IL8, CCL5, CXCL10, and weak stimulation of IFNB, IL6 and IL10; IL13 and IFNA were significantly downregulated. Overall MHYO potentiated PCV2 infection by increasing IFNG and IL10 mRNA expression levels. The increase of IFNG and chemokines and decrease of IFNA in IPCV2 and CoI pigs were correlated with increased severity of lymphoid lesions and the presence of PCV2 antigen. In summary, this work provided evidence that the increased severity of lesions in PCV2 and MHYO coinfected pigs was associated mainly with the presence of PCV2 antigen and alterations of cytokine mRNA expression profiles.

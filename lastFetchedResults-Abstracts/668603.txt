This paper discusses the question “Does LCA lead to environmental benefits along the product chain in German industry?” Two of eight case studies conducted and the insights gained are presented. Afterwards, the essential determinants that have an obvious influence on the application of LCA in a negative or positive way are elaborated on. They can be assigned to different categories, such as information, economic aspects, or organisational issues. The paper concludes that the environmental benefits that may occur are strongly dependent on the pattern of application, i.e. the objective in carrying out an LCA study, and the number and interests of the personnel involved along the chain. Finally, the authors give a few recommendations as to a more effective use of this instrument

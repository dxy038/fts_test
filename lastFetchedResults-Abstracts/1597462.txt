The main goal of the Generation-IV nuclear-energy systems is to address the fundamental research and development issues necessary for establishing the viability of next-generation reactor concepts to meet future needs for clean and reliable energy production. Generation-IV reactor concepts are being developed to use more advanced materials, coolants and higher burn-ups fuels, while keeping a nuclear reactor safe and reliable.

 the six Generation-IV concepts is a supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR), which continues the utilization of well-known light-water-reactor technologies. Research Centre Rez Ltd. has taken part in a large European joint-research project dedicated to Generation-IV light-water reactors with objectives to contribute to the fundamental research and development of the SCWRs by designing and building a test facility called “supercritical water loop (SCWL)”.

in objective of this loop is to serve as an experimental facility for in-core and out-of-core corrosion studies of structural materials, testing and optimization of suitable water chemistry for future SCWRs, studies of water radiolysis at supercritical conditions and nuclear fuels. This paper summarizes the concept of the SCWL, its design, utilization and first results obtained from non-active tests already performed within the supercritical-water conditions.

The objective of this study is to assess the clinical performance of a novel ultrasound bidirectional axial transmission (BDAT) prototype. The speed of sound of the first arriving signal (V<sub>FAS</sub>) was measured in the radius and tibia of 58 postmenopausal females. An optimized V<sub>FAS</sub> measurement protocol was introduced in order to reduce the clinical measurement time and increase the robustness in particular for patients with pronounced body mass index (BMI). The optimized protocol was efficient and showed excellent discrimination performance: the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was found for V<sub>FAS</sub> radius (OR=2.60; AUC=0.89). In comparison, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) values of the lumbar spine (OR=1.89; AUC=0.87) exhibited comparable fracture discrimination performance compared to the ultrasonic method.

The demonstration will show ECG signal acquisition and processing on a dedicated System-on-a-Chip (SoC) [1], and display of the raw and processed data on the screen of a laptop. This SoC has been developed within the European project IcyHeart [2]. The objective of the IcyHeart project was to investigate and demonstrate a highly integrated and power-efficient microelectronic solution for remote monitoring of a personÂ´s electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. A complete SoC has been developed by CSEM which embarks, on a single chip, an ultra-low power signal acquisition front-end, an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) for ECG, a low-power 32-bit digital signal processor (DSP), and a low-energy radio frequency (RF) transceiver. The SoC enables 3-lead ECG monitoring.

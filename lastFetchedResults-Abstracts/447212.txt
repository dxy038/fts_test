PURPOE: To report a cae of blindne caued by a white-matter injury after whole brain irradiation for metatatic renal cell carcinoma.

METHOD: Cae report. We performed comprehenive erial neuro-ophthalmologic examination.

REULT: Four to 5 month after reection of renal cell metatai in the left occipital cortex, interleukin-2 therapy, and whole brain irradiation with 3,000 cGy plu a 1,500-cGy boot to the poterior third of the brain, the patient developed a progreive decline in viual acuity in both eye to hand motion. Magnetic reonance imaging dicloed ignal abnormalitie without ma effect in the white matter of the parietal and occipital lobe bilaterally, including the optic radiation.

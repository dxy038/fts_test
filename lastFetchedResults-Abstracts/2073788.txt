The population of Laos PDR has increased rapidly in recent years, reaching 2.5% per annum. This growth threatens food security, which in Asia is often equated with rice production. The country has to feed almost 50% more people now than 16 years ago. The role of aquatic rice field species in rural Laotian diets has been underestimated, as almost 200 species are consumed, supplying a range of nutrients needed by the villagers. Nevertheless, national and regional food composition databases contain limited information on the nutritional composition of these species. Field sampling was undertaken in Champasak and Savannakhet provinces for nine species of aquatic animals, including fish, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs and insects. Four samples of fermented fish products were included. The objective was to gain knowledge on the nutritional composition of the aquatic species included in Laotian diets. The aquatic animals consumed on a daily basis contained high amounts of protein (11.6–19.7% for fish, crustaceans, molluscs, amphibians and insects and 3.3–7.8% for fermented fish), and a generally acceptable essential amino acid profile. They were also excellent sources of calcium, iron and zinc. However, they had low contents of fat (0.1–4.6%), fatty acids and vitamin A. Essential amino acids, iron and zinc are nutrients that are scarce in rural Laotian diets. As the food supply of rural households in rice farming areas of Laos is critically dependent on the environment, the sustainable existence of the rice field aquatic animals is a crucial factor for the nutritional status of the Laotians.

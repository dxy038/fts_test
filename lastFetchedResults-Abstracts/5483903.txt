DC-to-DC converters are widely used in applications such as computer power supplies, car auxiliary power supplies, servomotor drives and medical equipments. Luo converter is a recently developed DC-DC converter. Positive output Luo converter performs the conversion from positive source voltage of one level to positive load voltage of another required level. Parallel connection of Luo converters are used when available converters are of lower current rating but load requires higher current. Because of dissimilarity in devices and components used in each converter, current drawn or supplied by each converter may be unequal which will lead to converter failure or mal-operation. Therefore the main control issues in parallel-connected converters are to equalize the output currents among the converters and to ensure constant load voltage under supply and load disturbances. The objective of this work is to develop fuzzy logic control (FLC) for paralleled positive output Luo converters using MATLAB software. The simulation results are presented and evaluated. They validate the fuzzy logic control developed

Since 1993 the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory and the University of Oklahoma (UO) Department of Meteorology have collaborated to investigate tornadoes using the UMass 95 GHz polarimetric cloud radar. The project objective is to obtain high resolution horizontal cross section images of the reflectivity and velocity structure of a tornado and its vicinity in a supercell storm. To accurately measure the high wind speeds and gradients inside a tornado, a dual polarization pulse pair technique was implemented. This paper describes the technique and presents high resolution images of the hook echo and forward flank down draft of a supercell storm

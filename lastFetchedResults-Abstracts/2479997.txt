Venous thromboembolism is a serious complication among hospitalized patients. Infectious diseases are known as a risk factor for thrombo-embolic events. The aim of the study is to evaluate incidence, characteristic pattern, and risk factors for thrombo-embolic events among patients hospitalized with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. This cohort study was performed among 1,153 new cases of tuberculosis. Suspected patients for DVT (deep venous thrombosis) or PTE (pulmonary thromboembolism) were investigated by Doppler sonography and pulmonary CT angiography. Another 100 tuberculosis patients without thromboembolism were also observed as control group. The incidence of diagnosed thrombo-embolic complication was 32 of 1,153 admitted patients (2.8%; 95% confidence interval: 1.9 to 3.9) with a median interval of 14 days after anti-TB treatment initiation. The incidence of DVT and PTE was 2% and 1%, respectively. Thrombo-embolic events and DVT were more common in men than in women: 4.2% versus 1.3% (P = 0.003) and 3.5% versus 0.4%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Hypertension and opium addiction were significantly correlated with thromboembolism. Incidence of DVT and PTE is noticeable among patients with tuberculosis

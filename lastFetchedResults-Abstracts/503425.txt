Background and Objectives: Neonatal jaundice is one of the most common problems during neonatal period. The objective of this study was to determine whether measurement of total serum Bilirubin (TSB) by transcutaneous method (BiliCheck) correlates with spectrophotometric and Diazo methods or not.Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional and descriptive study from October 2006 to November 2007 total Serum bilirubin levels were measured in a group of term neonates with hyperbilirubinemia by three methods: Diazo, spectrophotometric and Bilicheck , data were gathered and analyzed by Pierson's Correlation Coefficient and Chi square tests.Results: The study group consisted of 85 infants with hyperbilirubinemia (M/F 47/38). Result of measurement of total serum Bilirubin with: Diazo, spectrophotometric and Bilicheck were (16.74 ± 4.39) mg/dl, (16.16 ± 4.57) and (14.73 ± 3.48), respectively. Significant direct liner correlation was found between total serum bilirubin measured by Bilicheck, Diazo and spectrophotometric methods. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of Bilicheck method in comparison with Diazo method were 94/82%, 44/5%, 78/57% and 80%, respectively.Conclusion: Transcutaneous Bilirubinometry by Bilicheck is a simple and accurate method for measurement of serum Bilirubin level in neonates

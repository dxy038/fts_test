The objective of this study was to define the complement of ampullary and isthmic oviductal fluid proteins that associate with the sperm membrane during the non-luteal and luteal stages of the oestrous cycle. Oviductal fluid was obtained from three dairy cows via indwelling cannulae in the ampulla and isthmus of the same oviduct. Daily samples of oviductal fluid were combined by region and stage of the cycle to create pools consisting of non-luteal isthmic, luteal isthmic, non-luteal ampullary, and luteal ampullary oviductal fluid. An aliquot from each oviductal fluid pool was biotinylated by incubation in biotin reagent. Spermatozoa from three fertile bulls were pooled, washed and incubated for 4 h in each of the four pools of biotinylated oviductal fluid. After incubation, sperm membrane proteins were solubilized, and proteins subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting. The biotinylated oviductal fluid proteins that associated with the sperm membranes were detected by avidinâ€“horseradish peroxidase and diaminobenzidine substrate. Eight oviductal fluid proteins with apparent molecular weights of 97, 75, 66, 55, 48, 34, 28 and 24 kDa were consistently detected to associate with the sperm membrane. Differences in ampullar and isthmic fluid proteins that associated with sperm during the luteal and non-luteal stage of the oestrous cycle were not detected.

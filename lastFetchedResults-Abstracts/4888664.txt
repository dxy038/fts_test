Summary form only given. In order to realize the goal of a nationwide electronic scheduling environment as an integral part of the second phase of OASIS, it has been determined that business practices involved in the conduct of inter-RTO energy transactions will need to be standardized. To provide a basic framework about which to structure a set of uniform business practices, the NERC reliability model is used. The reliability model is a functionally oriented view of the entities that are involved in managing all aspects of interconnected system operation. The NERC model defines the entities involved in all aspects of inter-RTO transactions according to their most basic functions. In addition, it identifies three time intervals with regard to the scheduling process. These are Making Deals or transacting, Scheduling and Approvals, and Real Time. NERC has identified for each time period the responsibilities, interactions and communications between the entities defined in the model. Within this framework, there are identified critical business practices that are necessary to maintain reliability, promote equitable transmission access, and to enhance market and process efficiency. In fashioning the set of business practices presented here, we have consciously set the bar high. In other words, the primary objective is to fashion a set of rules that make the best sense rather than either necessarily trying to accommodate everyone\´s current practices or taking a "least common denominator" approach. For some, the changes needed to comply will be significant. However, taken in the context of FERC\´s view of the end state of RTO formation, these changes are perhaps more consistent.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to ascertain the types and frequency of pathologic conditions associated with atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance on Papanicolaou smears.
STUDY DESIGN: A 5-year retrospective review of screening cervical cytologic examinations diagnosed as atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance was performed at the University of Virginia to determine pathologic findings associated with atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance on Papanicolaou smears stratified by subtype and overall.
RESULTS: Pathologic findings for the respective Papanicolaou smears with the diagnosis of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance not otherwise specified, favor benign, squamous intraepithelial lesions, and favor neoplasia through the follow-up interval were as follows: squamous intraepithelial lesions in 11%, 8%, 38%, and 20%; adenocarcinoma in situ in 3%, 0%, 0%, and 10%; endometrial hyperplasia in 3%, 5%, 1%, and 2%; and cancer in 8%, 3%, 1%, and 7%. Overall, 63 patients (32%) had preinvasive or invasive lesions.
Conclusions: Atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance on Papanicolaou smears were correlated with significant findings in 45% of patients (32% with preinvasive or invasive lesions and 13% with benign lesions). A prompt and aggressive workup is recommended. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179: 382-90.)

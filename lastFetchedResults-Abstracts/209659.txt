Introduction: Some of periapical lesions could be observed in a radiograph but the exact diagnosis is reach after
microscopic evaluation. Unfortunately, in many cases periapical lesions are not diagnose because lack of a
radiograph and then the dentist may pull the lesion out completely or incompletely. In this situation remains of
the lesion can creat next problems.
Objective: Determine frequency of periapical lesions among extracted teeth and classify them according to
microscopic evaluation.
Materials and Methods: This is a cross- sectional study. It was done in dental's offices and clinics in Rasht
during 8 weeks, forty two lesions were collected among 5900 extracted teeth. The information was recorded and
the lesions were sent within fonnalinlO% to Pathology Laboratory in Poursina Hospital. The lesions were sliced
by microtome, Stained (H and E), and then they were observed by a pathologist. The lesions were classified and
statistical analysis was done by EPI calculator and SPSS 11.5.
Results: 42 teeth (0.7]%) had periapical lesions among 5900 extracted teeth. After microscopic evaluation the
lesions were classified as periapical granuloma (57.14%), periapical cyst (33.33%) and other lesions (9.53%). In
this study the frequency of the lesions was similar in both sex, and patients often were between 3rd to 5lh decades
of their life. The must frequent location of the lesions in the jaw was in the posterior of maxilla. posterior of
mandible, anterior of maxi lIa and anterior of mandible consequently.
Conclusion: Almost there are seven periapical lesions among 1000 extracted teeth.
Although the frequency of periapical lesions seems to be infrequent, all the periapical lesions should be sent to
laboratory because lesions like mural ameloblastoma and traumatic bone cyst might be needed different
treatment.

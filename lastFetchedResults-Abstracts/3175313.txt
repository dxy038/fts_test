On the basis of reservoir utilization scheduling characteristics involving multiple objectives, constraints and many uncertainties, from the start of the basic meaning of risk analysis, a risk analysis framework for multipurpose reservoir scheduling was proposed, which is focus on analysis of decision-making of multi-objective optimization scheme, including the objective value function, risk evaluation index system and evaluation model weights, and finally a common purpose reservoir scheduling risk analysis techniques and methods is established. The example shows that the theoretical method is effective. The relationship curve about risk and benefit proved, reflects the mean of risk analysis, is also helpful for decision makers with different risk preferences to scheme scheduling decisions, and provides a technical support for the multipurpose reservoir scheduling.

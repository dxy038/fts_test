Partner selection is an important decision problem in Agile Supply Chain. Since it is a non-analytical objective function and cannot be solved by general quantification methods, soft computing which is a fuzzy logic operation embedded heuristic genetic algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal solution. The experiments of practical scale suggest that the model and methods are effective and possible to achieve optimal solution quickly.

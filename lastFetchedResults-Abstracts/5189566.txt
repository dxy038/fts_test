Due to the proliferation of devices emitting electromagnetic radiation, there has been a renewed focus to study the harmful, as well as the beneficial effects of electromagnetic radiation. Radiation from cell phone and devices operating in GSM-900 band are likely to have effects on living organism and needs investigation. Recent works in this area include the effects of cellular phone radiation on blood-brain barrier connections, cell toxicity and on carcinogenic. In diabetic related studies, which are an important topic area, studies on the effect of cell phone exposure on brain glucose metabolism and the effects of transient EM fields on the plasma glucose levels in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics have been reported. The study of the effects of cell phone radiation to blood sugar levels, therefore, is another area of interest and needs investigation. In our presentation we will discuss the results of 900 MHz uniform EM fields on high blood sugar concentration using a GTEM cell. The objective of this study is to investigate the glucose levels, red and white blood cell viabilities in human blood at 900 MHz at an input powers of 2 W and 60 W. The 2W power level simulates a handset phone, while the 60 W signals are from a cell phone tower. These power-signals are generated inside the GTEM cell designed for the purpose.

Background
opyridine (4-AP) given to patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) has shown beneficial effects in some somatic and autonomic functions, although patients often develop dyspeptic symptoms. 4-AP is a potassium-channel blocker capable of altering gastro-pyloric functions as demonstrated experimentally. Our objective was to examine the influence of 4-AP treatment on gastric emptying in patients with chronic SCI.
s
c emptying was measured by the acetaminophen absorption test in 18 patients (9 with cervical and 9 with thoracic injury), and 9 healthy volunteers. Patients received increasing oral doses, 5 mg day−1 of oral 4-AP (5–30 mg day−1), for 12 weeks. Patients were studied before and at the end of the last week of 4-AP treatment, whereas healthy volunteers (without 4-AP treatment) were studied only once. Whole blood samples of 2.5 mL were drawn at 0 (before 1 g of oral acetaminophen) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 min postdose. Acetaminophen concentration in plasma was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography.
s
ent with 4-AP significantly delayed stomach emptying in patients with chronic SCI, considering the significant decreasing of acetaminophen absorption (t paired test, p &lt;0.05). This effect did not correlate either to the level or ASIA score of the injury (linear regression correlation analysis, r2 = 0.003 and 0.015, respectively). No significant differences were observed by comparing data of patients before 4-AP treatment with healthy volunteers.
sions
ntake in patients with chronic spinal cord injury significantly slowed gastric emptying regardless of level and ASIA score of the injury.

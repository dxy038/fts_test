Introduction: In the orthotic and prosthetic workshops, awkward postures, repetitive and continuously movements etc. are the risk factors of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). This study was conducted with the objective of ergonomic assessment of working conditions in these workshops. 
Material and Methods: In this study all employed personnel of linorthotic and prosthetic production centers in Shiraz city participated (n=42).Data were collected using Nordic Musculoskeletal disorders Questionnaire (NMQ) and Ergonomic Risk Factor checklist (ERF)for assessment of working conditions .Data analysis was performed using SPSS software (Ver. 16).
Results: The means (SD) of age and job tenure (years) in employees studied were 37.26 (10.21) and 12.8 (9.39), respectively .The most prevalent MSDs symptoms were reported in lower back (42.9%), shoulder (40.5%) and knee (40.5%).Working condition assessment by ERF check list revealed that the means core of upper and lower region of body and also mean of total score were higher than acceptable limit (more than 7)..
Conclusion: In working conditions improvement, corrective measures and MSDs risk factors control in studied workers should be noted to risk factors in low back, shoulder and knee. The results of this study showed that ergonomic problems in orthotics and prosthetics clinics was related to "custom shoe making", "grinding and finishing", "filling plaster cast" and "positive cast rectification" tasks and ergonomic interventions to decrees and/or eliminate of awkward working posture needed corrections.

SEMG (surface EMG) has many benefits, for example measuring SEMG is easy and a characteristic pattern of SEMG is obtained for each different movement. Therefore, SEMG that is generated by body movement is able to use as a control signal for some electric powered equipments. Our objective is the perfect control of the computer by using SEMG that is generated from forearms. In this paper, we will talk about our developed interface system that works as a keyboard of the computer

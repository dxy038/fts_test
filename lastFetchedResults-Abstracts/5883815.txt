This paper attempts to explore a new method to improve the teaching of algorithmic for beginners. It is well known that algorithmic is a difficult field to teach for teacher and complex to assimilate for learner. These difficulties are due to intrinsic characteristics of this field and to the manner that teachers (the majority) apprehend its bases. However, in a Technology Enhanced Learning environment (TEL), assessment, which is important and indispensable, is the most delicate phase to implement, for all problems that generate (noise...). Our objective registers in the confluence of these two axes. For this purpose, we focused essentially to elaborate an assessment approach of algorithmic competences in a TEL environment. This approach consists in modeling an algorithmic solution according to basic and elementary operations which let learner draw his/her own step with all autonomy and independently to any programming language. This approach assures a trilateral assessment: summative, formative and diagnostic assessment.

Computer aided Maintenance planning for mechanical equipment is presented in this work to implement the optimized extensive maintenance plan at a specific time horizon. The objective is to interchange the unscheduled corrective maintenance into scheduled preventive maintenance depending on historical data of equipment. This work is concerned with development of reliability analysis based on Weibull distribution. An optimization technique has been developed to provide the optimized preventive maintenance plan for the whole equipment during a required time horizon.

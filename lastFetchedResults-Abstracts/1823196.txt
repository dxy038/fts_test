Objective
al curvatures in human adult dentition such as the curve of Spee, curve of Wilson and Monsons's sphere provide clinical guidance for prosthetic rehabilitation and orthodontic treatment. However, association between occlusal curvature and masticatory function is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between occlusal curvature and food comminuting and food mixing ability in human young adults with permanent dentitions.

young adults with complete dentitions (mean age, 25.0 years) participated in the study. Occlusal curvature was determined by a three-dimensional analysis of the mandibular arch according to the Broadrick flag method. Food comminuting ability was assessed using a masticatory performance test with peanuts as test food and it was scored as median particle size. Food mixing ability was assessed using a mixing ability test with a two-coloured wax cube and it was scored as mixing ability index.
s
ar regression analysis identified the sphere radius of occlusal curvature as significant predictor for both median particle size and mixing ability index after controlling for maximum bite force (P &lt; 0.001). These results indicated that subjects with a flatter curvature (larger sphere) in the mandibular arch showed better food comminuting and mixing ability. Coefficient of determination (R2) of occlusal curvature related to median particle size and mixing ability index was comparable to that of maximum bite force.
sion
al curvature seems to be associated with food comminuting and mixing ability in human young adults with permanent dentitions.

Although multicarrier on-off keying (MOOK) is a relatively bandwidth inefficient technique, the simplicity of its transmitter-receiver pair and inherent coding ability make it a popular choice for a number of communication systems. This technique however is particularly susceptible to frequency selective fading channels which are often encountered in the wireless environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate and analyse bandwidth efficient diversity exploitation techniques with the objective to enhance the performance of this technique. A hybrid frequency-amplitude diversity scheme is proposed. It will be shown that significant performance enhancement can be achieved in frequency selective fading channels, and at no extra bandwidth degradation.

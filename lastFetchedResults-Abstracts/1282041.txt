Background and Objective: Evidence exist that polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is responsible for a high percentage of women infertility during reproductive age. In this study, the correction of this problem by hyper-activation of nitric oxide (NO) system was studied in rats. 

Materials and Methods: Female Wistar rats (weighing 200-250 g) were kept as virgin diestrous under standard conditions. One group of the rats was i.p. injected with L-arginine (50 mg/kg) through a period lasting nine days/once a day. Another group received naloxone (0.4 mg/kg), 30 min prior to i.p. injection of L-arginine during the experimental phase. The third group was injected with a single dose of naloxone (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.). The control group solely received saline (1 ml/kg, i.p.). 

Results: Ovaries from L-arginine treated rats showed polycystic characteristics in comparison with the control; this feature was resolved in the naloxone treated groups. The endometrium due to L-arginine showed inflammation, however, its growth or folding were significant in naloxone treated rats.

Conclusion: Naloxone intervenes with the PCOS induced by over-activation of NOS. This research likely represents the case of infertility in the animal model of PCOS. The study may open a new gate towards the naloxone efficacy on infertility induced of PCOS.

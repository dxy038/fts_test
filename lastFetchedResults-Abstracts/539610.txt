 The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of carboxylic acid supplementation on growth rate and some relevant biochemical values in growing lambs. Ten Egyptian male lambs (12-18 keg live body weight) were divided into two equal groups. Group 1 lambs, did not receive any supplement (The control group). Group 2 lambs were supplemented with 4g /head /day of carboxylic acid salt = malate. Lambs were fed a balanced ration ad libidum. Body weights were monthly recorded and blood samples were taken each two weeks. Results indicated that the body weight gain increased (P<0.05) in supplemented than the control lambs. Concentrations of serum glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides were higher in supplemented than control lambs. Serum total protein and globulins obviously increased in the supplemented lambs, Vitamin C and glutathione-S-transferase serum concentrations increased (P<0.05) during most times of the experiment. Plasma malondialdehyde decreased (P<0.05) in supplemented lambs. The levels of serum copper and zinc increased (P<0.05) in the most times of the study, especially serum zinc values after withdrawal. B- hydroxybutyric acid concentration increased (P<0.05), especially after first two weeks of the trial. Serum testosterone level increased (P<0.05) in supplemented than control lambs. It was concluded that malate can be used safely as feed additive in growing male lambs as it improved weight gain and increased values of glucose,cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, globulins and antioxidants (vitamin C, glutathione S-transferase, copper and zinc) and testosterone with decreased value of lipid peroxide (malondialdehyde).

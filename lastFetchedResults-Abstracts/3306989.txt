Overlay routing has emerged as a promising approach to improve reliability and efficiency of the Internet. In this paper, we study the problem of recovery path selection, whose objective is to select a proper one-hop recovery path with minimum cost in path probing and measurement, when the default physical path and the overlay backup path suffer from simultaneous failures. Spurred by the observation that a few relay nodes with high betweenness centrality, which are called Super-Relay nodes, can provide more optimal routes for a large number of node pairs, we propose one-hop overlay path recovery model by introducing Super-Relay nodes (OHPR). Simulations based on a real ISP network and a synthetic Internet topology show that our approach can provide high-quality overlay routing service, and can achieve better robustness by choosing more reliable one-hop alternative path.

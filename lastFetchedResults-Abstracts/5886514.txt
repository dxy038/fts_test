We have been developing a passive motion exercise system for ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion that can be applied to patients with complicated ankle joint deformity. The developed system is expected to reduce edema in lower limbs, and currently we are aiming to find objective indicators for volume of edema by the use of our system. In this paper, the effects of passive motion provided with an ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion exercise system on peripheral circulation are examined. The result indicated that skin blood flow and surface skin temperature of the elderly subjects changed associated with passive motion, which suggests that decreased peripheral circulation can be improved with passive motion.

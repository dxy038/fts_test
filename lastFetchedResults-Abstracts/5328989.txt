Our main focus in this paper is to determine the most appropriate method for assessing the Quality of Experience (QoE) in the context of Multiple Description Coding (MDC) video streaming, over multiple overlay paths, in video distribution networks (VDN). For this objective, we compare three different types of QoE assessment approaches, subjective approach, objective approach and a hybrid approach that can overcome the limitations of both subjective and objective ones. Results show how the hybrid Pseudo-Subjective Quality Assessment (PSQA) tool can outperform the well-known peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) as well as the subjective methods for evaluating the perceived video quality in our context of MDC streaming.

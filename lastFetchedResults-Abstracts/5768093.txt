Reactive power dispatch problem is still an active problem in the area of power system operation. Finding an optimum solution that provides a balance between system performance and the cost associated with the reactive power placement (in terms of improved voltage profile and voltage stability) is essential. The objective of the research is to explore the applicability of a new emerging global optimization technique, called a genetic algorithm to the reactive power dispatch problem. The algorithm is based on the mechanics of natural selection and has been tested in other fields with promising results

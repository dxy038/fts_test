Objective (s): Health-promoting behaviors of individuals are important determinants of health status. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Iranian version of health-promoting lifestyle profile II (HPLP II) among adolescent girls. 
Methods: Pender's Health Promotion Model was the theoretical framework for this cross-sectional study of a sample of 500 high school girls (grade9-11), in Kashan, Iran. The HPLP II reliability was estimated using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest. Concurrent validity was estimated by performing Pearson’s correlation between the HPLP II, and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), perceived self-efficacy. In addition confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed in order to evaluate construct validity. The data were analyzed using SPSS v.18 and LISREL8.8 programs.
Results: The Cronbach’s ? coefficient was 0.86 for the instrument and for subscales ranged from 0.70 to 0.77. The correlation between the HPLP II and the SF-12 and perceived self-efficacy were significant as expected. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded a good estimate of fit (?2=6.34، df =2، P = 0.420،NFI = 0.99، CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.066).
Conclusion: The psychometric properties of Iranian version of HPLP II showed satisfactory results and now it can be used in studies of health promotion among young adolescents.

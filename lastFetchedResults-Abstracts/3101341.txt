In order to promote the cooperation between enterprises in networked manufacturing alliance enterprise, and make development and manufacture resource optimally collocate and share among alliance enterprises, and raise the rate of alliance enterpriseÂ´s development and the utilization of manufacture resource, and reduce the waste for repetitive investment, fuzzy assignment as well as genetic algorithm are adopted in the research of optimal scheduling of resources. Optimal scheduling of product development resources have been described, and mathematical model of optimal scheduling of product development resources have been established. The solving method combining of fuzzy assignment and genetic algorithm has offered according to different objective function. Simulation analysis is used on model and solution algorithm verifying the correctness of theoretical research.

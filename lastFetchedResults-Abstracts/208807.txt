Background: Classically, multinodular goiter (MNG) has been considered to be a safer form of goiter with minimal risk of
malignancy. However, recent literature advocates that prevalence of malignancies in solitary thyroid nodule (STN) and MNG
is comparable.
Objective: To ascertain the frequency and pattern of malignancy in MNG and STN.
Materials and Methods: It was a prospective study conductive from Feb 2006 to Nov 2008 in histopathology department at
Shaikh Zayed Hospital Lahore. In this period, 432 cases including 310 cases of MNG and 122 cases of STN who underwent
thyroid surgery were studied. Histopathology was carried out following surgery in all these cases. Histological diagnosis in
each case was analyzed.
Results: Among 310 cases of MNG, 12 (3.87%) were malignant and M:F was 2.53:1. Out of 122 cases of STN, 14 (11.47%)
cases were found malignant with M:F of 1:1.76.
Conclusion: The prevalence of malignancy in STN is higher than that in MNG; however, multinodularity should no longer
be considered as an indicator of benign disease. Surgical intervention should be considered in all cases of nodular goiter.

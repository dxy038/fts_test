The main objective of the paper is to explore the attributes of the authorÂ´s VSI system in the light of the properties of chaotic systems. The question whether or not the tolerance band controlled system is chaotic is investigated. The author believes that by raising this question a gate is opened for the introduction of the theory of chaos, which currently is on the frontier of science, into the field of power electronics. Some remarkable simulation results make these opening steps promising and exciting. The paper takes as an example AC motor drives fed by voltage source inverters furnished with closed-loop current controlled (CC) PWM realized by special tolerance band control. The stator current vector wanders seemingly randomlike in the tolerance band. Interestingly, this movement has striking similarities with the properties of chaotic systems

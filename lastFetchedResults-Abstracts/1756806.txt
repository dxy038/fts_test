Introduction & Objective: Mesenchymal stem cells from various sources such as bone marrow are available. These cells have multipotent capacity to differentiate into mesodermal cell lineages. Mesenchymal stem cells are one of the major candidates in cell therapy. The aim of this study was the isolating of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human bone marrow and assessing their ability for differentiation into osteocyte. 
Materials and Methods: Bone marrow was aspirated from human normal donor after informing consent. Cells were isolated and cultured. Identification of cells with flow cytometric analysis was performed. For osteogenic differentiation, the 4th-passage cells were treated with osteogenic medium for three weeks and specific staining was done.
Results: Flow cytometric analysis showed that the human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were positive for CD90 and negative for CD45 and CD80. Stem cells derived from bone marrow could differentiate to osteocyte cells after 21 days.
Conclusion: Results of this research indicated that stem cells derived from humanâ€™s bone marrow are an important source of stem cells. They have the potential for osteogenic differentiation.
Key word: Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Human Bone Marrow, Osteocytes, Differentiation

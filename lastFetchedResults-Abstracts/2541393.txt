Introduction: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders that due to different factors such as hormonal changes can cause mental distress and decreased quality of life. A review of the studies conducted in Iran shows the lack of attention to the quality of life in these patients as a big challenge. Therefore, this study was performed with aim to assess the effect of some polycystic ovary syndromerelated hormones on quality of life in these women. Methods: This crosssectional study was performed on 60 women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome referred to Shiraz Shahid Motahari clinic in 2012. PCOSQ questionnaire was used to assess the patients&#039; quality of life. To evaluate the effect of PCOS on FSH, testosterone and estradiol, 10 ml blood samples were taken from the participants on days 35 of the menstrual cycle. Serum levels of hormones were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and electroimmunoassay (EIA). Data was analyzed by SPSS software (version 18) and chisquare, Pearson correlation, ttest and ThreeWay ANOVA. PResults: Menstrual disorders obtained lowest mean score in the areas of PCOSQ that indicates the most important concern of patients, and the areas including weight, infertility, emotional disorders, and hirsutism were the next weakest areas, respectively. In the evaluation of relationship between various measured parameters with different areas of quality of life, inverse significant correlation was found only between testosterone and emotional area (P=0.049, r=0.355) and no significant relation was observed in other cases (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: Regarding inverse significant correlation between testosterone and emotional area of quality of life, it is recommended that based on the hormonal changes of testosterone, special attention be paid to this dimension of quality of life and appropriate educational and counselling sessions be designed and implemented.

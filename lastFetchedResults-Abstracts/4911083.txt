A new pyramidal JND (just noticeable difference) model is presented. The idea is to use this JND to determine the optimum strength for embedding the watermark providing an invisible and robust watermarking scheme. The image is first decomposed into a multiresolution representation using the pyramidal decomposition. Then, a perceptual model is proposed to compute the JND value for each pixel at each Laplacian level. This model takes into account three main characteristics of the human visual system (HVS), namely: contrast sensitivity, luminance adaptation and contrast masking. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated in terms of transparency, using subjective and objective tests, and robustness to different common attacks.

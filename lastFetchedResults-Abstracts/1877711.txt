Objective
rpose of this study was to validate a 3-factor measurement model of dyspnea sensory quality (WORK-EFFORT, TIGHTNESS, SMOTHERING-AIR HUNGER) originally derived in patients with exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
s
s validation study, adult patients with heart failure were enrolled after hospital admission (median hospital day 1) and asked to rate the intensity of dyspnea sensory quality descriptors on the day of enrollment (study day 1; N = 119) and in a recall version for the day of admission (study day 0; n = 97).
s
matory factor analysis demonstrated good model fit for both days. Cronbach’s α for each factor was greater than .87 for both study days.
sion
s the first study to validate a previously specified measurement model of dyspnea sensory quality in an independent sample. Results indicate that measurement of dyspnea sensory quality in exacerbated cardiopulmonary disease does not necessarily require disease-specific questionnaires.

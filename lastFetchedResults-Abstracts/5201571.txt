Query formulation remains obstinately difficult for large classes of users. Indeed, in face of the growth in query complexity due to development of new kind of application manipulating great size of data, we notice the absence of models taking charge of the user through from specification of needs to formulation of queries. We think that users can be given effective help in query formulation by means of re-using former queries. Indeed, the objective of this work is to propose a method of assisting users to formulate queries by accessing and re-using existing ones. It consists of making available to users query components plus a strategy for re-using them. The approach developed here lies within the scope of re-use development environments. The model developed incorporates knowledge defining query components and ways to select, adapt or combine them to meet particular requirements

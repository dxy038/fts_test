In this paper we describe an eddy current sensor based on the induction balance principle for the recognition of buried conductive tag. The objective of this system is to identify without excavation the various types of ground pipes. The principle is to associate to each pipe type a characteristic tag integrating conductive elements. We present a DPSM theory used for sensor modeling. We present also the first generation model of our sensor, and the optimization of different parts of this last one. Specially, the replacement of fiat coils by "turned" ones, their dimensions and positions. After modeling, we describe the sensor second generation carried out and obtained real signals. We show the results of methods used to recognize the two coding systems. We conclude by the improvements obtained by all these changes and the future work suggested

In this paper, we describe the various traditional and recently proposed intelligent methods for automatic voltage regulation (AVR) of a power generation unit. We vouch for using artificially intelligent paradigms and thus call it IVR (Intelligent Voltage Regulation). This system is generally deployed in hybrid and interconnected power generation systems. Traditionally PID controllers were used with controller parameter values decided manually and intuitively, which became non-practical as power grids started to interconnect. Then, soft-computing methods for building intelligent controllers based on fuzzy-logic were proposed. These then were integrated with swarm based optimization methods like PSO. A comparison among some of these alternatives is the main objective behind this research.

In order to analyze the propagation of shocks due to hypervelocity impact of micrometeoroids and space debris on spacecrafts, it was necessary to analyze the high-frequency shock-propagation-dynamic on complex structures representative of real spacecraft structure. Objective of this research is the GOCE satellite due to its highly accurate accelerometer very sensitive to the micro-vibration environment. After a detailed analysis of the most-probable shock-propagation-path within the satellite, several representative targets have been designed. Then an extensive test campaign has been conducted on these targets exploring a wide range of impact conditions. As a result, a database was established which correlates the impact conditions in the experimental range (0.6–2.3 mm projectiles at 2.5–5 km/s) with the shock spectra on selected locations on various types of structural models. The behaviour of structural joints was also analyzed under shock conditions that are not normally reproduced by pyroshock testing. The database represent a fundamental tool in order to validate the numerical analysis that will be used to assess the vibration environment, due to in-orbit micrometeoroids and space debris at the accelerometer location. This paper presents the test procedure applied and the general results achieved.

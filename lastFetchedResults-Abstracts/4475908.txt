In the traditional cockpit display-control system, pilots have to face more and more instruments and response to the complex information simultaneously. In order to study the change characteristics of the mental workload under such multi-task condition, take the virtual instruments for design objects to set up a series of tasks. With the increase of information quantity and frequency of m instruments, the task becomes more difficult. Then the QN-MHP is established to evaluate mental workload according to the information characteristic of above tasks and information processing manner of human. At the same time, carry out the corresponding EEG verification experiments with Neuro scan SCAN-40 equipment, and uses EEG energy ratio as validation standard. The EEG experiment result verifies that this model is feasible and efficient. This method canÂ´t only avoid experimental dependence of traditional subjective and objective tests, or the instability of the mental workload process, but also refrain the subjective error in the NASA-TXL test, so that the evaluation results get more accurate.

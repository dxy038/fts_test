A new control strategy for the HEV bus based on the equivalent brake specific fuel consumption(BSFC)has been proposed in this paper. It concerns the derivation of calculation methods for the BSFC of and the general formula for the objective function of the BSFC of the battery package under different operation mode. The performance of the BSFC control strategy is tested using the simulation model of the HEV bus based on the real operation data and driving cycle. The simulation results have shown that the new control algorithm can increase 12.1% fuel economy for the HEV bus compared to the conventional power following strategy.

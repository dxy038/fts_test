Objective: Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a surgical procedure used to generate large
volumes of new bone for limb lengthening.
Materials and Methods: In this animal experimental study, a 30% lengthening of the left
tibia (mean distraction distance: 60.8 mm) was performed in ten adult male dogs by callus
distraction after osteotomy and application of an Ilizarov fixator. Distraction was started on
postoperative day seven with a distraction rate of 0.5 mm twice per day and carried out at
a rate of 1.5 mm per day until the end of the study. Autologous bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells (BM-MSCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as the treatment group (n=5)
or PRP alone (control group, n=5) were injected into the distracted callus at the middle
and end of the distraction period. At the end of the consolidation period, the dogs were
sacrificed after which computerized tomography (CT) and histomorphometric evaluations
were performed.
Results: Radiographic evaluationsrevealed that the amount and quality of callus formations
were significantly higher in the treatment group (P < 0.05). As measured by
CT scan, the healing parametersin dogs of the treatment group were significantly
greater (P < 0.05). New bone formation in the treatment group was significantly higher
(P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The present study showed that the transplantation of BM-MSCs positively
affects early bony consolidation in DO. The use of MSCs might allow a shortened period
of consolidation and therefore permit earlier device removal.

Background and Objective: Infertility is a common condition with important psychological, economic, demographic, and medical implications. Demand for infertility services has grown substantially even though the prevalence of infertility has been stable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effect of single dose of sildenafil on seminal parameters in young, infertile patients with oligoasthenospermia.
Subjects and Methods: Twelve young, infertile men with oligoasthenospermia from an academic hospital as well as a male infertility center and clinical andrology laboratories were enrolled in to this study. A single dose of sildenafil (50 mg) administered and the semen samples were collected 1 hour after treatment. Changes in sperm parameters evaluated after sildenafil administration, compared with the basal conditions.
Result: Sperm progressive motility improved (median value, 32.7 % vs. 28.2%) 1 hour after the administration of 50mg sildenafil as well as semen pH (median value 7.82 vs 7.94). No significant changes in sperm morphology, total sperm motility, rapid progressive sperm motility, semen volume and sperm concentration after sildenafil treatment. 
Conclusion: The data suggest that single dose of Sildenafil causes improvement in sperm progressive motility in patients with oligoasthenospermia.

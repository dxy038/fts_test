Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate whether amphotericin B vaginal suppositories would be effective in the treatment of non-albicans Candida vaginitis in women who failed conventional therapy.
Study design
Thirty-two patients were identified with non-albicans Candida vaginitis. These patients were treated with conventional antifungal agents. Ten patients had persistence of the non-albicans Candida infection after treatment. Amphotericin B 50-mg vaginal suppositories were given nightly for 14 days to this subgroup of treatment failures.
Results
Of 10 women, 8 (80%) who were treated with amphotericin B vaginally initially showed no further infection. One of the treatment successes had 2 recurrences and responded to a second course of amphotericin B but failed a third course. If this patient is considered a treatment failure, then amphotericin B vaginal suppositories were successful in 70% of patients. The medication was well tolerated and local side effects were minimal.
Conclusion
Amphotericin B vaginal suppositories are a viable treatment option for refractory vaginitis caused by non-albicans Candida.

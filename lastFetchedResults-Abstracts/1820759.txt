Objective
ition to its role as a remineralizing agent in preventing dental caries, recent evidence has shown that casein phosphopeptide–amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP–ACP) can protect teeth against erosion. The aim of this study was to determine whether CPP–ACP could reduce enamel wear rates under severe erosive conditions simulating heavy attrition and gastric regurgitation.

 specimens were subjected to 10,000 wear cycles at a load of 100 N and pH 1.2 in a tooth wear machine. The machine was stopped every 2 min (160 cycles), and CPP–ACP in the form of a paste was applied for 5 min in experimental group 1. A paste with the same formulation but without CPP–ACP was applied in experimental group 2. No paste was applied in the control group.
s
ar mixed model analysis indicated that the mean wear rates in experimental group 1 (0.44 ± 0.05 mm3 per 1000 cycles) and in experimental group 2 (0.63 ± 0.06 mm3 per 1000 cycles) were significantly lower than that in the control group (0.92 ± 0.11 mm3 per 1000 cycles) (p &lt; 0.05). The mean wear rate in experimental group 1 was also lower than that in experimental group 2 (p &lt; 0.05). Wear facets in experimental groups 1 and 2 were noted to be smoother and more polished than those in the control group.
sions
emineralizing and lubricating properties of the paste containing CPP–ACP appear to contribute to wear reduction in enamel. These findings may lead to new strategies for the clinical management of tooth wear.

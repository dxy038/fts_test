VCR technology in hot strip mills can increase transverse stiffness of loaded gap, heighten control effect of roll bending, improve distribution of contact force between backup roll and work roll. However it appears to lack coordination with CVC work roll. A new objective function of VCR plus design curve was established with considering the contour of CVC, and simulation was carried out to verify the effectiveness of VCR plus by two dimensional variable thickness finite element method. The on site test results show that VCR plus technology is proved to be effective in strip profile and flatness improvement, roll consumption reduction and increase of rolled product length of rolling cycle in CVC mills.

Objective
Our purpose was to assess how obstetrics/gynecology clerkships incorporate methods of student assessment into grades.
Study design
A survey that included a broad range of assessment methods was distributed to obstetrics/gynecology clerkship directors registered with the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Respondents were asked to indicate the methods used for assessment and to indicate the weight assigned to these methods in determining a student grade.
Results
Of the 146 surveys distributed, there were 53 respondents (36.4%). The most common methods of subjective assessment included evaluation of patient presentation skills and performance on ward rounds. The 2 most commonly used objective methods, general assessment of cognitive knowledge and the National Board of Medical Examiners Subject Examination in Obstetrics and Gynecology, generally accounted for 75% of the final grade, although these same 2 components also had the widest range of assigned weights reported.
Conclusion
Assessment methods and incorporation into a final grade vary widely across obstetrics/gynecology clerkships.

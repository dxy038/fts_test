ITER is currently the most ambitious project on nuclear fusion research. Its objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion as an energy source for the future. The complexity of the systems required to meet this challenge present many opportunities for omissions or incorrect assumptions. System engineering allows the engineer to deal with such a complexity by developing a Functional Breakdown Structure (FBS). Unlike a Plant Breakdown Structure (PBS), the FBS is a function-oriented tree, not a product-oriented tree. It details operations or activities that have to be performed as needed functions of the architecture, allowing identification of any missing elements, defining the personnel skills required to operate the architecture and managing the machine availability.

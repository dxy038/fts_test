To achieve the objective set by European Union to reduce the energy consumption of buildings by the year 2020, effective measures for increasing energy efficiency have to be implemented. Improving energy efficiency in schools does not mean compromising the comfort of staff and students. Implementing some simple energy saving measures can improve conditions, as well as save money. The aim of this paper is to present the evaluation of the energy saving measures to increase the energy efficiency lighting in a Portuguese school - Technology TondelaÂ´s Professional School. These measures have been identified during the conduction of an Energy Audit in the building during 2010. The energy saving measures analyzed involves the replacement of low efficiency by high efficiency lighting (efficient lamps, electronic ballasts) for different spaces. The evaluation of the impact of these actions, namely in terms of costs, annual consumption reduction, greenhouse gas emissions reduction and payback period, is presented.

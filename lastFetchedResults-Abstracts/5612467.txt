Assessment industrial building´s reliability accurately is important in working of industrial building´s alteration, reused and daily management. In the analysis of factors that influenced industrial building´s reliability, 11 assessment factors on three aspects of load-bearing structural system, structural arrangement and the support system, and maintenance structure system are selected as the assessment index system. Then a industrial building´s reliability model is presented based on projection pursuit classification technique. The optimal projection direction is obtained by using composite simplex method. According to the projection value to asses the industrial building´s reliability. This approach has advantages of robust, accuracy and objective. It provides a new thinking in assessing the industrial building´s reliability.

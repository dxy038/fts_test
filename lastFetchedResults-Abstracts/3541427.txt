The main objective of the paper is to present in one place all the performance curves for the various modes of operation of the resistive lattice H mixer. Four distinct cases arc considered; two narrowband mixers with open- and short-circuit terminations at the image frequency, and two broadband circuits with matched and mismatched conditions at the RF port. The design formulas are tabulated, and the expected minimum conversion power loss, as well as the optimum terminations required over a wide range of operational levels, are plotted for each type of mixer.

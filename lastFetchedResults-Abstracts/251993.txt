The major objective of this work is to describe the dynamic thermal behavior of
thermoelectric generators and refrigerators under the effect of the hyperbolic
heat conduction model. In practical situations, these devices work under transient
operating conditions due to the time change in the imposed current,
voltage, and hot or cold temperatures. Results for transient temperature distributions
were obtained for different parameters. The coefficient of performance
was obtained as a function of time for increasing current flow.

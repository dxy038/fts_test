EDM is a well-established machining option for manufacturing complex shapes of any conductive material with low forces. The main strength of the EDM process is that it can machine hard material parts with low forces that are extremely difficult to machine by conventional machining processes. The forces are very small because the tool and the work-piece do not have any contact during the machining process, which creates a significant amount of research interests in the field of EDM. This paper provides a review on the various research activities carried out and various developments in the field of die-sinking EDM. Researchers have explored a number of ways to improve the sparking efficiency of EDM including some unique experimental concepts that depart from the traditional EDM sparking phenomenon. The current research shares the same objective of achieving more efficient metal removal coupled with a reduction in tool- wear and improved surface quality. The paper identifies major academic research related to improvement in performance, optimizing process parameters, improvements in machining rates along with simplifying the electrode design and manufacture.

Objective This paper reports the validation
process for research questions that measure cultural
identity in a survey of adolescents from a multi-ethnic
urban area. Method Four questions that tapped preferred
cultural origins of friends and clothing were used
to classify subjects into categories for cultural identity
described by Berry (1980).We assessed face, content and
construct validity of these questions by: i) investigating
the meaning of cultural identity from an African-
Caribbean, Bangladeshi, and White British perspective
in three focus groups; ii) asking participants to comment
on the questions and their suitability for studies of
cultural identity; and iii) using data from the Research
with East London Adolescents: Community Health Survey
(RELACHS) study of adolescents to test hypotheses
about associations of acculturation with health outcomes
(physical and mental) in order to assess whether
these trends are consistent with previous research, and
are in accord with trends predicted by the Berry model.
Results Questions about the cultural origins of friends
and clothing showed good face and content validity.
However, only the questions on friendship choices
showed some associations in the predicted directions,
with some associations that were unexpected. The most
significant findings were that, in comparison with marginalised
pupils, for African-Caribbean pupils assimilation
was associated with more tiredness (OR=40.7,
3.8–432.8,p<0.001) and traditionalism with less obesity
(OR=0.1, 0.02–0.5, p<0.001). For Bangladeshi pupils
integration was associated with a lower risk of depression
(OR=0.4, 0.2–0.8, p<0.001). Conclusion Questions
on friendship choices can be used to assess cultural
identity, but associations with health and health risk behaviours
are different for each ethnic group.

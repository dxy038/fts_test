Purpose: Microbial assay is used to determine the potency of antibiotics and vitamins. In
spite of its advantages like simplicity and easiness, and to reveal the slight changes in the
molecules, the microbial assay suffers from significant limitations; these methods are of
lower specificity, accuracy and sensitivity. The objective of the present study is to evaluate
the efficacy of real time-PCR technique in comparison with turbidimetric method for
microbial assay of amikacin.
Methods: Microbial determination of amikacin by turbidimetric method was performed
according to USP. Also amikacin concentrations were determined by microbial assay using
taq-man quantitative PCR method. Standard curves in different concentration for both
methods were plotted and method validation parameters of linearity, precision and accuracy
were calculated using statistical procedures.
Results: The RT-PCR method was linear in the wider concentration range (5.12 – 38.08 for
RT-PCR versus 8.00 – 30.47 for turbidimetric method) with a better correlation coefficient
(0.976 for RT-PCR versus 0.958 for turbidimetric method). RT-PCR method with LOQ of
5.12 ng/ml was more sensitive than turbidimetric method with LOQ of 8.00 ng/ml and the
former could detect and quantify low concentrations of amikacin. The results of accuracy
and precision evaluation showed that the RT-PCR method was accurate and precise in all of
the tested concentration.
Conclusion: The RT-PCR method described here provided an accurate and precise
technique for measurement of amikacin potency and it can be a candidate for microbial
determination of the antibiotics with the same test organism.

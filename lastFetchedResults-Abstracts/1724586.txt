This work presents as a main objective to study the immobilization process of yeast invertase by adsorption in the ion exchanging resin Duolite A-568 for invert sugar production. Initially, a kinetic study of the soluble form of the enzyme was carried out. At the sequence was studied the immobilization process of yeast invertase in the weakly exchanging anionic resin Duolite A-568. The influences of the pH, enzyme concentration and temperature in the enzyme immobilization were analyzed through a central composite design (CCD). The results indicated that the retention of the catalytic activity in immobilization was strongly dependent of these variables, being maximum in a pH value of 5.0, with an enzyme concentration of 12.5 g/L (1.875 g of protein per liter) and temperature of 30 Â°C. The simultaneous influence of pH and temperature on the free and immobilized invertase activity was also studied through a CCD.

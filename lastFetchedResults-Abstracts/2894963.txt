Human body communication (HBC) is expected to become a unique man-machine interface because the transmission path is established only when the user touches the target device. In this study, HBC between a stationary device and a wearable device worn on the wrist was investigated. Transmission characteristics between the devices and electric field around the human body model were calculated by electromagnetic field analysis. The transmission characteristics from the stationary device to the wearable device were about -56 dB, which suggests a stable bidirectional transmission. The S<sub>21</sub> decreased more than 30 dB when stationary signal electrode and fingertip were 5 cm apart, indicating that contact is necessary for transmission.

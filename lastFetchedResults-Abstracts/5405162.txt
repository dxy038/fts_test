That battlefield ammunition storage layout is good or bad has much influence to the battle effect, sometimes it may influence the result of the battle. On the basis of analyzing the characteristic of battlefield ammunition storage layout according to military rules, this paper constructs the mathematics model applying multi-objective decision thinking, then adopts improved genetic algorithm to solve the model, thus acquires the best project of the battlefield ammunition storage layout. The adaptive crossover probability and adaptive mutation probability are proposed, which consider the influence of every generation to algorithm and the effect of different individual fitness in every generation.

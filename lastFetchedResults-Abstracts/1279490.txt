The objective of this work is to study the distribution of chemical elements in topsoil and subsoil, focusing on the identification of anthropogenic (human-made) and geogenic (natural) element sources in a former metallurgical industrial area. Samples of topsoil (0–5 cm depth) and subsoil (20–30 cm depth) were collected from 60 different sites in a 52 km2 area around the town of Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The study was based on comparisons of statistical parameters, spatial distribution of selected elements, and the results of cluster and factor analyses. Two natural geochemical associations and one anthropogenic association were identified. The natural geochemical associations (Al, Ce, K, La, Li, Nb, Rb, Sc, Ta, Ti Th, V, and Y and Co, Cr, Na, Ni, and Mg) are predominantly influenced by lithological factors, whereas the anthropogenic association (Ag, Bi, Cd, Cu, Hg, Mo, Pb, Sb, and Zn) is the result of past iron metallurgy in the study area. Although Zenica was the largest ironwork in former Yugoslavia, the observed level of contamination is rather low when compared to the iron and steel industry in Bosnia, Herzegovina and Slovenia.

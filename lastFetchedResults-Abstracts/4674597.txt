The objective of this paper is to study the therapeutic effect of nanosized As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> complex (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanoparticles containing As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) combined with magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) on human cervical cancer Hela cells in vitro and xenograft cervical cancer in nude mice. The growth and apoptosis of Hela cells treated with nanosized As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub> complex combined with MFH was examined by MTT, Flow cytometry assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in vitro. We also observed mass and volume inhibitory rates of the tumors of Hela-bearing nude mice by using animal experiment. The results indicated that the nanosized As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> complex combined with MFH could significantly inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of Hela cells. The inhibitory rate was 61.43%, the apoptotic indexes was 44.79%. Animal experiments showed that the mass inhibitory ratio of the tumors treated with As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> complex combined with MFH was 88.21%, and the volume inhibitory ratio was 91.57%. Compared with the control and experimental groups, each group had statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05). So, As<sub>2</sub>O <sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> complex combined with MFH could inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of Hela cells and also has a conspicuous inhibitory effect on the weight and volume of xenograft cervical cancer

Taking the switches of a distribution network as interconnecting lines, depending on their location in the systems, distribution feeder lines and loads can be aggregated and further be viewed as a bus if they have the same consequences after failure. Using this approach, a complex distribution network can be simplified into a simple model consisted with buses and switch-lines. The impact of the number of sub-lines and the location of switches to the reliability of distribution systems is analyzed A power supply line of distribution systems in a district of Fujian was chosen to perform the above model simplification, the reliability of these reduced distribution systems was calculated. At last, based on the notion of cost/benefit analysis, an objective functions for the optimization of investment strategy combining reliability with economic is suggested to determine the optimal connection modes in the distribution networks selected.

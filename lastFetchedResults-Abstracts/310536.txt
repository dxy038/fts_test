Objective. To measure and compare the mechanical properties in bending of the four-ring, and three-ring/one-tube hybrid external fixation frames.

Design. In vitro measurements of the mechanical behaviour of ring and ring-tubular external fixation frames. In the latter, one ring of the full circular frame was replaced by one tube and Schanz screws.

Background. The mechanical properties of the classical Ilizarov four-ring external fixation frames has been compared to those of other external fixation frames by various authors. However, in clinical practice the hybrid fixation frame is being used with increasing frequency. Therefore the mechanical properties of the latter are of immediate interest and clinical value.

Methods. On explanted sheep tibiae with single and double osteotomies, frame stiffness in the four-point bending mode was measured at different K-wire tensions, comparing the values obtained from four-ring frames, to those of three-ring-tubular hybrid frames. These measurements were made under conditions of (a) bone distraction (BD), and (b) segment transport (ST), both at the initial and final stages of this procedure.

Results. In circular frames, frame stiffness in bending for increasing K-wire tension showed a Gaussian distribution both in distraction and post-ST with an optimum at 1000 N. In ring tubular hybrid frames, however, frame stiffness showed a more linear relationship to K-wire tension.

Conclusions. In the four-ring Ilizarov external fixation frame, the exchange of one ring with one tube and one Schanz screw both reduced frame stiffness in bending and converted to linear its relationship to K-wire tension.

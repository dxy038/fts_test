Fuzzy regression is one of important methods for data analysis. Fuzzy regression extends the concept of classical regression which has been constructed in the statistical framework. We show that a convex hull method can provide a powerful tool to reduce the computing time, especially for real-time data analysis. The main objective of this study is to propose an efficient real-time fuzzy regression analysis based on the use of convex hull, specifically a Beneath-Beyond algorithm. The reconstruction of convex hull edges depends on incoming vertices while a recomputing procedure can be implemented in real-time. An air pollution data is analyzed by applying the proposed approach. An important role of convex hull is emphasized in particular when dealing with the limitations of linear programming.

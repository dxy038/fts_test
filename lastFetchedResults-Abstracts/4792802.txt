The main objective of this paper is to design a novel threshold voltage detector circuit using carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNTFET). This circuit is simulated in HSPICE by using HSPICE model of CNTFET. The uniqueness of this proposed circuit is that the threshold voltage of each CNTFET decides each voltage detection level where as in CMOS implementation a complex band-gap reference circuit is needed to produce a reference voltage level for precise detection. MOSFETs with different threshold voltage can also be used to implement this idea but that would add a new V<sub>th</sub> mask for each different voltage detection level which will increase the process cost significantly. Therefore this new proposed CNTFET based voltage level detection circuit can produce much improved performance with significant reduction in implementation complexity by both saving number of mask set and reducing the chip area significantly.

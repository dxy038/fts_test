Partially dehulled sunflower seeds were subjected to a hydrolytic treatment with cellulases during aqueous processing for oil and protein extraction. Sub-optimal extraction conditions (particle size and separation technology) were established in order to appreciate the potential improvement caused by the enzymatic treatment and to select the best operational conditions. The effects of three operational variables (extraction–treatment time, water/seeds ratio and enzyme/seed ratio) were studied on three objective functions (the extent of hydrolysis reaction, the oil extraction yield and the percent polyphenolics removal). After 2 h of enzymatic treatment–extraction a practical optimum in the range 7.5–8 g water g−1 seeds and 1.25–1.4 g enzyme 100 g−1 seeds could be defined. Under these conditions the oil extractability and the polyphenolics removal are improved by more than 30 and 80%, respectively.

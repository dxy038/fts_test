In the present paper, the shape and position of internal cooling passages within an axial turbine blade have been optimized to achieve a uniform temperature distribution with the minimum cooling air flow while the maximum temperature is below the allowable value. Four cooling passages are made within the blade. The cross section shape of each passage is parameterized using a new method based on an 8-order Bezier curve. This curve, which is represented in terms of Bezier control points, has much flexibility and can produce a large variety of shapes. The shape of the blade surface profile remains unchanged during the optimization process. The numerical simulation has been carried out using conjugate heat transfer method to predict the temperature distribution in both solid and fluid regions and a semi-empirical relation is employed to evaluate the heat transfer coefficient for internal cooling passages. The multi-objective optimization is performed for NASA C3X blade through the Fluent/Gambit packages coupled with a differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm. The cooling passages shape generated during the optimization process shows that the present method of shape parameterization produces fairly smooth and realistic geometries. The optimization outcomes are given as a Pareto front.

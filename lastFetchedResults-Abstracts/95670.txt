There is not a single study on film cooling performance of a single round hole at the three streamwise angles for a wide range of blowing ratios with a short hole length. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to provide a consistent set of measurements in terms of effectiveness and heat transfer coefficients [Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer, 2002] obtained systematically on a flat plate, and to deliver a better understanding of film cooling performance, with explanations deduced from the existing knowledge of a single jet in crossflow, before more engine representative conditions are introduced. The present results also serve as a database for future numerical modelling.

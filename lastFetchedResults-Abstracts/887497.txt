Objective(s):Cinnamon as an antioxidant is able to reduce oxidative stress. Previous study confirmed antioxidant enzymes have beneficial and essential effects on male infertility by their role against reactive oxygen species. 
Material and Methods: Wistar male rats (n=20) were allocated into two groups, control group (n=10) and cinnamon group (n=10) that received 75mg/kg by gavage method, daily for 4 weeks respectively while the control group just received an equal volume of distilled water daily. In 30th day, 5 cc blood sample of each rat was taken for testosterone measurement. 
Results: Total serum testosterone and TAC (total antioxidant capacity) levels were significantly increased in group that has received 75mg/kg cinnamon in comparison to control group (P  
Conclusion: Since in our study 75mg/kg Cinnamon has significantly increased serum testosterone and TAC, it seems to use it in infertile patients has beneficial effects.

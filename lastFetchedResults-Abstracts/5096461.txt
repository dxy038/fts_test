This paper presents the result of a pilot test where in-home displays were tested among 91 households in Norway. The test group was compared to a control group of 42 households. The main objective was to test if the customers would reduce their electricity consumption due to updated feedback regarding their own consumption, and their presumed changed attitude towards electricity as a product. Three surveys were performed during the test period.

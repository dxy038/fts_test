Prior to this research, autonomy and belonging were perceived as two independent and distinguishing characteristics of system of systems. The objective of this paper is to explore the interdependency of autonomy and belonging, and the role of competition and collaboration among constituent elements to influence the level of autonomy and belonging. The definition of autonomy and belonging are restated using the multiattribute utility theory. Using this theory, competitions and collaborations are modeled as redistributing resources (or values, norms, etc.) to influence the level of autonomy and belonging. The proposed mathematical model is applied in a system of systems of swarm robots to present its applicability and validity. The result shows the impact of competition and collaboration among constituent elements of a system of systems on autonomy and belonging in that system of systems. The proposed mathematical conceptualization is applicable in understanding, engineering, and governing wide-spread system of systems.

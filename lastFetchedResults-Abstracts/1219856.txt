Background: Musculoskeletal health in schoolchildren is a global health problem.
The objective of the current study was to assess ergonomic behavior and musculoskeletal
health in urban poor schoolchildren in Pune, India.
Methods: Sixty-five (29 male students) slum dwelling schoolchildren were assessed
for their ergonomics using a validated and reliable tool.
Results: Average age was 13 years. Out of 65 students, 36 reported presence of
musculoskeletal pain. In addition, 78.5% had bad ergonomics when lifting books.
Sitting posture was poor in 67.7%, while 50.8% demonstrated bad posture while
using a computer. As far as the female students were concerned, it was seen that
out of 36 students, 55.6% complained of presence of pain. Out of the 20 students
who reported pain, 70% had a score lower than 7.5 on ergonomic score assessment
(indicative of bad ergonomics). When the male students were considered,
out of 29 students, 65.5% reported presence of pain. Out of the 19 students who
reported pain, close to 79% demonstrated bad ergonomics.
Conclusion: There is presence of musculoskeletal aches and pains in this underprivileged
section of the society, including demonstration of bad ergonomics and
postures while performing activities in school. Thus, musculoskeletal health problems
exist in urban slum schoolchildren. It is important to identify health problems
at an early stage in both boys and girls. Children are the future of the nation
and hence, identification of health issues early in life and preventing them from
becoming chronic is of utmost importance.

Objective: To study the changes of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the resting-fMRI in brain areas of human with high myopia. Methods: Twenty graduate students with high myopia and twenty ones with normal vision underwent two resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, one for eyes-open (EO) with no fixation and one for eyes-closed (EC) conditions. After data preprocessing, ALFF was obtained by calculating the square root of the power spectrum in the frequency range of 0.01~0.08Hz. Results: In EO condition, decreased ALFF was observed in the left occipital lobe, bilateral frontal lobe and right inferior parietal lobule in high myopia group compared to normal vision group; increased ALFF was observed in the left caudate nucleus and thalamus compared to normal vision group. In EC condition, decreased ALFF was observed in the bilateral frontal lobe, right parietal lobe and right middle temporal lobe in high myopia group. In high myopia group, the ALFF in EO condition is significantly higher than that in EC condition in the left caudate nucleus and the cuneus. In normal vision group, there were significant ALFF differences between EO and EC conditions. Conclusions: Bad vision might reduce the neural activities in prefrontal and parietal cortex within the default mode network (DMN). While, Human with bad vision need stronger neural activities in the caudate nucleus in EO condition to regulate the transmission of information between the thalamus and the orbitofrontal cortex which may be induced by their bad vision.

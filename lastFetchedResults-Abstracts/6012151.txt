This paper addresses the problem of optimal power allocation in multiuser OFDM ad-hoc networks. Our objective is to maximize the weighted rate-sum of users under total transmit power constraint. Maximizing a weighted rate-sum is more amenable whereas appropriate weight assignment to different users, guarantees fairness among users. We propose a distributed algorithm for optimal power allocation based on reaching a consensus among users for power allocation. The proposed algorithm is tractable in the sense of computational complexity and requires only local information at each node. Simulation results and the analysis of the algorithm are presented to support the proposed idea

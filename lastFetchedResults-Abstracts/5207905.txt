The following paper presents bidirectional switch neutral point clamped three-level inverter topology, which is intended for low voltage applications. The inverter schematic and its principles of operation are presented. Then conduction and switching losses model derivation is proposed. According to obtained model equations, proposed concept is compared with other inverter topologies by means of the efficiency. Finally, some experimental results of BSNPC inverter are presented.

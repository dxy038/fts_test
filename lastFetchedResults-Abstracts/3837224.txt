The objective of this study was to design an adaptive, real-time assistive system as an alternate HCI that will give computer access to individuals with severe motor disabilities by means of eye gazing only. It focused on the implementation of an algorithm to smooth out abrupt and unwanted jerky behavior of the mouse cursor due to the saccadic nature of the eye movement via the configuration of an artificial neural network that minimizes the jitter effect based on user characteristics. These characteristics were extracted via the creation of user profiles through an embedded graphical interface.

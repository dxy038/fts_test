Purpose
l elbow pain has multiple etiologies; most common is lateral epicondylitis. Radio-capitellar arthritis, posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI), plica and radial tunnel syndromes may produce similar pain. The purpose of this study is to report on a rare subset of patients who had an acute injury during treatment for chronic lateral epicondylitis, exacerbating symptoms and lessening function. Indications for surgery were a failure of another round of nonoperative management and diagnosis of a new injury to the lateral ligaments in addition to the lateral epicondylitis. Surgical intervention revealed the acute injury to the radial ulno-humeral ligament (RUHL) complex, superimposed on chronic lateral epicondylitis, which we believe caused worsening of symptoms. Surgical repair of both lesions provided satisfactory results.
als and methods
patients (range, 29-46 years; mean, 40.7) being treated for chronic lateral epicondylitis each sustained an acute elbow injury resulting in PLRI. Study data, including Andrews-Carson Elbow Score (ACES) and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), were collected in the initial evaluation and at regular postoperative intervals, with a follow-up period of 12-24 months. Indications for surgery were pain, functional impairment, and failure of other treatments. All surgeries were performed on an outpatient basis under general anesthesia in the prone position.
s
tients showed arthroscopic evidence of chronic lateral epicondylitis and acute RUHL injury. All showed significant improvement in total ACES and MEPS after repair of both lesions, full range of motion, and objective improvement in strength and function, with no adverse effects or complications.
sion
ts with chronic lateral epicondylitis who sustain an acute injury may damage the RUHL complex. Early recognition of this additional injury may allow surgical repair of both injuries with satisfactory results.

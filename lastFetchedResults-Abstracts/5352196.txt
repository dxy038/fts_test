An iterative algorithm for the design of M channel maximally decimated cosine-modulated pseudo quadrature mirror-image filter (QMF) banks is proposed. The objective function is minimized applying a practical implementation of the modified Newton method which has high design efficiency for a near perfect reconstruction and reduces the reconstruction error. Several design examples are included, and some comparisons are made with other existing design methods, to demonstrate the proposed algorithm

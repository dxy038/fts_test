To circumvent the lack of knowledge of what measure is more suitable for optimization of the trade-off between image fidelity and coding rate, this paper introduces a novel mathematical methodology for rate control by organizing the progressive transmission in accordance with coherence constraints for avoiding forms of behavioral inconsistency. This methodology could be used within a progressive transmission scheme to produce a new compression method. We compare the new coding scheme against the state of art coder in progressive transmission and demonstrate its superior performance based on a new objective criterion of evaluation.

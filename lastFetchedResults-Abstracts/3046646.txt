A trust-region method is a quite attractive optimization technique, which finds a direction and a step size in an efficient and reliable manner with the help of a quadratic model of the objective function. It is, in general, faster than the steepest descent method and is free of a pre-selected constant learning rate. In addition to its convergence property (between linear and quadratic convergence), its stability is always guaranteed, in contrast to the NewtonÂ´s method. We present an efficient implementation of the maximum likelihood independent component analysis (ICA) using the trust-region method, which leads to trust-region-based ICA (TR-ICA) algorithms. The useful behavior of our TR-ICA algorithms is confirmed through numerical experimental results.

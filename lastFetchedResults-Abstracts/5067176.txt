The rise of the Internet and the push for ubiquitous computing has brought a proliferation of numerous single method solutions, forcing users to remember numerous secret codes, a task that is becoming increasingly difficult. On the web, codes are used by publications, blogs, Webmail, e-commerce sites, and financial institutions. Elsewhere, they serve as authentication mechanism for Internet service providers (ISPs), email servers, local and remote host account, ATM, voicemails and so on. Existing textual passwords, token based systems, and other methods often do not offer the necessary security standard. Fortunately biometric systems that are based on the biological features of the user when typing texts are very promising in enhancing the de facto textual password. The main objective of this paper is to assess and report on the suitability of keystroke dynamics in protecting access to resources when users are typing the different types of password that exist.

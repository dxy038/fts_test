Obesity is a major risk factor for hypertension, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Weight loss is associated with significant metabolic benefits. Our objective was to examine changes in adipocytokines and interleukin (IL) 10 in obese subjects before and after weight loss. We measured anthropometric parameters, adipocytokine and IL-10 in 78 obese people who had visited obesity clinics at five university hospitals (Ajou, Ulsan, Catholic, Hanyang and Yonsei) in Korea. They restricted their caloric intake to less than their usual intake (by 500kcal), were administered sibutramine and were given a program of exercise for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, total body fat, total cholesterol, triglyceride, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-6, resistin and leptin had significantly decreased, while adiponectin and IL-10 had significantly increased. A bivariate correlation analysis found that increment in IL-10 and baseline IL-10 levels significantly correlated with decrement in TNF-α (P<.01) and baseline adiponectin (r=.52, P<.001), respectively. These results were confirmed in a multiple regression analysis. The results suggest that weight loss after caloric restriction and medical treatment in obesity can improve metabolic risk factors through changes in some cytokines.

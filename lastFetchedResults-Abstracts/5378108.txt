In view of the characteristics and the special demands of the electric power information system, this paper designs an assessment model based on variable precision rough set. Then, it uses group decision-making theory, which could make the results of the assessment more accurate and more objective, to calculate the risk value of the target system risk. And then VPRS and AHP are used to determine the index weight involved in the process of the electric power information risk assessment. Finally, it verifies the correctness of the algorithm by analyzing results of the examples of the electric power information system security assessment. We can see that the model could not only find the weakness of the system by analyzing the results got by calculating the current risk value of the electric power system, but also reduce the influence of the subjective factors in some degree.

Objective To investigate the prevailing attitudes towards
mental health help-seeking in Europe, their correlates, and
whether these attitudes are associated with actual service
use for mental health problems.
Method Data were derived from the European Study of
Epidemiology of Mental Disorders, a survey representative
of the adult population of six countries: Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain (n = 8,796).
The World Mental Health Composite International
Diagnostic Interview was used to assess attitudes and
DSM-IV diagnoses. The attitudes referred to beliefs that
the respondents would seek professional help when faced
with a serious emotional problem, would feel comfortable
talking about personal problems with a professional, would
not be embarrassed if friends knew about the professional
help, and respondentsâ€™ perceived effectiveness of mental
health care.
Results Almost a third of the respondents held the view
that professional care was worse than or equal to no help
when faced with serious emotional problems. Female
gender, being younger than 65 years of age, high income,
living in Spain or Italy, presence of mood disorder and
previous service use were associated with at least two of the
four assessed attitudes towards mental health help-seeking.
All four attitudes were significantly associated with mental
health care use, also after adjustment for previous service
use.
Conclusion The low perceived effectiveness of professional
care calls for serious action aiming to improve the
visibility and credibility of the mental health care sector

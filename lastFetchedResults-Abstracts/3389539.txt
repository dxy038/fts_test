This paper considers the optimal design of high order digital differentiators in the L<sub>1</sub> sense. Conventionally, using L<sub>1</sub> error criterion for this design problem results in a nonlinear optimization problem since the corresponding objective function contains an absolute error function. We first reformulate the design problem as a linear programming problem in the frequency domain. To avoid the requirement of huge computation load and storage space when using linear programming based algorithms, we present a method based on a modification of KarmarkarÂ´s algorithm to solve the design problem so that an analytical weighted least-squares (WLS) solution formula can be obtained. This leads to a very efficient procedure for the considered design problem. Computer simulations show that the designed differentiators can achieve more accurate wideband differentiation than those designed by using L<sub>2</sub> and Chebyshev (minimax) error criteria

One of the challenges in the operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is power optimization under different operation mode. In solving the aforementioned problem, polygamy based selection Genetic Algorithm technique has been proposed in this work. The proposed technique involves parameter initialization, problem coding and optimization. The power requirement is coded as a bit of strings subject to power limit constraint. The initial solutions are evaluated based on the UAV power system objective function. The evaluated solutions are clustered into two different classes using K-Means algorithm. Chromosomes in the cluster with minimal centroid are then made to undergo polygamy mating subject to population control mechanism. Resulting solution were then mutated and the whole process continue till number of generation is reached or other termination criteria met. Application of the proposed technique shows that the average efficiency of UAV can be improved using the proposed algorithm.

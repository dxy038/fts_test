Objective: To compare safety and benefits of laparoscopic versus open appendicectomy in a randomized control clinical trial. Methodology: Between January 2008 and October 2009 one hundred and twenty patients (86 male and 34 female) with suspected acute appendicitis were assigned either to laparoscopic [n=60] or open [n=60] appendicectomy. Surgical technique was standardized for both laparoscopic and open procedure. The patients were analyzed in terms of the following aspects and findings; operation time, postoperative pain, intra and post operative complications, hospital stay and return to normal daily activities. Results: There was no mortality. Wound infection (8.3%) and intra-abdominal abscess (11.6%) formation rate was significantly higher in open group than in the laparoscopic group (1.6%) and (3.3%) respectively. Postoperative pain scores (assessed by a pain distress variable, indicated on visual linear scale 0 to 10 and a pain activity scale, indicated on visual linear scale 0 to 10) was significantly lower in laparoscopic group. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in laparoscopic group (p<0.0353) and mean operation time was similar in both groups. One patient (1.6%) was converted from laparoscopic to open appendicectomy due to diffuse pelvic adhesions. Conclusion: Though operation time was same but complications, pain and hospital stay was less in the Laparoscopic group.

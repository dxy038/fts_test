
Objective: The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of premenstrual
symptoms on health related quality of life (HRQOL) in a sample of Iranian women. Method: In this cross-sectional study, a sample of women aged 15–45 years, who lived in
Tehran were randomly recruited according to demographic questionnaire. For diagnosing
the premenstrual dysphoric disorder and premenstrual syndrome, Premenstrual Symptoms
Screening Tool (PSST) was used in this study. The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the
Premenstrual Symptoms Impact Survey (PMSIS) were administered to evaluate health-related
quality of life. Results: Among 430 women, 44% had PMS, 16% met the diagnostic criteria for Premenstrual
Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) and 40% were in General Population (GP) group. The SF-36
scores showed that in all dimensions except for physical functioning there were statistically
significant mean differences among the three groups. Also, women with premenstrual
dysphoric disorder and PMS group had significantly different social function, validity, and
mental health. Comparing the Premenstrual Symptoms Impact Survey scores between the
three groups mean, scores of feeling frustration, fatigue and mood swings for the premenstrual
dysphoric disorder were significantly higher than the two other groups. Conclusion: Premenstrual symptoms have significant impact on health-related quality of life
assessed by SF-36 and PMSIS, specially on mental and emotional domains.

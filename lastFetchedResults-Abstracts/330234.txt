Objective. The objective of this work was to examine osteoblast-like cell attachment and morphology in vitro to osteoceramic materials with three different surface morphologies.

Methods. Osteoceramic composite disks were fabricated from tricalcium phosphate and magnesium-aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) in a 50 vol% ratio. The disks were prepared with three different surface morphologies, including as-fired (irregular), etched (rough), or polished through 1 mm diamond paste (smooth). Osteoblast-like cell cultures were plated onto the prepared disks for 2 h, and the number of attached cells was determined. ANOVA and Student Newman-Kuels tests were used to test for significant differences in cell attachment (p < 0.05). SEM was used to visually evaluate the nature of the cellular adaptation on the osteoceramic surfaces.

Results. Some additional surface roughening resulted from the interaction between the osteroceramic disks and the biological culture media during the attachment assay. A statistically larger number of cells was found to be attached to the etched osteoceramic surfaces compared to the as-fired and polished osteoceramic surfaces or the tissue culture plastic control. Cellular adaptation was extensive on all three osteoceramic surfaces at 2 h.

Significance. These results are consistent with previous in vivo work and continue to support the hypothesis that osteoceramic materials have potential for implants and bone substitute materials.

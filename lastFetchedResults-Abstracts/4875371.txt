Entropy terms are analyzed for use in a heterogeneous network involving ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators and feed-forward neural networks, referred to as FOWA networks. The OWA operators are used to aggregate feature information and were previously used successfully in a landmine application. Weight vectors of OWA operators are special cases of Choquet capacities for which the Shannon entropy has been defined. One can also consider the quadratic Renyi entropy for OWA weight vectors. A term is added to the objective function of the FOWA network involving these entropy terms. An analysis of the derivatives used in gradient descent is conducted.

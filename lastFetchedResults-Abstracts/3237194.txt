Scalable video enables flexible video delivery over IP networks. The adaptation of the video content to the network configuration and the networking conditions is the great advantage of scalable video. In this research work, on-demand H.264 SVC video delivery over wireless multi-hop single-frequency networks is studied. The main objective is to achieve the highest levels of video quality possible while ensuring fairness among competing video flows over a wireless network. With the main barrier being interference, each video receiver has to decide from which peer it will receive a specific layer. The problem of peer selection and layer allocation is formed as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). A relaxation as a Non-Linear Program (NLP) is also provided. Simulation results based on real input video sequences verify the validity of the theoretical approach.

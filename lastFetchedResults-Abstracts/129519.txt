BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The congenital pseudarthrosis of tibia (CPT) is a rare congenital malformation with unknown etiology. Several methods of surgery were used for therapy of this abnormality that often is associated with failure of treatment or amputation. The purpose of this study was to assess the treatment of congenital pseudarthrosis of tibia by free vascularized fibula transfer.
CASES: This study was performed on 11 cases (mean age = 4.5 years) with congenital pseudarthrosis of tibia who referred to Hazrat Fatemeh, Akhtar and Mostafa Khomeini hospitals in Tehran during 10 years. From all, five cases had been already operated with different orthopedic methods that associated with unsuccessful results. All patients treated with free vascularized fibula graft. Anti coagulant agent was administered to patients for one week to prevent thrombosis after surgery. All patients were followed up and no failure of therapy was found.
CONCLUSION: With regard to good outcome of therapy of this congenital disorder with free vascularized fibula graft, it is recommended using this method of surgery for therapy of this congenital abnormality.

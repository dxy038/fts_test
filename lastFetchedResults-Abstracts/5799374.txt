The field Marshal electromagnetic simulation environment (FM-EMSE) is aimed at small research groups involved in electromagnetics design and analysis. Project goals include improved user interface consistency, single- geometry to drive multiple tools and inclusion of legacy codes. A key objective is a simulation system that can be modified, extended and maintained by researchers who are not expert programmers. The present status of the FM environment and the basic FM simulation toolset will be presented.

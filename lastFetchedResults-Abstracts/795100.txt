In this paper, a model of game theory in relation to behavior management and employees' different reasons in no institutional differences has been studied. In this model, administrators can use the tools, training, restructuring, redesigning jobs, control jobs, etc.  The low productivity of staff within the organization is indifferent to prevent each of these tools; however, for administrative expenses to be incurred. In contrast, if the employee does not perform actions with indifference, indifferent managers, agencies, clients, and business partners, which will result in cost; these costs will put the survival of the organization at risk. Players, the manager and staff are indifferent to interact with each other. Director of strategy may be to find a strategy to minimize its cost, the minimum amount of staff indifference and maximize the productivity of the organization. In this scheme, indifferent staff director of strategy, the objective function of optimal strategies for each player and then manager of the parties with respect to the strategy of the game and the parameters of the model are obtained.

Objective(s): In the wake of a natural disaster, dealing with dead bodies is one of the most difficult issues in
the early response phase, requiring careful planning in advance. It follows that the risk analysis phase for any
natural disaster should inelude a study of the history of similar events and a thorough review of the measures
taken as well as the diffieulties faeed by those involved in the disposal of dead bodies.
Methods: This was a qualitative study eomprising the following stages: 1) data colleetion through in-depth
interviews with over 30 people- ineluding those in managerial positions- who were involved in the response
phase after the Bam earthquake, 2) data analysis based on the grounded theory, 3) data extraction and
identification of key variables. and 4) development ofa theoretieal model based on these variables.
Results: In the response phase after the Bam event, key issues regarding the management of human corpses
were identification, confirmation of death, and burying the bodies. The most prominent issues fell into the
following categories: 1) problems with the procedures and structures employed in corpse management, 2)
problems with identification, 3) acceptability to the community of the procedures used in corpse management,
and 4) inadequate anention to specific technical details as regards confirmation ofdeath and burial.
Conclusion: In the event of another disaster, the present structures and procedures cannot mount an adequate
response with regard to corpse management. Experience from other countries has shown that the disruption
caused by major disasters can provoke hasty, injudicious decisions with irremediable adverse consequences.
Problems do exist. but they must not serve as an excuse to compromise standards and ignore basic
requirements for death confirmation, corpse identification, and proper burial.

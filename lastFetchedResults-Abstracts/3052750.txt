In the past few years. third generation (3G) mobile communication systems, where the spectrum of the services now extend up to 60 MHz to 75 MHz, have emerged. In this process, new communication waveforms, such as WCDMA (TDD and FDD) cdma2000 and TD-SCDMA. are now joining the legacy communication waveforms such as GSM/EDGE/GPRS and cdmaOne, to form a large set of services that are used throughout the world. CellularWS manufacturers are now facing various challenges in supporting multiple services as these services have different frequency, bandwidth and protocol structures. Furthermore, in 2001, USA FCC has mandated the E911 requirements for user location services. To meet these requirements radio manufacturers have investigated methods of position location for user equipment. The main objective is to develop the position location solution that is synergistic with the cellular/PCS technology while minimizing the change of current base station infrastructure. In this paper, the SDR architecture for 3G cellular/PCS services and location services is addressed along with the technologies that make this advanced architecture feasible.

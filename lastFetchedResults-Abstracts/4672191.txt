This paper presents aerodynamic modelling and realtime control of a 1 degree-of-freedom (DOF) free to pitch Tailplane. The system is designed to serve as an experimental test facility for investigating flight dynamics principles, model validation and different feedback control paradigms. A high fidelity plant model is an important first step in many flight related applications such as control system design, analyses and pilot training. To achieve this objective a detailed study is conducted employing analytical as well as system identification techniques. Analytical approach although less accurate complements system identification process. This synergy is exploited along with statistical and time domain tests to arrive at a high fidelity model. It is argued that such an integrated approach is suitable for modelling a class of unmanned air vehicles. The SI model is then employed for controller synthesis. Finally, real-time pitch control under stick command is demonstrated utilising classical PI control law.

Selection of timetables for a transit system is a vital aspect of the schedule problem. An optimal model of timetables is presented for regional bus scheduling problem. Its objective is to optimize timetables in such a way that the transfer time of passengers at the transfer nodes is minimized while the operational constraints such as the traffic demand, departure time and maximum (minimum) headway are satisfied. This is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is difficult to solve using classical techniques. In this paper, modifications are made to Genetic Algorithm (GA) used to solve the problem. The Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) imports the simulated annealing algorithm to improve the premature and slow evolution speed phenomenon. In the last part, taking practical bus lines as an example, the reasonable of the model and the feasibility of the algorithm are tested.

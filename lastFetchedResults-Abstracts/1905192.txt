The rule of “Mitigation of Damages” is among the pivotal principles
prevailing the reparation process, based on which the injured party bears an
obligation to take any reasonable course of action to minimize damages
being incurred and to avoid their expansions ; otherwise, he may not be
found entitled to a full compensation. Even though, the principle is only
moderately addressed, besides Islamic jurisprudence by some local laws and
regulations, no independent research has yet been conducted on the subject.
The article shall note that such duty of the injured party is not strictly
unlimited , meaning that for it to arise, certain conditions must genuinely
exist .Further ,there may be objective obstacles which may negate the injured
party’s obligation to mitigate damages being incurred. In a comparative
approach and by making reference to various International instruments
including in particular the laws of England as the main origin of the
mitigation rule, this article shall discuss the conditions and impediments in
line with effectuation of the said principle.

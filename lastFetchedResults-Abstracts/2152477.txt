Nanograined/ultrafine-grained (NG/UFG) metals provide surfaces that are different from conventional coarse-grained polycrystalline metals because of the high fraction of grain boundaries. In the context of osseointegration of metal implants, grooving of nanograins/ultrafine grains by electrochemical grooving is a potential approach to increase the biomechanical interlocking and anchorage with consequent enhancement of cellular response. The primary objective of the research described here is to advance science and technology of metal implants by making a relative comparison of osteoblast response of grain boundary grooved and planar NG/UFG surfaces. The NG/UFG substrates were obtained using an ingenious concept of controlled phase reversion and the grain boundaries were electrochemically treated to induce grooving of large fraction of grain boundaries of NG/UFG substrate. Experiments on the effect of grooving of grain boundaries of NG/UFG metal indicated that cell attachment, proliferation, viability, morphology, and spread are favorably modulated and significantly different from planar (non-grooved) NG/UFG substrates. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies demonstrated stronger vinculin signals associated with actin stress fibers in the outer regions of the cells and cellular extensions on electrochemically grooved NG/UFG substrate. These observations are indicative of accelerated response of cellâ€“substrate interaction and activity. The differences in the cellular response of planar and grain boundary grooved NG/UFG surface are attributed to favorable surface topography that accelerates the cellular activity.

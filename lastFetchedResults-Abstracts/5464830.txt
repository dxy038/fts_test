In this paper, we present a theoretical protocol for autonomic distribution of services in a P2P environment, as well as the results of its simulated implementation. Our objective is to demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a distribution of the corresponding software modules that meets the requirement of the community in the absence of any centralized resource management. Instead, an acceptable balance between offer and demand is achieved via a simple "trial-and-error" mechanism, involving a simple, locally applied "reasoning" loop running independently on every peer.

The paper presents for analysis and control of smart fins for a subsonic projectile. The fin should be able to produce maneuvering force and moment that can control the rotation angle of a projectile fin during flight. The objective of this paper is to present a fuzzy logic controller for a smart fin that is activated by piezoelectric actuator. The beam-based piezoelectric actuator is enclosed within the hollow fin. It has an end fixed to the rotation axle of the fin while the other end is pinned at the tip of the fin. A dynamic model of the system, including external moment due to aerodynamic effects, is obtained using the finite element approach. A general design for a fuzzy logic controller for the fin is presented. The membership functions of the fuzzy variables for this controller are determined using a hybrid genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed controller works satisfactorily under various operating conditions

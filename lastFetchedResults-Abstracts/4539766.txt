The objective of a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored grant entitled, ldquoMaking Connections: Resources for K-12 Service-learning and Experiential Learning in STEM Disciplinesrdquo was to encourage K-12 educators to incorporate service-learning into the science and math curriculum by providing an easy-to-use resource. It was hoped that the use of service-learning in the science and math curriculum would help promote the entry of women and minorities into the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, increase the potential pool of engineers and scientists in the United States, contribute to the development of STEM educators and enhance cultural sensitivity, ethics and social responsibility in future STEM workers. As part of this grant, 60 local K-12 teachers were asked to use the website, facilitate an activity identified on the website and assess the usefulness of the website as well as the perceived affect the activity had on the students. All participants were asked to fill out a survey to assess the usefulness of the website as well as the perceived impact of service-learning in enhanced student interest in STEM. A subset of this group facilitated well developed career interest inventory tools prior to and after facilitating the activity in an effort to determine if the activity had an affect on the students perception of engineering or the resultant career choices. This paper will focus on the survey, assessment tools and will present the results obtained from the survey.

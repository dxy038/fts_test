Logic circuits composed of NOR or NAND elements are now being used extensively in digital systems, mainly because of their economy; one type of element may be used throughout an entire circuit. Assuming that the basic decision to use such "universal" elements has been made, the main design objective will usually be to produce either the fastest or the most economical circuit possible. The fastest NAND circuits, i.e., ones having a minimum number of levels of logic, are obtained by rewriting the minimum-OR polynomial (as obtained by the Quine-McCluskey method) in terms of the NAND connective, yielding a three-level logic (two-level if complemented inputs are available) e.g., where * represents the NAND connective. Similarly the minimum-AND polynomial may be written in terms of the NOR connective. Circuits obtained in this way are often also minimal with respect to the number of logic elements required.

In the present work, unsteady MHD flow of a Maxwellian fluid above an impulsively stretched sheet is studied under the assumption that boundary layer approximation is applicable. The objective is to find an analytical solution which can be used to check the performance of computational codes in cases where such an analytical solution does not exist. A convenient similarity transformation has been found to reduce the equations into a single highly nonlinear PDE. Homotopy analysis method (HAM) will be used to find an explicit analytical solution for the PDE so obtained. The effects of magnetic parameter, elasticity number, and the time elapsed are studied on the flow characteristics.

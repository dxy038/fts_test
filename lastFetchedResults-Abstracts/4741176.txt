Configuration management tool play an important role in software project management, it can solve a lot of problems which trouble the software project managers, Configuration management tool selection involve in many factors, it is a multifactor, complex systems engineering problem. In this paper, use the method of fuzzy decision analysis to study. First, analysis the evaluation indicators of the configuration management tool, use the decision hierarchy diagram to analysis the function, performance, cost, service and other indicators, where after, study multi-objective fuzzy decision method, including constructing the factors index matrix, constructing the fuzzy matrix, and making decisions on programs, finally, use the configuration management tool to select the instance, explain the whole process of decision analysis methods. The results show that, fuzzy decision analysis method well solves the fuzzy and non-deterministic problem, in the configuration management tool selection, practical application should be using qualitative analysis and quantitative calculated combining method, flexibility to determine the evaluation index system and its weights value.

Nowadays FSO (Free Space Optics) is a well-established technology for closing the last mile gap. This contribution will show the usage of FSO in combination with other Wireless Technologies (in the special case with WLAN and DVB-T) for regions of low Internet coverage. FSO allows a broadband access with high data rate for users not connected so far by fibre cables. It is a well-known fact that peripheral regions lack of reasonable broadband Internet services. Landlines often are outdated or have very high attenuation. WLAN and FSO (Free Space Optics) are license free transmission technologies and DVB-T has become a geographically widespread technology. This paper will show an alternative Internet access method using WLAN and FSO systems as a data uplink and DVB-T as a downlink channel for broadband data access. The work is carried out within international co-operations in the frame of a Special Programme of European Union SEE (South-East-Europe). The main objective of this strategic project is to tackle the Digital Divide by developing a joint, coordinated and viable initiative which will increase the accessibility and availability of AVMS on-demand and Information Society services offering at least minimal Internet experience to the vulnerable groups such as elderly, persons with disabilities, economically weak and all those who have a limited access to Internet services due to lack of access (rural) or limited computer/Internet literacy.

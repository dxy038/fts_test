Actualization of user-centered information system with tasks and functionalities that duly addresses users´ needs had been a motivating force for researches in user-centered design (UCD) generally. In designing Information Visualization (InfoVis), UCD models and methodologies have been adapted to address the peculiarity and diverse domain specifics of InfoVis. This UCD models´ adaptation has been done in geovisualization, spatiotemporal InfoVis, biological data visualization, among others, with none on students´ data focused InfoVis, despite the domain users´ peculiarities. Furthermore, our study on actualization of higher education institutions (HEIs) students´ data-focused InfoVis observes the incompatibility of the existing InfoVis UCD models of past related studies with the actualization of HEI domain-specific InfoVis. This incompatibility is arguably traceable to the peculiarity of the domain InfoVis users-data administrators, data analysts, the policy administrators and decision makers. Due to our work field experience, and objective argument from literatures reviewed, we employed a comparative content analysis and in-depth critique methods to modify the existing InfoVis UCD methodologies so as to feature additional stages to comply with our domain specificity. This study therefore presents a modified InfoVis UCD methodology that attends to the observed limitations of the previous works, and finally, our work in progress is presented.

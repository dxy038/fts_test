The objective of this paper is to provide insight into the basic behavior of an integrated voice/data multiplex structure by using a two-dimensional Markov analysis. The model for analysis is restricted to the movable boundary case, where the unused capacity for voice traffic is dynamically reassigned to data traffic. Numerical analysis shows a quasicapacity-limit characteristic for the data delay performance. This paper denotes this characteristic as the multi-capacity-limits (MCL) property and investigates it from a number of viewpoints.

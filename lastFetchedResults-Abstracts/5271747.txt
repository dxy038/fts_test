The brushless doubly-fed machine (BDFM) has gained renewed attention in variable-speed drive applications in recent years for its features of simple structure, favorable characteristics and economical operation. In this paper, the implementation of a field orientation control strategy of a BDFM for adjustable speed drives is presented. With the help of a synchronous reference frame dq model, a rotor flux orientation scheme is employed to achieve decoupled control of torque. A 30 kw BDFM prototype system with 80196KC single ship based controller and bidirectional power converter is built to verify the theoretical analysis. Computer simulation and laboratory experimental results are shown in favorable agreement

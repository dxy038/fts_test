Background and objective
se is a competitive inhibitor of intestinal alpha-glycosidases that slows the breakdown of sucrose and starch, thereby reducing glucose and fructose absorption. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acarbose treatment on antioxidant parameters and deposition of type I collagen in the parotid glands of diabetic rats.
s
es mellitus was induced by intravenous injection of streptozotocin, and rats were divided into four groups: non-diabetic (NDM), diabetic (DM), diabetic treated with 25 mg/kg acarbose (DMA) and non-diabetic treated with acarbose (NDMA). Changes in enzymatic antioxidant systems, such as the activity of SOD and GPx enzymes, were evaluated, and the specific staining pattern of the type I collagen fibres was investigated in the rat parotid glands.
s
 group presented high levels of SOD and GPx enzymes, which were reduced by acarbose treatment. Tissue damage, which was indicated by an increased MDA concentration in the parotid glands of rats in the DM group, was also reversed in the DMA group. Moreover, type I collagen fibres from DM rats were more intensely stained than those of NDM rats. Acarbose treatment was effective in decreasing collagen deposition, which was shown by a decrease in staining intensity of approximately 25%.
sions
results suggest that the diabetic state influences the type I collagen concentration in the parotid glands of rats. In addition, acarbose treatment was helpful in preventing the deposition of such fibres, as well the increase in oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia.

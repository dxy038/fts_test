Cellular phones continue to impress us with their capabilities as more technological advancements are achieved. It is to the point now that one could consider the cellular phone as an extension of their own body, as they need it to complete many standard tasks in todayÂ´s information technology-based age. Many ideas and technologies are being converged with cellular phone technologies, one of these being hand held language translators. They have never really achieved mass commercialisation, however now with a majority of citizens from many developed countries owning a cellular phone, hand held translation now has an excellent stage to be developed on to, especially as a cellular phone is a communication device in the first place. The objective of this research was to design and build a Japanese-to-Korean translator on a cellular phone that focuses on accuracy and portability to achieve ease of commercialisation in the continuously growing market for translation products.

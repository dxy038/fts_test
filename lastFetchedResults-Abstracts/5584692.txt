For multi-attribute decision-making problems (MADP), considering the preferences of consumers, this paper proposed a solution combining subjective and objective information, that is consumer preferences, objective factors and expert subjective judgment. Based on the natural properties of decision alternatives, the attributes matrix was constructed and then standardized. Taking the rational weights of each attribute as decision variables, the comprehensive attribute value function was converted into complementary judgment matrix. Aiming to minimize the deviation between the converted complementary judgment matrix and the consumer preferences complementary judgment matrix, the optimization model was established. Then, taking the minimum deviation between the weights of rational attributes and the weights given by decision-makers as object, another optimization model was built. Through integrating both goal programming models the reasonable weights were obtained and the method for ranking the alternatives was given. Finally, taking purchasing mobile phone video terminal as a case, we verified the usefulness and effectiveness of this method.

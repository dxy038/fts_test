A matrix method is presented for the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in loss less anisotropic layered waveguides. In those cases where bidirectional propagation is supported the concept of transverse wave impedance is introduced and an equivalent four-port network represents a single mode in the anisotropic layer extending from one interface to the next. These four-ports can be cascaded to determine the overall characteristics of the guiding structure or the polarization characteristics of a stack of thin uniaxial layers. Expressions are given for the reflection and transmission coefficient matrix of an interface, and for the condition of transverse resonance. Characteristic equations resulting from certain periodic boundary conditions have been obtained for uniaxial anisotropic media in polar and longitudinal configuration, and a software package LAYER has been prepared to implement the computations.

This paper presents a modified localization scheme of a mobile robot. When it navigates, the position error of a robot is increased and doesnÂ´t go to a goal point where the robot intends to go at the beginning. The objective of localization is to estimate the position of a robot precisely. Many algorithms were developed and still are being researched for localization of a mobile robot at present. Among them, a localization algorithm named continuous localization proposed by Schultz [2] has some merits on real-time navigation and is easy to be implemented compared to other localization schemes. Continuous Localization (CL) is based on map-matching algorithm with global and local maps using only ultrasonic sensors for making grid maps. However, CL has some problems in the process of searching the best-scored-map, when it is applied to a mobile robot. We here propose fast and powerful map-matching algorithm for localization of a mobile robot by experiments.

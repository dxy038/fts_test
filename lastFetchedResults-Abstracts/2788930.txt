3D laser scanning is becoming a standard technology to generate building models of a facilityÂ´s as-is condition. Since most constructions are constructed upon planar surfaces, recognition of them paves the way for automation of generating building models. This paper introduces a new logarithmically proportional objective function that can be used in both heuristic and metaheuristic (MH) algorithms to discover planar surfaces in a point cloud without exploiting any prior knowledge about those surfaces. It can also adopt itself to the structural density of a scanned construction. In this paper, a metaheuristic method, genetic algorithm (GA), is used to test this introduced objective function on a synthetic point cloud. The results obtained show the proposed method is capable to find all plane configurations of planar surfaces (with a wide variety of sizes) in the point cloud with a minor distance to the actual configurations.

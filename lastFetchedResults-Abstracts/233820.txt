The objective of the study is to set the bases of bioclimatic construction by learning from the traditional construction. The research is focused in the information obtained from the classical authors of Spanish vernacular architecture. The aim of this paper is to determine the design strategies used in vernacular constructions to adapt them to the environment. The results of the study can be used in two different forms: (1) to make a proposal for the recovery of vernacular constructions with peculiar bioclimatic strategies; (2) to translate some of the bioclimatic strategies used in vernacular constructions to the present ones.

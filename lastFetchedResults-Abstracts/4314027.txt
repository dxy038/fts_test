To obtain a more objective and scientific result of power quality (PQ) fuzzy synthetic evaluation, this paper presents a combined weighing method based on Deviation Function and Joint-Entropy to determine weights of PQ indices in which the whole-warp between the ideal combination of the estimated weight vectors and the combination determined by other methods became minimal and the overall situation was the least in this method. Thus, the optimization model about the weight vectors combination was constructed. An example is also given to demonstrate the precision, reliability and validity of the method.

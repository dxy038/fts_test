Our objective in this paper is to determine of the pollution resistance on insulator surface in the front of an electric discharge. Because it is practically difficult to calculate the resistance of the pollution which has three dimensions geometry for the real insulator. We propose a new method which is based on the development of the surface geometry of a real insulator to an equivalent surface of two dimensions. The comparison between measuring results obtained from the developed model of 2D and the reference of 3D model gave satisfactory results. We noticed that the position of the discharge on the surface of the polluted insulator plays an important role in the determination of the pollution resistance. This resistance value is very important in the calculation of the flashover critical voltage in presence of an electric discharge.

Minimizing service cost and adverse effects on environment and society are important in waste management. Due to this, landfill and transfer station location become important. This article as a practical research uses Analytical Hierarchy Process in Multi Criteria Decision Making considering environmental and social criteria in levels of Benefit, Opportunity, Cost and Risk (BOCR) for potential locations and use of results in multi objective modeling gives a novel framework finding locations. The proposed model has two objectives trying to minimize transportation costs and maximize environmental and social scores for potential locations, solved by weighting method. This process applied in Tehran to find landfill and hub optimal location. According to conditions, GhaleNo region for landfill and Mehrabad for hub is selected, increasing waste collection effectiveness, decreasing costs, environmental and social problems.

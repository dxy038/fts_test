In 2002, the World Health Organisation defined Pharmacovigilance as ‘the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of drug-related adverse effects or any other possible risks. The major objective of this communication is to report the neuromuscular (neurosensory and neuromotor complications as well as fatigue and myalgia) and pulmonary (dyspnoea and cough) adverse effects of CHOP regimen in patients with intermediate grade Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL). The study report revealed that the neurological and pulmonary adverse effects were increased, whereas the muscular complications were decreased during the course of CHOP chemotherapy as compared with the baseline parameters.

Background: Selection of a surgery method with best outcomes and least complications in hypospadias repair is of prime importance.
Objective: To determine the advantages and disadvantages (complications) of Snodgrass procedure using vascularized Dartos method in the repair of hypospadias.
Methods: Through an interventional study, 31 patients with mid shaft to distal hypospadias were operated using Snodgrass method supported with vascularized flap. All patients were operated once and by only one surgeon. Results of repairs were analyzed statistically. Findings: Out of 31 patients, 6 were under 3 years old, 19 between 3 to 7 years old and the rest were more than 7 years old. Results of hypospadias repair showed that there was no meatal stenosis & other complications except a fistula which was corrected surgically. Conclusion: Based on the data obtained from the present study, Snodgrass method using vascularized Dartos flap for repair of hypospadias is strongly recommended.

The administration and evaluation of figure-copying and related tasks such as the visual motor integration (VMI) assessment can, in principle, be made more efficient and effective by means of a system which can record the subject-executed image and provide on-line manipulation and analysis of the image data. The authors specifically review a novel generalised approach to achieving such an objective and, in particular, describe an interactive software toolkit which can be used to support clinical evaluation of standardised testing procedures and which can potentially improve the accuracy and objectivity of task assessment. It is also possible to extend the basic analysis described here to provide further developments to the system to emphasise in particular the extraction of dynamic image features. This type of analysis can offer the possibility of new forms of assessment not available with the purely static evaluation of subjectsÂ´ responses currently adopted in practice, and this is the subject of continuing work

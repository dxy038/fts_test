A new multilayer routing strategy for high performance multichip modules (MCMs) whose objective is to route all nets using the minimum number of layers and vias and to satisfy various design constraints is introduced. After pin redistribution, a mixed version of single layer routing and <e1>xy</e1> plane-pair routing techniques is proposed for signal distribution to establish a good tradeoff between them in order to favor circuit performance and/or design objective instead of overemphasizing the processing cost. The various strategies are compared, using practical MCM examples

Objective(s): Titanium oxides are known to be appropriate hemocompatible materials which are
suggested as coatings for blood-contacting devices. Little is known about the influence of
nanometric crystal structure, layer thickness, and semiconducting characteristics of TiO2 on
blood hemostasis.
Materials and Methods: Having used sol-gel dip coating method in this study, TiO2 thin films
were deposited on nano-scale electro-polished stainless steel 316L with 1 to 5 nano-sized layers.
Surface morphology and structure of the film were studied with X-ray diffraction and atomic
force microscopy. Blood compatibility was also determined by measuring the platelet activation
(CD62P expression), platelet adhesion (Scanning Electron Microscopy), and the blood clotting
time on these samples.
Results: The films were compact and smooth and existed mainly in the form of anatase. By
increasing the number of TiO2 thin layer, clotting time greatly extended, and the population of
activated platelet and P-selectine expression changed according to the surface characteristics of
each layer.
Conclusion: The findings revealed that stainless steel 316L coated with nano-structured TiO2
layer improved blood compatibility, in terms of both blood platelet activity and coagulation
cascade, which can decrease the thrombogenicity of blood contacting devices which were made
from stainless steel.

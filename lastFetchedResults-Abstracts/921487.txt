Objective: Oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of diabetes and cardiovascular complications of metabolic syndrome. The main objective of this study was to evaluate total antioxidant status by diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-scavenging activity in patients developed metabolic syndrome (MetS). 
Materials and Methods: Forty-four patients with MetS diagnosed on the basis of adult treatment panel (ATPIII) criteria along with 46 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were studied. A blood sample was taken after a 12-hour fasting period, and blood glucose, lipid profile, and DPPH were determined.
Results: A significant decrease (p=0.03) in DPPH-scavenging activity levels in the study group was observed compared to the control group. Among the components of metabolic syndrome, hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypertension were negatively correlated with DPPH-scavenging activity levels.
Conclusions: The findings of the present study suggest the oxidative stress in patients with MetS which further increases the cardiovascular risk and diabetes mellitus in these patients. We posited that studying of the oxidative status is crucial in order to prevent type 2 diabetes development and cardiovascular disease and its complications because it is installed long before the disease actually appears.

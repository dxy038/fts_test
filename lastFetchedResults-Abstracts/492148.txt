Biceps femoris (BF) and masseter muscle (MM) are the mixture of slow oxidative and fast-twitch fibres. Compared with MM, BF
had the significantly higher expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) fast IIx and IIb isoforms (MyHCIIx and MyHCIIb), but lower
expression of MyHC slow isoform (MyHCI) and fast IIa isoform (MyHCIIa). The objective of this study was to investigate the
expression pattern of troponin I (TnI) slow-twitch isoform (TNNI1) and fast-twitch isoform (TNNI2) in BF and MM of Yorkshire
and Meishan pigs which differed significantly in the growth rate. The expression of the TNNI1 and TNNI2 peaked at the postnatal
35 days in Yorkshire pigs and postnatal 60 days in Meishan pigs. The expression of TNNI1 and TNNI2 in Meishan pigs was
significantly higher than that in Yorkshire pigs at the foetal 60 days, while the opposite occurred at postnatal 35 days. The
expression ratio of TNNI1 relative to TNNI2 favoured TNNI2 expression in BF and MM regardless of Yorkshire and Meishan pigs.
TNNI1 expression in MM was significantly higher than that in BF at 60, 120 and 180 days in Meishan pigs and at 120 and
180 days in Yorkshire pigs. On the contrary, no significant difference of TNNI2 expression in BF and MM was found except for
Yorkshire pigs of 180 days. This study provided the foundation for future research on TnI isoforms as the model gene to study
mechanisms of muscle fibre-specific gene regulation in pigs.

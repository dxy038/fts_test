The objective was to study the expressivity of Stickler syndrome in affected children and adults in the UK and to highlight issues for improving early diagnosis, treatment and counselling. A postal questionnaire survey of the 216 members of the Stickler Syndrome Support Group was carried out. Of the 153 (71%) who responded to the questionnaire, 48 (61%) of adults and 15 (20%) of children had experienced retinal detachment; 36 (49%) of the children and 18 (23%) of the adults were born with a cleft palate. Only 5 (7%) of the children and none of the adults had been diagnosed by a cleft surgeon, although 23 (31%) of the children had been diagnosed originally as having Pierre-Robin sequence. Only a third of the adults had been given any genetic counselling. Stickler syndrome is an under-diagnosed condition with profound consequences, particularly with respect to vision. Earlier diagnosis by the cleft team may help to reduce suffering and increase awareness of the condition.

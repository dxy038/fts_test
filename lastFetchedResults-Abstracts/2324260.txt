The theorizing procedure in international relations has shifted from the micro levels towards macro levels. Accordingly, constructivism was proposed as a moderate approach to study the social and political phenomena with an emphasis on structure and individual as functionary factors. The importance of this study is due to the role assigned to governments and individuals as well as the possible mechanisms and limiting structures in shaping the international system, foreign policy behavior and the national interests. Having utilized a descriptive-analytic method, the researchers made attempts at explicating failure of Gaddafi’s foreign policy on the basis of the theory of constructivism as a moderate approach. The objective of this paper is to answer the question: What caused Gaddafi's foreign policy failures during his rule. Findings show that, contrary of domestic and foreign policy arising from Qaddafi ideas with inter- subjective local, regional and international meanings was the main factor of his foreign policy failure or inefficiency during his rule.

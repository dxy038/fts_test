Introduction: Post-operative pain after endodontic treatment is still one of the complications of this procedure. The objective of this clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of infiltration injection of dexamethasone on post-endodontic pain of necrotic teeth.
Materials & Methods: In this clinical study 30 single canal teeth with necrosis, were randomly divided into 2 groups of dexamethasone and control. After administration of local anesthesia and preparation of the access cavity, root canals were shapedusing step back technique and filled using lateral condensation technique. Then in dexamethasone group, 1ml of dexamethasone was injected through infiltration in periapical region of the roots. Post-operative pain was assessed after 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours using a visual analogue scale (VAS).
Results: Statistical analysis revealed that severity of pain in dexamethasone group, was generally lower than the control group in the first 48 hours, especially in 6 and 12 hours after treatment but this difference was not statistically significant (Pâ‰¥0.05). On the other hand, in experimental group, patients reported their pain in wider range in comparison with the control group.
Conclusion: Infiltration administration of dexamethasone did not reduce post-operative pain severity in the first 12hours after endodontic treatment. Post-endodontic pain severity was not different between men and women and either maxilla or mandible.

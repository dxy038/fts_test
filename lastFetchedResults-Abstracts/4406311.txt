The objective of the work package Policy of the LLP SALEIE project is to bring together policy administrators from institutions across Europe in order to review current practices and to identify examples of best practice. This would help build a common understanding of governance and policy implications on the strategic changes associated with the project, and create a centre for excellence in the policy area. Amongst the tools proposed to be used in the frame of SALEIE project, surveys play a major role. This paper deals with the problem of best practice examples identification based on the analysis of the data collected using the questionnaire of the survey.

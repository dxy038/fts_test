Background/Objective: Digitized mammography has several advantages over screen-film radiography in data storage and retrieval, making it a useful alternative to screen-film mammography in screening programs. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of digitized mammography in detecting breast cancer.
Patients and Methods: 185 women (845 Images) were digitized at 600 dpi. All images were reviewed by an expert radiologist. The mammograms were scored on a scale of breast imaging reporting and data system (BIRADS). The definite diagnosis was made either on the pathologic results of breast biopsy, or upon the follow-up of at least one year. The overall diagnostic accuracy of digitized mammography was calculated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve.
Results: 242 sets of mammograms had no lesions. The total counts of masses, microcalcifica-tions or both in one breast were 39 (11%), 42 (12%), and 25 (7%), respectively. There were 321 (92%) benign and 27 (8%) definite malignant lesions. The diagnostic accuracy of digitized images was 96.34% (95% Cl: 94%-98%).
Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of digitized mammography is comparably good or even better than the published results. The digitized mammography is a good substitute modality for screen-film mammography in screening programs.

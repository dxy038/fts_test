The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis with simple and effective solutions for unwanted incidents, termed as sympathetic trippings, in distribution network, due to a fault in transmission network. This paper analyses such occurrences and provide effective solution using economical, safe and reliable methods. However, all mitigation methods should be carefully analyzed by considering various constraints and criticality concerns in the distribution network before implementation.

Background and Objective: With respect to epilepsy prevalence and the fact that some of the patients remain refractory to available antiepileptic drugs, design of suitable drugs, without unwanted side effects is necessary. The use of plant extracts to treat diseases is proposed as a therapeutic modality. Lavandula officinalis (L. officinalis), commonly known as ustukhuddoos, has been used for a long time in traditional medicine for some of nervous disorders like epilepsy. The aim of this investigation was to provide a scientific basis for traditional use of L. officinalis in epilepsy.

Materials and Methods: A total of 60 male NMRI mice weighing 25 to 30 g were randomly divided into six groups including: 1. PTZ, 2. positive control (PTZ and valproate 150 mg/kg, as an anticonvulsant drug), 3 to 5. mice received  L. officinalis extract at three doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg, and 6. mixed group which received L. officinalis (200 mg/kg) and valproate (100 mg/kg) i.p. All groups were kindled by 11 injections of PTZ (35 mg/kg) with an interval of 48 h. In the 12th   injection, all groups were tested for PTZ challenge dose (75 mg/kg). The phases of seizure (0-6), threshold and duration of second and fifth phases were observed for 30 min after PTZ injection.

Results: Data analysis showed that L. officinalis could reduce intensity and duration of seizures. In addition, there was no phase 5 following L. officinalis treatment. Anti-epileptic effect in mix group was not more than the L. officinalis group.

Conclusion: Antiepileptic effect of chronic administration of L. officinalis was established and it was more effective at a dose of 200 mg/kg than doses of 400 and 800 mg/kg. Meanwhile, L. officinalis could reduce seizure phases better than valproic acid.

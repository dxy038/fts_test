The objective of this paper is to design radio resource management policies for supporting the effective delivery of multicast service in Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) systems. Specifically, we propose multicast subgrouping-based solutions to maximize the system efficiency in terms of throughput under the constraints that 1) all user equipment devices are served and that 2) fairness among the activated multicast subgroups is guaranteed to avoid usersÂ´ dissatisfaction. These results are obtained by modeling the multicast subgroup formation problem through a bargaining game. Moreover, an algorithm, which achieves the optimal fairness&#8211;efficiency tradeoff, is proposed to support the system in selecting the most appropriate solution in terms of 1) subgroups activated over each system carrier and 2) resource allocated to them.

In self-organized ad hoc networks, nodes usually belong to different authorities and pursue different goals. To save their valuable resources, they tend to be selfish. Meanwhile, some nodes may be malicious whose objective is to degrade the network performance. In this paper, we present an anti-attack cooperation stimulation system for self-organized ad hoc networks to stimulate cooperation among selfish nodes and to defend against attacks. In the proposed system, the damage that can be caused by attackers is bounded, and the cooperation among selfish nodes is enforced. Simulation studies also verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. Another key property of the proposed system is that it is fully distributive, and does not require any tamper-proof hardware or central management point.

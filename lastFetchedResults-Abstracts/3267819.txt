The radiated emission from a device under test is predicted by using an equivalent dipole approach which is based on amplitude-only near-field scanning. The method needs minimizing an objective function to determine the parameters of the equivalent dipoles. The objective function usually exhibits many local minima, and this limits the application of local optimization algorithms. A restarted differential evolution algorithm is hence proposed to overcome the limitation. Experimental data are used to verify the presented approach.

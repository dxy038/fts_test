World Health Organization (WHO) cites
malnutrition as the greatest single threat to the world's
public health. The objective of the application is to provide a
way to reduce malnutrition in children by introducing a new
system which will function under the e-government initiatives
by using Agent Technology and Data mining technique (such
as rule based classification). Multi-agent systems have a set of
properties that make them suitable for use in solving the
many problems that are encountered in the healthcare
domain. This paper outlines the architecture & working of
the system which will consists of agents such as User Identify
Agent, Advice Agent, Resource Agent, Admin/Government,
Reporting Agent and Detection Engine. The proposed system
will be helpful to provide the necessary information about the
patientâ€™s medical status. Information is organized and
managed as a utility for patients, but at the same time it is
also based on requirements of the government & the assigned
authentication of the user. The system is further enhanced in
order to provide required information about the specific
nutrition status about the patient. And also it will provide the
convenient way for citizens to check nutrition status of their
child. System is further improved by in cooperating rule
based classification technique to detect malnutrition

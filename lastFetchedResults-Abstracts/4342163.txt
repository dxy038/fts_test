This paper covers the results of the radio architecture studies towards common multistandard compatible radio front-ends (operating in the 2 GHz band) carried out within the RACE Project 2123 GIRAFE (Gigahertz Radio Front Ends) which is a research project in the area of mobile telecommunications focused on the application of advanced microelectronics integration and packaging techniques for RF components to be used in terminals of future mobile communications systems. These terminals will be based on combinations of available second generation systems in Europe (GSM, DCS1800, DECT and INMARSAT). The objective is to create a set of RF building blocks (RX and TX mixers, 90&#176; phase shifters, VCO and prescaler) and develop multistandard RF front-ends in a high frequency bipolar process, complemented by the investigation and adaptation of novel packaging techniques which have a major impact in manufacturing low cost, high volume RF components

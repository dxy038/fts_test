In this paper, network location problems with several objectives are discussed, where every single objective is a classical median objective function. We will look at the problem of finding Pareto optimal locations and lexicographically optimal locations. It is shown that for Pareto optimal locations in undirected networks no node dominance result can be shown. Structural results as well as efficient algorithms for these multicriteria problems are developed. In the special case of a tree network, a generalization of Goldman's dominance algorithm for finding Pareto locations is presented. Â© 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Networks 33: 79-92, 1999

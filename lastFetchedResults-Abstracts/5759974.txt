A well-known objective method of speech quality measurement is the ITU-T P.862 PESQ. This input/output-based method of perceptual quality evaluation operates on a transmitted (input) and received (output) speech signal to compute an objective perceptual quality score for the received signal. In this paper, we present F-PESQ, a novel output-based method of applying PESQ to received speech signals assumed to be coded in a framed format. It enables the application of PESQ to voice calls in networks without requiring knowledge of the transmitted signals. As such, it may be applied in vivo to voice calls at end-devices. The accuracy of F-PESQ is evaluated with analysis and simulations of frame loss with G.711, G.723, and G.729 codecs. A client/server architecture is presented for minimizing the computational requirements that F-PESQ imposes on end-devices. We also show how F-PESQ can be combined with the ITU-T G.I 07 E-model in a MOSC (conversational mean opinion score) measurement method that accounts for additional factors such as round-trip delay.

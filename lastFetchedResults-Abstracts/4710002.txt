Electing the best eligible coach, getting the nice-to-have reflect expert idea´s result, and avoiding the effect of difference between subjective preference and objective preference on decision makers are the major problems of this paper. In order to minimize decision maker´s total deviation between subjective preference value and objective preference value, we adopt alternative preference information referred to as utility value to study candidate coach electing problem. To make decision making reasonable, the choice of attribute weight must make total deviation of decision maker´s subjective preference and objective preference value minimized. Adopting numerical example to the actual selection of candidate coaches, the effects of it are fairer.

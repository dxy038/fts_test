Bluetongue is one of the viral disease in ruminants. The type species of the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae. It is transmitted by colicoides. This study was conducted on 200 sheep blood samples from 19 sheep flocks in 7 villages of  Khoy in the West- North of Iran. 160 sheep are ewe and 40 are male. The objective was describing the prevalence and distribution of serum antibodies to Bluetongue virus (BTV) in a sample. Competitive ELISA was applied to detect antibodies. 134 samples (67%) were positive and 66 samples (33%) were negative. 23 of males and 111 of females were positive (57.50% and 69.37%, respectively). The difference prevalence of antibodies in serum between male and females was not significant(p > 0.05). The relationship between prevalence antibodies in serum and age-groups was significant (phi= 0.59) and (p < 0.05). From this study it is concluded that the bluetongue antibodies presence in the sheep sera from Khoy sheep flocks and can to create a disease.

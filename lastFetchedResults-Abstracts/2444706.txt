How the term “Neoclassical Economics” was introduced to
economics and what thoughts does it point to? Does the current use of this
term conform to the original efforts of the founders of it? These are among
the questions which always have drawn the attention of economists. The
term "Neoclassical Economics" was primarily introduced to the modern
economics by Veblen. What he meant by it was the marginalist thoughts
of late 19th century and early 20th century.
Marginalists resorted to subjective preferences in order to escape from
the theory of objective value prevalent in Classical economics. They had
hoped to make the foundations of economics more scientific by putting
objective value aside. Despite the early developments, the efforts became
so abstract after a while that could be considered anything but a theory
about human behavior. By reviewing the scientific life of neoclassical
economics in this paper, we will show how this school of thought was
formed, what its characteristics were and what it became during the time.
We will also show that the founders of this school of thought, despite
what is mainly believed, didn't have an anti-historical and anti-institutional
approach.

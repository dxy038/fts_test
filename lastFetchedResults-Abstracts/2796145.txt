This paper presents a comparative study of routing metrics intended to optimize routing reliability and maximum link utilization (MLU) for network provisioning. The routing metrics are applied to a novel Path Indexed Linear Program (PILP) that simultaneously minimizes the MLU and maximizes the expected satisfied demand (ESD) from source nodes to destination nodes while considering a probabilistic link failure model. ESD is a performance objective that measures the expectation of the aggregate satisfied traffic demand. Additionally, a new weighted sum routing metric that produces better trade-off solutions than those by traditional routing metrics is proposed.

This letter discusses various indices to define or quantify harmonic contributions of a customer and its supply utility to the distortions at the point of common coupling (PCC). The relationships among the indices are examined through case studies and circuit analysis. It was found that there are still many unsolved problems in this subject. The objective of this letter is to serve as a stepping stone for other researchers to investigate the subject area.

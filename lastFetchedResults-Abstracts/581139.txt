Background and Objective: Some cardiovascular risk factors are more prevalent in Middle Eastern countries than in other parts of the world. Lifestyle-related factors, including diet, might account for this discrepancy. We aimed to identify the association between food intake patterns and cardiovascular risk factors among Iranian adult women. 
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 486 apparently healthy Iranian women aged 40â€“60 years were studied. A Willett-format FFQ was used to collect dietary data. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations, lipid profiles, and blood pressure were measured. Diabetes was defined as FPG  >  or = 126 mg/dl; diagnosis of dyslipidemia was based on Adult Treatment Panel III and that of hypertension on Joint National Committee VI recommendations. The presence of at least 1 or 2 of the 3 major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes) was also evaluated.
Results: We identified 3 major (healthy, Western, and Iranian) eating patterns. After controlling for potential confounders, the subjects in the top quintile of the healthy dietary pattern were less likely to have dyslipidemia [odds ratio (OR), 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.53], hypertension (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.60), at least 1 (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.18-0.58), and at least 2 risk factors (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.77) compared with the lowest quintile. In contrast, those with greater adherence to the Western dietary pattern had greater odds for cardiovascular risk factors (OR, 2.59-3.11; P  <  0.05). The Iranian dietary pattern was significantly associated with dyslipidemia (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.02-2.99) and at least 1 risk factor (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.05-3.20). The major dietary patterns were not associated with diablets risk.
Conclusion: It seems that major dietary patterns are associated with cardiovascular risk factors among Tehranian women.

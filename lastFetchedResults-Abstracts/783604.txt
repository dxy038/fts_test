Objective The aim of the study was to
examine an alternative way of scoring the Camberwell
Assessment of Need (CAN) for the purpose of service
evaluation, using the by us defined Social Services (SI)
and Psychiatric Services (PI) subindices. Methods CAN
assessments in 1997 and 1999 of 262 outpatients
(mean age 45 years, 77.1% psychotic disorders) were
reanalysed to fit the SI and the PI, which were compared
to the full CAN. Results The mean total needs
on the full CAN decreased from 6.65 to 6.22
(P = 0.007), as did the mean unmet needs (1.55–1.81,
P = 0.049). The mean total needs on the PI decreased
from 2.42 to 2.22 (P = 0.006), as did the mean unmet
needs (1.66–0.57, P < 0.001). No changes in mean
needs occurred on the SI. Conclusions All significant
changes occurred on the PI, indicating a more beneficial
outcome of the psychiatric care than the social
care in terms of meeting needs, a result impossible to
discern from the total scores of the CAN. Thus, output
scores on subindices of the CAN might be useful as
outcome measures in service evaluation

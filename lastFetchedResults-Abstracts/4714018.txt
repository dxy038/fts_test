The objective of this study was to explore the subject matter in curriculum construction of bilingual education (BE) for majors of tourism management (MTM) in Chinese tertiary education (CTE). Data (n=157) were collected from school administrators, BE teachers, MTM, and insiders of tourism industry via self-administered questionnaire. The subject matter of BE was elaborated based on Joseph Schwab´s notion of four commonplaces&#8212;the subject matter, the learner, the teacher, and the milieu in curriculum construction. The results of this study showed the criteria in selecting BE courses, their linkage and continuity with other relevant units, terms and time allocation for BE courses, teaching pedagogies and classroom teaching-learning process design. Moreover, a unique process evaluating effectiveness of the subject matter for MTM was posited in line with Ralph Tyler´s concept of curriculum continuum. The implication of this research is also discussed at the end of this paper.

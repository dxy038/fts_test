In this paper, a solar hybrid desiccant air conditioning system, which combines the technologies of two-stage desiccant cooling
(TSDC) and air-source vapor compression air-conditioning (VAC) together, has been configured, experimentally investigated and theoretically
analyzed. The system mainly includes a TSDC unit with design cooling capacity for 10 kW, an air-source VAC unit with 20 kW
in nominal cooling capacity, a flat plate solar collector array for 90 m2, a hot water storage tank and a cooling tower. Performance model
of the system has been created in TRNSYS simulation studio. The objective of this paper is to report the test result of the solar hybrid air
conditioning system and evaluate the energy saving potential, thereby providing useful data for practical application. Experimental
results show that, under typical weather condition, the solar driven desiccant cooling unit can achieve an average cooling capacity of
10.9 kW, which contributes 35.7% of the cooling capacity provided by the hybrid system. Corresponding average thermal COP is over
1.0, electric COP is up to 11.48. Under Beijing (temperate), Shanghai (humid) and Hong Kong (extreme humid) weather conditions, the
solar TSDC unit can remove about 57%, 69% and 55% of the seasonal moisture load, thereby reducing electric power consumption by
about 31%, 34% and 22%, respectively. These suggest that the solar hybrid system is feasible for a wide range of operating conditions.

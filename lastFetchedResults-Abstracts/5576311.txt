The issue of human health with environmental safety has always been critically important aspect in human life. Especially when it comes to the issue of the effects and threats posed by risk of disasters which causes devastation and destruction to humansÂ´ health and ecological regions. Disaster is a combination of natural or artificial threats and human activities. Vulnerability to be result from the lack of appropriate disaster management plans, which leads to financial, infrastructural, economical, social and human damages and destructions on a large scale. However, team working simulation has become supremely important in modern organizations due to its beneficial outcomes. However, teamwork performance levels are determined by, namely: the complexity of interaction and coordination between the attributes of its individual members, the communication and dynamics between team members, the working environment, as well as the team working tasks. As building industries and organizations evolve, so also does the interactive nature of their teamwork communication. Product developments have been increasingly undertaken by a multidisciplinary integrated unit of teams. Such increasing complexity means that the interactive nature of methods for studying teamwork must also evolve as a sound research area of study, especially towards the building construction industries. The main objective of this paper focuses on the use of an agent-based modeling (ABS) concept of approach towards the simulation of building consultant teamwork in the construction industry.

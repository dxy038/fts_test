This paper reports the radiation characteristics of a low cost and simple structure bidirectional antenna by using a linear probe in a rectangular ring. The radiation pattern is obtained from the Fourier transformation of the aperture field which is derived from the field inside the ring by using GreenÂ´s function. From the numerical result of the radiated field, for a specific ring dimension, the optimum length which provides the maximum directivity are calculated and chosen as a design parameter. Experimental results, verifying the bidirectional radiation, agree very well with the computational result

The scheduling and allocation phase is a critical phase in the high-level behavioral synthesis of ASICs. A neural network model is presented which schedules a dataflow graph under several simultaneous constraints: a limited number of control steps, buses, and hardware units, and an objective to minimize data path lengths. Comparisons with such heuristic approaches as ALAP demonstrate typically superior solutions

Abnormal increase of ventricular repolarization dispersion (VRD) is an important risk factor for severe arrhythmia development. An increased VRD implies a modification of the spatio/temporal T wave morphology. Our objective is to study the ECG derived VRD feature markers that better represent the electrical modifications generated by increased VRD in an in vitro rabbit heart experiment which has global VRD induced, at all myocardium areas, by supplying d-Sotalol (dS) and by premature ventricular stimulation (PVS). Temporal (T-wave duration, T <sub>W</sub>) and geometrical (mean repolarization axis, Theta<sub>XT </sub>, measured respect to a fix reference X axis) features were shown as the better markers of increased VRD, with the higher discrinant power in the T wave duration. Results are: T<sub>W</sub>:(95plusmn7 ms) vs (118plusmn15 ms) for Control vs PVS; T<sub>W</sub>:(78plusmn10 ms) vs (133plusmn29 ms) for Control vs dS; Theta<sub>XT</sub>-(35plusmn51deg) vs (117plusmn49deg) for Control vs dS

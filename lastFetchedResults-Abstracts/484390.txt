Results: In 120 sheep's serum samples prevalence of T. gondii was 59%. To titers ranged from 1:2 to 1:32. Likewise out of 100 studied bovine samples only 5% were infected and comparing with sheep's had low frequency of infection. In goats the rate of frequency of infection were 36%. The results of our study showed highest frequency of the infection among sheep and goat.

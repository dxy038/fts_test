The development of non-conventional water resources in Egypt is a must in order to respond to the continuously increasing demand. The present paper presents the results of an investigation undertaken in order to evaluate technically and economically the installed desalination units in Sinai. The available water resources were evaluated. Forecast study was undertaken in order to evaluate the expected shortage. The future need for desalination units was identified. The main objective of this work is to identify the potential sites for desalination project implementation.

Coarse Grained Recongurable Multimedia Architectures(CGRMAs) have become increasingly important in recent years, due to its potential to greatly accelerate a wide variety of applications. The lack of compilation technology for all kinds of CGRMAs causes a bottleneck in the current design process. In this paper, we present a Level Depth Based Mapping (LDBM) algorithm, the objective is to support CGRMAs. Experimental results using LDBM on a typical CGRMAs show that the LDBM algorithm can get the less using time of reconfigurable cell array (RCA) and the fewer number of I/O edges between blocks than Level Based Mapping (LBM) based on the same pipelined architectures. On the other hand, LDBM can obtain the better utilization rate of RCA.

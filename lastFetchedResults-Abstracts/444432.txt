 : Abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal neoplasm are occasionally discovered concurrently. Simultaneous operative therapy may be an effective alternate management strategy to a staged procedure.
 : The medical records of 10 consecutive patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and nephrectomy for renal neoplasm were reviewed. Data collected included mode of presentation, preoperative evaluation, renal pathology, and in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Long-term follow-up was obtained through office records and telephone contact.
 : In 7 patients, the renal mass was identified during evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The aneurysm was identified during evaluation of hematuria in 2 patients. One patient was discovered to have both conditions simultaneously. All patients underwent successful aneurysm repair and nephrectomy. Pathology revealed 6 renal cell carcinomas, 2 complex cysts, 1 hemangiopericytoma, and 1 oncocytoma. Four patients have died in the follow-up period: 1 of metastatic cancer and 3 of unrelated causes. There have been no cases of graft infection.
 : Simultaneous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and nephrectomy for neoplasm is an appropriate management strategy for selected patients

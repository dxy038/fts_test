A new approach is suggested for designing and developing an employment influence factors correlation analysis application where GMDH principle is used for generating it more easily. This approach uses self-organizing data mining importing the concept of evolution based on principle of GMDH and enables the knowledge extraction process on a highly automated level and generates optimal complex model in an objective way. In correlation analysis of employment considering domestic economic factors, model structure is created automatically using self-organizing data mining technology and the internal correlations between these factors are found.

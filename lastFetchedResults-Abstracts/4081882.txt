In this paper, we study a practical coding scheme for the dying binary erasure channel (DBEC), which is a binary erasure channel (BEC) subject to a random fatal failure. We consider the rateless codes and optimize the degree distribution to maximize the average recovery probability. In particular, we first study the upper bound of the average recovery probability, based on which we define the objective function as the gap between the upper bound and the average recovery probability achieved by a particular degree distribution. We then seek the optimal degree distribution by minimizing the objective function. A simple and heuristic approach is also proposed to provide a suboptimal but good degree distribution. Simulation results are presented to show the significant performance gain over the conventional LT codes.

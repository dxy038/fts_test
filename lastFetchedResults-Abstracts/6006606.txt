Contamination-driven insulators failure causing wooden pole fire is a problem that increasingly disturbs H.V distribution systems in Australia as well as other countries of the world.. This paper presents an improved mathematical model for leakage current with various wood parameters and different environmental factors using dimensional analysis technique. The objective of the study is to understand the signature of the leakage current under various environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature and atmospheric pressure. The results obtained from the proposed algorithm are compared to experimental results of other researchers, and found to be in good agreement.

Wind power generation brings new challenges to the security operation of power system due to its intermittency and uncontrollable. There are some special characters in China, such as large-scale, long distance transmission and lack of flexible regulating power. For short-term power dispatching, it is an important issue to obtain the security limit of wind power integration capacity. This paper presents a novel algorithm for evaluate wind power integration capability in daily system operation based on security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED). Through objective conversion, a wind power integration capability optimization model is established, which can fully consider the regulation ability of traditional generation resources as well as the coordination and optimization of grid safety. The model is solved by commercial software CPLEX and the maximum wind power generation curve of all wind farms is obtained. Numerical simulations indicate the effectiveness of the proposed evaluate algorithm.

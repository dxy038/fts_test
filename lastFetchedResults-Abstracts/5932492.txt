This paper has as principal objective to determine the value of some parameters of light that are determinants in the activation or inhibition of the growth stimulus in a biological system. In this case intensity and dose, as important parameters, were considered. Semiconductor and GaAIAs lasers with &#955;=650 nm were used to irradiate the biological systems. In the first part of this study three different biological systems were defined. In the first biological system Triticum aestivum L (wheat) seeds were used; for the second biological system Cucumis sativus L (cucumber) seeds were used, and finally for the third biological system human fibroblasts were used. The responses of the three biological systems were analyzed using statistical processes when intensity and dose were varied. The results obtained indicate that when the appropriate light parameters are used activation or inhibition can occur.

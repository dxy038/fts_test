Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of local capsaicin cream as an effective treatment for patients with documented vulvar vestibulitis syndrome.
Study design
A retrospective chart review was performed for patients who received a diagnosis of vulvar vestibulitis syndrome that was treated with capsaicin. Patients performed local application of capsaicin 0.025% cream for 20 minutes daily for 12 weeks. A comparison was made between the pre- and posttreatment Kaufman touch test to evaluate discomfort. The Marinoff dyspareunia scale was also used to assess pre- and posttreatment.
Results
The sum of the Kaufman touch test scores before the treatment (13.2 ± 4.9) compared with the scores after treatment (4.8 ± 3.8) was statistically improved (P< .001). A significant improvement was also observed at each individual site (P< .001). The Marinoff dyspareunia scale also showed a significant improvement (P< .001).
Conclusion
Vulvar vestibulitis syndrome that is treated with capsaicin significantly decreases discomfort and allows for more frequent sexual relations.

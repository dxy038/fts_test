We present an approach that links nonlinear model reduction techniques with control vector parametrization-based schemes to efficiently solve dynamic constraint optimization problems arising in the context of spatially-distributed processes governed by highly-dissipative nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed approach is applied to a metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy process for the production of GaN thin films, with the objective to minimize the spatial non-uniformity of the deposited film across the substrate surface.

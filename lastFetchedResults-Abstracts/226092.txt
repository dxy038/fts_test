The optimal operation of a continuous crystallizer is studied by taking a real industrial scale crystallizer as an example. The
objective function to be maximized is the production rate of the crystals which are larger than a certain size. Since continuous crys-
tallizers exhibit sustained oscillation, it is important to ®nd the optimal operation under oscillatory condition. In this study, the
optimal operating condition is derived for two types of operation: one is the case where the manipulated variables are kept constant
(constant input operation), and the other is the case where the values of manipulated variables are changed periodically (time varying
input operation). The optimization result of time varying input operation indicates that the production rate of large crystals can be
increased if the number of ®ne crystals in the vessel is reduced by withdrawing along with the product. Furthermore, this study
examines the optimal operation of the crystallizer in the case where the sustained oscillation is eliminated by a stabilizing controller.
The optimization result clearly indicates that the production rate of large crystals can be signi®cantly increased if the operation is
optimized under the condition where crystal size distribution (CSD) is stabilized.

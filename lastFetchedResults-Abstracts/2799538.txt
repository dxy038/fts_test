The objective of this paper is to expand the concept of hybrid modeling and control in power electronics area. A new precise and non-averaged model of a DC-DC boost converter is developed on the basis of Mixed Logical Dynamical (MLD) systems, and the approach is extended by a new version of such systems which is called as Extended Mixed Logical Dynamical (EMLD) systems in this paper. A Model Predictive Controller (MPC) based on the Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) is designed for the MLD and EMLD models of the DC-DC boost converter considering all possible dynamics in Continuous and Discontinuous Conduction Modes of operations (CCM-DCM). The simulation results show the satisfactory performance of the closed-loop control system over a wide range of operating points and verify the advantages of the EMLD model over the MLD one in terms of the complexity of the resulting optimizations in the relative MPC controllers.

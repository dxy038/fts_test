The research on `Pedagogical potentials of IEEE 802.11 WLAN to Nigerian based University´ is an in depth study to evaluate the potentials of its implementation to the entire teaching and tutoring vertical in Nigerian universities. While conducting this research study, the campus did not have the facility of Wireless internet service. Researchers are to provide the WLAN-Wireless local area network service to support the communication protocol limiting to shorter distances within a definite range with aid of infrared signals and radio networks. For this study, data collection is made over two periods, i.e., first, at the time of launching WLAN in order to gain an overview of the academic performance of the students and in the second instance, after providing the training to use WLAN, at the end of the semester. This study is conducted over a period equivalent to one semester. The objective of this is to identify any improvements in the performance of the students and the teaching staff after the completion of the training. The key performance indicator `Academic outcome / Performance of students and attitude of faculty´ on wireless internet in the campus is captured through the study and relevant statistical tools and techniques are applied to the data. The ascent in the academic outcome of students and the performance of the faculty is evident for the benefit of WLAN technology. This paper will cover the literature review and basic model of possible relationship between depend and independent variables of the research in detail.

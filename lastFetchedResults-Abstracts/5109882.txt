We introduce a simple texture synthesis method based on support vector machines (SVM). Although SVM has been effectively used for various pattern recognition tasks, there is no report available on directly applying SVM for texture synthesis. The advantage of using SVM is that the sample can be simply modeled by a linear model and is not required during the synthesis stage. In addition, the method can be further extended to synthesize 3D surface texture or bidirectional texture functions. Our experimental results show that the method can successfully model and synthesize semi or highly structured textures, which can be difficult subjects for previous texture synthesis methods based on parametric models.

A study from the Business Internet Group San Francisco (BIG-SF) reported approximately 70% of websites contain bugs (resided in both static pages and dynamic pages) and suffer some kind of failure. Interestingly, these sites include not only commercial websites but also US government managed websites. It is our objective to better understand why testers are unable to reveal certain kind of bugs. We have reviewed several testing methods, summarized their techniques, and listed the kinds of problems that can or cannot be tested. Consequently, we suggest a complementary solution by re-using the existing methods for web applications testing that may prove fruitful.

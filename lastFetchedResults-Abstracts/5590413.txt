An improved Wiener filtering method for reducing background noise added to speech in colored noise environments like car engine is proposed in this paper. This implementation uses the crosscorrelartion between the speech and noise signals. The noise signal does not affect the speech signal uniformly over the whole spectrum. A nonlinear multi-band Bark scale frequency spacing approach was proposed to reduce colored noise. However, classic short-time noise reduction techniques, including this Wiener filter, introduce some residual noise that remains in the enhanced speech signal. To reduce residual noise the proposed Wiener filter is combined with constrained perceptual weighting filter. Objective and subjective tests demonstrated the proposed technique can improve the perceptual quality of speeches.

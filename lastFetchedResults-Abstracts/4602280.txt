This paper presents an innovative theoretic and numerical approach for modeling the classic pulse introduce by Nyquist, which is a very important a digital modulation that one of the main stakes of the area of digital signal processing. An appropriate revision over concept of Operational Window Aperture with the purpose to check our approach by applying it over the Raised Cosine pulse, and as a direct consequence will permit to reach our final objective. A complementary revision will be made over the new concept of a digital modulation introduced by the authors previously which was defined as the Rise Time Modulation (RTM) since part of this technological approach will be concerned in this paper. The technique adopted for modeling both full and half pulses can be applied for a wide class of digital transmission systems which demand an appropriate modeling for all communication channels. Some considerations will be performed to present a Nyquist pulse with distinct two roll off factors, that can results the optimization of the interference as well as the intrinsic noises that appear in those systems with a very high transmission rates.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pathology of hirschsprung's disease is a ganglionic colon, and the most common symptom is chronic constipation. Surgical intervention started with stages pull-through from last decades, but since 1980, many pediatric surgeons have performed one stage pull-through with excellent results.
METHODS: From 1992 to 1998, 40 patients with hirschsprung 's disease who were divided into two patient groups (20 patients in each group) operated with different stages (Swenson) and one-stage pull through procedures in Mofid children's hospital and the results of these two procedures were compared with each other.
FINDINGS: Six years evaluation reveals one stage pull-through takes less time, has less cost, short staying in hospital, less complications and earlier recovery than stages procedures.
CONCLUSION: One stage pull-through in HD is a safe and effective procedure, but most important point is patient selection.

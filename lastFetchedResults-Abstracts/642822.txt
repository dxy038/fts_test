Objective
Bariatric surgery is the most effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity, reducing obesity-associated comorbidities. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the fatty acid–binding protein-2 Ala54Thr polymorphism outcomes 1 y after biliopancreatic diversion in morbidly obese patients.
Methods

A sample of 41 morbidly obese patients (body mass index >40 kg/m2) were operated upon from December 2004 to December 2006. Weight, fat mass, blood pressure, basal glucose, triacylglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured at the basal visit and at each visit. The frequency of patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was recorded at each visit.
Results

Twenty-three patients (56.1%) had genotype Ala54/Ala54 (wild group) and 18 patients had genotype Ala54/Thr54 (15 patients, 36.5%) or Thr54/Thr54 (3 patients, 7.4%; mutant group). In the wild group, body mass index, weight, fat mass, systolic blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triacylglycerol concentrations decreased. Diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. In the mutant group, the same parameters improved, without statistical differences from the wild group. Initial excess weight percent loss at 1 y of follow-up was similar in both genotype groups (61.8% versus 61.9%, NS).
Conclusion

Polymorphism Ala54Thr of fatty acid–binding protein did not have an effect on weight loss or clinical outcomes after bariatric surgery.

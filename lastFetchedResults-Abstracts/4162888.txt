Video frame resizing has received more and more research attention as contemporary video distributions need to deliver video to various receiving devices with different display resolutions. It is now becoming necessary for video distribution systems to be able to generate higher resolution video from lower resolution one for some end users. Current schemes in video up-sampling either only focused on improving visual quality with little or no improvement in objective quality or increasing the up-sampling accuracy by adaptively optimizing interpolation methods. Many such algorithms are typically quite complex and require substantial extra implementation efforts. In this letter, we propose a new hybrid DCT-Wiener-based interpolation scheme for video intra frame up-sampling without referencing the original high resolution video frames. This scheme takes full advantage of interpolation in both DCT domain and spatial domain and seamlessly integrates these two approaches to design an improved up-sampling filter. Experiments have been carried out to demonstrate that noticeable improvement in both objective and visual quality are obtained. With similar complexity, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 4 dB gain in PSNR over fixed parameter Wiener filter-based interpolation, 4 dB gain over popular bicubic interpolation, and 1 dB gain over up-sampling scheme in DCT domain.

This paper presents the use of a Taylor series for fuzzy multiobjective linear fractional programming problems (FMOLFP). The Taylor series is a series expansion that a representation of a function. In the proposed approach, membership functions associated with each objective of fuzzy multiobjective linear fractional programming problem transformed by using a Taylor series are unified. Thus, the problem is reduced to a single objective. Practical applications and numerical examples are used in order to show the efficiency and superiority of the proposed approach.

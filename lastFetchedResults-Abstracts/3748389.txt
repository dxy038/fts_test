The authors present field measurements and the results of a three-dimensional canopy model inversion for sand shinnery oak. Spectral bidirectional radiance measurements in three spectral channels, 0.65-0.67 &#956;m, 0.81-0.84 &#956;m, and 1.62-1.69 &#956;m, encompassing both the complete land surface and sky hemispheres, were acquired for a sand shinnery oak plant community in west Texas. The changes in canopy reflectance that occur with variations in solar zenith angle and view direction and for two seasons of the year were evaluated. A three-dimensional radiation interaction model (TRIM) was then inverted to estimate oak leaf area index (LAI) and canopy density, expressed as percentage of cover, from the bidirectional reflectance data

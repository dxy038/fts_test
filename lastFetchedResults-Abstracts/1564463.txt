Under investigation in this paper is the Hirotaâ€“Maccari equation, which is a generalized ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional model in fluid dynamics, plasma physics and optical fiber communication. With the aid of the Hirota bilinear method and symbolic computation, the corresponding N-soliton solutions are given and illustrated. The characteristic face method and asymptotic analysis are applied to discuss the solitonic propagation and collision, including the bidirectional solitons, elastic interactions and inelastic interactions. Finally, a kind of special phenomenon with the parameters varying is investigated, which might provide people with useful information on the dynamics of the relevant fields.

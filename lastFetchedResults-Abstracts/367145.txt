In the field of in vitro  biocompatibility testing, the investigation of cell response at the interface with a biomaterial is of great importance; there is a need for standard conditions and thus of well-defined and reliable sources of materials for an objective evaluation of cellular function. Thrombin is often used in vitro as a stimulating agent to check the specific functions of cultured endothelial cells. In the present work, and in order to select a thrombin of commercial origin, two criteria were borne in mind: purity towards the presence of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) and effectiveness towards vWF release by human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) that have been submitted to four human commercial thrombins. We detected the presence of vWF in some thrombin solutions that have not yet been in contact with HUVEC. The different thrombins contained vWF antigen ranging from less than 0.1 mUnit per NIH unit of thrombin (from Diagnostica Stago and Sigma Chemical Co.) to 10–20 mUnit per NIH unit of Fibrindex® thrombin (from Ortho Diagnostic Systems). Thus, if vWF is present in commercial thrombins, it contributes to and overestimates the vWF appearance in the media resulting from cell stimulation. Consequently, we fixed on thrombin from Diagnostica Stago for further studies involving HUVEC on biomaterials.

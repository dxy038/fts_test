Background: G6PD deficiency probably is one of the most important factors for sever icterous and hemolytic crisis in neonates.
Objective: This study was done to determine the prevalence of G6PD deficiency by NADP test in jaundiced newborns.
Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study that over 15 month investigated 270 infants with jaundice, admitted in Amir hospital in Semnan. Demographic data were collected. Also laboratory tests including blood grouping, hematocrit, hemoglobin, coombs' test, reticulocyte count, bilirobin and NADP test, were done.
Finding: Results indicated that 4.44% of newborns had G6PD deficiency. Jaundice began in the 2-3 days after birth. In 40% of newborns with G6PD deficiency, total bilirubin was higher than 18 mg/dl. The most common blood group (42%) was 13+ and 20% had family history and coombs' test was negative in all newborns.
Conclusion: Findings showed that G6PD deficiency is relatively prevalent in icterous newborns.

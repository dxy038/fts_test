Green computing technology has been considered upon different aspects in IT such as reducing the complexity of systems, limitations in physical environment, decreasing costs and reducing energy consumption. Virtualization technology and a security solution to analyze the traffic between Virtual Machines(VMs)have been researched in previous green IT papers. The main objective of this work is not only to analyze and compare these green technology papers, but also to ensure these security problems and solutions for green computing technology concepts are surveyed.

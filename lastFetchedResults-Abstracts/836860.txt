Quantitative assessment of soils hydraulic properties that are contaminated with oils is crucial for optimal soil
and water resources conservation. The objective of this study was to investigate Kerosene effect on soil
hydraulic properties. For this purpose, the soil retention curves and saturated hydraulic conductivity of Kerosene
and water were determined by hanging column and constant head method, respectively. The soil retention curve
parameters were obtained based on van Genuchten, Brooks-Corey and Campbell’s models. Unsaturated soil
hydraulic conductivity for both fluids were predicted based on Mualem- Brooks-Corey, Burdine- Brooks-Corey,
Mualem-van Genuchten and Campbell’s functions. The results indicated that Kerosene was retained less than
water owing to its negligible surface tension, yielding less needed tension to drain kerosrene out from soils.
Moreover, the magnitudes of the pore-size distribution parameters remained mostly unchanged and the bubbling
pressure parameters were increased in Kerosene-air system compares to water-air system. The Kerosene-water
matric potential ratio at the same soil fluid quantity was 0.48. The Leverett’s and suggested scale factors were
determined 0.39 and 0.49, respectively, which indicates the soil fluid retention curves were appropriately scaled
based on the recommended scale factor. Due to high kinematic viscosity of Kerosene and low soil retention for
Kerosene, the saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity of Kerosene was less than that of water.

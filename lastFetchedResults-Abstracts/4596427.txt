The objective of this paper is to show an effective critical axial magnetic field (AMF) as a function of contact diameter and arc extinguishing contact gap in vacuum interrupters (VIs), based on prevention of anode spots formation. Experiments were conducted in a demountable vacuum chamber, in which an external Helmholtz AMF coil was installed coaxially between a pair of butt-type contacts. The AMF flux density B<sub>AMF</sub> applied by the external coil was uniform and it can be adjusted from 0 to 110 mT. The experimental results showed that an effective critical AMF by arc current B<sub>AMF</sub><sup>eff</sup> (mT/kA) needed for prevention of anode spots formation followed a power function with contact diameter D as B<sub>AMF</sub><sup>eff</sup> = sD<sup>-&#945;</sup>, where s and &#945; were constant and D was in a range of 12~100 mm. And B<sub>AMF</sub><sup>eff</sup> (mT/kA) increased as a linear function with the arc extinguishing contact gap l, even though the increasing of B<sub>AMF</sub><sup>eff</sup> was so slow with l in a range of 12~24 mm. Last, a numerical calculation suggested that anode current density radial distribution contributed to the above findings.

This paper presents an algorithm for optimal placement and size of the Distributed energy resources (DERs) considering system loss minimization and voltage profile improvement as objective functions. DERs are the energy resources which contain renewable energy resources such as wind, solar and fuel cell and some artificial models like micro turbines, gas turbines, diesel engines, sterling engines, and internal combustion reciprocating engines. Combinations of DER studies and for every combination, indices, active and reactive losses and voltage profiles are studied. To optimize the objective function, new optimization technique called Bat algorithm(BA) is proposed. The Bat algorithm is tested on 37-bus distribution system with different load models like residential, Industrial, Commercial and Mixed loads. For all cases current injection based distribution load flow method is used.

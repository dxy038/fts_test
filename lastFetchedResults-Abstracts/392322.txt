Objective: The adhesion of neutrophils to the vascular endothelial cells appears to be important for the pathogenesis of vasculitis in Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). To determine the pathological significance of the neutrophil adhesion, we have examined and evaluated the relationships between the levels of adhesion molecules and proteinase-3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (PR3-ANCA), and between the levels of TNF-Î± and disease activities in WG.
Methods: sELAM-1 and sICAM-1 in sera from WG and healthy donors were detected by ELISA. SLex and LFA-1 on neutrophils were detected by flow cytometry.
Results: The level of sICAM-1 was significantly higher in active WG than in inactive WG, tending to reflect individual disease activities. There was no difference in the level of sELAM-1 between WG patients and healthy donors.
Conclusion: Our study suggests that the adhesion of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium is significant for the pathogenesis of the vasculitis in WG.

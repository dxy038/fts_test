Conventional design and analysis of gun system are based on three assumptions of plane, symmetry and static equilibrium, and the consistency between theoretic analysis and experimental results cannot satisfy us despite that varieties of correctional coefficients are introduced. Progressive sensitivity analysis method is presented, and the important degrees of factors with different dimensions are compared. Structural parameters that most affect firing stability are achieved according to sensitivity analysis, and they are optimized with the objective of firing stability by Design Sub-space method (DSM). Finally, a group of structure parameters which can optimize firing stability are obtained, the application perspective of virtual prototyping technology applied in military fields is presented.

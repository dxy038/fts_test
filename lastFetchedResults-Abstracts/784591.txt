Objective: To examine associations between dietary and supplemental folate, vitamin B-12 and
vitamin B-6 and incident Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) among elderly men and women. Design, Setting and
Participants: Data collected were from participants of the Cache County Memory, Health and Aging Study, a
longitudinal study of 5092 men and women 65 years and older who were residents of Cache County, Utah in
1995. Measurements: Multistage clinical assessment procedures were used to identify incident cases of AD.
Dietary data were collected using a 142-item food frequency questionnaire. Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH)
modeling was used to determine hazard ratios across quintiles of micronutrient intake. Results: 202 participants
were diagnosed with incident AD during follow-up (1995-2004). In multivariable CPH models that controlled
for the effects of gender, age, education, and other covariates there were no observed differences in risk of AD or
dementia by increasing quintiles of total intake of folate, vitamin B-12, or vitamin B-6. Similarly, there were no
observed differences in risk of AD by regular use of either folate or B6 supplements. Conclusion: Dietary intake
of B-vitamins from food and supplemental sources appears unrelated to incidence of dementia and AD. Further
studies examining associations between dietary intakes of B-vitamins, biomarkers of B-vitamin status and
cognitive endpoints are warranted

 Context Diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disease
                            worldwide and its prevalence is increasing. The development of drugs
                            with fewer side-effects is required when treating this disease. Thus,
                            the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of traditional
                            medicine and medicinal plants in this regard. The various mechanisms by
                            which isolated extracts and herbal compounds exert their effects on
                            different diabetes mellitus factors was investigated. Evidence
                            Acquisition Databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science
                            (from 1990 until the present) were searched, using a detailed list of
                            terms related to the effects and mechanism of herbal ingredients on
                            diabetes mellitus complications. Results The presence of secondary
                            metabolites, such as phenols, flavonoids and alkaloids in plants, have
                            been used as a source of medication for the treatment of many diseases,
                            including diabetes mellitus. Following an extensive review of the
                            literature, it was found that the secondary metabolites of plants have a
                            wide range of anti-diabetic effects. Conclusions Plant compounds should
                            be isolated and their effects on diabetes mellitus and its complications
                            examined in order to treatment for diabetes mellitus.

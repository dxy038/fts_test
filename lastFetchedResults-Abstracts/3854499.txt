This paper is based on modifications implemented in the protection and grounding systems of a large paper mill and describes selective ground fault protection for a 13.8-kV system with multiple bus-connected generators, synchronous bus ties, and utility interconnections. The ground fault current in the system is reduced from the existing 3400 A to 500 A, and a hybrid grounding system is implemented for each of the generators. As the ground fault currents are reduced to limit the fault damage, the sensitivity and selectivity of the ground fault protection become important. Directional ground fault relays with coordinating pickup settings are applied to achieve this objective. The new platform for directional elements (numerical relays) drives its performance from sequence impedance measurements

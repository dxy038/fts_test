In this paper we propose a high performance fuzzy adaptive Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism based on Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm. The proposed mechanism is called FARED (Fuzzy Adaptive RED). The main objective of the FARED is to control the average queue size (avg) near a target point. By using a single-input-single-output fuzzy logic controller, when the avg is less than the target, the max    parameter
of RED is decreased which decreases the drop rate. On the other hand, when avg is greater than the target point, the max    (the upper bound on the marking probability) is increased which
increases the drop rate. To evaluate the performance of the FARED, by using the computer simulation, several trials were performed. All simulation results show that the FARED has better performance than traditional RED and Adaptive RED (ARED) mechanisms.

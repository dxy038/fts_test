Background:  Patch testing is the confirmatory procedure for allergic contact dermatitis. The test requires the application of chemicals under occlusion for approximately 48 hours to maximize penetration, although it can also produce irritation. Photomechanical waves (PW) have been shown to render the stratum corneum transiently permeable and facilitate the delivery of macromolecules into the epidermis. This alternative might reduce prolonged occlusion of the skin to minimize irritancy, while retaining the sensitivity of the test. Objective: PW was used to facilitate the delivery of an allergen into the skin in vivo. Methods:  The allergic skin reaction using PW delivery was compared with 5-minute and 21-hour occlusion in a sensitized hairless albino guinea pig model. The pigs were sensitized by intradermal injection of (0.01%) dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and topical administration (0.1%, 1 week later) of the hapten. One month later, testing for the allergic response was performed by the administration with PW of 10 [mu ]L of 0.1% DNCB. Results:  Our results show that there was an allergic reaction for the 24 hour occlusion or PW delivery of the antigen. In contrast, no response was observed for the 5-minute occlusion with the antigen. Conclusion: The rapid delivery of antigens with PW can improve the test for the diagnosis of contact dermatitis.

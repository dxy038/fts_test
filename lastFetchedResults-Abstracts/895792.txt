Background: Behavioral adaptation is one of the most important indicators of treatment in children with attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in long-term. Absence of therapeutic intervention including drug and non-drug therapy leads to negative consequences in adolescence and adulthood. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of Barkley’s behavioral parent training in reducing symptoms of children with ADHD. 
Methods: This interventional study was conducted on 60 parents of 4-12 years old children with ADHD who were under drug therapy during 2011. The Measurement tools were the Conners parent questionnaire and the demographic questionnaire. Data were analyzed using factor analysis of variance with repeated measures in both intervention and control groups. 
Findings: Barkley’s behavioral parent training had significant effects on reducing symptoms in children and symptoms were significantly reduced in the intervention group compared to the control group. Repeated measures confirmed the sustainability of parental training effect on reducing symptoms. 
Conclusion: Behavioral parent training can be effective as an adjunctive method along with drug therapy in reducing symptoms of children with ADHD.

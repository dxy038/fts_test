Micromanipulators and micropositioners are becoming more and more popular in micro-machining, optics, and biomedical industry. They are used to manipulate movements of minute objects under the microscope. The objective of this paper is to explore and define possible applications of flexure joints. An investigation of some existing 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) flexure joint configurations. In literature is presented. Finally, a design of novel 2-DOF design will be presented with some discussions about the description of a possible 3-DOF manipulator. It is shown how these initial investigations can lead to the design and development of 6-DOF micro-manipulator system

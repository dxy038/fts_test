Limited numbers of microsatellite markers are available for genetic characterization of Hordeum bulbosum which comprises the secondary genepool of cultivated barely. The objective of this study was to evaluate the transferability of microsatellite markers from H. vulgare to H. bulbosum and a preliminary evaluation of their polymorphism. From ninety-three pairs barley SSR primer tested for transferability, all of them  amplified DNA segments in H. vulgare (11 accessions) and 48 pairs (51.61%) were transferable to the H. bulbosum (5 accessions) with high level of polymorphism. Twenty-two (23.65%) SSR markers showed transferability to H. murinum used as outgroup. A total of 546 alleles were detected by 48 transferred primer pairs in all accessions. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 13 with an average of 11.375 alleles per locus. The PIC values were ranged from 0.161 to 0.621 with an average of 0.477. The value of PIC in H. vulgare (average PIC = 0.639) was significantly higher than H. bulbosum (average PIC = 0.316). In dendrogram generated based on SSR data accessions were divided into groups related to their taxonomic classifications, indicating the efficiency of barley SSRs for phylogenetic analyses in H genome containing species in the genus Hordeum. Based on the results of this study, it can be suggested that the cross species transferable barley SSRs are valuable molecular tools, for genetic diversity analyses in the H. bulbosum for which limited number of microsatellite markers are available. This study provided a set of efficient SSR markers from publicly available barley microsatellite markers for the genetic characterization of H. bulbosum.

Objective
Assess whether women note a change in aspects of arousal because of removal of the uterus and cervix.
Study design
Between 1990 and 1992, 105 women were asked to report on their sexual function before and at 3, 8, and 18 months after undergoing a total hysterectomy. Results were analyzed by Ï‡2.
Results
Hysterectomies were abdominal or vaginal, and 42% of subjects had ovaries removed and initiated estrogen replacement. Ease of arousal diminished in 24% and improved in 11%. Intensity of orgasms decreased in 15% and increased in 14%. Effects of nipple stimulation were usually preserved. Sexual satisfaction increased significantly. Seven women noted distinctly worse sexual function.
Conclusion
An indicated total hysterectomy will likely increase sexual satisfaction and not change the effect of breast stimulation. The few women with disturbingly reduced sexual sensation deserve assessment and treatment.

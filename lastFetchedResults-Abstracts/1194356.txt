The thermal performance of the building envelope is a major requirement for guaranteeing a comfortable and hygienic interior climate. The roof is a part of the building envelope which provides protection from thermal damage incurred by the sun. To improve this protection ability, the use of a ventilated roof can be considered, which has a ventilation layer known as a cavity, beneath the roof cover panel.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of such factors as cavity ventilation, the slope of the roof, intensity of solar radiation, the size and shape of the cavity, and panel profiles, by investigating airflow and temperature distribution in the cavity, in an effort to improve the cooling effect of ventilation in the cavity of the roof. In this study, the influence of these elements on airflow is studied. The evaluations are carried out by way of experiments.

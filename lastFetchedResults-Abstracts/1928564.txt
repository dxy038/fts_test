The objective of this experiment was to evaluate various programmes for synchronization of oestrus. The focus of the study was to evaluate rates of detection of oestrus, synchrony of oestrus, pregnancy rate, and effect of ovarian status at initiation of the programmes on rates of detection of oestrus and pregnancy rate. Spring-calving, lactating dairy cows (n=2009) were allocated at random to one of six treatments: (1) A (n=335), progestogen (controlled intravaginal drug release; CIDR) inserted per vaginum 10 d before breeding season for 8 d, 10 μg of buserelin at CIDR insertion, PGF2α treatment on the day prior to CIDR removal, and AI of cows detected in oestrus within 6 d after CIDR withdrawal; (2) B (n=330), as in A, plus 1 mg of oestradiol benzoate i.m.10 h post CIDR withdrawal; (3) C (n=347), as in A, except buserelin was replaced by 10 mg of oestradiol benzoate; (4) D (n=335), as in A, plus PGF2α and oestradiol benzoate at CIDR insertion; (5) E (n=332), CIDR containing a 10 mg oestradiol benzoate capsule inserted per vaginum for 12 d; or (6) F (n=330), as in E, plus PGF2α on the day prior to CIDR withdrawal. The oestrous detection rate (number of cows detected in oestrus within 6 days of CIDR withdrawal as a proportion of the number of cows submitted for synchronization of oestrus) and oestrous synchrony (oestrous detection rate within 2 d of CIDR withdrawal), respectively, were greater (P &lt;0.05) following B (95.7% of 330, 98.7% of 316) compared with any of the other programmes for synchronization of oestrus (A: 87.5 of 335, 79.4% of 293; C: 86.7% of 347, 80.0% of 301; D: 90.1% of 335, 89.8% of 302; E: 74.4% of 332, 70.4% of 247; F: 76.4% of 330, 78.5% of 252). The oestrous detection rate was reduced (P&lt;0.05) among cows in metoestrus administered E (64.0% of 50) relative to similar cows administered F (82.8% of 64). Pregnancy rate was greater (P&lt;0.05) following B (57.9% of 330) than A (48.9% of 335, P=0.06), C (43.2% of 347), E (40.0% of 332), and F (35.1% of 330) but not D (59.3% of 302), when based on those cows presented for oestrous synchronization programmes. In conclusion, 1 mg of oestradiol benzoate administered 10 h post CIDR withdrawal (B) resulted in the best overall oestrous detection, oestrous synchrony, and pregnancy rates, which would be beneficial to a fixed-time AI program.

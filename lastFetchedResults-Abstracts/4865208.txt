As a kind of particular uncertain programming problem, stochastic transportation problem has wide application value in many fields, such as production planning, resource allocation, etc. In this paper, combining with the characteristic of stochastic transportation problem, take mathematical expectation and variance as the compound quantitative value of objective, moreover, take objective value and the synthesizing satisfying of constraints as the compound quantitative value of stochastic transportation problem, propose the objective evaluation strategy and decision synthesizing strategy, then the stochastic transportation programming model based on effect is established (denoted by BESTPM) and specific building steps are given. Finally, its performance is further discussed through a stochastic transportation example. All these indicate that BESTPM not only has good structure characteristics, but also effectively merges decision consciousness into solution.

Many control problems involve simultaneous optimization of multiple variables that competing with each other (such as Integral of Absolute Error (IAE), Overshoot, Undershoot, Response time, and etc). On the other hand, the control system performs poor in characteristics and even it becomes unstable, if improper values of the controller tuning constants are used. So it becomes necessary to tune the controller parameters to achieve good control performance with the proper choice of tuning constants. An optimal control of Amine Plant is studied in this paper utilizing the multiobjective genetic algorithm concept in conjunction of Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) controller. This paper presents the tuning of PID controllers by minimizing two objective functions (Overshoot and IAE) through the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Numerical results show that NSGA-II based tuning method has excellent ability in optimal control of Amine Plant.

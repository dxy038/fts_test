This paper presents an algorithm for successful conflict resolution amongst autonomous cars using Game theory, and implementing the same with Cellular Automata on MATLAB. Our objective is to come up with an optimum solution, so that the cars involved reach their destination, avoiding collisions, in the least amount of time. The knowledge gained will be extended to a more real word scenario, where there are multiple cars in a particular environment.

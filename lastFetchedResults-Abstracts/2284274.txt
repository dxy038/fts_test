In a response-adaptive design, we review and update the trial on the basis of outcomes in order to achieve a specific goal. Response-adaptive designs for clinical trials are usually constructed to achieve a single objective. In this paper, we develop a new adaptive allocation rule to improve current strategies for building response-adaptive designs to construct multiple-objective repeated measurement designs. This new rule is designed to increase estimation precision and treatment benefit by assigning more patients to a better treatment sequence. We demonstrate that designs constructed under the new proposed allocation rule can be nearly as efficient as fixed optimal designs in terms of the mean squared error, while leading to improved patient care.

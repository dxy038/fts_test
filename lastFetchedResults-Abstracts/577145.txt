Many of unique phenomenons in atmosphere and ocean are deduced by air-sea interaction that one of these is gravity or density current in special semi-enclosed marine environments such as Persian gulf. This current as a component of sea waters circulation has effective role on some of the marine activities such as military, communications, fishing, â€¦ and sea waters exchange and pollutions transport. The objective of this study is physical survey of effective meteorological elements such as evaporation, temperature, wind and precipitation and effective non-meteorological elements such as tide and rivers run-off on the outflow gravity currents from Persian gulf and also estimation of these effective amount. This study shows that by assumption of non-transport of mass in Persian gulf, annual evaporation from Persian gulf is caused annually increase of water salinity about 2.20(psu) and amplification of gravity current and annual precipitation in Persian gulf is caused annually decrease of water salinity about 0.07(psu) and attenuation of outflow gravity current from Persian gulf. Also tide, temperature, wind and pollutant matters have in order attenuation effect, two opposed and seasonal effects, two opposed effects and two opposed effects depending on their specific weight on outflow gravity current from Persian Gulf. In addition, an mathematical relation between change of temperature and salinity quantity for determining   occurrence probability of gravity current appearance in marine environments is obtained.

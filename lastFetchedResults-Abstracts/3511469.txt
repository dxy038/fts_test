Strategic switching can be achieved by a current injection scheme which simulates the change in topology. The injected currents are applied to the terminals of the elements of a socalled base network corresponding to those actually switched. This requires that the base network must contain all elements in the "in" state. The injected currents to be used as a compensation in the commonly employed system matrices (Y, Z) for the real change in topology can be taken as control variables in an optimization procedure for the switching problem. With the aid of a method similar to linear programming (LP) objective functions such as line current, short circuit current or even losses can be formulated. By means of a switching sequence consisting of elementary switching operations the desired objective function will be brought to its optimum value.

A CMOS metal-electrode-based micro system for bidirectional communication (stimulation and recording) with neuronal cells in vitro is presented. The chip overcomes the interconnect challenge that limits todayÂ´s bidirectional microelectrode arrays. The microsystem has been fabricated in an industrial CMOS technology with several post-CMOS processing steps to realize 128 biocompatible electrodes and to ensure chip stability in physiological saline. The system comprises all necessary control circuitry and on-chip A/D and D/A conversion. A modular design has been implemented, where individual stimulation- and signal-conditioning circuitry units are associated with each electrode. Stimulation signals with a resolution of 8 bits can be sent to any subset of electrodes at a rate of 60 kHz, while all electrodes of the chip are continuously sampled at a rate of 20 kHz. The circuitry at each electrode can be individually reset to its operating point in order to suppress artifacts evoked by the stimulation pulses. Biological measurements from cultured neuronal networks originating from dissociated cortical tissue of fertilized chicken eggs with amplitudes of up to 500 muV<sub>pp</sub> are presented

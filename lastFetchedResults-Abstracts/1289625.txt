Background and objective: Safety in the oil refining
companies is considered as an important issue. These
companies consider improving the safety culture as their
main priorities. This study aimed to assess the safety culture
of an oil refinery with the use of Geller model.
Methods: According to Geller model, which is composed
of three main dimensions, questionnaire and the Checklists
were prepared. After a pilot study and descriptive study and
estimating the reliability of checklists and questionnaires,
190 personnel were selected for sample group. There was
a performance assessment of the staff’s performance along
with the questionnaires filled by staffs. The environmental
assessment was completed by checklists. Data from
questionnaire and the checklists were transferred to the
database. Statistical analysis was performed by using
SPSS15 through Chi Square and Pearson Tests.
Results: The mean age was 35.46 years with SD=10.68.
Most of the personnel under study were married (70.50%);
most of them had diploma (62.1%). Based on the view of
the staff, 29.5% of them in their work life had a job-related
accident. They also had a medium attitude and relatively
good performance. Using Pearson test, There was a
significant relationship between employees’ perception and
their performance (p= 0.009).
Conclusion: Although there was a significant relationship
between staff perception and performance with kind of
employment, work unit, work type, & education, which in
most cases due to obeying standard safety rules, had good
performance, staff had a weak attitude in relation to applying
safety rules. It seems that we need to work on this issue so
that safety and applying safety rules become a value at work.

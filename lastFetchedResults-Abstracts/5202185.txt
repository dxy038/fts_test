Accurate positioning for land vehicles is required to meet the requirements of new safety systems. Though dual frequency RTK has sufficient accuracy for these needs, the cost makes it difficult for this to become common in consumer vehicles. The objective of this study is to realize commercially feasible RTK using practical single frequency receivers with the support of vehicle embedded gyros and odometers. The information of vehicle trajectory limits the ambiguity search space and improves the performance of single frequency RTK. A driving experiment showed that this approach has advantages both in a suburban area and urban canyon, compared to the traditional RTK.

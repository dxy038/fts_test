The authors present a testing methodology framework which attempts to provide guidance in testing technique selection and application. The framework defines several testing levels with complementary technique groups defined for each level. Each testing technique group is a collection of testing techniques with a common objective and emphasis. In addition, several categories of testing metrics are defined which can be utilized to increase testing effectiveness. The proposed testing methodology framework was initially developed to satisfy the diverse project needs of one organization. The methodology framework, however, is expandable and can be customized to meet the needs of other organizations and updated to reflect technology improvements in the testing area

A new single phase high performance input side switched AC-DC Cuk converter is proposed. A bidirectional switch is formed by a unidirectional semiconductor switch with proper positioning of the bridgeless diodes at the input ac side for power conversion for both positive and negative half cycle. Because of the high frequency input side switching, the power factor of the circuit is inherently corrected and it requires a small filter to make the input current near sinusoidal with limited THD. The significant improvement in THD makes the circuit a good choice in applications needing AC-DC conversion with power conditioning. The circuit exhibits such performances with variable loads at constant frequency switching with no additional control circuits. The efficiency of the circuit is also satisfactory. Analysis and simulation results of the circuit are obtained by using software simulation. The main advantage of this new AC-DC converter is its superior power quality.

This paper proposes a novel method for quantifying the protection impacts of distributed generation. A multi objective function has also presented for DG allocation. This function minimizes the protection impacts while maximizing the voltage profile improvement and loss reduction. Genetic algorithm has been implemented for this optimization and the proposed method has been run for a real network, using DIgSILENT Power Language (DPL).

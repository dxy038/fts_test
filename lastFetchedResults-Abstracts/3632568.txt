In this letter, a novel algorithm for removing salt-and-pepper noise from corrupted images is presented. We employ an efficient impulse noise detector to detect the noisy pixels, and an edge-preserving filter to reconstruct the intensity values of noisy pixels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can obtain better performances in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations than those state-of-the-art impulse denoising techniques. Especially, the proposed method can preserve edges very well while removing impulse noise. Since our algorithm is algorithmically simple, it is very suitable to be applied to many real-time applications.

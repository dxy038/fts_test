The physical parameters of cellulose such as surface area and porosity are important in the development of cellulose composites which may contain valuable additives which bind to cellulose. In this area, the use of acid hydrolyzed nano-dimensional cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) has attracted significant interest, yet the surface area and porosity of these materials have not been explored experimentally. The objective of this work was to characterize the surface area and porosity of CNWs from different origins (plant cotton/bacterium Gluconacetobacter xylinus) and different acid treatments (H2SO4/HCl) by N2 adsorption; as well as to compare surface area and porosity of bacterial cellulose synthesized by static and agitated cultures. Our results showed that CNWs produced from H2SO4/HCl exhibited significantly increased surface area and porosity relative to starting material cotton fiber CF11. Micropores were generated in HCl hydrolyzed CNWs but not in H2SO4 hydrolyzed CNWs. Bacterial CNWs exhibited larger surface area and porosity compared to plant CNWs. Cellulose synthesized by G. xylinus ATCC 700178 from agitated cultures also exhibited less surface area and porosity than those from static cultures.

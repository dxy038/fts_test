Polrood reservoir dam is located at southeast of the Roodsar city in the Gilan Province. The objective of this article is to identify and evaluate the environmental risks of the Polrood dam in construction phase. For this purpose, the risk factors were first identified by experts’ judgments using the Delphi questionnaire. Then, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used for weighting and classification of the Polrood dam risk factors.
In this process, after building the hierarchical structure, the pair-wise comparison matrices for the risks criteria were created according to the risks intensity and probability. In order to determine the weight of each criterion, the values obtained were entered into the Expert Choice software. Based on the results of this software, “Physicochemical risks”, “Biological risks”, “Economic-Social-Cultural risks” and “Health and Safety risks” were ranked weighting 0.123, 0.080, 0.048 and 0.021 respectively. Among the Physicochemical risks, “Erosion”, “Sedimentation” and “Pollutions” were identified as the most important risks, weighting 0.061, 0.047 and 0.018 respectively. For the biological risks, the negative impacts were most on the “Flora”, and then on the “Habitats” and “Fauna”, weighting 0.189, 0.139 and 0.017 respectively. The most important risks among the Economic-Social-Cultural risks were “Displacement and resettlement”, “Negative impacts on buildings, facilities and residential areas” and “Land use change”, weighting 0.114, 0.049 and 0.033 respectively. “Workers downfall”, “Road accidents” and “Sudden explosions”, weighting 0.109, 0.046 and 0.044 were also considered as the most important “Health and Safety risks”. Finally, some useful solutions and management programs proposed to reduce, eliminate, control, and transferring the main risk factors.

Objective: The need to reduce costs while providing a first class service has led to the expansion in the role of nurses in otolaryngology practice in the National Health Service (NHS) in recent years. The aim of this study was to compare patient satisfaction with conventional and nurse led follow-up after grommet insertion. The hypothesis was that patient satisfaction is much greater with doctor led conventional follow-up as compared with nurse led out-patient follow-up. Methods: The study was performed using a questionnaire survey using a validated patient satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Our results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in the mean factorial scores for interpersonal skills and technical competence, physical surroundings, and convenience between the conventional and nurse led follow-up clinic. The overall patient satisfaction was higher with nurse led grommet follow-up clinic than with conventional doctor led out-patient follow-up. This was statistically significant (Mann–Whitney U=1357.50, Z=−2.39, P=0.01). The waiting time in out-patients was also significantly less in the nurse led grommet clinic. Conclusions: We conclude that nurses provide a high quality service resulting in high patient satisfaction. Nurse led grommet follow-up clinic has the potential for substantial reduction in outpatient access times in the NHS.

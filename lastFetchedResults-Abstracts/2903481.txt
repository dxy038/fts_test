Heat exchanger network synthesis with uncertain source-stream temperatures has been formulated as a fuzzy multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (F-MO-MINLP) to handle the multiple objectives of minimum utility consumption, minimum total area, and even minimum number of matches. Inlet Temperatures are proposed as fuzzy variables. The linear (Triangular) membership function has been employed to describe this variation of Inlet Temperatures at different &#945;-cut values. The effect of variation of the &#945;-cut values on the various objectives has been investigated. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been utilized to obtain the weights of objectives. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the various aspects dealt in the work.

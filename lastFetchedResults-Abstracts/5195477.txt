We investigate a non quadratic regularizer that is based on the Hessian operator for dealing with the restoration of 3-D images in a variational framework. We show that the regularizer under study is a valid extension of the total-variation (TV) functional, in the sense that it retains its favorable properties while following a similar underlying principle. We argue that the new functional is well suited for the restoration of 3-D biological images since it does not suffer from the well-known staircase effect of TV. Furthermore, we present an efficient 3-D algorithm for the minimization of the corresponding objective function. Finally, we validate the overall proposed regularization framework through image deblurring experiments on simulated and real biological data.

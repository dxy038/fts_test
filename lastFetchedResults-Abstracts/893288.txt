Psychological stressors like examinations lead to stimulation of autonomic nervous system resulting in effects in heart, blood pressure, respiratory rate etc. Cold pressor test (CPT) is a validated test for sympathetic activity. The objective of the study was to study the sympathetic activity using CPT, 5 months prior and 1 month prior to send- up examination in first professional MBBS students. 90 first professional MBBS students (55 females, 35 males) in the age group of 18-22 years were subjected to CPT at two instances, 5 months before and 1 month before their send-up examinations. The collected data was statistically analysed. In male as well as female students, resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not show significant change both 5 months and 1 months prior to examinations. The value of both SBP and DBP after CPT in males showed a highly significant increase but while comparing the two time periods, the increase was not significant. The value of SBP and DBP in females increased significantly after CPT in both instances and while comparing the values, i.e, 5 months prior and 1 month prior to examinations, the increase was highly significant. There does occur increase in sympathetic activity in students who were to appear in their send up examination consequent to the psychological stress faced by them. This change was more evident in female subjects as compared to male subjects. This test can also be used as a screening test for hypertension amongst the subjects.

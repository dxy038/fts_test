Currently, system engineering problems are solved using a wide range of domain-specific models and corresponding languages. It is unlikely that a single unified modeling language will be able to model in sufficient detail the large number of system aspects addressed by these domain-specific languages. Instead, a model integration framework is needed for managing the various modeling languages used to solve systems engineering problems. The Systems Modeling Language (OMG SysML<sup>TM</sup>) can provide an answer to this need for model integration. Using SysML, a modeler can abstract a domain-specific language to a level that permits its interaction with other system models. In addition, graph transformation approach can be use to accomplishing automated, bidirectional transformation between SysML and the domain specific language. In this paper, a generic approach for defining such graph transformations is presented.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous splenic rupture is rare in pregnancy and puerperium, and if the diagnosis and treatment are delayed, maternal mortality and morbidity rates remain extremely high. In this article a case of a spontaneous splenic rupture following cesarean section is reported
CASE: A 24-year-old healthy woman had elective cesarean because of twin pregnancy at 38 weeks of pregnancy. She was reexplored for hemorrhagic shock on her first postpartum day. Urgent laparotomy revealed hemoperitoneum due to splenic vein rupture. Uterus and adnexa were normal and splenectomy was performed. The patient was not traumatized during surgery or postoperatively and microscopic examination of spleen was normal. 
CONCLUSION: However spontaneous splenic rupture is a rare event, it should be suspected in any women with unexplained abdominal pain or with signs of internal bleeding during pregnancy or early postpartum.

The steering feel study is very important in the development of electric power steering system (EPS). This paper describes a method about how to evaluate and get the suitable steering feel when driving a vehicle equipped with EPS. The EPS steering feel subjective tests were performed to obtain objective quality parameters that correlate with subjective evaluation. After this, the paper briefly describes the statistical technique used to identify which parameters best correlate with vehicle steering qualities. As there was no correlation between a single partial rating and a single objective indicator, the principal component analysis (PCA) method was chosen and obtained objective indices. The objective evaluation parameters have been validated by driverspsila subjective evaluation. In the third part, the analytical method was applied to vehicle dynamic analysis to analyze vehicle steering feel characteristics, we established a closed-loop steering feel simulation model to analyze steering torque characteristics, vehicle dynamic response and assess steering feel performance for different settings of a EPS system. The design of EPS was optimized and achieved more suitable driving feel by using the dynamic analysis model without plenty of real vehicle tests. This method make it possible to easily and accurately benchmark steering dynamic characteristics, set design targets, and is helpful to achieve good steering feel.

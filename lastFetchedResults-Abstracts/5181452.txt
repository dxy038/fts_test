In this work we propose a WDM PON migration from FTTB to FTTH access by employing bidirectional amplification by a linearized semiconductor optical amplifier. We demonstrate that a semiconductor optical amplifier placed at the entry of a group of ONUs sharing the same wavelength can boost the loss budget allowing to compensate for the losses of a passive splitter up to 1:16 division rate, allowing to upgrade existing WDM PONs FTTB structures to permit the fiber to reach the final userÂ´s home.

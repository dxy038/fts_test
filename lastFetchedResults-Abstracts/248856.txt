A new approach to process optimal design in non-isothermal, steady-state metal forming is presented. In
this approach, the optimal design problem is formulated on the basis of the integrated thermo-mechanical
 nite element process model so as to cover a wide class of the objective functions and to accept diverse
process parameters as design variables, and a derivative-based approach is adopted as a solution technique.
The process model, the formulation for process optimal design, and the schemes for the evaluation of the
design sensitivity, and an iterative procedure for design optimization are described in detail. The validity of
the schemes for the evaluation of the design sensitivity is examined by performing a series of numerical
tests. The capability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through applications to some selected process
design problems

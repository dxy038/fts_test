We present a realization and the modeling of a 27-GHz integrated extended cavity ring laser that is passively mode-locked. The mode-locked ring laser is fabricated with active-passive integration. Experimental results show that internal reflections are the major factor affecting operation stability. Continuous-wave, self-pulsating, and in small windows of operation mode-locked regimes have been observed. Similar regimes have been observed in our bidirectional laser model. This model describes the semiconductor amplifier and the saturable absorber using rate equations. Our experimental and theoretical results are compared and discussed.

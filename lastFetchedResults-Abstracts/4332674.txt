In this paper, we propose an adaptive control law that achieves prescribed performance indices regarding the transient and steady state response of the robot force/position tracking errors and ensures no loss of contact of the robot end effector. A compliant contact with a planar surface is assumed and the control objective is satisfied under parametric uncertainties in the robot dynamics and the force deformation model. Simulation results confirm the theoretical findings and compare the proposed controller with a conventional one.

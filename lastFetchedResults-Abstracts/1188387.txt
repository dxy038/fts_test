Scrap car tyre particles can be used as filler or toughening agent in rigid epoxy matrices if the resultant interface is adequate. The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of use of different silane coupling agents (SCAs) to improve the interface between the epoxy resin and recycled rubber particles. For this purpose, seven different SCA were used to modify surfaces of the rubber particles. After the preparation of epoxyâ€“rubber specimens, tensile Charpy impact and plane-strain fracture toughness tests were conducted. Mechanical tests and fractographic studies revealed that some of the SCA can improve of the interface between the epoxy matrix and the rubber particles leading to increases in strength while slight decreases in toughness of the samples.

This paper presents a preliminary study that relates the ability in performing remote control tasks with 3D video feedback and the usersÂ´ quality of experience (QoE) when users are asked to judge the video quality only. The QoE has been evaluated by means of traditional subjective quality experiments, while an objective performance indicator (alignment error) has been used in the remote control task. Results show that, unexpectedly, even a relatively poor subjective video quality still provides sufficient 3D perception to achieve satisfactory alignment performance.

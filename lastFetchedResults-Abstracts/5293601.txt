Flex Ray is a new communication protocol standard for future automotive applications that provides time determinism, flexibility and fault-tolerance. It consists of a time-triggered Static Segment and an event-triggered Dynamic Segment in a single communication cycle. The scheduling of tasks in the ECU and messages in the Flex Ray bus can affect each other. Design of the task/message scheduling is critical for design optimization of Based-based distributed systems. This paper focuses on the Static Segment. We use Constraint Programming (CP) for optimization of the objective of minimizing the used static slots through task/message scheduling. We present a case study with realistic size for automotive control applications and experiment results show that the proposed CP-based model for the static segments can achieve good performance.

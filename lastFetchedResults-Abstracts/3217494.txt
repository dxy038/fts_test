Existing robot faces have used as one-way emotional expression and communication device based on actuator control mostly. This paper is about robot face development as a bidirectional interaction interface, not one-way output or expression device, and the application. We added infrared-based touch input system to the uni-directional output device, and then implemented the robot face to be an independent bi-directional interaction interface itself. In addition, we focused on the `touching the faceÂ´ behavior, so let the physical interaction be possible between human and robot through the developed graphic model and interaction scenarios. Lastly, we suggested several extendible touch interaction applications using this system.

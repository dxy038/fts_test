In the present study, the role of chastity and hijab in the promotion of the dignity of women from the perspective of the supreme leader, has been studied. The study is theoretical and has been conducted based on the analysis of documents. The results indicate that based on the views of the Supreme Leader, justice, freedom, security, protection of human values and spiritual presence of women in society, are the most important indicators of the dignity of women. This is an objective that will be realized only in the shadow of chastity and Magnanimity. Evidence suggests that there are challenges and issues in this field that our society is facing. With respect to views emphasized by the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, it is necessary to promote and explain the mission and strategies in this regard.

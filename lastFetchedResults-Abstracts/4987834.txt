The objective of this work has been to propose a self-powered gate driver system for medium voltage solid state starters. This paper presents some experience with SCRs using the self-powered gate driver system (SPGDS), designed and used for starting and stopping large induction motors. The proposed system derives power for gating the SCR from energy stored in the snubber capacitors at turn on and the voltage across the SCR at turn off. This solution eliminates the need for an isolated power supply board or auxiliary power supply, with substantial savings in cost and space in MV applications

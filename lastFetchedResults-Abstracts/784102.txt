Objective This study aimed to examine sex differences in
young peopleâ€™s beliefs about the causes and characteristics
of, as well as treatment for, bulimia nervosa.
Method Participants (100 male, 102 female) completed a
four part questionnaire adapted from other studies.
Results There were sex differences on about a third of the
attitude statements particularly about the cure for bulimia
nervosa. A factor analysis of each section revealed six to
seven interpretable factors per issue. An analysis of the
factor scores showed few significant sex differences but
most for the characteristics displayed by bulimics. Factors
from the different sections of the questionnaire were logically
related.
Discussion There were some sex differences on beliefs
about key cognitive and physical characteristics of the
disorder as well as the importance of specialist interventions
for the disorder. Females more than males endorsed
the importance of specialist professional help over selfhelp
interventions. Overall this sample seemed well
informed about bulimia nervosa.

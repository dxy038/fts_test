Background and Objectives: The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are common goals that were established by the United Nations in 2000. The aim of this study was to compare some of these indicators in Iran, the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), and the world.

Methods: The existing data from the World Health Status in 2014 and some other available sources in Iran, EMR, and across the world were addressed. The most relevant health indicators included decreased childhood mortality, maternal well-being, prevention of AIDS, tuberculosis and other diseases, and environment quality assurance.

Results: The proportion of neonatal mortality to total mortality among those less than 5 years increased from 37 to 44 in the world compared to 39 to 46 in EMRO and 46 to 61 in Iran. About 14.5% (71000 out of 490000) of the AIDS/HIV cases reported in the EMRO belonged to Iran in 2002. The maternal mortality rate (MMR) showed a decline of 72.2%, 50% and 44% in Iran, EMRO and the World respectively. The proportion of delivery by skilled persons and the proportion of pre-delivery care had a positive trend in Iran and were higher as compared to EMRO and the world average.

Conclusion: Iran achieved many MDGs, however, despite a decline in the AIDS/HIV incidence rate, its prevalence rate has increased in Iran, EMRO and the world from 2001 to 2013. The proportion of neonatal mortality rate to under 5-year mortality rate has had an increasing trend. Decision-makers should give priority to indicators that have not achieved MDGs.

In this talk we review the work in the field of chaos applications, especially in the formulation of solutions for practical engineering problems. Using a few case studies we illustrate the various common pitfalls in the reporting of chaos applications in engineering. Our objective is to promote the prudent use of engineering judgments and proper exercise of scientific principles when applying the theory of chaos in analyzing and solving engineering problems.

Advances in robotics have been applied to automation in industrial manufacturing, with the primary purpose of optimizing practical systems in terms of such objective measures as accuracy, speed, and cost. The paper introduces research on a mental commit robot that seeks a different direction that is not so rigidly dependent on such objective measures. The main goal of this research is to explore a new area in robotics, with an emphasis on human-robot interaction. The paper investigates influence of a priori knowledge on subjective interpretation and evaluation of a mental commit robot. We developed a seal robot that has the appearance of a baby of a harp seal. Most people did not know a harp seal exactly nor have experience of interaction with it. Then, subjects evaluated the seal robot while interacting with it

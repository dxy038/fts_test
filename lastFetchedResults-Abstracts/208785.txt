Background: The genus Salvia L. (Lamiaceae) consists of 58 annual and perennial species
in Iran, of which 17 are endemic. S. hydrangea DC. ex Benth. with common Persian name of
"Gol-e Arooneh" has been used in folk medicine of Iran as antiinflammatory, antispasmodic,
carminative and sedative. Infusion of flowers was used for treating cold in traditional
medicine of Fars province.
Objective: Study of chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oils of
S. hydrangea from two different localities of Iran.
Methods: Aerial parts of S. hydrangea were collected in full flowering stage from two
different localities; Abadeh (Fars province) and Takab (Azarbaijan province). The oils were
obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger type apparatus and analyzed by GC and GCMS
instruments. Antibacterial activities of the oils were evaluated by disc diffusion method.
MIC values were measured by microdilution broth susceptibility assay.
Results: The essential oils yield of Abadeh and Takab were 0.1 and 0.13% (w/w) based on
dry weight of plants, respectively. Thirty-seven and 35 compounds were identified in the oil
samples which constituted 97.4 and 98.3 % of the total oils, respectively. In the oil obtained
from Abadeh, β-caryophyllene (25.2%), 1,8-cineole (15.2%) and caryophyllene oxide (11.1%)
were found as the major components. From Takab sample β-caryophyllene (26.2%),
1, 8-cineole (14.2%) and α-pinene (11.2%) were characterized as the main compounds. The
oils showed moderate antibacterial activity.
Conclusion: The differences observed in essential oil composition of two studied samples
could be attributed to their different ecological, geographical and edaphical origin factors.
The moderate antibacterial activity of the oils could be associated with the presence of 1, 8-
cineole.

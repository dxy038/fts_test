In this paper, the discrete memoryless arbitrarily varying broadcast channel (AVBC) with receiver side information is studied and its random code and deterministic code capacity regions are derived for the average error criterion. In addition, it is analyzed for deterministic list codes and it is shown that the corresponding list capacity region displays a behavior, which is similar to AhlswedeÂ´s famous dichotomy result for the single-user arbitrarily varying channel: it either equals the random code capacity region or otherwise has an empty interior. This is characterized in terms of list sizes at the receivers and an appropriate concept of symmetrizability for the AVBC with receiver side information. The scenario studied here is motivated by the broadcast phase of bidirectional relaying, where a half-duplex relay node establishes a bidirectional communication between two other nodes using a decode-and-forward protocol. The relay decodes the messages both nodes have sent in the initial multiple access phase and broadcasts a re-encoded composition of them in the succeeding broadcast phase. Then, the broadcast phase corresponds to the AVBC with receiver side information, which differs from the classical broadcast channel, since both receivers can exploit their own messages from the previous phase as side information for decoding.

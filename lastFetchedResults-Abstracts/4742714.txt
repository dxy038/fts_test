This paper discusses control design issues for the existing thyristor controlled series compensation (TCSC) device at Slatt substation on the Slatt-Buckley 500 kV transmission line owned by BPA (USA). The controls were developed at Washington State University (WSU) in a project funded by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The project has been carried out in close collaboration between the WSU team and the BPA engineers. The controls are primarily aimed at providing fast transient stabilizing control during the first few swings of critical contingencies. Mid-term small-signal stability enhancement is the secondary control objective

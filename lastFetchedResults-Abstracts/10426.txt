A strategy was developed for implementation and management of multisector urban infrastructure projects. The strategy includes risk-based analytical hierarchy process (AHP) for project prioritization that is based on project deliverables and project life-cycle and implementation guidelines. The expert-opinion elicitation process used for this study consists of a variation of the Delphi technique, scenario analysis, civil works, and nuclear industry recommendations. The AHP methodology utilizes a multicriteria decision-making technique that allows the consideration of both objective and subjective factors in obtaining cardinal priority ranking of infrastructure projects. The methodology, which deals with different fields of infrastructure, can incorporate uncertainty in the process and can be implemented using simple spreadsheet format. The methodology was developed for a group of players (methodology implementers) involved in implementation and management of urban infrastructure projects. These include the decision makers, the stakeholders who can influence the decision and/or be affected by it, and the analysts. The methodology was demonstrated in this paper using real-life applications for effectiveness in prioritizing infrastructure projects from mixed infrastructure sectors in Palestine.

The quality of the medical image can be evaluated by several subjective techniques. However, the objective technical assessments of the quality of medical imaging have been recently proposed. The fusion of information from different imaging modalities allows a more accurate analysis. We have developed new techniques based on the multiresolution fusion. MRI and PET images have been fused with eight multi resolution techniques. For the evaluation of fusion images obtained, we opted by objective techniques. The results prove that the fusion with RATIO and contrast techniques to offer the best results. Evaluation by objective technical quality of medical images fused is feasible and successful.

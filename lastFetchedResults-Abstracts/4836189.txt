It has become an important objective as well as a key technology for improving the effectiveness of modern logistics systems that how to dispatch the various sub-systems in AS/RSs to achieve optimal performances. This paper gave a main focus on the analysis and comparison for a variety of algorithms, of which, the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) and the Petri Net (PN) were emphatically analyzed. Moreover, some opinions were brought forward for further studies on the scheduling optimization for AS/RSs.

The time to electric breakdown, and the electric field necessary to result in breakdown of solid insulation, seem to be best represented by a Weibull probability distribution. This tutorial paper reviews the graphical method of estimating the parameters of the Weibull distribution. It also presents the method of Maximum Likelihood as an objective technique, developed by statisticians for improving the estimates of the Weibull parameters, especially for censored experiments. Procedures for calculating confidence intervals are also given. It is shown in an example that the confidence intervals can be very wide for sample sizes commonly used in dielectric life tests.

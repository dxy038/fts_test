Electronic warfare is a military action whose objective is to control the electromagnetic spectrum. To accomplish this objective, both offensive electronic attack (EA) and electronic protection (EP) actions are required. In addition electronic warfare support (ES) actions are essential to supply the intelligence and threat recognition that allow implementation of both EA and EP. Commanders must prepare to operate weapons systems in an intensive and non-permissive electromagnetic environment. Mission accomplishment requires awareness, dynamic planning, and flexibility at all levels of war. The Information System is a rescue in this critical task. It has been proposed to develop the EW Intelligent Information System that deals with processing of electronic warfare, communications, radar, war missions etc. In this work, design and implementation of such an intelligent system is offered. Using artificial intelligence, this system aims at achieving the best performance with a friendly system in spite of the existence of hostile actions. This system deals with different sources of data. It helps visualize mission scenarios, decides the mission suitability and the best EA and ES methods accordingly. This work handles a nonlinear optimization problem with multiple variables and constraints. Closed form and exact solutions of such problems are computationally difficult. Therefore, the paper proposes the use of artificial intelligence mainly the fuzzy logic and neural networks approach to tackle this problem. Traditionally, large databases of information require complex problem solving techniques. However, the use of AI provides a simple yet computationally manageable solution for this issue.

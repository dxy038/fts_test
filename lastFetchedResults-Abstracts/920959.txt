An improved synthesis of n-octyl Î²-d-galactofuranoside was described using micro-wave activation. The resulting alkyl furanoside showed antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, a non-pathogenic model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It was further incorporated into a biodegradable PBAT/sodium caseinate polymer. The resulting biomaterial loaded with 5% of the pharmacophore retained the mycobacteriostatic properties and developed a mycobactericidal activity on contact and at the periphery of the film.

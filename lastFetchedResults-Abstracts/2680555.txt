Introduction: Gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder is a complicated psychological problem and has traumatic consequences for patients, their families, and society. The objective of this study was to evaluate the self-concept in patients with gender dysphoria and compare that with healthy individuals. Materials and Methods: This study compared sixty gender disappointments, including 15 patients undergone male-to-female gender reassignment, 15 patients undergone female-to-male gender reassignment as well as 15 males and 15 females requesting sex reassignment, with 30 healthy individuals (15 females and 15 males). Identity Style Inventory and self-concept test were used for this evaluation. Results: Our findings showed that style identity was different between patients with gender disappointments and healthy people. Patients with gender disappointments exhibited less informational identity than healthy individuals. In addition, patients underwent gender reassignment, especially male to female gender reassignment, showed higher score of informational identity than patients with requesting sex reassignment. Conclusion: Dissatisfaction of gender identity affects self-concept and identity in patients with gender disappointment.

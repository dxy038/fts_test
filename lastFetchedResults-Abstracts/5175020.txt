This paper presents a new approach to provide fault tolerance in MPLS multicast networks. MPLS has been used to provide faster forwarding; combining with multicasting it further supports applications with improved service. Fault tolerance is therefore important for such networks. Our approach for fault tolerance is to divide and encode the traffic into multiple disjoint trees using a modified (k, n) Threshold Sharing scheme. Our approach can reconstruct the original traffic from any k out of n trees available. Therefore, in the event of node/link failure(s) of any (n-k) trees, our approach provides fault tolerance without introducing any recovery delay and packet loss. Moreover, our objective is also to minimize bandwidth utilization for protection purposes.

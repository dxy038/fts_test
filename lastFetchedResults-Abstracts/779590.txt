The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview
about education for cataloging and classification in Mexico.
Mexican Library and Information Science (LIS) schools have traditionally
featured a strong emphasis on cataloging and classification
learning, which continues to be an important part of their curricula.
Additionally, as in other countries, education for cataloging and classification
in Mexico has been influenced by the changes that libraries
and Library Science have experienced as a result of new technological
developments. General trends in education for cataloging and classification
in Mexico are seen by comparing the different Mexican LIS
schools and their program curricula.

Objective(s): To determine the microbiological quality of water used in Tehran food industries.
Methods: 50 food factories were randomly selected. Free residual chlorine (as an indicator of effective disinfections), Total and Thermotolearant Coliforms (as indicators of contamination) were the main parameters measured in up to 300 water samples taken from water supply systems. The examination of water was performed according to the standard methods described by the American Public Health Association (APHA).
Results: The result indicated that 94% of factories had private water supply systems. 92% were used underground water resources. Only 36% of factories disinfected water before use; in most samples, concentrantions of free residual cholrine were not in the optimal range. 47.7% and 10.4% of sample were contaminated; with mean total coliform 3 per 10m1 and mean thermotolearant colifirms counts of 8.6/100ml respectively.
Conclusion: In general, the management of water quality control (specially microbiological aspect) in Tehran food industries is poor and there is a real need for improvement.

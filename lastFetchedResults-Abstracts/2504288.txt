Background: Phospholipids are distributed asymmetrically between inner and outer
leaflets of the plasma membrane of live cells. Early during apoptosis, this asymmetry is
disrupted and phosphatidylserine becomes exposed on the outside surface of the plasma
membrane. There is little information about the effects of vitrification on apoptosis.
Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of vitrification on
apoptosis of subfertile and fertile men.
Materials and Methods: In this study, semen samples were collected from subfertile
(n=20) and fertile men (n=10) after 48h abstinence of intercourse. After semen analysis
according to WHO criterias, each semen sample was divided into two portions. First
portion was assessed by Annexin V-flous staining kit for showing apoptosis in
subfertile and fertile men and second portion was assessed after vitrification-thawing.
Results were analyzed by Paired t-test and Independent t-test.
Results: After vitrification-thawing, mean percentage of apoptotic spermatozoa has
increased 6 and 3 times in subfertile and fertile men respectively. This difference is
significant.
Conclusion: Vitrification-thawing could disrupted membrane asymmetry and
caused apoptosis. Therefore, it will cause reduction of functional spermatozoa in access
of Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART).

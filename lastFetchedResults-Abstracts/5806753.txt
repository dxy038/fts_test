The objective of this Paper is to design and implement a resource allocation algorithm that maximizes the capacity while maintaining the proportional fairness among users. The algorithm is designed to maintain proportional rates among users for each channel realization, which ensures the rates of different users to be proportional. By formulating the problem this way, it will be shown that a higher capacity for all users (even with those with poor channel gains) can be achieved with low computational complexity. In other words the objective can be explained as formulating a new optimization problem that balances the tradeoff between capacity and fairness.

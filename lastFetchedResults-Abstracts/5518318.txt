The number of failed software process assessment and improvement programs far outnumber the successes and the improvement rates appear to remain low, because as Garvin (1993) suggests, "continuous improvement programs require a commitment to learning". This study investigates the relationship between a software process assessment and improvement model and organisational learning, and examines whether a software process improvement model provides a means for viewing organisational learning; and secondly, investigates the type of learning required to support the objective of continuous improvement.

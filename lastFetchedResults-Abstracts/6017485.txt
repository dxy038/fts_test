Summary form only given. The key of reactive power planning (RPP), or Var planning, is the optimal allocation of reactive power sources considering location and size. Traditionally, the locations for placing new Var sources were either simply estimated or directly assumed. Recent research works have presented some rigorous optimization-based methods in RPP. This paper will first review various objectives of RPP. The objectives may consider many cost functions such as variable Var cost, fixed Var cost, real power losses, and fuel cost. Also considered may be the deviation of a given voltage schedule, voltage stability margin, or even a combination of different objectives as a multi-objective model. Secondly, different constraints in RPP are discussed. These different constraints are the key of various optimization models, identified as Optimal Power Flow (OPF) model, Security Constrained OPF (SCOPF) model, and SCOPF with Voltage-Stability consideration (SCOPF-VS). Thirdly, the optimization-based models will be categorized as conventional algorithms, intelligent searches, and fuzzy set applications. The conventional algorithms include Linear Programming (LP), Nonlinear Programming (NLP), Mixed Integer Non- Linear Programming (MINLP), etc. The intelligent searches include Simulated Annealing (SA), Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), and Tabu Search (TS). The fuzzy set applications in RPP address the uncertainties in objectives and constraints. Finally, this paper will conclude the discussion with a summary matrix for different objectives, models, and algorithms.

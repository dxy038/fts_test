Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease with diverse clinical manifestations. It typically attacks the lungs (pulmonary); however, it
may also affect other parts of the body (extrapulmonary) with or most commonly without lung involvement. Notable extrapulmonary
infection sites include pleura, central nervous system, lymphatic system, genitourinary system, bones and joints, and abdomen.
Abdominal TB is one of the most prevalent forms of extrapulmonary presentations of this variable disease. Given the patients with
abdominal complaints especially in developing countries, where the disease is endemic, it should be kept in mind that abdominal TB has
numerous differential diagnoses. Case Presentation: Our case is a 46 year-old female with left upper abdominal pain and mass sensation, with no associated signs or
symptoms, but negative family history of TB and carcinoma. The patient underwent several diagnostic procedures so that the ultimate
cause for her abdominal pain would be discovered among various existing differential diagnoses. Discussion: Peritoneal TB, although not very common, is still the important cause of not only abdominal symptoms but also female
infertility. The need to pay more accurate attention to peritoneal TB in endemic areas, especially in young patients considered to have
peritoneal carcinomatosis, seems very important.

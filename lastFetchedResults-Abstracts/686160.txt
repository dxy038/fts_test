Asthma in children appears to be associated with both phthalate esters and dampness in buildings. An important question is whether the concentrations of phthalate esters correlate with dampness (expressed as relative humidity—RH) in indoor air. The objective was to study the influence of RH on the specific emission rate (SER) of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) from one type of vinyl flooring in the well characterized Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC). The vinyl flooring with ca. 17% (w/w) DEHP as plasticizer was tested in 6 FLECs at 22 °C. The RH in the 6 FLECs was 10%, 30%, 50% (in triplicate) and 70%. The RH was changed after 248 d in 2 of the 50%-FLECs to 10% and 70%, and to 50% in the 10%-and 70%-FLECs. The data show that the SER of DEHP from vinyl flooring in FLECs during a 1 yr period is independent of the RH. A new physically based emission model for semivolatile organic compounds was found to be consistent with the experimental data and independent of the RH. The model helps to explain the RH results, because it appears that RH does not significantly influence any of the identified controlling mechanisms.

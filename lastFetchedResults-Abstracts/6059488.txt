Recently characteristics required of automobiles have been diversified, and from the electric/electronic points of view, the changes of automobiles are a wide range of electronization flow of control and changes of power source of automobiles represented by electric automobiles and the transmission system. Considering these, the connector, one of the network parts of an automobile to shoulder the transmission of signals and power is increasingly important in electric connection and reliability. In designing the connector to be installed in the automobile, therefore, we think it significant to obtain theory to become a design guide on the connecting performance, especially contact resistance characteristic. The objective of this study is to derive the theoretical formula of the contact resistance to meet the requirements from the design of the connector to be installed in the automobile and verify its effectiveness. First, from the known formula of contact resistance, we derived a formula including parameters to determine the connector specifications that are simple and can be used for the design and verified the effectiveness from statistical results of various measurement data.

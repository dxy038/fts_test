An objective to control power flow in intermediate DC link of typical induction drive converter has been introduced and respective drive setup intended for such task. Theoretical considerations and simulation results of control approach utilizing available drive controller capabilities like direct torque control and speed control, as well as introduction of additional adaptive funnel type controller has been presented. Modifications of introduced adaptive control method have been presented and evaluated by simulation. Simulation results support proposed idea of DC link power flow control.

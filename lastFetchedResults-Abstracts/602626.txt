This paper presents analysis of variation of various parameters on design of discone Antenna. The aim was to note variations in design parameters of discone antenna in the range of 2.0-2.5 GHz with step size increase of .1 GHz Simulation of the proposed Antenna was performed with Antenna design tool by FEKO. The change in different parameters affects the discone antenna dimensions .It has been observed that as the disc diameter is decreased the resonant freq increases, V. S. W. R is below 2.0 while maintaining an exceptional omnidirectional radiation. The antenna resonates in the range of frequencies 1.74 to 2.177 GHz. The main parameters for the optimum design of discone antenna considered were Resonant frequency fr, V.S.W.R, reflection coefficient, B w. The simulated performances for various frequencies are in good agreement with our objective

In this paper, the phase stability of 50 km externally modulated 256-QAM DWDM fiber optic link is evaluated. The analysis of RF phase noise in the fiber optic link is the main objective of this work. RF phase noise is mainly investigated with preamplifier (EDFA) configuration at 1550 nm wavelength. BER curves, constellation diagrams and Eye diagrams are the three main performance criteria considered through this paper.

Using Ultra wideband technique for short distance wireless communication in home networking requires cost effective technical solutions with high quality. The objective of this paper is to provide a low cost, short distance (&lt;; 10m), point to point, high speed wireless link using a single user UWB system with 2-dimensional hermite based pulse shape modulation and a simple receiver comprising of a multiplier along with a channel equalizer. The paper investigates the performance of UWB system with simple receiver for image transmission over IEEE UWB channels CM1-CM4 modeled for indoor communication. The received image quality is tested by measuring PSNR and SSIM (Structural Similarity and Image Quality index). It is observed that an image can be received on the receiver side with its original quality (PSNR) at symbol SNR of 13dB without ECC (data rate=1334MBps) over the distance of 4m using a proposed receiver instead of multiple finger rake proving it to be a cost effective solution for UWB wireless system.

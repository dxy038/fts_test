Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the flexure strength of unidirectional fiber-reinforced resins under static and cyclic loading with and without thermal cycling.

Methods: The fiber-reinforced resin materials chosen for this project were commercially available endodontic posts and commercially procured bar samples. For all materials, controls for flexure strength were tested in air and in water using three-point loading. Specimens were thermal cycled between 7 and 63 °C for 6000 cycles. A staircase approach was used to determine the flexure fatigue limit and scanning microscopy was used to examine the microstructure.

Results: The carbon/graphite fiber-reinforced resin posts and the glass FiberKor posts were significantly stronger than the ceramic (zirconia) and the other glass-reinforced resin materials. Thermal cycling caused a significant lowering (11–24%) of the flexure strength for each resin based post system. The ceramic post system decreased only by 2%. Further, for standard size glass fiber-reinforced resin bars, no significant differences between testing in air and water was observed, but a significant difference between static and cyclic loading was noted.

Significance: The decreases in the strength property due to thermal cycling and the cyclic loading of these materials indicates that their utilization in the oral environment enhances their degradation, and potentially shortens their clinical life.

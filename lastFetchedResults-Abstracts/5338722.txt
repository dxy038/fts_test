This article explores design and analysis of instantaneous power theory with proportional integral derivative (PID) based Shunt Active Power Line Conditioners (APLC). This APLC compensates the reactive and harmonic currents drawn by the non-linear load besides power factor correction. The objective is to study different control strategies for real time compensation of current harmonics at different load conditions. The compensation process is based on the calculation of real power losses using p-q theory and the PID controller reduces the ripple voltage of the dc capacitor of the PWM-VSI. This approach is different from conventional methods and provides effective solution. The switching is done according to gating signals obtained from hysteresis band current controller. The shunt APLC is investigated under different steady state and transient conditions.

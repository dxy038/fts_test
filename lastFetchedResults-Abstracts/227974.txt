Power factor correction converters with a programmable harmonic input impedance can
be used to reduce the harmonic distortion in the utility grid. Whereas previously proposed controllers
tried to obtain a resistive behaviour of the converter with a constant input impedance for all
frequencies, including the fundamental, another recently proposed control strategy allows the
setting of a harmonic input resistance independent of the fundamental input impedance.
Although previous papers showed the usefulness of this approach, the analysis and verification
of the input impedance of the converter in a broad frequency spectrum is focussed here. The characteristics
of the current controller will determine the input impedance of the converter in the frequency
domain. The implementation of the control strategy with a programmable harmonic
resistance on a digitally controlled full-bridge bidirectional converter is described. Experimental
tests on a 1-kW prototype show that with the proposed implementation good concordance with
the theoretical input impedance curves is obtained.

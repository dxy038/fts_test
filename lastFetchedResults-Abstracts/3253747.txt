Network survivability is the ability of a network to continuously deliver the required services under undesired events. It has become a fundamental concern for the design and performance evaluation of telecommunication networks. We present survivability models for a telecommunication network subject to disaster propagation. The primary objective is to develop a stochastic modeling framework and associated computational techniques to assess the survivability of the system. By way of a wireless network example, we illustrate the viability of our approach and assess the accuracy and efficiency of the computational methods. The numerical results indicate that our approach is not only able to accurately estimate the survivability of a network (design) but also is computationally efficient.

This paper describes a proposed multi-channel mobile telephone communications system designed to meet Canadian Telephone Company system requirements. Some of the requirements satisfied by this system are maximum channel loading and automatic channel selection with a mobile equipment cost marginally higher than that of the standard mobile radio telephone. The paper will describe a mobile equipment designed for this system together with a description of the equipment modules required to utilize standard mobile and fixed station equipment in this system. The primary objective of A.M.T.S. is to allow maximum subscriber loading within the limits of the 1 to 11 contiguous channels available in the 150 mc mobile telephone service band. Because it has been possible to meet this objective without materially increasing the capital investment per subscriber, relative to present systems employing manual channel selection, it is felt that the A.M.T.S. concept may be of interest in other areas of North America.

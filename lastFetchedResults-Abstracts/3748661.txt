The objective of this paper is to examine the link between the attenuation coefficients and the interferometric phase center heights, for several frequencies from P- to L-band, and to study the extent to which it depends on the canopy architecture and description. This paper relies on the use of a coherent and full polarimetric scattering model, which simulates the fields backscattered by a forested area. In the first part, we study the behavior with a frequency of the interferometric phase center heights, and in the second part, we focus on the attenuation coefficients. Then, we compare the behaviors of these two quantities, and we propose to empirically derive a relation between these two quantities and the mean forest height. Finally, we investigate if a change in the initial forest or radar configuration has an impact on the determination of this relation.

Purpose – With the emerging a new phenomenon of Internet, the banks have gone through the
traditional process and have reached the stage of modern banking in their career. Following this
transition, the banks became familiar with numerous banking technologies. However, the main
concern in the use of these technologies was the quality assessment and their impact on customers’
satisfaction and loyalty. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to provide a model which is
able to assess the quality of any kind of banking technologies (whether the technologies that are
already in use or those that will be used in the future).
Design/methodology/approach – Firstly, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) method was used to
identify the service quality dimensions within technology-based banking. Then, the effect of each
variable on customers’ satisfaction and loyalty was investigated using structural equations modeling
employing LISREL software.
Findings – Following exploratory factor analysis, 8 dimensions of easiness, assurance, security,
customization, comprehensive being, convenience, support services and the employee knowledge
were identified as the service quality dimensions within technology-based banking. Finally, the effect
of each of the eight dimensions on the customers’ satisfaction and loyalty was investigated using
structural equations modeling.
Practical implications –The model obtained in the present study was used to identify the service
quality dimensions regardless the applied banking technology, therefore it is considered as a general
model which is applicable to any kind of banking technology.
Originality/value – The present study provides a general model to identify the service quality
dimensions within technology-based banking.

Although power flow of current power utility network, smart grid system exchange digital information and power flow bidirectional interaction between provider and user. Thanks to communication networks, exchange of information between end user and power suppliers can estimate the power consumption more precisely and stable operation of power utility can be possible. To provide these advantages, importance of communication network is increased, and it is required to carefully design the network system. Although a few study and IEC 61850-90-4: Communication Networks and System: Network engineering guideline, which relate to guideline and checklist for network design is suggested, the confirmation of network configuration and guideline presented needs to be considered more carefully. We design and simulate the communication network for IEC 61850 based substation station bus and process bus of Poong-Dong digital substation, which is the first IEC 61850 based substation with multi-vendorsÂ´ IEDs (Intelligent Electrical Devices). We expect that this study will help to design the communication network for digital power utility.

Objective(s): We aimed to study the effect of trimetazidine (TMZ) on urethral wound repair.
Materials and Methods: A total of 52 male rats were used; 8 groups were formed: 1-week and 3-week control (C1,C3), sham (S1, S3), oral (OT1, OT3), and intraurethral TMZ (IUT1, IUT3) groups. Serum and urine total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant capacity (TOC), and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) were studied. Hematoxyline-Eosin was used for the histopathological study. In addition, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α), interleukin 1α, and β levels were compared across groups by an immunohistochemical method.
Results: There were significant differences between C3 and IUT3, OT3 and IUT3 with respect to serum TAC in 3-week groups (P=0.013; P =0.001). Serum TOC levels were significantly different between C3 and IUT3; S3 and OT3; and OT3 and IUT3 groups (P =0.024; P =0.019; P =0.000, respectively). Serum 8-OHdG levels were significantly different between C3 and OT3 groups (P=0.033). In the immunohistochemical examination, C1 and OT1; C1 and IUT1; and S1, S3, OT1, OT3, IUT1 groups were significantly different with respect to IL-1β staining (P=0.007; P =0.000; P=0.009), while there was a significant difference between C3 and S3 with respect to IL-1β (P =0.000).
Conclusion: TMZ increased urinary total oxidant level; while increasing serum TAC levels in the long-term. It also reduced serum TAC levels in urethral use and caused an increase in serum TOC levels with minimal effects on DNA injury and repair. No effect was detected on IL1 α and TNF, but partially reduced the effect on IL-1 β levels.

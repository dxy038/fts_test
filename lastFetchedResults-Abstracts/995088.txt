The present review deals with novel developments in immunosensors destined for final application in food analysis. In this perspective particular emphasis will be given to the most important approaches which recently have been used for immunosensor construction and assembling. For this reason, electrochemical, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) techniques will be explored in detail and recent and practical examples on food matrices will be reviewed. Objective of this survey is to give a general overview of the possible application of immunosensors to the food analysis field.

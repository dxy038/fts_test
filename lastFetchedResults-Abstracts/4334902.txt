A major objective in wireless sensor networks is to find optimum routing strategies for energy efficient use of nodes. Routing decision and transmission power selection are intrinsically connected since the transmission power of a node is adjusted depending on the location of the next hop. In this paper, we propose a location-based routing framework to control the energy distribution in a network where transmission ranges, hence powers, of nodes are determined based on their locations. We show that the proposed framework is sufficiently general to investigate the minimum-energy and maximum-lifetime routing problems. It is shown that via the location based strategy the network lifetime can be improved by 70% and the total energy consumption can be decreased to three-fourths to one-third of the constant transmission range strategy depending on the propagation medium and the size of the network.

Abstract
Objective: Obesity is related to anemia which is explained its mechanism as disorder in iron absorption but the more rational reason is anemia of inflammation or anemia of chronic disease. The aim of this study was to define the prevalence of obesity in patients with normochromic normocytic anemia.
Materials and Methods: We screened 406 patients who were referred to endocrine clinic. They were excluded from study if suffering from malignancy, hypo or hyperthyroidism, diabetes, growth hormone disorder, rheumatologic disorder or corticosteroid consumption. The complete blood count were checked in each participants. The patients with normochromic, normocytic anemia were diagnosed. Data was analyzed by SPSS17 software.
Results: Among this population, 26 persons had normochromic, normocytic anemia and 11 (42.3%) patients had central obesity. In remainder of persons (Without normochromic, normocytic anemia), 58.4% had central obesity.Overall, 49 patients had anemia and central obesity together. About 53% of them had normochromic normocytic anemia.
Conclusion: Central obesity is a common and complex phenomenon which is due to multiple etiologies. But based on our study, although the prevalence of central obesity was lower in patients with normochromic normocytic anemia, in 42.3% of them there was no source of inflammation except central obesity. Most patients with anemia and central obesity had normochromic normocytic anemia.

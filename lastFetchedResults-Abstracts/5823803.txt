Segmentation of human brain from MRI scan slices without human intervention is the objective of this paper. A simple and accurate method is developed for extracting the brain tissues from the T1 weighted MR Images. The DICOM images are used for segmenting. A hybrid of threshold and seed growth techniques are used in classifying the brain tissues into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

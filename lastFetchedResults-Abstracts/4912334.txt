We present the theoretical foundations for the multiple rendezvous problem involving design of local control strategies that enable groups of visibility-limited mobile agents to split into subgroups, exhibit simultaneous taxis behavior towards, and eventually rendezvous at, multiple unknown locations of interest. The theoretical results are proved under certain restricted set of assumptions. The algorithm used to solve the above problem is based on a glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) technique, developed earlier, that finds multiple optima of multimodal objective functions. The significant difference between our work and most earlier approaches to agreement problems is the use of a virtual local-decision domain by the agents in order to compute their movements. The range of the virtual domain is adaptive in nature and is bounded above by the maximum sensor/visibility range of the agent. We introduce a new decision domain update rule that enhances the rate of convergence by a factor of approximately two. We use some illustrative simulations to support the algorithmic correctness and theoretical findings of the paper

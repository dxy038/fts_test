A method for multi-objective circuit variability optimization in the presence of process variations is presented. Critical process parameter variations are identified by determining their correlations to the circuit performance measures of interest. Then, the distributions of these critical process parameters are used to identify the critical designable parameters for variability optimization. Membership functions and fuzzy set intersection operators are used to transform multiple design objectives into a single objective function suitable for optimization. Afterwards, the objective function for variability is minimized. Finally, the mean circuit performance measures are fine tuned for given target specifications.

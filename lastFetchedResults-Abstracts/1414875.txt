Perfluoroalkyl alcohols are used as surfactants for emulsion polymerization, as CFC-alternative substances and as materials for perfluoroalkyl monomer synthesis. The main objective of this work was to investigate the high-pressure phase behavior of the binary system, carbon dioxide + heptadecafluoro-1-decanol. We used the synthetic method with a variable volume view cell to obtain experimental data in carbon dioxide. Bubble point, critical point and dew point pressures for this system were observed at temperatures from 313 to 363 K and pressures up to 16 MPa. And experimental data were correlated with the Pengâ€“Robinson equation of state, nonrandom lattice fluid theory and statistical associating fluid theory equation of state, respectively.

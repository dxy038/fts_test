Study Objective
To determine differences in sexual behavior, health habits and contraceptive use among three age groups of pregnant adolescents.
Design
Prospective study of pregnant adolescents participating in face-to-face interviews including questions about demographic background, sexual behavior, health history and contraceptive use.
Setting
Urban prenatal clinic.
Participants
300 pregnant adolescents attending their first prenatal appointment.
Main Outcome Measures
Sexual behavior, health history and contraceptive use.
Results
Our cohort of pregnant adolescents included 61 (20%) 12–15-year-olds, 113 (38%) 16–17-year-olds and 126 (42%) 18–19-year-olds. A greater proportion of 12–15-year-olds were currently in school (90%) compared with 16–17-year-olds (48%) and 18–19-year-olds (38%) (P = 0.01). Of the18–19-year-olds, 41% had a previous pregnancy compared with 3% of 12–15-year-olds (P = 0.01). The youngest age group also had the lowest proportion of any drug use (25%). Contraceptive use (ever) was lower for 12–15-year-olds (46%) compared with 16–17-year-olds (59%), and 18–19-year-olds (66%) (P < 0.01). Reasons for not using contraception at the time of conception also differed by age with 9% of the youngest group reporting they wanted to get pregnant compared with 27% of the 18–19-year-old group (P = 0.01).
Conclusions
Sexual behavior, health habits and contraceptive use in pregnant adolescents differed by age group. Understanding that there are distinct risk behaviors associated with teen pregnancy among these three separate age groups will enhance the thoughtful development and evaluation of programs and policies targeted at preventing first pregnancies and repeat pregnancies in adolescents.

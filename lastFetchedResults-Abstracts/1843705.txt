The main objective of the present work is to perform molecular docking studies of the ligand 2-Mercapto-5-(3-Methoxy phenyl) 1,3,4 oxadiazole with protein focal adhesion kinase. A good correlation was observed in binding affinity of this complex. Using different inhibitors for this enzyme, it can be used as an anticancer therapy target.

Objective: To investigate the relationship between handedness and motorial brain tissue (corticospinal fasciculus and corpus striatum) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: In this study, thirty-five healthy subjects (24 right-handers and 11 left-handers) were enrolled from the International Consortium of Brain Mapping (ICBM) database, and the DTI data were obtained on Siemens Sonata 1.5T MR units. The parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudianl diffusivity (&#955;E&#776;L) and transverse diffusivity (&#955;E&#776;T) were acquired from the corticospinal fasciculus and corpus striatum in both hemispheres of brain. Discriminative analysis for left and right handed nesses was employed. Results: Handedness relates to motorial brain tissue, and the asymmetry of the motorial brain tissue. Furthermore, the major differences between left-and right-handedness in DTI index parameters were &#955;E&#776;L and &#955;E&#776;T in the caudate nucleus. Conclusion: The major differences between left- and right-handedness in microcosmic tissue were axon and myelin organization in the caudate nucleus. This finding is discovered by analyzing the DTI microcosmic information using multi-patterns.

Abstract: Today, using inductively coupled contactless power transmission systems (ICPT) to charge electric vehicles is a promising step in increasing efficiency of electric vehicles. In this paper, the design of an ICPT systembased on a rectangular coil configuration for primary and secondary coil is presented. An analytical model of the contactless power transmission system is derived and is used to optimize the performance of the system. System parameters are optimized using artificial bee colony algorithm and a new two-objective optimization problem is obtained which optimizes the system parameters to reach maximum efficiency while the minimum volume of copper is needed to be used. Moreover, the necessity of compensation in both primary and secondary studied and the best compensation technique based on the application of ICPT system is applied.The designed system performance while the primary and secondary windings are misaligned is investigated. Simulations are done by MATLAB and ANSOFT MAXWELL and the results confirm the analytical model and designed result as expected..

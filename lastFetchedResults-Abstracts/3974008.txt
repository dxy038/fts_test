The objective of this study is to investigate the transmitted (Tx) power of 3G terminals during real use. Such analysis reveals the exposure induced by mobile phone devices and provides a precise idea about the margin between time averaged and maximum (standardized) exposure. For this purpose, data streams exchanged on a live network were recorded and processed to extract a histogram of received power at the handset in indoor, outdoor, rural, and urban environments. The real Tx power is found to be generally a few percents of the maximum power. Moreover, the influences of some main factors like the handset model and the usage mode are investigated. A data mode for example increases the Tx power of about 6 dB compared to a voice call.

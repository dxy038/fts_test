The objective of the paper is to give an idea about the copper based networking cables and their important characteristics. Copper based cables, specially UTP cables are very sensitive to EMI and optical fiber are insensitive to EMI. But still today, UTP cable is the most popularly used networking cable supporting the standards up to Ten Gigabit Ethernet. It is because of its high speed of data transmission capabilities and also from the point of view of cost and installation. Here we present a detailed analysis of the significant characteristics of different copper cables. Analysis and study are supported by qualitative and quantitative evaluations of critical parameters in regards to performance.

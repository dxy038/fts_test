Spectrum mobility in cognitive radio networks not only enables the secondary users to guarantee the desired QoS of the primary users but also grants an efficient exploitation of the available spectrum holes in the network. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach in determining the initial and target channels for the handoff procedure in a single secondary user network. To characterize the network, a queuing theoretical framework is introduced, and &#8220;stay&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221; handoff policies are both addressed. The performance of the secondary user in terms of average sojourn and extended service times for secondary connections is analyzed, and convex optimization problems with the objective of minimizing those times as well as analytical solutions are presented. Simulation results confirm the validity of our analytical approach.

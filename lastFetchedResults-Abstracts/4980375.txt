The objective of the paper is to validate the feasibility of auto-tuning WCDMA link power maxima and adjust cell downlink load level targets based on quality of service. The downlink cell load level is measured using total wideband transmission power. The quality indicators used are call-blocking probability, packet queuing probability and downlink link power outage. The objective is to improve performance and operability of the network with control software aiming for a specific quality of service. The downlink link maxima in each cell are regularly adjusted with a control method in order to improve performance under different load level targets. The approach is validated using a dynamic WCDMA system simulator. The conducted simulations support the assumption that the downlink performance can be managed and improved by the proposed cell-based automated optimization.

In this paper, position control of a linear induction motor (LIM) using adaptive fuzzy backstepping design with integral action is proposed. An integral backstepping design for of LIM is first proposed to compensate the uncertainties that affect indirect field oriented control. A simple fuzzy inference mechanism is used to achieve the position tracking objective with uncertainties in mechanical parameters, resulting into a fuzzy integral-backstepping controller. Numerical simulations show that the proposed scheme presents good performances as compared to the conventional integral backstepping control

The objective of this paper is to propose a self optimizing algorithm for tuning dynamically the antenna parameters in LTE cellular networks. The impact of the downtilt and the Half-Power Beamwidth (HPBW) as well as the azimuth steering of the evolved NodeB (eNB) antenna on the cell coverage and capacity is investigated. A heuristic algorithm for adaptive antenna parameter optimization is proposed. The proposed algorithm aims at determining the appropriate antenna parameters in order to maximize the cell throughput. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed in the context of different network scenarios. Adapting the antenna parameter values to those recommended by the proposed algorithm notably improves the cell throughput.

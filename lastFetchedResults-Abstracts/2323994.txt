Supplier selection and determination of lot sizing is an important component of production and logistics management for many companies. Therefore, after selection of preferred suppliers, at first, we should obtain the optimize order of each of the suppliers with regard to the purposes and constraints of determiners. One of the most effective techniques, which can provide optimal solutions with different targets, is multi-objective programming model. The purpose of this study is to design an efficient multi-objective model to determine the lot sizing to each supplier. This work is done with designation of multi-objective model to achieve minimizing the cost of the chain, such as the cost of purchasing, storage, transportation, etc., and also maximizing the quality of materials purchased from the suppliers. Finally, the model is solved by using the meta-heuristic method, multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Also in order to validate the model, it is solved using meta-heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and the results are compared with the first method.

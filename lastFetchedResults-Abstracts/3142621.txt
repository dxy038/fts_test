We discuss the design of a realistic optical black hole (OBH) using the exact frequency domain solutions for TM and TE waves. The design includes thin separating layers between the absorbing core and the metamaterial shell. The overall objective is to develop an on-line simulation tool, which could help to design experimentally realizable OBH with a continuous radius-dependent index. Example structures working at 1.5 &#956;m are presented and analyzed.

Inroduction & Objective: Peripheral nervous system damages reverse as retrograde to alpha neuron cell bodies and cause spinal degeneration . It is probable that Nigella sativa from Ranunculaceae family can prevent the injury progress because of antioxidant effect. The aim of this study is Nuroprotective effect of Nigella sativa aquatic extract on alpha motoneurons degeneration after Sciatic nerve injury in rats.
Materials and Methods: In this study, 24 wistar rats with average body weight of 250 to 300 gr were divided randomly to four groups. Animals were divided each consisting eight members; A: control, B: compression, C: compression + treatment with 75 mg/kg aquaticextract, D: compression + treatment with 50 mg/kg aquatic extract. In compression group, the right leg Sciatic nerve get through compression (60sec), in treated groups, in addition to compression extract was injected (2time, every week, I.P). After for weeks of post – operations in which lumbar segments of spinal cord L2-L4 were sampled, processed, and serially sectional and stained with toluidine blue, the number of alpha motoneurons was counted using dissector method. Data was analyzed with using Minitab-14 software, ANOVA an d T- tests.
Results: Neuronal density was (650± 32) and) 1803±24) in compression and control groups respectively (P < 0.00). There was a meaningful statistical increase in neuronal density of group C (1350±66) in comparing compression group (P < 0.00). The neuronal density in group (D) (1287±126), significantly increased in comparison with group (B) (P < 0.001). 
Conclusion:This study showed that aquatic extract of Nigella sativa leaves increases the density of alpha motoneurons in spinal cord after sciatic nerve compression in Rats. The increase in neuronal density is relevant to the amount of extract used.

The objective of this study was to develop the NIRS equations for silage fermentation attributes based on scans of fresh and dry silage samples of Leymus chinensis. The silage fermentation attributes included pH, ammonia nitrogen, lactic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid. Concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and lactic acid in fresh silage samples could be successfully predicted using NIRS with scans of dried silage samples. The NIRS predictions of all fermentation attributes, except for pH, were more accurate when equations were based on scans of dried instead of fresh silage samples.

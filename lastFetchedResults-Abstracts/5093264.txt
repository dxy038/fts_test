In this paper, a new model based optimal motion controller for driving simulators is presented. Models of human perception systems in combination with a simulator dynamic model are used in the design of the optimal controller. The basic idea of the new approach is based on minimizing the difference between the perceived signals in the vehicle and the perceived signals in the simulator. In addition, a new approach based on the human vestibular system is used to represent the sustained acceleration for the tilt coordination. Compared to conventional motion cueing algorithms, the proposed approach provides a more realistic impression, the workspace of the simulator is better exploited and all the constraints of the driving simulator are always respected. Furthermore, a new objective quality criterion is suggested to evaluate the new approach. A comparison between the classical washout, the adaptive washout and the new optimal control strategy is carried out.

In order to decrease the hardship of the knowledge transferring and sharing between enterprises. We designed a Case-based reasoning mechanism for enterprise informalization projects. After an intensive survey of enterprise informalization we defined the case hierarchical representation in detail to enable project managers to describe project requirements adequately. Furthermore, we proposed a combination method of subjective and objective weights to the nearest neighbor algorithm for enterprise informalization case retrieval, which can facilitate users to get more comfortable. In addition, a framework of enterprise informalization project system based on CBR was built and the portion functions of the system were designed. Finally, an example was given for describing the CBR system.

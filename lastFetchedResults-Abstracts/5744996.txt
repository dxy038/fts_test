The main purpose of this research is to develop a fuzzy multiple criteria decision making model (FMCDMM) to evaluate, identify and select an optimal robot system to perform the desired task from a large collection of available robots that have multiple criteria. A simple but effective weight estimation method is used in this paper to make this estimation more objective and reliable. There are existed some other different weight estimation methods reported by some researchers, however, most methods need a lot of mathematical operations and therefore make the processes very complicated and time consuming. This research result can be extended and implemented to any complicated system with multiple criteria and alternatives. In this paper, we concentrate our discussion on selecting optimal robot systems used in manufacturing and production processes.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of trivalent (chromic chloride) and hexavalent (potassium dichromate) forms of chromium in the African mouth breeder Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters), with reference to the humoral immune response and lymphoid cells/organs. The 96 h LD50for hexavalent and trivalent chromium was found to be 75 and 1000 μg fish−1, respectively. Groups of fishes were injected intraperitoneally with 10, 1, 0·1 and 0·01% LD50hexavalent and trivalent forms of chromium and subsequently immunised with bovine serum albumin (5 mg in 0·2 ml physiological saline). Both forms of chromium suppressed the antibody response, with hexavalent chromium being more suppressive than trivalent chromium. Reduction in spleen weight, splenocyte number and the percentage of blood lymphocytes was observed following administration of both forms of chromium. The possible immunological mechanisms behind the differential suppression of the antibody response and the reduction in spleen weight, splenocyte and lymphocyte counts are discussed.

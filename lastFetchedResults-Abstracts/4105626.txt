THE INPUT or control requirements of magnetic amplifiers are influenced to a great extent by the &#8220;dynamic&#8221; properties of the core, i.e., by the sensitiveness of the ferromagnetic core materials to changing magnetic flux. Attempts to describe analytically the over-all core behavior in terms of the magnetization processes within the material are hindered by the complexity of the mathematics involved and by the lack of an accurate evaluation of the pertinent physical constants of the material. The objective of this article is to determine experimentally an approximate relationship between significant variables which describe the electromagnetic behavior of these cores; this work is limited to cores wound of 50% nickel-iron, grain-oriented tapes.

Mathematical programming approach has been employed extensively as a means to enhance the decision-making process in science and engineering. One of the fields that has been benefiting from the employing mathematical programming is the production planning and scheduling in both the industry and service sectors. Most of these applications assume deterministic situations in which the parameters used to develop the model are known in advanced and will remain unchanged. Undesirably, real-world decision-making problems are not deterministic, and in fact; they are fuzzy in nature. This research work is mainly concerned with enhancing the decision-making in production planning through adaptation of the concept of fuzzy programming. This paper reports on the development of a mathematical programming model that involves fuzzy parameters. In addition and besides presenting the fuzzy mathematical model, our paper will present, compare and discuss among two solution procedures that can deal with the fuzzy multi-objective linear programming problems.

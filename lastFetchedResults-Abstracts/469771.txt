Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between prepregnancy maternal body mass index and spontaneous preterm birth and indicated preterm birth.
Study design
This was a secondary analysis of the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network, Preterm Prediction study. Patients were classified into categories that were based on their body mass index. Rates of indicated and spontaneous preterm birth were compared.
Results
Five hundred ninety-seven (20.5%) of 2910 women were obese. Obese women had fewer spontaneous preterm births at <37 weeks of gestation (6.2% vs 11.2%; P< .001) and at <34 weeks of gestation (1.5% vs 3.5%; P = .012). Women with a body mass index of <19 kg/m2 had 16.6% spontaneous preterm birth, with a body mass index of 19 to 24.9 kg/m2 had 11.3% spontaneous preterm birth, with a body mass index of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 had 8.1% spontaneous preterm birth, with a body mass index of 30 to 34.9 kg/m2 had 7.1% spontaneous preterm birth, and with a body mass index of â‰¥35 kg/m2 had 5.2% spontaneous preterm birth (P< .0001). Indicated delivery was responsible for an increasing proportion of preterm births with increasing body mass index (P = .001). Obese women had lower rates of cervical length <25 mm (5% vs 8%; P = .012). Multivariable regression analysis confirmed a lower rate of spontaneous preterm birth in obese gravid women (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.83; P = .003).
Conclusion
Obesity before pregnancy is associated with a lower rate of spontaneous preterm birth.

market acuity, a model for operational agility is presented and tested
in this research to improve competitive activity in the electronics
industries of Iran. Regarding the objective, this research is applied

population of the research consists of company managers in the
electronics industries and the sample size, based on Kendal formula, is
332, selected by random sampling method. Path analysis and structural
equations modeling were used to test the research model. The findings
confirm the research model. Based on the results, it is concluded

The most common approach to decision making in muIti-objective optimisation with metaheuristics is a posteriori preference articulation. Increased model complexity and a gradual increase of optimisation problems with three or more objectives have revived an interest in progressively interactive decision making, where a human decision maker interacts with the algorithm at regular intervals. This paper presents an interactive approach to muIti-objective particle swarm optimisation (MOPSO) using a novel technique to preference articulation based on decision space interaction and visual preference articulation. The approach is tested on a 2D aerofoil design case study and comparisons are drawn to non-interactive MOPSO.

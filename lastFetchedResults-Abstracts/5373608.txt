Design problems are often solved by a group of designers with different expertise and background knowledge. These various concerns may cause conflicts among the designers. Thus, resolution of these conflicts frequently relies on some form of negotiation. This paper proposes a general framework for modeling collaborative design via fuzzy constraint-based agent negotiation. In this framework the individuals involved in the design process are viewed as agents. Fuzzy constraints are used to define each designerÂ´s demands involving concepts, and preferences. A collaborative design process is formulated as a fuzzy constraint-based agent negotiation. The objective of the model is used to effectively handle the design conflicts and achieve time-acceptable, high-quality and customer-oriented product. An example application to design a PC chassis is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

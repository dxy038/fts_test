Describes briefly a dynamic multi-path routing algorithm that has been considered for connection oriented asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. The scheme takes advantage of cell multiplexing capability that has particular advantage in the network supporting the variable bit rate (VBR) traffic. The fundamental objective of the scheme is to propose a congestion control based scheme that bridges the gap between routing and congestion control as the network becomes congested. The proposed routing scheme works as a shortest path first algorithm under light traffic conditions. However as the shortest path becomes congested under unbalanced heavy traffic, the source uses multiple paths when and if available in order to distribute the calls and reduce cell loss. This mechanism will provide the clients for good quality of service within the given constraints. The authors compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the other competitive schemes. The throughput and cell loss performance are compared via simulations. These have been carried out concentrating on a 5 node network

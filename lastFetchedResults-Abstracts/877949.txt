The mathematical formulation and analysis of an optimal control problem associated with a viscous,
incompressible, electrically conducting fluid in a bounded three-dimensional domain with fixed perfectly
conducting boundaries is considered. The objective of control is the matching of the velocity and magnetic
fields to given target fields; control is effected through distributed mechanical force and current controls.
The existence of optimal solutions is shown, the Gâteaux differentiability for the magnetohydrodynamic
system with respect to controls is proved, and the optimality system is obtained.

The authors aim to determine the structure of a complex convertor in as systematic a manner as possible. This procedure is described in the context of two-quadrant reversible resonance DC-DC convertors with natural switching, with the objective of deducing the structures of convertors able to supply a load of unknown power factor. After presentation of the various topologies arising from this synthesis, and an exposition of the principles of control of such structures, a method of graphical analytic study of these convertors is implemented which enables the operating characteristics to be determined

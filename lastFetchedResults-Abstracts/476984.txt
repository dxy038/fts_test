The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of different concentration of salicylic acid on enhancement germination characteristics of Sanguisorba minor L. under salt and drought stress. The experimental design was factorial arranged in a completely randomized block design with four replications. Treatment were combination of 5 levels of salt and drought stress, separately (0, -0.3, -0.6, -0.9 and -1.2 Mpa) and 4 concentration of salicylic acid (0 as a control, 100, 200 and 300 mg/lit). The results revealed that all germination characteristics decreased by increasing strength of salt and drought stress but treated seeds showed lower decrease. Application of salicylic acid increased germination percentage and rate and also decreased mean germination time significantly, but had no effect on root, shoot and seedling length. Since 200 and 300 mg/lit concentrations of Salicylic acid had more effect than the 100 mg/lit on germination attributes, on the other hand no significant difference was observed between 200 and 300 mg/lit concentrations. Considering the economic issues and also considering this fact that higher concentrations of salicylic acid may lead to accelerated stress in plant, 200 mg/lit salicylic acid concentration was suggested in S. minor in order to improve germination and seedling establishment under salt and drought stress.

Smartphones include features that offers the chance to develop mobile systems in medical field and one of the most common examinations is the electrocardiogram (ECG). The objective of this study was to develop a wireless reconfigurable embedded system using a FPAA for the acquisition of ECG signals, and an application showing and storing these signals on Android smartphones. The application also performs the partial FPAA reconfiguration. The parameters tested in the acquisition circuit and the quality of ECGs registered in an individual were satisfactory.

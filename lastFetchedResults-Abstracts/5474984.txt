Environmental awareness continues to rise, and customers of all types are realizing the importance of eco-friendly products which are essential to protect our planet. Green design rules are needed to support the implementation of environmental features in the practical design situation. Green design or Design for Environment (DfE) is a field of product design methodology that includes tools, methods and principles to help designers reduce environmental impact. The main objective of this work is to compile a set of DfE principles that are useful during the design process. Later the trends of Green Manufacturing in Bangladesh are studied. Today, many industries in Bangladesh are aware of green design and implementing DfE principles. The present situations about the Green Design trends in some of the leading consumer goods manufacturers, Unilever Bangladesh, PRAN-RFL Group and Rahimafrooz were studied. Moreover the GovernmentÂ´s recent initiatives concerning DfE are discussed in this article. Though the list of compiled DfE principles is based on best practices, further work is needed to expand the list.

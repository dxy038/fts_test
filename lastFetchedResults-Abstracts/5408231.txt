In this paper, we investigate the design and the implementation of dynamic optical bursts grooming in segmented-based traffic OBS networks. The objective is to aggregate into one burst, different overlapping short bursts which are transmitted to the same destination. This process is executed at the grooming unit of the core node. We propose a design and a physical implementation of this unit based on the Virtual Optical Memory (VOM&#169;) component. The VOM is a RAM-like memory which is used for temporal storing of data segments. Moreover, a signaling scheme and a grooming control module are developed in order to manage the grooming operation. In addition, a dimensioning framework is carried out and a performance study is performed in order to evaluate the grooming process according the grooming factor, VOM capacity, and maximum storing period.

An optimization algorithm for preform die shape design in metal-forming processes is developed in this
paper. The preform die shapes are represented by cubic B-spline curves. The control points of the B-spline
are used as the design variables. The optimization objective is to reduce the di erence between the realized
and desired  nal forging shapes. The sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the design variables
are developed in detail. The numerical examples show that the optimization method and the sensitivity analysis
developed in this paper are very useful and the design results are satisfactory. Importantly, the preform die
shapes designed by this method are easily manufacturable and can be implemented in practical metal-forming
operations. This optimization method and the sensitivity analysis can also be applied in the preform design
of complex industrial metal-forming problems.

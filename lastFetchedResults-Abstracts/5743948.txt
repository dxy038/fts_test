In the last decades the complexity of software development projects had a significant increase. This complexity emerges from the higher degree of sophistication in the contexts they aim to serve and from the evolution of the functionalities implemented by the applications. The Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), a document review investigation has taken place with the objective to compare SOA development with two highly used agile software development methods: Extreme Programming (XP) and Relational Unified Process (RUP). The motor behind this investigation is to see if this agile development methods are capable enough to design effectively and efficiently SOA type applications. The investigation concluded that both methodologies are not exactly suited to create SOA applications, but RUP has a greater chance to provide SOA type applications if the proper adjustments are made, specially on the design side of the methodology.

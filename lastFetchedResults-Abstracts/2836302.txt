As the substantial inverters of micro power supply and large amount of nonlinear loads in micro-grid, the harmonic problem is more and more prominent. This paper presents a harmonic suppression method using passive power filter (PF) and active power filter (APF) for micro-grid. According to the characteristics of microgrid and the influence of harmonics on two operation modes, a mathematical model is built considering economy and effect of filters as the optimal objective. Then an optimal configuration of filters in the micro-grid is given through optimizing by the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Simulations and analysis are provided showing the validity of the proposed method.

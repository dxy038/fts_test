Currently, the way that computers communicate has been changed, such as the increased management cost and the decreased performance. In order to resolve the problem, IT companies often outsource their part function to service providers. Many services require a similar infrastructure, therefore, we design a generic resource pool in which many services can share these resources. For this purpose, the first step is to propose a new dynamic and distributed algorithm for allocating resources to a set of services. Additionally, the proposed algorithm takes into account server resources (CPU and memory) and network related resources (delay and bandwidth), and the distributed algorithm takes CPU and bandwidth as the variables for the objective function. And it aims at maximizing the satisfied demand. Based on the distributed algorithm, the percentage of the satisfied demand is maximized. New algorithm is then used to do service placement and server selection.

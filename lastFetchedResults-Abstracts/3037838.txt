The optimal resource allocation policy is studied in this paper, for nonreal-time users in CDMA reverse link. The resource allocation policy of interest includes channel coding, spreading gain control and power allocation under the conventional receiver operation-multiuser detection technique is not considered. The constraints in the optimization include peak transmit power of the mobile station, total received power at the base station and QoS in the form of minimum SINR for each user. The coding and spreading gain control can be separated from the power allocation strategy. Our results show that the optimal power allocation policy depends on the objective function: to maximize the sum of throughput from each user, a greedy policy is optimal where the good users (mobile stations with good radio conditions) transmit with full power, bad users (mobile stations with poor radio conditions) barely achieve their QoS and there is at most one user in-between; on the other hand, to maximize the product of throughput from each user, a fair policy is optimal where the bad users transmit with full power and the good users transmit with powers to reach a common received power level. The fairness of the optimal policy in the latter case makes QoS constraint unnecessary. Furthermore, we have found a unified approach in deriving these optimal policies. This approach can also be applied to other power allocation problems in CDMA reverse link. We also present numerical results on the channel capacity under both objectives and the effect of QoS constraint.

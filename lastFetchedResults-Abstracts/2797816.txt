This paper addresses the safety assessment of an ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) device, namely a transmission line. We assume that both the physical parameters of this transmission line and those of the illumination wave are uncertain. The objective is to assess the probability of occurrence of an extreme event defined in terms of requirements imposed on the current circulating in the line. The work is based on methods of the structural reliability research community. The efficiency and accuracy of the applied methods are compared with reference results obtained by simulations.

The objective of this proposal is to specify the potential of integrating Bluetooth with a wireless network so that it can be used to be the extension of a wireless system to provide building (wireless office) services, universal and multi-media, multi-system, multichannel and multi-session services. The proposed invention includes several parts. First is use of combined ricocheting Bluetooth in buildings so that in-building coverage can be covered through HO. This approach enables the wireless system voice/data taking a free ride on Bluetooth in building. The outdoor window or roof mount wireless gateway (hub with antenna) is responsible for translating wireless voice/data to IP packet and is ready for Bluetooth to relay it to handset/PDA. Certain handshaking algorithms need to be developed so that different wireless systemsÂ´ voice/data can ricochet through Bluetooth seamlessly. The other advantage is to integrate the existing cellular network with the Bluetooth technology to provide HO and roaming among cellular and Bluetooth networks

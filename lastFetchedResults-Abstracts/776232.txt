This study aims to quantify and to model the temperature profile around an absorber tube of a parabolic trough concentrator with
low fluid flow. This study was specifically developed for the solar power plant of the Engineering Institute, National University of Mexico.
This work presents experimental results under saturated conditions and low pressures (1.5â€“3 bar) using water as the thermal and
working fluid for direct steam generation (DSG). The control variable was feed flow. Solar irradiance was used as the restriction variable
because all experimental tests should be developed under very specific values of this variable (for example, I > 700 W/m2). The objective
of this experiment was to study the thermal behavior of a temperature gradient around the absorber tube under steady-state conditions
and with low flow. Additionally, a theoretical analysis was carried out by means of the homogeneous heat conduction equation in the
cylindrical coordinate system using only two dimensions (r, u). The finite-difference numerical method was used with the purpose of proposing
a solution and obtaining a temperature profile. The objective of this theoretical analysis was to complement the experimental tests
carried out for direct steam generation (DSG) with annular two-phase flow patterns for low powers in parabolic trough concentrators
with carbon steel receivers.

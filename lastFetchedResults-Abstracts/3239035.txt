In order to solve the problem of path planning in an environment with many terrains, we propose a method based on interval multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). First, the environment is modeled by the line partition method, and then, according to the distribution of the polygonal lines which form the robot path and taking the velocity´s disturbance into consideration, robot´s passing time is formulated as an interval by combining Local Optimal Criterion (LOC), and the path´s danger degree is estimated through the area ratio between the robot path and the danger source. In addition, the path length is also calculated as an optimization objective. As a result, the robot path planning problem is modeled as an optimization problem with three objectives. Finally, the interval multiobjective PSO is employed to solve the problem above. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

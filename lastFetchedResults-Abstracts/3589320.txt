The combination of command, control, communications, computers and intelligence is known in the military as C<sup>4</sup>I. The naval C<sup>4</sup>I initiative is defining a future architecture that is based on information management with one objective in mind: to bring naval C<sup>4</sup>I to the next level of integration and interoperability in the joint war fighting arena for the advantages it brings to the warrior. We discuss the path we are taking to a more integrated C<sup>4</sup>I (IC<sup>4</sup>I) system. We also discuss what we have done to both define and bound the naval C<sup>4</sup>I universe; where we are on the path to the IC<sup>4</sup>I system; the challenges we face on our way; and how we intend to surmount them

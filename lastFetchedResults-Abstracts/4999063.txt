The auditory selective attention is an inherent ability of human beings, thus the detection of attention in auditory responses can be an important tool for the development of BCI using the hearing. For the practical implementation of these tools is necessary the developing techniques for detection and classification in real-time. In this work we developed an attention index, based on objective techniques for detecting evoked responses that can be applied in real time for classification/detection of selective attention. The results for the attention index developed suggest a lateral modulation of ASSR in attention condition.

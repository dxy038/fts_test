This paper studies the planning issue of distributed generators at different locations. The multi-objective function is normalized to form a minimized optimal function on distribution network cost, when the capacities and the number of distributed generators and the demands at various locations are known. Optimizing placement of distributed generators by applying electromagnetism-like mechanism, the access planning scheme of distributed generators at different locations can be obtained. This paper also compares electromagnetism-like mechanism to genetic algorithm in optimizing placement of distributed generators. The conclusion is drawn that electromagnetism-like mechanism has obvious advantage in operation efficiency and error tolerance in optimal placement of distributed generators.

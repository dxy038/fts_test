The objective of elevator audio playing system mainly concerns the device installed in elevator to provide music, advertisement and notifications. In this paper, GPRS is utilized for mode control and wireless instruction sequence update. As the core of the whole system, STM32 Microcontroller unit can browse and manage the catalog of files in SD card. Additionally, through building-up FAT 16 File System (FS), MCU will manage sound files in player flexibly and conveniently. Thus, the device supports enables three playing modes, namely, by category, by designated order or by random order. Laboratory Experimental result proves that the designed audio playing system is of flexible and stable maneuverability. This system will bring comfortable up-and-down experience to passengers, increase efficiency of elevator management and bring gains to advertiser and elevator service provider.

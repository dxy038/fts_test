A novel intelligent demand side management system is proposed for peak load management in LV residential distribution networks in the presence of plug-in electric vehicles. This method uses low cost controllers with low bandwidth two-way communication, installed in the householdersÂ´ premises and distribution transformers, to manage the peak load while maximizing customer comfort. A multi-objective decision making process is proposed to select the load(s) to be delayed or controlled. The efficacy of the proposed control system in reducing peak load while satisfying customer load objectives is verified by simulation.

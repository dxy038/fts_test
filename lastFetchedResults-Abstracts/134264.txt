Background: The upper GI endoscopy is one of the most important diagnostic methods that makes changes in arterial 02 and hemodynamic disorders.
Objective: To determine the effect of endoscopy on Sao2 and patients' hemodynamic. Methods: In this interfering study 53 patients were randomly chosen. HR, arrhythmia, BPand Sao2 of the patients were measured and recorded before and during endoscopy (when endoscope entered the bulb) and also after it by the researcher.
Findings: During endoscopy the mean of MAP, SBP, HR showed a meaningful increase. SBP in %35.8 of the patients reached to more than 140 mmHg and MAP in %26.4 reached to more than 110mmHg. %81.2 of the patients had arrhythmia of which the most common was tachycardia (%69.8), and also %24.5 were affected with hypoxemia and %34were affected with arrhythmia in the form of extrasystol. Sao2 showed a meaningful decrease during endoscopy.
Conclusion: Upper GI endoscopy has side effects such as hypoxemia and hemodynamic changes.

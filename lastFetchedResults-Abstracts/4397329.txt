The power electronic converters, electric machines, and mechanical loads are key parts of the electric drives systems, and these components are usually modeled and analyzed using specific simulation tools. The overall performances of the electric drives are influenced by system´s interconnected components. One solution, to investigate the interaction between different parts of these multi-domain systems, is to integrate them into only one simulation environment. This paper presents the development of two integrated models of a three-phase induction motor (IM) drive: one, based on d-q machine model using MATLAB/Simulink-Simscape, the second being based on finite element analysis (FEA) motor model using ANSYS Simplorer/Maxwell software. The goal is to analyze the system models capabilities to simulate the faults detection caused by failures of different drive´s components. The motor current signature analysis is used, in this paper, for monitoring the operation of the IM fed through a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) power inverter. Finally, two case studies are presented, one illustrating the effects of a faulty device of the PWM inverter, and the second case demonstrating the influence of the IM´s stator fault. Another objective of this study is to provide users a convenient way of instruction in the area of faults detection and power quality of alternating current (ac) machines and drives.

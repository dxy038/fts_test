Position controllers must handle kinetic energy exchanges during acceleration and deceleration of large inertias. Temporary buffer storage in capacitors is expensive. The system that can manage the power exchange with ease is the integrated controlled-current pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) rectifier/controlled-current PWM chopper link. Bidirectional power is accomplished by bidirectional current flow in the dc link for both modulators. The three-phase currents in the rectifier side are near sinusoidal in waveform at unity power factor. The performance of the system as a position controller in an environment of the sliding mode strategy is studied. The sliding mode strategy offers robust characteristics to the controller.

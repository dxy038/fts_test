This paper investigates how a different orientation layout of the humanoid hip joint rotary axes influences joint power in the particular case of knee and spine bending with additional loads in the hands. The objective is to show that a rotated orientation layout of the hip joints can help to better distribute the power among the hip joints compared with the classical layout - yaw, roll and pitch joints respectively along z-vertical, x-longitudinal, and y-lateral axes of the robotÂ´s body-where the hip joint has to support the entire load. The bending motion is simulated dynamically with different load weights, and with different angles of rotation of the hip joint axes about the x-axis. In addition to power consumption, torque-versus-speed diagrams are also taken into account for the motor sizing process.

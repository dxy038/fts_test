Phenomena in the real world are grouped into two categories: static and dynamic. The static phenomena donâ€™t change with variation of the time but the dynamic phenomenon will do it so. These changes may be occurred in the phenomena property like spatial or geometry. Traffic is a Spatio-Temporal phenomenon because its properties which are referring to some locations on the earth will change in respect to the time variation. Today, due to the development of technology, the management capability of the spatial-temporal phenomenon has been provided in a Temporal Geospatial Information System (TGIS). The objective of this research is study of using TGIS for controlling and coordinating of traffic signals. For this purpose, first, parameters and components for determining traffic condition and coordinating traffic signals are collected. Then based on these data, the structure of the traffic data is determined for entering into a database. This structure determined in such a way that the traffic condition is introduced to the system based on the type of existing traffic behavior. In this study, the dynamic data along with spatial data of street path (static data) are stored and structured based on relational model and Time Stamping Spatial Objects model. With performing relation between these data the instant variations of the traffic condition is determined. Based on these variations the traffic parameters and offset between different intersections are computed and then based on this information the schedule of traffic signals will be implemented with a singular or network method.

A notebook in the software Mathematica is developed here for the analysis of planar multilayer dielectric waveguides with the objective of using it as a didactic computational tool, with a possible inclusion in the electrical engineering package library of this same software. The scattering and guiding phenomena in a given structure are analyzed in the notebook, through the use of the programming facilities of the Mathematica software. The user may thus specify the physical and geometrical parameters to be analyzed or make a choice from a modelÂ´s library that includes periodic structures such as Bragg reflectors and multiple quantum well (MQW) structures

The continuous casting method (CCM) has been designed to obtain low cost silicon wafers. This method has the objective of wafer cost reduction production effect through the installation of a pre-heating zone and a crystal growth and cooling zone separately on both sides of a silicon melting and injecting zone. We have developed the drip-controlled method (DCM) as a casting method for CCM. In DCM, the injection of molten silicon and the crystal growth are carried out simultaneously and the heat of molten silicon is utilized actively as a heat source to control the crystal growth. DCM is the most effective casting method for continuous casting. Batch-type ingots with a size of 320 mm square, height 260-300 mm, were produced by DCM. An oxygen content of 5-15 ppma and a carbon content of less than 5 ppma were obtained throughout the ingots. The cell efficiency yield of more than 13.5% was 80% against the growth direction, with a wafer size of 100 mm&#215;100 mm using our standard cell process. A maximum value was found of 14.3% measured in JQA. The solar cell efficiency, the carrier lifetime and the diffusion length measured in this study showed DCM had an advantage for obtaining one-directional growth and columnar structure

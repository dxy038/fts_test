Photo voltaic (PV) power sources are new, prominent types of power supplies. Due to unreliability of these kinds of sources, it is required to use an Energy Storage device (ES) in conjugation to make a reliable power supply system for loads. This paper proposes a new multi-port DC-DC converter for PV/ES power supply systems in which, due to application of PV/ES power supply systems in urban places, a high efficiency converter with low number of elements and low generated electromagnetic noise is created. To achieve the mentioned features, soft switching operation is incorporated in the proposed converter. A special PWM switching strategy is used to achieve soft switching condition in double input operation mode. The proposed converter is able to operate in bidirectional mode, which allows ES to charge and discharge. A power management and control method is proposed for handling the power between different ports of the converter. Simulation results for a 2kW hybrid power supply system are presented to show different modes of the converter.

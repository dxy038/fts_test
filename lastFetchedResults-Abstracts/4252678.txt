The objective of this paper is to analyze the behavior of sequential machines by experimental means. Experiments are concerned with state-identification to identify the initial and final state of the machine. A computer program is developed which accepts, as input, a state table of Mealy type (any number of states) machine and builds the successor trees and finds the minimized distinguishing, homing, and synchronizing sequences. The program identifies the levels of the nodes and also lists all groups at each successor node of the tree. Additionally, flags are set when a terminal node is reached or a solution is obtained. The program, written in Pascal, is executed on the Vax 11/780 computer.

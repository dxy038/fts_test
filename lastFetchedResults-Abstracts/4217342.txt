The study focuses on optimization of optical networks based on function programmable ROADMs implemented by Architecture on Demand (AoD) under a multi-hour traffic scenario. The objective is to minimize the cost and energy consumption by reducing the number of active modules inside the nodes, and to investigate the impact of network reconfiguration frequency to potential savings and lightpath availability. The results indicate that AoD nodes combined with tailored routing can reduce cost and increase availability with no traffic disruptions during transitions between periods.

Objective: To evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of the high-voltage electrical stimulation for studying proximal conduction of peripheral motor axons in normal subjects, S1 radiculopathies and acquired demyelinating neuropathies.
Methods: Twelve patients with compressive S1 radiculopathy, 22 patients with acquired demyelinating neuropathy and 29 healthy volunteers were examined. The conduction of peripheral motor axons between lumbosacral roots and the sciatic nerve at the gluteal fold was investigated by high-voltage electrical stimulation delivered percutaneously.
Results: The main electrophysiological finding in S1 radiculopathy was an abnormal side to side difference in the amplitude of the compound motor action potential by proximal stimulation. Overall, the frequency of abnormalities detected by using high-voltage electrical stimulation was similar to that found with conventional EMG studies, and the two methods showed electrophysiological alterations in the same patients. In all patients with acquired demyelinating neuropathy, the proximal motor nerve conduction velocity from lumbosacral roots to the sciatic nerve at the gluteal fold was reduced; proximal stimulation of the motor axons revealed electrophysiological abnormalities more often than when using other electrophysiological techniques (F wave and H reflex).
Conclusions: High-voltage electrical stimulation of peripheral motor axons shows high sensitivity in detecting proximal neuropathies; it can also define the site and relevance of proximal lesions in the peripheral nervous system better than other conventional techniques.

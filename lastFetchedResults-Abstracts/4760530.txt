Self-organizing network is a new capability envisioned for the near-future wireless cellular networks. Among the different use cases, here we tackle the coverage optimization with the objective of adjusting the power devoted for the pilot signal as a function of the load of the different small Node Bs (SNBs). The optimization is done with the objective of minimizing the total transmitted power for the pilot signals in the network, leading to a switch on/off SNBs solution as a particular case. In this paper we present a decentralized algorithm that is executed at UEs and SNBs, exploiting the messages reported by UEs.

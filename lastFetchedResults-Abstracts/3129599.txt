An accurate and highly-efficient performance analysis approach is extremely important for the early-stage designs of network-on-chip. In this paper, the novel M/G/1/N queuing models for generic routers are proposed to analyze various packet blockings and then the performance analysis algorithm is presented to estimate some key metrics in terms of packet latency, buffer utilization, etc. For single-channel and multi-channel routers, the comparisons between analysis and observed results validate that the proposed approach with mean errors of 6.9% and 7.8% achieve the speed-ups of 240 and 210 times respectively. In our design methodology, this approach can not only effectively direct NoC synthesis process but also be conveniently applied to multi-objective optimizations to find the best mapping solutions.

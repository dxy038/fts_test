This paper presents a performance study of a low power non-coherent multi-band IR-UWB system based on energy detection for future wireless high data rates communications. The studies presented in this paper are based on the statistical multipath model of the UWB channel proposed by the IEEE 802.15.3a task group. A new simple model of the received signal is proposed. The main objective of this model is to evaluate the effects of combinations between paths in the propagation channel. The statistical characterization of the received signal and that of its energy were given for a system based on energy detection. The communicating system performance was evaluated in terms of average channel capacity and data rate. The obtained results permitted us to evaluate the advantage of the frequency demultiplexing approach adopted for the MB-OOK UWB transceiver.

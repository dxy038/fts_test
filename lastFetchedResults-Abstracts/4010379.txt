Pulse charging and pulse discharging have been reported by many authors in the literature to improve the performance of various secondary electrochemical cells. Only a few authors mentioned the effects of such charge and discharge method on lithium-ion batteries. The overall objective of this work is to experimentally investigate the impact of certain current pulse profiles on the electrical performance of Li-ion batteries. The results highlight a detrimental impact of periodic pulses on the cell performance compared to profiles with constant current.

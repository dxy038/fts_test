Objective: In this study the Structured Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders (SCIDI) was translated into Persian using a cross-cultural methodology, and its reliability and feasibility was tested in a multi-center study. Method: The study had two phases: a) translation of the instrument and assessing the cross-cultural equivalence, including forward and backward translation, and face validity of the translated version in regard with cross-cultural characteristics; b) reliability and feasibility assessment of the Persian translation on an Iranian clinical population. This is part of a larger study on validation of the SCID on 299 subjects admitted to outpatient and inpatient services of three psychiatric centers (Roozbeh Hospital, Imam Hossein Hospital and Iran Hospital) in Tehran, Iran. For test-retest reliability assessment, two SCID interviews (3 to 7 days apart) were administered to 104 subjects and the level of diagnostic agreement was assessd. Feasibility for interviewees (n= 299) and interviewers was tested by questionnaires considering the length of interview, its being boring/tiring, comprehensibility and acceptance of the questions, and difficulty of administration. Results: Diagnostic agreement of SCID test and retest were fair to good for most diagnostic categories (kappas over 0.6). Overall weighted kappa equaled 0.52 for current diagnoses and 0.55 for lifetime diagnoses. Most interviewees and interviewers reported the administration of the Persian SCID as feasible. Conclusion: Acceptable reliability of diagnoses made by the Persian translation of SCID, and its feasibility suggest it as a useful diagnostic instrument in clinical, research, and educational settings.

The clutch, a key transmission part, secures a crucial role especially to torsional oscillation in an automobile. Based on the influence of stiffness and damping to transmission system, optimization model of clutch torsional damper was given combined with DST240 series clutch which is used in some domestic automobile, and objective function was optimized. Torsional oscillation work condition of transmission system was improved after that. The practicability of optimal method is testified by the analysis results.

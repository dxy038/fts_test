The main objective of this study is to identify an indicator for the assessment of institutional thickness amongst various possible proxy measures in the Turkish context. Data for the creation of this indicator were collected at the provincial level after theorizing about studies of institutional thickness. The database includes the amount of public investment, the amount of investment incentives, the amount of municipality expenditure, the number of SMEs investment incentive certificates, the number of NGOs, the number of public buildings, the public knowledge creation variable, and the collaborative knowledge creation variable of Turkey. These variables are correlated and examined by taking their component and rotated component matrixes of them. The public knowledge creation indicator is identified as the most significant variable to describe the Turkish institutional setting. However, some commonly thought indicators remain insignificant in the analysis which raises the importance of country specific analysis.

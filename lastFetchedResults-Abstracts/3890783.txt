Presents a method of measurement of blood vessel characteristics for disease detection based on cone-beam CT images. The important objective here is to show how representation of blood vessel morphology can lead to feature measurement and identification of abnormal regions. The authors represent the blood vessel surface through curvatures and then measure the surface characteristics that emphasize disease such as aneurysm and stenosis. From results of an application to a patient´s abdominal blood vessels containing two aneurysms and one stenosis, the authors show the feasibility of their method to direct the physician´s attention to the location of the abnormality

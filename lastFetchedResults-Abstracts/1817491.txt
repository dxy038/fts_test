Late-gestation (embryonic day 18; E18) mouse submandibular glands (SMG) comprise a network of large and small ducts that terminate in lumen-containing, presumptive acini (terminal buds) expressing unique, cell membrane-associated embryonic mucin. The objective here was to clone and sequence embryonic low molecular-weight SMG mucin, predict its secondary structure, and begin to investigate its possible role in SMG development. Evidence was found that: (1) embryonic low molecular-weight mucin is an alternatively spliced Muc10 gene product, 220 amino acids in size (approximately 25 kDa), rich in potential O-glycosylation sites, and variably glycosylated (approximately 40 and 68 kDa); (2) consensus secondary-structure prediction for embryonic low molecular-weight mucin is consistent with a molecule that is anchored to the plasma membrane, directly or indirectly (via a glycolipid), and has a protein core that serves as a scaffold for carbohydrate presentation; (3) embryonic l-selectin is immunolocalized to the plasma membrane region of terminal-bud epithelial cells in a pattern similar to that seen for embryonic mucin; (4) embryonic, but not adult, mucin is able to bind l-selectin and does so endogenously in E18 SMG. As the primary role of l-selectin is to mediate cell adhesion and its ligands are mucin-like glycoproteins, it is suggested that this embryonic low molecular-weight mucin be termed MucCAM.

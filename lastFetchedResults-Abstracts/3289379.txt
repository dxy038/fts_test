This paper focuses on the problem of multi-objective reconfiguration of distribution networks taking into account the reduction voltage sags. The proposed methodology based on genetic algorithms finds the optimal reconfiguration for networks which have a radial topology, considering the expected occurrence of voltage sags reduction and also the real power losses; furthermore, the electric distribution system is represented as a graph, and the population is generated by providing the mesh information of the system. Case studies are presented for the IEEE 69-bus test network, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented methodology.

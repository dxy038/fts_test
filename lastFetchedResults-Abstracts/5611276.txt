We are evolving into a society with increasingly acute levels of natural disaster risks which are problems that we can do something about. Natural disaster risk communication (NDRC) is the only way to achieve the overall objective of natural disaster risk reduction strategies. In this paper, the term NDRC is firstly defined. Then an NDRC framework based on two-way communication, which outlines the primary elements as stakeholders, messages, platforms, and settings, is proposed and formulated. Finally, the targets and challenges of researches and practices on NDRC are attempted to list and outline.

In this paper, we investigate the higher order Cohen-Grossberg-type bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with time delays. By using Laypunov-Kravsovskii functional and homeomorphism theory, some new sufficient conditions are established for the existence and global exponential stability of a unique equilibrium without strict conditions imposed on self regulation functions. Finally, an example and its simulations are presented to illustrate the global exponential stability of the equilibrium.

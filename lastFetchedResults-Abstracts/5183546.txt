We propose a methodology which applies a multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm, the NSGAII, in order to design transparent optical networks, aiming to minimize simultaneously the total cost to build the network, the blocking probability and the energy consumption during operation. The optimizer provides a set of non-dominated solutions and, after that, the designer can decide which solution is more suitable for a specific case. We believe these three different important aspects must be taken into account during the design process. However, just some few papers tackle energy consumption from a physical network design perspective. Besides, to the best of our knowledge, none of the previous presented proposals consider all these issues simultaneously.

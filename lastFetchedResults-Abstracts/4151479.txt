In this correspondence, a minimum-mean-square-error bidirectional successive detection (MMSE-BSD) technique is proposed to mitigate the effects of interferences caused by time difference of arrivals (TDoAs) in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based on orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). The proposed BSD technique can successfully reduce the error propagation phenomenon in successive detection with low computational complexity by exploiting the subframe structure used in WMNs. It is shown by simulation that the proposed MMSE-BSD technique is robust to multipath channels and can be effectively used in asynchronous OFDMA-based WMNs.

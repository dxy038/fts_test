To have a systematic synthesis and galvanic isolation, it is common to use a full-bridge bidirectional DC-DC converter which is sometimes called dual active bridge. A comparative evaluation of full-bridge based bidirectional DC-DC converter is presented in this paper. Basic operation, control algorithm, advantages and disadvantages of several types of bidirectional converters are explained.

The current status of Chinese question answering system (QA) was introduced in the paper firstly. QA is the study on the methodology that returns exact answers to natural language questions. This paper attempts to increase the speed of the system responding to the users and accuracy of QA systems. To achieve this objective, the processing includes: Firstly, it introduces the conceptual theory and parts of intelligent question-answering system in detail. Secondly, it researches the Chinese word segmentation algorithm and its relevant technology. Thirdly, it puts forward the method of calculating sum of word frequency based on the whole sentence. It makes a better improvement for processing the problems. Fourthly, it brings forward the classification problem of specific fields, which is convenient for result matching according to the kind of problem of the system. In the end, this system completes the results extraction by calculating the weight. On the basis of theory and algorithm mentioned above, a question-answering system in the course ASP.Net field is implemented.

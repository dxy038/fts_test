Ubiquitous computing is considered as a promising technological path of innovation. Intensive R&D activities and political strategies are addressing the objective to foster marketable technologies and applications. This article explores the state-of-the-art on the way towards the “Internet of things”. Which application fields have already proved their potential for realising the vision and promises related to the new technology? What are the technical, legal and social challenges that have to be addressed – and how can policy-makers contribute? We deal with these questions in the light of recent developments in research and business, illustrating the findings by examples in retail, logistics and health care. The article concludes that further efforts by all stakeholders from businesses, society and politics are necessary to make ubiquitous computing applications economically sustainable and socially compatible in order to tap its full potential.

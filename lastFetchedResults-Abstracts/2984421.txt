In this paper, the adaptive field oriented control of an induction motor drive is proposed. The adaptive scheme use a fuzzy logic scheme for the identification of the rotor time constant, which is used to adjust the estimate of the slip angular speed. The identification method is presented as an optimization problem where the objective function is defined as the total square error between the motor and the commanded stator currents. Past convergence is achieved by using adaptive step size of the ratio between the motor and reference rotor time constant. Computer simulation results are obtained and the performance of the resulting field oriented controller is analyzed

Objective(s): This study was aimed at investigating the synergy effects of Aloe vera gel and silver nanoparticles on the healing rate of the cutting wounds. Materials and Methods: In order to determine the concentration of silver nanoparticles in Aloe vera gel, the MBC methods were applied on the most common bacteria infecting wounds, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cutting wounds with Full-thickness skin were dorsally created on rats; then the rats were divided into 4 groups. The treatments groups included: mixture of Aloe vera gel and silver nanoparticles, Aloe vera gel alone and silver nanoparticles alone in addition to control groups. The treatment was carried out for 2 weeks and the size of the wound closures were measured by an image software analysis. Results:There was no significant difference (p<0.05) in healing rate between the control and mixture group. However, there were significant differences between the silver nanoparticles and Aloe vera groups using Tukeyâ€™s analysis on the 6th, 8th and 10th days. Conclusion:The Aloe vera gel increased the rate of wound healing whereas the silver nanoparticles had a delay effect; and when they were mixed, it was similar to the average effect of both Aloe vera gel and silver nanoparticles.

Many companies still do not achieve the success rates they desire with new product introductions to the market. A method has been developed to aid companies to self-evaluate their product development processes (PDP). The method meets an identified need for a non-prescriptive procedure to evaluate an existing or proposed PDP at a detailed level, both in the context of the companyâ€™s own products, processes, procedures and markets, and in the context of accepted good practice.

The specification and development of the process and facilities needed for the manufacture of a product are identified as fundamental generic issues within the PDP that must be handled effectively to achieve successful product outcomes. The paper describes the main constructs of the evaluation method in relation to manufacturing issues, and presents results and findings from trials conducted in industry. It is seen that great care is needed to ensure that company practitioners make objective assessments of the important factors. Further work is planned to develop the method as an interactive computer tool and to conduct more trials.

In this paper we propose a methodology based on an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm, called NSGA-II to design the topology and define the devices for both all-optical and translucent optical network. We aim to define the topology layout and the specification of the optical devices that should be deployed in the network in order to minimize simultaneously the total installation cost of a communication network (CapEx) and the total network blocking probability (performance criterion). To accomplish that, we propose a capital cost model for the network. We considered the following physical layer impairments: losses in optical devices, amplified spontaneous emission in optical amplifier and homodyne crosstalk in optical cross connect, polarization mode dispersion and residual dispersion. Our proposed methodology can solve the network topology design problem taking into account the physical layer impairments and the capital costs simultaneously. We also present a case study to show the effectiveness of our methodology to define the degree of transparency of the network.

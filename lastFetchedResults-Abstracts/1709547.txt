BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Premature birth is a special experience for mothers. Separation of mothers from their neonates before the determined time due to preterm labor and hospitalization in NICU associated with many physical and mental consequences for them and makes major changes in their life. This study was carried out in order to more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon and aimed to describe the mother’s experience of premature birth.
METHODS: The present study was a qualitative study with the content analysis approach. The data collection was conducted with 15 unstructured and in-depth interviews with the mothers having premature birth during 2012-2013 in medical educational centers in the North and Northwest of Iran. A purposive sampling method was used in this study. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and finally analyzed using a qualitative content analysis with a conventional method.
FINDINGS: Data analysis led to extraction of continuum of separation in mothers of premature birth. This theme revealed in mothers by three categories of separation include: infant- mother, family-mother and social-mother. Analysis of the participant’s experiences showed that the extension of mother's aloneness is greater and longer in the first days of birth and gradually overtime, it is decreased and separation from the infant would be changed to separation from family, wife, relative and friends, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, mother's separation during the process of infant care, is not limited to hospitalization of premature infant, therefore it should be paid attention to continuum and progression of separation. Also, according to the needs of these mothers, appropriate interventions should be designed.

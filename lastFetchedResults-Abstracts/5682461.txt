In this paper we present results from subjective tests done on a data base of distorted images where the distortion took the form of additive colored Gaussian noise. The results from these tests give further support for a filter bank model of the human visual system. The results also suggest that coding schemes employing noise-shaping techniques can give better results than ones that do not. An objective quality measure LINLNSNR is developed based on the subjective evaluations which correlates well with human performance.

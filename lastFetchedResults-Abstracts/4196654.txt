Many implementations of visual tracking have been proposed since many years. The lack of standard evaluation process has prevented fair comparison between them. In this paper, we simply propose to evaluate different particle filter methods in people tracking applications. We introduce an objective metric and give results according to different parameter variations. Finally, based on our evaluations, we can propose a new particle filter configuration that outperforms other current implementation.

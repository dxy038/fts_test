This paper addresses the optimal management of hydropower resources on medium term. The objective is to maximize the expected revenue of a producer, and the decision variables are generation and forward contracts in each period for each scenario. Stochastic linear and nonlinear programming has been used as a framework for modeling and solution. Results are exposited for a Norwegian power producer participating in Nord Pool, the Nordic power exchange.

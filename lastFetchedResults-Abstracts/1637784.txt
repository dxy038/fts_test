A partially bonded strengthening approach for reinforced concrete (RC) beams utilizing near-surface-mounted (NSM) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars was investigated with the specific objective of improving deformability. A total of six RC T-beams strengthened with NSM CFRP bars of various unbonded lengths were tested. Test results showed a decrease of the stiffness at the post-yield stage of the loadâ€“deflection response in the partially bonded beams. This is caused by the delayed increase of the FRP strain within the unbonded length. As a result the beam deformability was increased as the unbonded length increased at the same applied load. Internal slip of the FRP bar and gradual concrete failure were observed near the ultimate state, which caused a complicate nonlinear behavior of the beams. An analytical model is proposed to address the complete beam behavior including the effect of slip of FRP reinforcement and gradual concrete crushing. This model was developed based on the compatibility of deformation of the partially bonded system and was able to represent the ultimate behavior of the beams well.

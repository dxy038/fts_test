The novel compact folded Yagi antenna, for its high gain and superiority in small size, is being interested in various electromagnetic application areas. But for its complex structure, as well as the strong coupling among the elements, making the optimization and design rather difficult. In this paper, the impact of multi-scale semi-solutions to the final performance of antenna is taken into account, a genetic algorithm applied to the multi-objective optimization of folded Yagi antenna is realized. To illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm, a three-element double-folded Yagi antenna is designed and fabricated, the measurements show good results in gain (7.40dBi) and perfect match in impedance (49.87-j0.49&#937;), which fully verify the reliability of the algorithm.

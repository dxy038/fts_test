In order to foreseen, within the next decade, the traffic at busy airports, the main objective is to automate all the ground motions from the gates to a given position of the runway exit in the near future. To this purpose, it is therefore first given the modeling of the automated vehicles in order to determine the control strategies. In this work, which is the first stage of a project referenced hereafter, simulation results are given to show the obtained performances of the system.

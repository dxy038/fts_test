This paper discusses about vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services such as reactive power compensation and harmonic elimination by employing the converters used in electric vehicle charging stations (Smartparks) as shunt active filters (SAF). Batteries can be charged using the bidirectional converters during off peak hours. The parks can supply stored energy to the grid if they have excess solar energy for charging and also support the grid by providing compensation. By incorporating modified ICos&#934; algorithm the complete simulation of hysteresis current controlled voltage source converter (VSC) acting as a Smartpark is presented. For inductive and non-linear loads simulations have been performed in Matlab under steady state and transient conditions. The feasibility of this simple and efficient controller to be used as SAF is demonstrated by the simulation results.

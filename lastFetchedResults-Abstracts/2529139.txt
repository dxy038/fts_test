
Objective: In recent years, interpersonal relationships have become more complex and
increasing number of people suffers from seclusion and loneliness. Early maladaptive schemas
(EMSs), important cognitive structures, are expected to have a profound effect on interpersonal
relationships. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between EMSs and
interpersonal problems among university students. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional correlational study. A total of 150 female students
selected using snowball sampling method out of Rasht universities and completed the Short
Form of Young Schema Questionnaire (SF-YSQ) and the 64-item Inventory of Interpersonal
Problems (IIP-32). For data analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient test and stepwise
regression were administered. SPSS-20 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Results showed positive significant correlations between EMSs’ domains, especially
the domains of disconnection/rejection and impaired autonomy and performance with
interpersonal problems. Conclusion: Given the important role of EMSs in interpersonal relationships, and the significant
role of interpersonal relationships in psychological adjustment, further investigations on this
field seem necessary.

A novel approach to video coding at very low bit rates is presented, which differs significantly from most of previous approaches, as it uses a spline-like interpolation scheme in a spatiotemporal domain. This operator is applied to a non-uniform 3D grid (built on sets of consecutive frames) so as to allocate the information adaptively. The proposed method allows a full exploitation of intra/inter-frame correlations and a good objective and visual quality of the reconstructed sequences

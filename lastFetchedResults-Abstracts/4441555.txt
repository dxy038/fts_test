The objective of this project is to construct and test a model of the brain, or of a specific region of it. As the brain is more complicated than a simple pattern-recognition perceptron, a dynamic, time-dependent, three dimensional artificial neural network (ANN) has been created for the purpose of most closely simulating the learning and recognition processes. It is of interest to research the effects of different stimulus patterns on learning, as well as different topologies of the neural connections themselves and damage to these connections and neurons. Considering the latter, lateral and feedback connections are implemented and tested along with the feedforward ones. The former, however, is yet to be investigated, but the facilities to explore it have been created

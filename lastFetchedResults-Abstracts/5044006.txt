Summary form only given. We define an Integrated Building Management System as a complex, multi-level, multi-objective, integrated, interrelated and complete intelligent design management information system capable of assisting building design process from the inception phase through management and maintenance phases. The proposed system will combine all different activities during the building and construction design activity. Arguably introducing such a system requires up to a certain degree a change in the working conditions and strategies. While it is true that the introduction of automation into these processes will affect from the one hand the working protocols of building designers and managers; on the other hand these automation processes should also be based on the way in which building design is carried out in the real world. The changes of conditions and possibilities of the building design and management working environments will result from the combination of the two. This paper suggests prerequisites for the realisation and the management of integrated building design environments. It addresses the crucial issues related to the recognition, definition and implementation of advanced technologies in building engineering design with an emphasis on information control and the management of planning process

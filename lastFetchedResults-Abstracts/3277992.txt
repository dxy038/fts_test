Microgas chromatography separation columns typically employ channels with fixed cross sections. In this article, we demonstrate unidirectional microfabricated width-modulated columns (&#956;WMC) that afford improved chromatographic efficiency, resolution and retention times compared to corresponding constant width bidirectional columns. The width of 1m-long, 250 &#956;m-deep &#956;WMC is gradually reduced from 120 &#956;m to 20 &#956;m at 1 &#956;m/cm. The effect of inlet selection (120 &#956;m or 20 &#956;m) on chromatographic performance is also evaluated. Moreover, with our improved fabrication process, multiple serially connected devices are simultaneously coated for the first time with highly-stable silica nanoparticles utilizing layer-by-layer technique thus enabling constant film thicknesses.

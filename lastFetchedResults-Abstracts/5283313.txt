Interference has the strongest effect on the available bandwidth of wireless local area network (WLAN) mesh networks. To mitigate the co-channel interference and improve capacity in multi-channel and multi-interface WLAN mesh networks, an efficient system model based on objective optimization is proposed in this paper, which takes channel assignment, number of network interface cards (NICs) and broadcast routing in consideration. In order to appropriately assign channel, a linear programming formulation is introduced to achieve this objective. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can get better performance than other approach in all cases.

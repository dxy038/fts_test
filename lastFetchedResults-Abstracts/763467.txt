Background and Objective: The aim of this research was to study the correlation between daily stresses and coping styles with mental health in migraine headache patients.
Materials and Methods: The research method was comparative-casual method.  The sample consisted of 60 patients with migraine headaches (30 males and 30 females) as the test group, whom were matched for various criteria including age, educational status, and suffering from headache for at least a two year period.  The control group consisted of 60 healthy school teachers (30 males and 30 female).  The instruments included Lazarousâ€“Folkman Coping Style, Holms-Rahe life stress, and General Health questionnaires.  The data were analyzed with the logistic regression method. 
Results: The results revealed that there was a significant difference between the test and control groups in daily stresses and coping styles (p < 0.001).  Furthermore, the rate of stresses in patients with migraine headache was significantly higher than the normal subjects.  In addition, the rate of emotional styles in patients with migraine headache was higher than normal controls.
Conclusion: There was a negative correlation between daily stresses, emotional styles, and mental health in patients with migraine headache.

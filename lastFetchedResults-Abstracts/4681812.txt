Mathematical model of economic operation in microgrid (MG) is built, in which using fuel costs of micro-resources, maintenance and operation costs, environmental governance costs, and electric charge interactive with main grid as multiple-objective function, comprehensively considering technical performance of the micro-resources, locally available energy resources and load demand. Improved genetic algorithm is used to optimize economic operation of the micro-resources and bi-directional power flow with main grid. In accordance with the result, integrated benefit evaluation is preceded. Integrated benefit evaluation of MG is reflected in the difference between the profit whether MG is used or not. Comprehensive benefit evaluation model is built consisting of user power costs, construction investment of power supply and power grid and environment overhead expenses as evaluation index of user side, power grid, environmentally friendly degree. Through the research of MG system, the simulation outcome shows that the promotion of MG can reduce user power costs, cut down or delay construction investment of power supply and power grid, and improve environmentally friendly degree, in other words, produce favourable combined revenues, which have referential meaning for investment decision of MG.

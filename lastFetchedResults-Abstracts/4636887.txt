Summary form only given, as follows. Geomagnetic disturbances are driven by the interaction of solar wind plasma with the geomagnetosphere, the strength of this interaction depends upon the orientation of the interplanetary transient plasma structures originating from the Sun. In this study two types of interplanetary disturbances, namely magnetic clouds events (MCE´s) and bidirectional events (BDE´s) are taken to study the short-term changes in solar-wind plasma components as well as in geomagnetic field of the Earth has been carried out.

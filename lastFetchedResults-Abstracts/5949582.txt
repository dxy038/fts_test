This paper proposes a new technique of edge detection for inspecting edge and perfection of soldering joint in the pre-amplifier circuit, which is an important part in hard disk drive. Summation of error between the actual value and the measured value from the designed system of several data sets is formulated as the objective function. Genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to find the optimal filter mask which enhances the accuracy of the inspection system. As results indicated, accuracy of the system with the proposed edge detection technique is superior to that of the system with conventional filters. In addition, inspection time of the developed system is much faster than that of human inspection.

Objective: This study assessed the relation of recurrent coarctation and repair in infancy and complications after subclavian flap aortoplasty.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 31 patients who underwent subclavian flap aortoplasty between 1994 and 2004 were evaluated. The median age was 1.3 ±I years, 61.3% of patients were males and 38.7% were females.
The frequency of associated heart malformation was: PDA (77:4%), VSD (29%), AS (19.4%), and MS (9.7%).
Results: The average follow up period was 34 months (1-126 months). The pre-operative median peak gradient was 64±21.5 mm Hg and the post-operative median peak gradient was 15.4±12.8. Recurrent coarctation was seen in one patient (3.2%) in angiography who was treated with balloon angioplasty. Acute arm ischemia or gangrene and left arm malfunction was not seen. There were no paraplegia, bleeding, or chylothorax. The early mortality was 3.2% (1 patient) due to heart failure.
Conclusion: We believe surgical repair for coarctation in neonatal & infantile gives no rise to incidence of re-coarctation and also decreases postoperative complications such as hypertension. Therefore, it should be done as soon as possible. SCFA remains an effective technique for repair of aortic coarctation with excellent results and low morbidity and mortality.

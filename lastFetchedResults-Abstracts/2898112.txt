The hand rehabilitation approach for people who are affected by cerebral apoplexy has been a long-standing issue with researchers worldwide. Currently, scientific research has discovered a way to recover the motor function. Moreover, the sensory function can be recovered by neuroplasticity. Previously, the conventional hand rehabilitation approach only focused on the motor function. Therefore, there is a need to develop an effective hand rehabilitation device to recover both the motor and sensory functions. This research embarked on the configuration setup and evaluation of new hand rehabilitation devices using a mechanical stimulation system. The system has directly led to the stimulation of tactile senses, which can later be used to help patients who lack motor and sensory functions. The work was carried out in four stages comprising the development of a programming algorithm, the design and fabrication of the device and finally, an evaluation of the product and its functions. The objective to develop and fabricate a new robust tactile grasping type stimulator for a hand rehabilitation device has been achieved successfully. The preliminary evaluation on a healthy volunteer was carried out to identify the safety factor in the implementation of hardware and software before targeted patients are used.

This study presents a multi-criteria method used for analysing the quality of an air-conditioned indoor environment. Indoor air flow induced by an actual Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning system was experimentally studied under various conditions. The attention was focused on thermal comfort, acoustical comfort and indoor air distribution by considering spatial statistic studies of comfort indices. The compounded electric power of fan, compressor and pumps was measured in order to get information about energy consumption. A first analysis of these parameters showed that indoor comfort cannot be described by a general law. Thus, to reach the objective of a global approach of comfort by a spatial statistical study of the various discomforts, a multi-criteria analysis based on ELECTRE II method adapted to the comfort of air-conditioned indoor environment was applied. In this way the operating rules for coherent air conditioning systems can be defined, with a requirement for quality of indoor environment.

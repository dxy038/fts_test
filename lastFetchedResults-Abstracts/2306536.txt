The main objective of this study is to measure the total factor productivity (TFP) in Iran manufacturing industries using the Solow's Residual under conditions of the imperfect competition market and non-constant return to scale. Hence, the study has employed the Young and Hsieh approach in order to estimate the TFP of Hall- Roeger technique in 2-digit ISIC Code level. The findings indicate that Manufacture of Non-Metallic Mineral Products; Manufacture of basic metals; Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment and finally manufacture of Food, Beverages have had the highest level of TFP given the Hall- Roeger technique. This is while the Manufacture of transport equipment; radio, television and communications equipment and apparatus; Manufacture of medical, precision and optical instruments, watches-clocks and other watches and  eventually Manufacture of electrical machinery and apparatus have had the lowest level of TFP in the Iranian Industries.

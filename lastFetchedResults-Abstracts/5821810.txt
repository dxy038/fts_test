GPS antennas should cover most of the sky and see as much satellites as possible. The antenna should have a broad radiation beam and low gain. The antenna must be well-matched in the relevant frequencies and be Right Hand Circular Polarized. The key factor in GPS systems for high position accuracy and for short acquisition time is the antenna. It is the objective of this paper to present the requirements from GPS antennas and to describe and compare different antenna types.

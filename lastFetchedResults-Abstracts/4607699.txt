More and more services systems are required to cope with an ever-changing and evolving environment. These changes and evolutions could take place in the usersÂ´ needs and demands, in the capacity and availability of services and providers, in the dimension of time and location, in the physical, systematical and social context of the point of services It has imposed great challenges for both requirements engineering researchers and services engineering researchers to develop useful techniques to bridge the gap between intuitive user objective statements to concrete service policies and constraints that is understandable and implementable by service designers and providers. The panel goal is to discuss requirements engineering strategies and techniques in response to the evolution of services as a computing paradigms as well as a business modelling paradigm.

Objective: Attention deficit ‎hyperactivity disorder in adults ‎‎(adult ADHD) is gaining more ‎attention nowadays. ‎Nevertheless, very few studies ‎have addressed this issue in Iran. ‎The present study was conducted ‎to determine the prevalence of ‎adult ADHD in Tabriz, North-West ‎of Iran‏.‏
Methods: Four hundred urban ‎inhabitants of Tabriz- with an age ‎range of 18 to 45 years were ‎selected through the probability ‎proportional to size cluster ‎sampling in 2009. The screening ‎was performed by Conner's Adult ‎ADHD Rating Scale, and the ‎definite diagnosis of Adult ADHD ‎was performed via clinical ‎interview according to DSM-IV-TR ‎and Wender Utah criteria‏. ‏
Results: The prevalence of adult ‎ADHD was estimated to be 3.8%. ‎Men when compared with ‎women were more likely to have ‎ADHD (5.5 % in men versus 2 % ‎in women). Marital status, birth ‎order, educational level and ‎occupational status showed no ‎significant association with adult ‎ADHD. History of psychiatric ‎treatment, alcohol drinking and ‎smoking had similar relative ‎frequency in subjects with and ‎without adult ADHD‏.‏
Conclusion: The prevalence of ‎adult ADHD in this region of Iran ‎seems to be substantially higher ‎than expected or treated. This ‎would require more attention to ‎be drawn by health sector ‎managers in order to improve the ‎knowledge of the general ‎population and the knowledge of ‎the health care professionals ‎about the disorder.‎

A nonlinear mathematical model is proposed for the simulation of the dynamic behavior of a regenerative single shaft power plant. The objective of the work is to provide a fast and reliable model for the study of dynamic behavior of the power plant and its control system. The model provides a comprehensive description of the power plant under transient conditions caused by electric load variations. The model is also suitable for application to other gas turbine power plants, such as gas-steam combined cycle power plant, steam-injected gas turbines, etc. In this work the main features of the mathematical model are first briefly described; the methodology used in order to derive a simplified linear model and to synthesize a MIMO controller is developed; finally the accuracy of the linear model and the performance of the controller are validated through the comparison of the time domain plots obtained from the linearized closed loop system and the results of the non linear simulations.

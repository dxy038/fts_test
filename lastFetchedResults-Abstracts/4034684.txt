This paper focuses on a new high-frequency (HF) link dc-to-three-phase-ac power converter. The least number of switching devices among other HF link dc-to-three-phase-ac converters, improved power density due to the absence of devices of bidirectional voltage-blocking capability, simple commutation requirements, and isolation between input and output are the integral features of this topology. The commutation process of the converter requires zero portions in the link voltage. This causes a nonlinear distortion in the output three-phase voltages. The mathematical analysis is carried out to investigate the problem, and suitable compensation in modulating signal is proposed for different types of carrier. Along with the modified modulator structure, a synchronously rotating reference-frame-based control scheme is adopted for the three-phase ac side in order to achieve high dynamic performance. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been investigated and verified through computer simulations and experimental results with 1-kVA prototype.

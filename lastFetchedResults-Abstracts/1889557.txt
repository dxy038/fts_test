Background
rpose of this study was to evaluate the subjective and objective outcomes in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty for treatment of postcapsulorrhaphy arthropathy (CA) and compare them with outcomes in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA).
s
shoulder arthroplasty was used to treat 25 consecutive CA patients (25 shoulders) at our institution; of these, 22 patients were available for follow-up. An age-matched cohort of 19 consecutive patients (20 shoulders) who were treated with total shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral OA was compared with the CA group. Patients were evaluated by physical examination and patient outcome measures (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons assessment and Simple Shoulder Test). Complications, reoperations, and subscapularis function was also recorded.
s
ed with the CA group, the OA group achieved greater forward elevation (165째 vs 147째; P = .036) and greater external rotation (56째 vs. 45째; P = .04); however, no significant differences were seen in subjective patient scores between the 2 groups for Simple Shoulder Test (P = .90), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons assessment (P = .65), and pain scores (P = .80). The difference in the number of revision surgeries in the OA group compared with the CA group (1 vs 4) was not significant (P = .35). A significantly higher number of patients in the CA group had subscapularis insufficiency compared with the OA group (5 CA vs 0 OA; P = .049).
sions
ndings suggest that when compared with patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty for primary OA, CA patients experience similar outcomes with respect to revision surgery, pain relief, and subjective self-assessment and have a higher incidence of subscapularis insufficiency.

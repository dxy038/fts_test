The problem of evil is still one of the most difficult problems in religious studies. Though it has a long history in human thought, it can be traced back in theoretical mysticism in Ibn Arabi’s thought in the 7th/14th century. The main question addressed by this study is whether evil is a real existence or a mere absence in Ibn Arabi’s school of thought. If the whole or part of evil is a real existence, then how is it compatible with the Origin of Existence that is perfect goodness? While in philosophy the problem of evil is related to objective existences, in mysticism it is related to the manifestations of existence. Ibn Arabi refutes evil absolutely as it is related to the personal unity of being and the best possible order. However, as far as determinations are concerned he accepts a mere absence as evil in nature adding that there are some sorts of relative evils in creation just as there are some sorts of essential evils in the Law (tashri‘). Quotations related from Qunawi and Fanari confirm these claims. After explaining Aristotle’s view of evil as a mere absence in 11th/18th century, concerning the nature of evil and posing a challenge to it in his Mafatih 
al-Ghayb, Mulla Sadra briefly touches Ibn Arabi’s point of view through relating quotations from Ibn Arabi and Qaysari. After Mulla Sadr?, many scholars have confused between philosophical and mystical views. This much evil is related to the possible aspects, partial capacity (disposition) and potentials of a possible being and eventually to the general capacities of immutable archetypes.

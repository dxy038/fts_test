The increase in negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment has forced many countries to use renewable energy sources, especially wind energy. China is a country which conceals abundant wind energy resources but the utilization of wind energy is limited. In this paper, our objective is to assess wind potential in Fujian Province by selecting two cities, Fuzhou and Shamen, both of which is located in southwest coastal region. The wind energy potential of two cities is statistically analyzed based on 15 years measured daily time-series wind speed data. The probability density distributions are derived from time-series data and distributional parameters are identified. The Weibull two-parameter distribution function is fitted to the measured probability distributions on a monthly basis. The results of this study shows that the Weibull distribution function give an excellent fit to the wind speed distribution and the wind potential of Fujian province is not as optimistic as we expected previously.

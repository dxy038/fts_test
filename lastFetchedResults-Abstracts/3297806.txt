To overcome the shortcoming of low resolution of the matched filtering method when estimating time delays, the WRELAX algorithm of the Nonlinear Least-Squares (NLS) parameters estimation problem is commonly used. However, the computing time of the WRELAX algorithm is long. In this paper, the Scatter Search (SS)-based WRELAX algorithm is applied in underwater acoustical channel computation. Multipath time delay estimation of a CW signal is calculated in Gaussian white noise channel with three SNR conditions of 20dB, 10dB, and 0 dB. Simulation results show that the SS-based WRELAX algorithm reaches a higher resolution than the conventional matched filtering method. Moreover, the SS algorithm can reduce the iteration number a lot comparing with the Gauss-Newton algorithm in the process of searching the minimum objective function value.

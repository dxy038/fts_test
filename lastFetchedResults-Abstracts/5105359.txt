Glaucoma is currently diagnosed by glaucoma specialists using specialized imaging devices like HRT and OCT. Fundus imaging is a modality widely used in primary healthcare. An automatic glaucoma diagnosis system based on fundus image can be deployed to primary healthcare clinics and has potential for early disease diagnosis. A mass glaucoma screening program can also be facilitated using such a system. We present an automatic fundus image based cup-to-disc ratio measurement system; and demonstrate its potential for automatic objective glaucoma diagnosis and screening. It provides strong support to use fundus image as the modality for automatic glaucoma diagnosis.

In model-Driven development (MDD), metamodels, models, and model transformations are interdependent. A change in one artifact must be reflected in all other related artifacts. Regardless of their dependencies, (meta)models and transformations can evolve autonomously rendering referenced artifacts invalid. Coupling the evolution of models to their corresponding metamodels tries to prevent such mismatches, but is currently limited to one-way adaptations and does not take model transformations into account. To eliminate these short-comings, we combine first-class transformation models with bidirectional transformations (BX). Our generic approach integrates BX into well-established Eclipse-based MDD tools, thereby neither being restricted to a specific modeling nor model transformation language.

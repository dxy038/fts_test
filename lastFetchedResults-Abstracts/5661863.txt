In this paper we study the problem of the uplink system throughput maximization while we still maintain fairness among the various users despite their time-varying channel conditions. We first rigorously formulate the corresponding problem as a multi-objective optimization problem with constraints, and then by introducing the concept of power index capacity, we devise a scheduling algorithm that is shown to be optimal, while using the stochastic approximation approach we develop a simple method to adjust the control weights or the users, which is a key element in maintaining fairness. The performance evaluation of our proposed approach reveals the advantages of the proposed technique and demonstrate that it can achieve very high system throughput while maintaining the fairness among various users.

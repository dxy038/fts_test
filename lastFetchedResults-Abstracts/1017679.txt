Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between ultrasonography and electromyography (EMG) measures of abdominal muscles during abdominal hollowing maneuvers when recorded simultaneously during the same contraction in subjects with and without low back pain (LBP).  
Materials & Methods: The thickness of the right transverse abdominis (TrA) ,internal oblique (IO) and external oblique(EO) muscles were measured with ultrasound imaging and muscle activity recorded by surface EMG  in 15 healthy and 15 LBP subjects. 
Results: The results showed no significant relationship between two measures for abdominal muscles during abdominal hollowing maneuvers. The correlation coefficient between thickness alterations and maximum muscular activity for the TrA was 0.27 and 0.11 for the non-LBP and LBP subjects, respectively. This correlation was 0.17 and 0.08 for the internal oblique and 0.17 and 0.07 for the external oblique muscles in the non-LBP and LBP subjects, respectively.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that no clear relationship between increases in abdominal muscle activation and corresponding measures of thickening during abdominal hollowing maneuvers.

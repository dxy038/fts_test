Interpolation is very important in many medical imaging applications. The problems of interpolating low resolution medical images are approached in this paper as an optimization problem. The objective function is derived from Bayesian Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) probability density, which effectively combines the measured low resolution image data with a-priori knowledge of the image property. Solution to the optimization problem produces a zoomed image which resembles the measured low resolution image, but has noise smoothed and blur corrected

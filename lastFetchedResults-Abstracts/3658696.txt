The valve-point loading logic described in this paper is intended to meet at any time in the most economical fashion a generation commitment. This objective is approached by insuring that as great a portion of the load as practicable will be carried by units loaded to valve points, that the remainder of the load will be carried by units reserved for regulation, and that in both categories the assignments will be made to those units which can provide the requisite capacity at the lowest cost.

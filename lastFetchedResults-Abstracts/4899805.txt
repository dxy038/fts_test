Assistive gait devices, such as walking frames, are used by individuals of all ages. Despite this wide utilization, very little is known about the biomechanical stresses sustained by the upper extremities when using these devices. The objective of this short chapter is to present a methodology used to quantify upper extremity joint loads during ambulation with a conventional walker. Data for a standard walking condition are also provided. The authors believe that this technology and knowledge will prove useful to improve the methods of use and the design of walkers. While the authors present data collected in an adult population, this technology can easily be transferred to the pediatric population

In power systems involving a load, a battery and a solar array, MPPT (maximum power point tracking) is a promising principle to extract the maximum amount of energy from the solar array and distribute it to the battery and loads. A digital hill-climbing control strategy combined with a bidirectional current mode power cell is presented that makes it possible to get a regulated bus voltage topology, suitable for space applications, by means of two converters. Theory, simulation, and breadboard validation are successively detailed

The objective of this paper is to define a mathematic model for the dimensioning of LTE Rel-8 network. After describing the mechanisms influencing the dimensioning such us the Scheduling, QOS and LTE capacity, we define the strategy of the planning and the objective function which aim to minimize the number of the base stations and the capacities of the wired links to deploy. The mathematical formulation of the model leads to a linear and mixed problem. CPLEX method based on &#8220;Branch and Cut&#8221; algorithm is used to solve this problem.

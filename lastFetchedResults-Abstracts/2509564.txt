The story of meeting between Moses and one of God's special servants is one of the most astonishing anecdotes of the Quran that has prepared the grounds for Muslim mystics and their esoteric interpretations. One may have two approaches to this story to realize mystical attitude. In the first approach, the wayfaring and practical aspects of the story are the focus of attention. In the second approach, one can interpret and adjust the elements of the story through objective and at time subjective approaches. The present paper is an attempt to follow the first approach to compare the contentions inherent in different interpretations with the trend of the story and other Quranic phrases. Also other mystical aspects of the story and its wayfaring advantages such as adjustment of the three stages of the journey with three stages of monotheism, manners of servitude to God and discarding selfishness as well as attention to esoteric positions, even for the prophets, are also discussed.

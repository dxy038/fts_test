This paper discusses multi-objective optimization issues with the design scenario of an active element in microwave electronics. The Binary Genetic Algorithm and NSGA-II has been discussed in the paper. Multi-objective optimization techniques have already been in used in mechanical component design, truss structure designs, low-thrust spacecraft trajectory designs. The multi-objective issues of LNA design are addressed and solved in the example of this paper. Our proposed application of an optimization technique using GA has been successfully applied to LNAs, optimizing bias conditions at the simulation and design stage. The technique can also be extended to optimizing bias conditions in any active circuit e.g. power amplifiers.

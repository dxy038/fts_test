This paper presents a novel iterative channel exchange algorithm to enhance a previous resource allocation. The objective is the improvement of network throughput in wireless ad-hoc networks by channel exchanges among neighbor nodes. The algorithm makes use of knowledge of channel status and usage, and can be implemented in a distributed manner. Due to the iterative approach, stepwise improvement can be achieved. Two channel exchange algorithms, i.e., a random channel exchange and a non-random channel exchange, which considers channel and node statuses, are investigated. The algorithms are evaluated under a time-invariant channel and network. Numerical results show that the algorithms can improve throughput performance and attain nearly equal performance although the random exchange has less complexity.

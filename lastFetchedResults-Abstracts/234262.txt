The objective of this study was to conduct an experimental analysis to investigate the performance and energy saving of the well-known desiccant air-conditioning system in Thailand. The system was composed of a silica gel bed, a split type air-conditioner (1.5 ton refrigeration) installed in a room of volume 76.8 m3, air ducts and a blower. Its design allows us to adjust the percentages of return air, outdoor air and indoor air mixed to the air leaving the desiccant, and desiccant bed thickness as well. Tests were conducted on several days with relatively similar ambient conditions. Under the test conditions used here, a 5 cm bed thickness is recommended with a maximum adsorption rate of 473 g/h. The optimum percentages of air ratios are as follows: 15% outdoor air, 15% return air (mixed together at the desiccant bed inlet) and 70% of indoor air mixed to the dry air leaving the desiccant. The corresponding electricity saving was about 24%. As expected, simple economic analysis indicated that the desiccant air-conditioning is only viable for large cooling capacities and central air-conditioned buildings. The payback period is about 4 yr.

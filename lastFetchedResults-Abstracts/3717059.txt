Some basic steps in the development of a low-noise monolithic preamplifier system for multielectrode detectors are reviewed. Some of these steps refer to the realization of an effective filter on the monolithic chip. Others were oriented toward arriving at a technology suitable for a low-noise design. A nonhomogeneous monolithic process combining N- and P-channel JFET and N- and P-channel MOS on the same substrate meets the objective. Radiation hardening considerations restricted the design to two device categories only, NJFET and PMOS. As a preliminary result of the effort in the areas of filter design and technology development, a 64-channel preamplifier system for microstrip detectors is described

Investigates the qualitative properties of a class of bidirectional associative memories. Networks are described by a system of first order ordinary difference equations which are defined on a closed hypercube of the state space with solutions extended to the boundary of the hypercube. For the present model, a systematic analysis method is developed to completely characterize a given network, i.e., the distribution of equilibria in the state space, and the stability properties of the equilibrium points. In addition, the authors establish a computationally efficient synthesis procedure utilizing the eigenstructure decomposition method. The applicability of the present results is demonstrated by means of a specific application in flexible structures

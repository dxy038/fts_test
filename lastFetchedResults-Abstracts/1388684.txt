In general, the exact solutions for natural frequencies and mode shapes of non-uniform beams are obtainable only for a few types such as wedge beams. However, the exact solution for the natural frequencies and mode shapes of an immersed wedge beam is not obtained yet. This is because, due to the “added mass” of water, the mass density of the immersed part of the beam is different from its emerged part. The objective of this paper is to present some information for this problem. First, the displacement functions for the immersed part and emerged part of the wedge beam are derived. Next, the force (and moment) equilibrium conditions and the deflection compatibility conditions for the two parts are imposed to establish a set of simultaneous equations with eight integration constants as the unknowns. Equating to zero the coefficient determinant one obtains the frequency equation, and solving the last equation one obtains the natural frequencies of the immersed wedge beam. From the last natural frequencies and the above-mentioned simultaneous equations, one may determine all the eight integration constants and, in turn, the corresponding mode shapes. All the analytical solutions are compared with the numerical ones obtained from the finite element method and good agreement is achieved. The formulation of this paper is available for the fully or partially immersed doubly tapered beams with square, rectangular or circular cross-sections. The taper ratio for width and that for depth may also be equal or unequal.

OBJECTIVE

To assess the relationship between dysglycemi and myocardial infarction in nondiabetic individuals.

BACKGROUND

Nondiabetic hyperglycemi may be an important cardiac risk factor. The relationship between myocardial infarction and glucose, insulin, abdominal obesity, lipids and hypertension was therefore studied in South Asians— group at high risk for coronary heart disease and diabetes.

METHODS

Demographics, waist/hip ratio, fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, lipids and glucose tolerance were measured in 300 consecutive patients with  first myocardial infarction and 300 matched controls.

RESULTS

Cases were more likely to have diabetes (OR 5.49; 95% CI 3.34, 9.01), impaired glucose tolerance (OR 4.08; 95% CI 2.31, 7.20) or impaired fasting glucose (OR 3.22; 95% CI 1.51, 6.85) than controls. Cases were 3.4 (95% CI 1.9, 5.8) and 6.0 (95% CI 3.3, 10.9) times more likely to have an FBG in the third and fourth quartile (5.2–6.3 and >6.3 mmol/l); after removing subjects with diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose, cases were 2.7 times (95% CI 1.5–4.8) more likely to have an FBG >5.2 mmol/l.  fasting glucose of 4.9 mmol/l best distinguished cases from controls (OR 3.42; 95% CI 2.42, 4.83). Glucose, abdominal obesity, lipids, hypertension and smoking were independent multivariate risk factors for myocardial infarction. In subjects without glucose intolerance,  1.2 mmol/l (21 mg/dl) increase in postprandial glucose was independently associated with an increase in the odds of  myocardial infarction of 1.58 (95% CI 1.18, 2.12).

CONCLUSIONS

 moderately elevated glucose level is  continuous risk factor for MI in nondiabetic South Asians with either normal or impaired glucose tolerance.

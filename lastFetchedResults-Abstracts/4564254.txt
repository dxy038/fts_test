In this paper, a design and analysis of compact coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed wideband slot antenna is presented. The proposed antenna has simple structure consisting of rectangular slot, semicircular feeding structure at the anterior portion of the feed and notched ground planes. The notch is introduced to increase the bandwidth value and to attain the better impedance matching condition. The overall dimension of the antenna comes around 19 mm times 20 mm times 1.6 mm and fed by 50 Omega coplanar waveguide. A MoM based electromagnetic solver, IE3D is used for simulation of this antenna configuration. The results show that the impedance bandwidth of the antenna reaches about 65% with return loss better than -10 dB over the chosen frequency spectrum. The proposed antenna gives bidirectional pattern in the E plane and omni directional radiation pattern in the H plane over the frequency range of 5 GHz to 10.3 GHz. This antenna configuration would be quite useful for many wireless applications as it is easy for fabrication and integration with RF circuitry.

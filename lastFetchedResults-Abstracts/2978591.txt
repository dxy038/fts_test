The objective of this study was to compare three model inversion techniques (neural networks (NNT), look up tables (LUT), iterative optimization (OPT)) for the estimation of four main biophysical variables: LAI, C<sub>ab</sub>, f<sub>cover</sub> and f<sub>PAR</sub>. The canopy radiative transfer model used is SAIL coupled with PROSPECT leaf model. Results show that OPT performs better when applied to datasets consistent with the radiative transfer model assumptions used in the inversion approach. Conversely, NNT shows significant improvement when applied to different datasets. The authors observed also large differences in the retrieval performances between the biophysical variables investigated, f<sub>PAR</sub> and f<sub>cover</sub> being better estimated than LAI and C<sub>ab</sub>

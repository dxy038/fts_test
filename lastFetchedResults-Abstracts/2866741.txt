The wire race ball bearings are special type of four-point contact ball bearings, which are mainly used in the cases with special requirements of lower mass and limited space. In this paper, by using the software of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (iSIGHT) combined with the finite element analysis software (ANSYS), the optimization design of a wire race ball bearing used in rotating platform was accomplished by taking dynamic load rating as objective function and the statics, other requests as constraints. The result of optimization shows that the dynamic load rating of wire race ball bearing is increased from 31647N to 42083N.

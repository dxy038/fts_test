The development of a method to assist in diagnosing balance disorders necessitates a study of the interactions between the parameter indicating the instability of the balance mechanism (COP) and the factors that assist in maintaining the balance. Thus, the objective of this study was to establish the existence of correlation between the COP excursions and the muscle activity during balance. A correlation was established between the COP excursions and the gastrocnemius (Ga) and tibialis anterior (Ta) muscle activity at the ankle joint. Further studies need to be performed to quantify this correlation in order to completely understand the balance mechanism of the human body and to determine a method for the diagnosis of balance disorders

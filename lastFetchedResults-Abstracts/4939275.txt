Our work aims at realizing a system which consists in gathering the knowledge and the know-how in the field of fault diagnosis for steam turbines, by the construction of domain ontology. In order to better exploit the ontology and reason using its classes, sub-classes and instances a Case Based Reasoning (CBR) paradigm is chosen, as it offers an ideal solution for diagnostic of real application systems. In the CBR the design of build integrated systems that combine case specific knowledge with models of general domain knowledge is offered by COLIBRI, it is an environment to assist during the design of knowledge intensive CBR (KI-CBR) systems. The paper, therefore, presents a current work which has for objective to develop a CBR application for fault diagnosis based on ontology, by using the API JColibri.

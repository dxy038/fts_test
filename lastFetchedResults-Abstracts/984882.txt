Background: Avermectin B1b, a component of commercially available abamectin is obtained as fermentation product of S. avermitilis and has frequently been used as anthelmintic and insecticidal agent. Secondary metabolite production, avermectin B1b in present study, is dependent on medium composition therefore a proper medium should be designed for the fermentation process in order to have the best production.

Objectives: The main objective of this study was the selection and optimization of medium for maximum production of avermectin B1b from S. avermitilis 41445.

Materials and Methods: Eight different growth media were used for the production of avermectin B1b.

Results: However the maximum production of avermectin B1b (17 mg/L) was obtained by using SM2 growth medium containing soluble corn starch, yeast extract, KCl, CaCO3 and MgSO4 which was detected qualitatively by using TLC and quantitatively by HPLC.

Conclusions: Maximum production was observed with initial medium pH of 7, 10% inoculum size with incubation temperature of 31Â°C for 10 days of fermentation period.

The purpose of total mystics and devotees out of sufferings and difficulties is to achieve divine realities and proximity, the realization of which is not possible except through intuition and introspection. Mysticism and Sufism as a branch of human knowledge is a proper haven for expressing mystics' thoughts and beliefs and causes the emergence of mystical definitions and expressions. The mental, religious, ideological, cultural, and mystical backgrounds of Sufis have been effective in origination of such mysterious words. Those words and expressions used in the talks of Sufis represent their moods and positions, and though sometimes it seems that their talks are different from one another and expressed in a variety of ways, they have had the same purpose to convey.
This paper studies the word "manifestation" and its different types according to the attitudes of some Sufis. Manifestation is one of those expressions that mystics use to indicate the quality of their vision and whatever they receive from the Almighty and His presence in the objective world, and have endeavored to pave the way to get close to God by perceiving their link to the Almighty. Since spiritual journey is something individual and empirical, demonstrating mystics' intakes and perceptions has been achieved in various and similar ways.

Oilfield development plan is an important issue to energy exploitation. In addition to the deterministic and stochastic models brought forward in the past studies, this paper proposes a multi-objective programming model for oilfield development plan, in which parameters are fuzzy variables. In order to solve this model, we use AHP to weigh objective functions and design a hybrid intelligent algorithm integrating fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm. A numerical example is given to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of multi-objective fuzzy programming model and its algorithm.

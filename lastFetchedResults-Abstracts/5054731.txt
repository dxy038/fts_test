This paper discussed about design and characterization of the Inter Digital capacitor. The main objective is to study the effects of width and spacing of the capacitor electrode on capacitance value. Water levels sensors are studied by using Inter Digital Capacitor (IDC) technique on Printed Circuit Board (PCB). IDC technique is used to make the capacitance measurement of the solution became more effective. This paper also presents simulation and experimental data to characterize the sensor. The result shows that the capacitance value is directly proportional to the electrode´s width and inversely proportional to the electrode´s spacing.

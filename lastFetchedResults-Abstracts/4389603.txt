In this paper, we present a new dielectrophoretic microfluidic technique in a modular Lab-on-Chip (LoC) platform. The proposed LoC has a reconfigurable topology. It generates a wide range of signals depending on the analyzed liquid with a variable frequency up to 1.2 MHz. In addition, a programmable phase shift circuit with a minimum phase step of 3.6&#176; for each signal is implemented. The amplitude of each signal can be adjusted independently, and the latter can be distributed through 64 bidirectional electrodes. Each electrode can be enabled or disabled individually. Moreover, device includes capacitive sensing stage for the measurement of the in-channel capacitance change induced by algae. Furthermore, The architecture of the proposed system is versatile and can be adjusted to different cell manipulation applications. The presented LoC was tested with 15 &#956;m algae cells.

In this paper, a low-complexity and high-efficiency scheme is developed for frame rate up conversion (FRUC). Texture based adaptive motion estimation is carried out for improving the accuracy of motion vectors. In addition, the proposed scheme comprises a motion vector post-processing method which corrects the outliers in nine directions. Moreover, in order to deal with the artifacts caused by the problem of overlaps and holes, a simple motion refinement method by calculating motion vectors of overlaps and holes is proposed. Experimental results verify the superiority of our work in both objective and subjective performances compared with conventional methods.

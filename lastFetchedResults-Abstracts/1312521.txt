Droughts, resulting in low crop yields, are common in the semi-arid areas of Ethiopia and adversely influence the well-being of many people. The objective of this study was to assess the benefit that in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) would have, compared to conventional tillage, on maize yields on a semi-arid ecotope at Dera situated on the eastern part of the Rift Valley. Rainfall–runoff measurements were made during 2003 and 2004 on 2 m × 2 m plots provided with a runoff measuring system and replicated three times for each treatment. There were two treatments: conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT), the latter with a flat surface that promotes runoff and therefore IRWH. Rainfall intensity was measured at 1 min intervals with an automatic tipping bucket instrument, and runoff was measured after each rain event. Measured runoff as a function of rainfall intensity and duration from half the rainfall–runoff events was used to determine the critical parameters of a appropriate runoff model. The calibrated model was found to be capable of predicting runoff in a satisfactory way.

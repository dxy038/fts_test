                                                                            <i>Harpagophytum procumbens</i> is a traditional herbal plant belonging to the <i>Pedaliaceae</i> family. This herb is used to treat a wide range of disorders including rheumatism, arthritis, inflammations, gastrointestinal disturbances, hepatic diseases, and anemia. Side effects of this medicinal plant are unknown during pregnancy period.
                                                                                                        Objectives
                                                                            Therefore, the objective of the present research was to evaluate the teratogenic effects and congenital malformation resulting from using <i>Harpagophytum procumbens</i> ethanolic extract in pregnant Balb/C mice.
                                                                                                        Methods
                                                                            In this experimental study, female mice (N = 40) which had successful mating were kept in standard conditions. Then the ethanolic extract of the plant (200, 400, 600 mg/kg) was given to the treatment groups by gastric gavage route on 0 - 14<sup>th</sup> days of gestation. Female mice were euthanized on 18<sup>th</sup> gestation day and each fetus was removed and examined for external malformations. Histopathological studies were done for all fetuses and mice. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance for all groups. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 18 software.
                                                                                                        Results
                                                                            Our results showed administration of <i>Harpagophytum procumbens</i> extract to pregnant mice in dose 600 mg/kg could induce necrosis in liver, kidney and lung of fetuses and pregnant mice but there were no significant structural malformations and abnormalities in body weight and crown-rump length of treated embryos in gross evaluation (P &lt; 0.05).
                                                                                                        Conclusions
                                                                            It seems that administration of <i>Harpagophytum procumbens</i> extract to pregnant mice may cause teratogenic effects and histopathological changes in fetal tissues. Therefore, the use of this herbal medicine should be restricted during pregnancy.

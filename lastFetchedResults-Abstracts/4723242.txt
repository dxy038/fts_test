In a two-inertia motor system with flexible shaft, a torsional vibration is often generated, as a quick speed response close to the primary resonant frequency is required. This vibration makes it difficult to achieve a quick response of speed and disturbance rejection. The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic analysis and a design of a pole placement controller by using the weighted ITAE performance index for a two-inertia motor system. Three kinds of speed controllers (I-P, I-PD, and state feedback) are used. The simulation results show that the full state feedback controller has the best performance compared to other controllers in terms of oscillation and settling time. The proposed controller is expected to be the standard for controlling a two-inertia motor system with flexible shaft

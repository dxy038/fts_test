Objective
This study was undertaken to assess if levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-8, sialidase, prolidase and immunoglobulin A against Gardenerella vaginalis hemolysin (anti-Gvh IgA) in vaginal secretions differ between BV+ women with (M+) and without (M−) Mobiluncus spp.
Study design
Vaginal secretions were obtained from 265 women at their first prenatal care visit and assessed for all study parameters. Gram stain evaluation using Nugent criteria was performed and coinfection with sexually transmitted infections determined. Differences between BV+/M+ and BV+/M− women were evaluated using the χ2 statistic or Mann-Whitney test.
Results
Of the 265 BV+ women, 43% (n = 113) were M+ of which 97% (n = 110) had Nugent scores of 9 or 10 . BV+/M+ women had elevated levels of sialidase (median value: 4.11 nmol vs 1.91 nmol of converted substrate; P = .003) but no difference in prolidase, anti-Gvh IgA, IL-1β, IL-8, levels were found between the two groups. BV+/M− women had significantly higher rates of coinfection with Trichomonas vaginalis.
Conclusion
BV+/M+ women have higher vaginal concentrations of sialidase and lower rates of T vaginalis compared with BV+/M− women. Further research is needed to assess the association of this, and other, microbiologic profiles to risk of adverse pregnancy outcome.

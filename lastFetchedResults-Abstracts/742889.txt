Objective: The estimate frequency of anatomic variations in origin of the right coronary artery in a Turkish population. Material and method: The angiographic data of 5253 consecutive adults patients undergoing coronary angiography were analysed retrospectively for the diagnosis of anomalous origin of the right coronary artery. Results: Among 5253 adults patients, five (0.09%) patients had anomalous origin of the right coronary. They had an isolated anomalous origin of the right coronary artery. The right coronary arose from the left coronary sinus of Valsalva (there was separate orificium for the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery) in two (0.03%) patients, from above the left coronary sinus of Valsalva in three (0.05%) patients. In all patients, the anomalous origin of right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva and from above the left coronary sinus of Valsalva coursed between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Conclusion: The anomalous origin of the right coronary artery is a rare congenital cardiac malformation. Most patients remain asymptomatic. However, there are cases of sudden cardiac death described in the literature, indicating a potentially malign course of the disease. The angiographic recognition of this vessel may be useful for physicians dealing with diagnosis and treatment of the anomaly of the right coronary artery.

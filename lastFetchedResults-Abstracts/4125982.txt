The objective of this article is to present the end-to-end broadband service and protocol architecture over DSL that has been adopted for both ADSL and G.Lite (PPP over ATM). G.Lite is a new form of DSL, and its characteristics are discussed. The article then presents a vision for the evolution of an analog modem-based service to G.Lite and ADSL services. The article explains the standardized architecture of PPP over ATM for DSL, and explores how the unique characteristics of G.Lite affect higher-layer protocols (PPP over ATM). Finally, it discusses a vision of how DSL will be deployed together with home networking to provide broadband services to multiple devices in a user-friendly fashion

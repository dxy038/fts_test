Nowadays, the issue of objective video quality assessment has been extensively studied. However, the human visual system (HVS) is the ultimate receiver for videos thus leading to a gap between objective scores calculated by computers and subjective preferences given by observers. In this paper, we focus on bridging this gap by introducing a psychological criterion called contrast effect. That is, because of the impression about the quality of previous frame still remaining in observersÂ´ minds, they tend to underestimate or overestimate the quality of the current one. Noticing this fact, we propose a video quality assessment system with an additional revision module to bridge the gap mentioned above. Firstly, the video is described by several representative clips with large entropy values. Then, we present Quality Words (including luminance, contrast, structure and spatio-temporal texture) to evaluate the quality of distorted video. To characterize the spatio-temporal texture, a new descriptor called Rotation Sensitive 3D Texture Pattern (RS-3D) is proposed. Finally, we revise the result in the revision module motivated by contrast effect. Experiments on VQEG Phase I FR-TV test dataset verify the effectiveness of our method.

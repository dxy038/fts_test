A multilevel chopper has been proposed as a suitable topology for high voltage application. In this paper, the optimal design of the multilevel inverter for UPS application is presented. A simulation-optimization system is used to perform the optimal design. This system is a combination of an optimization tool and a simulation program. The simulation program is with knowledge of the sequences of operation and is used to perform an accurate computation of the power inverter characteristics. The optimization tool however is used as a powerful procedure for the resolution of the design problem formulated in terms of objective function and constraints. The optimal design results of the multilevel inverter are verified by an experimental prototype

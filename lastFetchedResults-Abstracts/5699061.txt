Electricity industries worldwide are undergoing a period of profound upheaval. Conventional vertically integrated mechanism is replaced by a competitive market environment. A pure operating cost optimization is not enough to model the distributed, large-scale complex system. A market simulator will be a valuable training and evaluation tool to assist sellers, buyers &amp; regulators to understand system&#8217;s dynamic performance and make better decisions avoiding bunch of risks. The objective of this research is to model market players by adaptive multi-agent system, compare the performances of different artificial life technique such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Particle Swarm (PS) in simulating players&#8217; behaviors, identify the best method to emulates real rational participants.

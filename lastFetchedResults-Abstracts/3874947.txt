This paper is one of a series prepared for use in Current Operational Problems (COPS) forums with the goal of focusing the attention of the industry on high priority problems faced by those who are involved in the actual operation of power systems. The five ``short note reports" provide viewpoints on human factors considerations in electric utility dispatch control centers. The short notes focus on physical considerations, information considerations, stress, and human relationships. Much of the material that is discussed was drawn from the results of a survey of thirteen dispatch control centers. The short note reports presented here are intended to clarify the nature of operational concerns and problems. It is the objective of COPs forums to solicit discussion and stimulate others to devise responsive solutions.

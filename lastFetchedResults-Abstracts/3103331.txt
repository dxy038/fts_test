This paper focuses on modeling of axial symmetrical bodies which is formalized and generalized by the approach of topological optimization. Both constant velocities of their striking the water surface and arbitrary angles of water-entry are utilized to topological design within non-regular design domain and on the fixed loading surface. The topological optimization is based on the adoption of the solid isotropic microstructure with penalty (SIMP) approach and minimum compliance as the design objective subjective to volume constrain. The initialization of variables is the ratio of material volume limited to the total volume; and the values of variables out of the design domain always evaluate zeros. Numerical examples of water-entry bodies are investigated based on the topology optimization method. The optimum models with actual loads presented and the SIMP models are proved to be reliable and practical at the conceptual design phase of axisymmetric bodies on water entries by applying the topological optimization to a hemispheroid, wedge, and plate.

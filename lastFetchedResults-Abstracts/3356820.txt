This paper proposes different smart charging algorithms for electric vehicles (EVs) to find out the maximum grid capability in dealing with these new devices. The main objective is to obtain maximum EV penetration in the distribution grid without reinforcing the grid in order to avoid any cost for distribution system operators (DSOs). Two smart charging algorithms are proposed in this study. The proposed algorithms are applied to a part of the Danish distribution grid as a case study. As a comparison, a dumb charging scenario, i.e. charging EVs without any specific order or algorithm, is also simulated. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of the smart charging methods to increase the penetration of EVs up to three times, compared to the base case.

The single-output PID neural network control system is applied to Study of the permanent magnetic drive speed control system, the control system uses the BP algorithm to fix the connection weights through online training and learning, the objective function to reach the optimal value, in order to achieve the adaptive control of the permanent magnetic drive. The simulation results show that, on the permanent magnetic drive of this the nonlinear dynamic system control, single-output PID neural network control algorithm has a strong track performance and anti-load disturbance performance, can achieve good control.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the lifestyle and the mental status of college students. We used two psychological questionnaires: Lifestyle and Mental Status Questionnaire (LMSQ)&#8221; and &#8220;Profile of Mood States (POMS). The mental status such as stress and irritation and the mood such as depression and fatigue could be extracted with LMSQ and POMS, respectively. The students at the Department of Medical Engineering were examined and responses were obtained from 60 students. From the results of the LSMQ, we learned that they were under-nourished, physically inactive, irritated every day, and felt a buildup of stress. Students feeling a high level of irritation and stress showed a significantly high level of &#8220;fatigue&#8221; and &#8220;confusion&#8221; in the mood criteria of POMS. The combination of MSLQ and POMS could abstract not only the students mental status but also the relationship between the mental status and mood level. Research using LSMQ and POMS proved a useful tool for extracting the mental stress status of students individually and it can realize a way to support their needs in their school lives.

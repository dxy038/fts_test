When videos are transmitted over the Internet, packet missing is inevitable and an entire frame may get lost. However, most of the literature on error concealment problems can only deal with block loss. For the case of frame loss, they usually fail to achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a highly effective frame concealment method, which gives amazingly good recovery quality. We base on the theory of multiple hypotheses and devise an adaptive integration scheme to make full use of each hypothesisÂ´ strength. Different from the existing methods which mostly rely on motion vectors of previous frames, we fully exploit the correlation between consecutive frames. A novel idea for generating multiple estimates of the lost frame is adopted. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art error concealment methods for whole frame loss in both subjective and objective quality.

This paper approaches the topic of protection system reliability from an economic point of view by 1) designing an optimal modern protective relay based on a prescribed level of reliability subject to economic constraints and 2) determining optimal routine test intervals by balancing the cost of routine tests and losses due to relay failure. This paper proposes a method that enables the designer to optimally select hardware and software components of a digital protective relay to gain the highest possible overall reliability with a restricted budget. This design can be viewed as a reliability and redundancy allocation problem for which a new easy-to-implement algorithm is proposed. In contrast to the existing literature that views the problem of routine test interval optimization solely from a reliability viewpoint, this paper proposes an optimization procedure for determining optimal test intervals. The optimization objective function consists of three terms: cost of routine tests, losses due to relay unresponsiveness, and losses due to relay maloperation. The value of the objective function is calculated based on a new, simple, and comprehensive Markov model. Illustrative numerical examples clarify the application of the proposed methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in achieving an optimum for both cases.

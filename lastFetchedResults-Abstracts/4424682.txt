The objective of this paper is to present an electrically erasable programmable read only memory cell model for static and transient simulations. As a core element of this model, a MM9 model has been used coupled with the charges´ neutrality expression in the structure. The charges´ neutrality, including the charges trapped on the floating gate, is applied to determine the potential on the floating gate. From the floating gate potential, related to the terminal voltages, the drain current and the different charges present in the cell structure are calculated with the MM9 formulation. Moreover, this pragmatic model takes into account the geometric dependences of the cell. This model has been successfully implemented in Eldo.

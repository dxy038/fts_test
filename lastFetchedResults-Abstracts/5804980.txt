A joint adaptive power and adaptive rate (APAR) control algorithm for OFDM systems that aims at sum-rate maximization, subject to certain power and rate constraints, is presented in this paper. In the basic optimization framework, the overall system throughput is the main objective, but as such it lacks user fairness consideration. Two scheduling schemes that allow adjusting the trade-off between fairness and throughput are proposed and combined with the APAR scheme for fairness enhancement. Simulation results show that enhanced system performance and balanced efficiency-fairness trade-off can be achieved by the proposed schemes in downlink.

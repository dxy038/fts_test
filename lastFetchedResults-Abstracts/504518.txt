Objective: to study the construct validity of Wechsler intelligence scale for Iranian children, the third version (WISC-III) separated age groups and to access to the fittest structural model of developmental changes in the process of their intelligence.

Materials and methods: 2456 scores of student's assessment results from boys and girls 6 to 16 year living in Tehran, a group of 11 models in the framework of an age factor, a factor of two, three and four factor in intelligence, were analyzed. In order to analyzing Amos-4 software was used. Results: with regard to fitness of indicators, four-factor model for measuring of intelligence in children (WISC-III) is the fittest. No change in the factorial structure of process of general intelligence in children was observed.

Conclusion: The construct validity of four-element model for intelligence analysis of the results in all age was acceptable and can be an appropriate basis for planning of clinical rehabilitation of children.

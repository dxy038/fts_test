It is presented in this paper an algorithm for thresholding images of historical documents. The main objective is to generate high quality monochromatic images in order to make them easily accessible thru Internet and achieve high recognition rates by Optical Character Recognition algorithms. There are several well-known thresholding algorithms which are not suitable for this kind of image. Our new algorithm is based on the classical entropy concept and a variation defined by the Tsallis Entropy and it proved to be more efficient than classical thresholding algorithms.

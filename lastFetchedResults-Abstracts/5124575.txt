This paper presents a scalable Multi-Agent System (MAS) for optimal operation of an islanded microgrid. Each autonomous element in the microgrid is represented as an intelligent agent in MAS. The MAS is developed such that it maximizes the power production of local distributed generators and minimizes the operational cost of microgrid subject to system constraints and units constraints. Agents in the MAS interact among themselves cooperatively to optimize the objective of microgrid operation and use Power World simulator to confirm that there is no technical violation during the microgrid operation. Simulation studies were carried out on the developed system and the outcome of studies demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MAS for optimal operation of a microgrid and also shows the possibility of autonomous built-in simulation of microgrids.

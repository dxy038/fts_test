Millions of people travel between countries and regions on a daily basis being exposed to unfamiliar environments. Knowing where you are and how to get to places within a restricted time can make people´s lives easier. Today, WiFi access points (APs) are common everywhere, especially on university campuses, in hotels, hospitals, shopping centres, and city central business districts. This project, dubbed WiPos (WiFi-Positioning), had the objective to develop a positioning system using WiFi APs deployed across a university to locate one´s position in a building under conditions where GPS could not be used. When relatively accurate user position is available, location based services (LBS) can be provided to users, including timetable of a lecture room, location of the nearest vending machine, and so on. This project involved developing a server and a client (running on the Android platform) to handle positioning and LBS transactions. Testing has shown that the university´s WiFi network is sufficient to provide `room to room´ accuracy.

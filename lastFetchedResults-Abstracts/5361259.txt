The objective of this paper is to describe the research, the development and the implementation of a specialized monitoring system (SMS) integrated to administrative processes, which aims to maintain the water quality and its supply in segments of public basic sanitation systems. Based on levels of product loss, it demonstrates the importance of the SMS implementation to analyze and prescribe intervention actions. The adopted method is demonstrated through studies of process automation and maintenance management in a basic sanitation company in a city with 300 thousand inhabitants, from 2001 until 2006. The results obtained in the support to decision making process, reduction of water loss and the improving of maintenance management are evident.

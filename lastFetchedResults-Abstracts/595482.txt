Objective: To compare and validate Allen stroke score (ASS) and Siriraj stroke scores (SSS) in differentiating acute cerebral hemorrhage (CH) and cerebral infarction (CI). Methodology: This comparative, analytical study was conducted at Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar, Pakistan from July 2000 to February 2002. Study included 100 patients of acute ishemic or hemorrhagic stroke confirmed on CT scan brain after clinically evaluation. ASS & SSS were calculated for each patient and compared with the results of CT scan for comparability (Kappa Statistics) and validity by using SPSS 10. Results: Out of 100 patients, 69 had CI and 31 had CH. The overall comparability of ASS & SSS was fair (Kappa=0.51). ASS & SSS were uncertain in 27 & 18 cases respectively; with Kappa showing worst comparability in term of certain results (K= 0.23). In 64 cases with both scores in the diagnostic range, the Kappa showing excellent comparability (K=0.91).The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of ASS was 38.70%, 91.30%, 66.67%, 76.82% respectively for CH and 71.1%, 80.64%, 89.09% and 55.56% respectively for CI, with overall predictive accuracy of 61%. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of SSS was 67.74%, 94.2%, 84% and 86.67% respectively for CH and 78.26%, 90.32%, 94.73% and 65.11% respectively for CI, with overall predictive accuracy of 75%.Conclusion: Although, SSS being simple with more accuracy is better than ASS, both these scores lack sufficient validity to be used for exclusion of cerebral haemorrhage before offering antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy.

In this paper we present an Optimal Real Time Navigation System (ORTNS) implemented on an Android Smart Device capable of calculating the route to destination based on a permanent Internet connection and information flow obtained from SYTADIN, a traffic Information System. A multi-objective criterion is defined in order to offer the drivers different route to destination parameterization. The ORTNS is not only capable of optimal route to destination calculation with respect to traffic state but also makes the vehicle On-Board energy optimization and/or gas emission reduction possible. As an application example we propose a real time energy management for a Hybrid Electrical Vehicle (HEV) composed of batteries and Super-Capacitors (SC). Based on calculated 3D route to destination and average speeds for each road segment the state of charge (SOC) for batteries and Super-Capacitors (SC) for each receding horizon are optimaly predicted and modified in real time.

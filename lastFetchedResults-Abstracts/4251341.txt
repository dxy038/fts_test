In this paper, we consider the design of channel-aware scheduling policies for centralized wireless networks with resource-sharing constraints. The work is motivated by the objective to utilize the wireless system resources efficiently in addition to meeting the resource-sharing constraints. Our solutions are based on scheduling policies achieving close-to-capacity performance. We suggest two algorithms - an offline and an online solution - to properly adjust the weighting factors of the scheduling policy in order to achieve the required resource-sharing constraints.

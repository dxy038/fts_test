Objective
y and depression have been linked to adverse prognostic outcome in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) with mixed results. The timing of anxiety and depression measurement has received little attention so far.
s
udy sample consisted of 536 patients admitted to hospital for CVD and followed in a rehabilitation trial. Symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline and after 1 year. Cox proportional hazards model was used to describe the association between anxiety and depression and adverse outcome (myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, death and a combined endpoint) after 5 years.
s
ence of anxiety and depression at baseline was 32% and 13%, respectively. There were 303 combined events; 140 deaths, 60 patients had MI, 177 patients were admitted to hospital with HF and 60 patients had a stroke. Neither anxiety nor depression at any time was associated with mortality or the combined endpoint. Anxiety in IHD patients at baseline and at 1 year was associated with increased risk of MI (HR 2.74; 95% CI: 1.10–6.83) but was attenuated after adjusting for other risk factors (HR 1.18; 95% CI: 0.39–3.55). Both anxiety and depression at 1 year were associated with increased risk of stroke: HR 2.25 (95% CI: 1.05–4.82) and 2.34 (95% CI: 0.99–5.50), respectively, but risk associated with anxiety was attenuated after adjustment. There were no gender differences.
sions
ry to conclusions from recent meta-analyses, anxiety and depression measured at baseline and after 1 year were not associated with adverse outcome in CVD patients after multivariable adjustment.

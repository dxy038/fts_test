NATO´s Project Group 6 has developed an architecture that exploits commercial technologies and international standards in support of future NATO missions. This article discusses the NATO Post 2000 tactical communications architecture. The architecture and standards, when implemented by the NATO nations, will result in inherent interoperability among the Allies. The objective and background of the project, the envisioned Force structure that generated the command, control communications (C3) requirements, the architecture that has evolved to date, and the supporting technology are discussed. The architecture´s performance was modeled via simulation and some of the results are presented

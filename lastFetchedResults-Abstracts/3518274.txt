As part of the National Waste Terminal Storage Program, Rockwell Hanford Operations is conducting investigations to study the feasibility of storing radioactive nuclear wastes in the basalt of the Columbia River plateau. The Basalt Waste Isolation Project (BWIP) is conducting these studies and has initiated a series of in situ tests to characterize rock response to thermal and mechanical loading expected upon waste emplacement. These tests include heater tests and a large-scale block test which are instrumented to measure rock-mass response. Another objective of the project is to devise generic instrumentation to be used in the repository environment. This effort involves improvement of existing instruments and the development of new systems. This paper summarizes the instrumentation program being conducted for in situ tests in basalt and describes the current techniques for rockmass measurements.

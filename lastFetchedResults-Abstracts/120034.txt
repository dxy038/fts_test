Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging using a focal plane array detector has been used to study atherosclerotic arteries with a spatial resolution of 3-4 (mu)m, i.e., at a level that is comparable with cellular dimensions. Such high spatial resolution is made possible using a micro-attenuated total reflection (ATR) germanium objective with a high refractive index and therefore high numerical aperture. This micro-ATR approach has enabled small structures within the vessel wall to be imaged for the first time by FTIR. Structures observed include the elastic lamellae of the tunica media and a heterogeneous distribution of small clusters of cholesterol esters within an atherosclerotic lesion, which may correspond to foam cells. A macro-ATR imaging method was also applied, which involves the use of a diamond macro-ATR accessory. This study of atherosclerosis is presented as an illustrative example of the wider potential of these ATR imaging approaches for cardiovascular medicine and biomedical applications.

Fuzzy grey extension space has been widely used in decision-making because of its advantages. Based on fuzzy sets theory, FGES-DSS has its limitation: fuzzy membership function is a single value, which cannot get more objective opinions. Set pair analysis is characterized by the similarity-membership function, the difference-membership function and the counter-membership function. In this paper, the author discusses a new approach for decision-making: set pair extension space decision support system. This new approach can characterize both the favoring evidence and the opposing evidence for every scheme and the result for decision is more reasonable.

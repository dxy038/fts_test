This contribution explores an aspect of information science, which is little treated in the literature, but on which enormous sums of money are spent annually. This is the subject of information and the prosecution of war. What follows may be considered as a kind of tutorial on this huge, but poorly understood realm of information science applications. My objective at the workshop was to acquaint the participants with an overview of how information has been woven into the fabric of conflict. At present, information is so tightly woven with combat that the term information warfare has been coined. It may come as a surprise to think in these terms about information science.

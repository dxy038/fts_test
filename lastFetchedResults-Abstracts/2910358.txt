In the last few years, several problems have been evidenced in the electricity sector for example: increasing energy demand, overloaded power grids, transport losses in energy, resource shortages and greenhouse gas emissions in their generation. In response to these problems, several solutions have been proposed, one of them is the distributed generation with clean technologies, where each industry, building, housing, etc., is capable of generate energy to supply your own demand. The objective of this research is to present a simulation model for the integration of distributed resources in buildings, that is able to predict the energy contribution of each technology in a distributed resources system in a building, using as inputs: the local climate (solar radiation, wind speed, etc.,), building electricity demand, contracted electrical power, and the size of the available distributed resources. The main advantage of this model is that it allows simulations of various scenarios and in different parts of the world.

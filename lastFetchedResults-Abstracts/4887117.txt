In this year´s event, we decided to include the 2004 Workshop on System Design Automation. It is the fourth open project workshop of the Sonderforschungsbereich 358 of the Dresden University of Technology, dedicated to the synthesis, test, and verification of electronic, hybrid, hardware, and software systems as well as system design automation in general. The main objective of the PARELEC conference has always been to bring together experts in parallel computing methods and professionals in Electrical Engineering, who use parallel computing as a tool to solve their specific problems. In such a way, the conference provides a forum for lively discussion and mutual stimulation of the research and applied work we carry out in these two fields. This year´s PARELEC conference is organized by Dresden University of Technology in cooperation with Schmalkalden University of Applied Sciences and the TU Munchen.

Introduction: Unwanted pregnancy is a worldwide problem that affects women, their families and society, and the essential aim of family planning is to prevent women from unwanted pregnancies.
Objective: This cross-sectional study was performed for determining prevalence rate of unwanted pregnancy and some correlative factors in urban areas of Guilan.
Materials and Methods: 500 pregnant women in urban Health Centers for prenatal care were selected by cluster sampling. Data were collected with questionnaire consisting of 29 closed questions.
Results: Analysis of the information showed that 27.4% of pregnancies were unwanted. There was a significant relation between unwanted pregnancy and the variants: age of mother (p<0.002), number of children (p<0.0001), and mother's educational level (p<0.014). Tendency to abortion among pregnant women with unwanted pregnancy was 58.8%.
17% of mothers with previous pregnancy had unwanted pregnancy and 41% of them had abortion. There was a significant relation between going to Health Center during pregnancy (regular or irregular) and unwanted pregnancy (P<0.015). In this study, 70.8% of unwanted pregnancies were as a result of contraceptive failures and 29.9% of them were due to non-use of contraceptives.
Conclusion: The results of this study emphasize the necessity for more care on quality aspects of family planning services and specific attention on counseling.

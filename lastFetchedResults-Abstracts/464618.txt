OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the surgical management and outcome of laparoscopic removal of benign cystic teratomas during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: The records of women with benign cystic teratomas who were managed with operative laparoscopy during pregnancy were reviewed. RESULTS: Twelve women had laparoscopic removal of a benign cystic teratoma during pregnancy. Gestational ages at surgery ranged from 9 to 17 weeks, with a mean of 14 weeks. Cyst size ranged from 5 to 13 cm, with a mean of 8.5 cm. Intraoperative rupture of the cyst occurred in 10 of 12 (93%) women. No patient had evidence of chemical peritonitis. The mean operating time was 87 minutes and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 44 hours. No intraoperative or postoperative maternal or fetal complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic removal of a benign cystic teratoma of the ovary may be safely accomplished during pregnancy. In spite of a significant risk of cyst rupture, careful operative technique followed by copious irrigation of the pelvis may avoid chemical peritonitis and potential adverse sequelae.

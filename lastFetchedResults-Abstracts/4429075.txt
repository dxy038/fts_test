The objective of this work is the design and development of the Data Acquisition and Storage parts of a measurement system that will be used for the Condition Monitoring (CM) of Power Transformers. The data captured from the sensors and stored in a database will be used by an application that will predict the behavior of the Power Transformer. Data Store and Data Acquisition were developed using Data Warehouse Techniques and Virtual Instruments. This paper focuses in the description of the Data Acquisition subsystem, although a brief introduction to the other subsystems will be made. The CM system is currently installed and working properly in four electric Power Transformers.

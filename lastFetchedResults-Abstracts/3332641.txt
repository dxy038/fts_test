Real-time state estimates (SEs) of nodal demands in a power distribution system (PDS) can be developed using data from a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. These estimates provide information for improved operations and customer service in terms of energy consumption and power quality. The SE results in a PDS are significantly affected by measurement characteristics, i.e., meter types, numbers, and topological distributions. The number and type of meters are generally selected prior to a SCADA layout. Thus, selecting measurement locations is critical. The aim of this study is to develop a methodology that optimally locates field measurement sites and leads to more reliable SEs and to estimate the state of the system. An optimal meter placement (OMP) problem is posed as a multi-objective optimization form and intelligent estimator is designed to estimate the bus voltage. The algorithm developed in DE used to identify the location of RTU and power flow meter. The intelligent algorithm developed with PSO and ANN to estimate the bus voltage with limited measurements. The algorithms are tested with TNEB and IEEE benchmark systems.

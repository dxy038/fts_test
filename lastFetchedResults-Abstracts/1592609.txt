Permanent brushless dc motors have been used in many areas. Considering to their vast advantages, researchers have studied extensively for speed control and reducing the torque ripple of this motors. But a little study was done for both speed control and optimum design of them. This paper presents for the optimal design of a PMBLDC motor with goal of reducing volume and building cost. In addition the speed control aim is considered using a multi-objective nonlinear cost function which is solved by fuzzy particle swarm optimization. First characteristics of motor are expressed as functions of motor geometries. Then cost function which combines the step response characteristic of motor speed, building cost and its volume is constructed and minimized. To reach this goal in this application the new improved fuzzy particle swam optimization is used for the first time. The results of simulations show that this method has good ability and efficiency in reaching global best point in compare of GA and PSO methods.

Seepage flow measurement is an important behavior indicator when providing information about dam performance. The main objective of this study is to analyze seepage by means of an artificial neural network model. The model is trained and validated with data measured at a case study. The dam behavior towards different water level changes is reproduced by the model and a hysteresis phenomenon detected and studied. Artificial neural network models are shown to be a powerful tool for predicting and understanding seepage phenomenon.

Background and objective: Botulism is a medical and public health emergency which early diagnosis and rapid treatment of its has a crucial role for prevention of disease expansion to other cases. Globally 1000 cases of food borne botulism reported each year. There are different toxin types of Clostridium botulinum (A,B,C,D,E,F,G) which human cases occurred just with A,B,E,F toxin types. This study has been done for increasing knowledge of physicians and decrease morbidity or mortality of the disease.

Material and method: This is a descriptive retrospective study which has done based on gathered data in Center of Disease Control, MOH.

Results: 41, 66, 48 and 80 cases have been registered in 1382-1385 respectively with Mean age of 27. There was not any significant difference between patients regarding gender( P>0.05 ) while risk of acquisition was associated to live in rural area( P<0.05 ). Disease mainly reported from northern provinces and Main sources of infection were salted fish and fish seed(34.5%), whey( 9% ), home made cheese( 6.5%) and home canned foods( 3.5% ). Industrial canned foods caused only 2% of cases. In the past 4 years no cases of Infant botulism was registered and total cases were food borne botulism. Common detected toxin types were A, B and E respectively with no cases of F or G. Case fatality rate was lower than global estimation (3.1% vs. 7%).

Conclusions: Despite an increasing trend of disease detection in Iran, surveillance of botulism is still weak in Iran and there is an obvious underreporting of botulism and related death, which needs to more participation of physicians in surveillance system. In the other hand public health instruction about how to prepare traditional foods is very important and should be considered.

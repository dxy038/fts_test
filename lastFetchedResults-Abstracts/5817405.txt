Currently a great attention is paid to the increase of security and operation of power system. Several large system failures occurring worldwide over the previous decades affirm significance and need to develop this philosophy. There are examples of it such as power system failures of blackout type in USA, Italy or a splitting into islanding operations in a synchronically interconnected power system in Europe. The reason for occurrence of such failures is a conjunction of several events, nevertheless, all the cases show the only common violated indicator which is a failure to meet the performance of security criterion N-1. This article deals with the methodology based on analysis of the results of simulated calculations of N-1 events with the aim to obtain a more complex view of the use of security criterion N-1 in comparison with the current methods and procedures being in practice. The methodology is based on deterministic approach arising from calculations of steady states with global assessment of operational states of power system. The objective of the article is to comprehensively consider operational states from the view of wider use of the results of security criterion N-1 in comparison with procedures currently being in place.

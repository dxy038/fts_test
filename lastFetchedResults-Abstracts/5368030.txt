Most city planners and managers already recognize that urban areas require careful design/re-design and considered management, based on resource sustainability criteria. Involved aspects range from protection of natural and human resources, wise energy and water management, reduction of air pollution and traffic control, health and well-being of population, safeguard of cultural heritage, comfort standards in residential districts, industrial production, craftsmanship preservation, etc. Advanced instruments for territorial planning/management are required. Decisions should be based on "proper" information. Data set has to be accurate, objective, reliable, comprehensive and always up-to-date. Specific data/information have to be extracted out of all available information but some data/information have to be collected specifically for the purpose. This article is part of a wider research effort to carry out GIS (geographical information system) and a DSS (decision support system) for the city of Rome. Thematic maps are derived from accurately geo-coded remotely sensed images and used to draw "Guidance Tables for Urban Planning." A multidisciplinary team carries out coordinated work to this scope. Application examples and results for the city of Rome are illustrated in this paper, based on integration of multispectral data from various satellites (ESA-ERS, Landsat, SPOT) and MIVIS hyperspectral data from aircraft. High complexity has been observed in land cover types, surface composition and morphology, which is directly interrelated with all phenomena taking in urbanized areas (i.e. physical, chemical, social, economic, etc.). Attention has been focused on climate, urban elements, patterns and materials.

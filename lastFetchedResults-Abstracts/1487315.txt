The main objective of this study is to investigate the role of human capital on economic growth in different economies. For this purpose, we consider a model in which the growth rate of total factor productivity (GRTFP) depends on human capital stock levels, and human capital affects GRTFP through innovation and technology adoption from abroad. Using a cross-country panel approach for 104 countries, including 79 developing countries and 25 OECD countries, in five-year intervals during the 1980-2005, we found the relationship between human capital and economic growth is nonlinear. In addition, the development of domestic technology is more effective factor on economic growth in developing countries than catch-up factor, while human capital accumulation through technology adoption from abroad is more effective factor on economic growth in developed countries.

By dividing the global area into several control areas, a multi-objective coordinated AGC control method is introduced in this paper. The main control areaÂ´s objective is the ACE of global area. The sub-areas maintain the power flow of transmission lines among areas at scheduled interchange and cooperate with the main area in emergency. AGC system based on the addressed method can realize multi-objective coordinated control conveniently. The proposed method has been implemented in several provincial power grids in China and proved efficient.

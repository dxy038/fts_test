This paper deals with the autonomous parking problem of autonomous vehicle. In this paper a robust image processing method with modified of the parking problem algorithm to recognize the road parking space for a real-time controlled autonomous vehicle is presented. The main objective of a proposed method is parking an autonomous vehicle safely irrespective of space image quality. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for the problem with stability analysis. Also we show parking problem simulation which proves the effectiveness and stability of the algorithm. Using this algorithm, a car-like mobile robot could be controlled to move to a desired posture within a prescribed boundary. The developed system which integrated the control algorithm for parking tested with car-like mobile robot through simulations and experiments.

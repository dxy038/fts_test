Tuberculosis is one of notifiable infectious diseases which may cause serious epidemic problems. Traditional diagnostic techniques include acid-fast stain, bacteria culture, metabolic monitoring have some disadvantages such as low sensitivity, time consumption and less specificity. In this study we proposed a new diagnostic technique based on the protein chips concept which detected by SPR phenomena. It was found that the resonance angle (&#8764;51.86&#176;) shifted slightly toward right with antibody concentration of 10X, 30X, 100X, and 300X dilution under optimal concentration of immobilized TB antigen W38 (MW 41.5 kDa, 50 &#956;g/ml). While for the W06 (MW 14 kDa, 50 &#956;g/ml), the resonance angle was around 50.13&#176; and shifted with the same trend as W38 did.

Background: Approximately 1.8 million of the worldâ€™s population is infected with both M.tuberculosis
(TB) and HIV. HIV-seropositive patients with TB may have radiographically atypical presentations.
Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether there was any difference in radiological presentation
of pulmonary TB between HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients.
Patients and Methods: Information on 204 patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of pulmonary
TB to the infectious ward of Razi Hospital, Ahvaz, between 2004 and 2008 was obtained
from their records. They were divided into HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative groups. All clinical
signs and symptoms and radiological findings were extracted from each patient file and recorded
in a questionnaire.
Results: Normal thoracic radiography, pleural effusion, milliary pattern, and hilar and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy were more common in the HIV-seropositive group. Pulmonary infiltration
and cavitary lesions in Chest X-ray (CXR) were more frequent in the HIV-seronegative group. The
prevalence of fibrosis in HIV-seronegative patients was higher than in HIV-seropositive subjects.
Upper lobe pulmonary involvement in HIV-seropositive patients was less frequent than HIV-seronegative
persons due to their immunodeficiency.
Conclusions: Radiological presentation of pulmonary TB differs between HIV-seropositive and
HIV-seronegative patients due to progressive immunodeficiency from HIV infection.

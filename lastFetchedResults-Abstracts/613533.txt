Mycoplasma Synoviae is a major avian pathogen and cases many economic losses on poultry industry in Iran, Mycoplasma Synoviae synthesizes Variable lipoprotein heamagglutinin(VlhA), is believed to play a major in pathogenesis of the disease. The objective of the present study was to diagnosis and detection of Mycoplasma Synoviae isolates based on the vlhA gene.This study was designed to detect MS through culture isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to demonstrated the involvement of MS infection in trachea and the lung/air sac samples taken from commercial poultry flocks of provinces: Tehran, Qazvin and Markazi  with clinical signs of the disease. Moreover the specific primers to the Mycoplasma genuse from the primes complementary to the single-copy conserved 5Â´ end of vlhA gene were used for detection of MS by vlhA-PCR. PCR results, in addition to identification of Mycoplasma specie, revealed variable sizes of 350-400bp for each isolates. Of the 43 swabs 28(65%) yielded one of the potentially pathogenic Mycoplasmas evaluated for using PPLO agar culture diagnostic method, and 33(76%) yielded one of the potentially pathogenic Mycoplasmas evaluated for Mycoplasma genuse PCR as diagnostic metod and 24(55%) swabs yielded Mycoplasma Synoviae for using vlhA PCR as diagnostic metod. The results of this study demonstrated that PCR based on amplification of conserved 5? end of vlhA gene is an efficient tool for detection of Mycoplasma Synoviae isolates, as well as due to contain of RI, RII and RIII regions its can with top sensitive and operative, be used for to diagnosis and detection of Mycoplasma Synoviae isolates.

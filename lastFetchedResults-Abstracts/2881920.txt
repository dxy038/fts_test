The IEEE Engineering Mobile Service Oriented Systems (EMSOS) Workshop aims to bring together researchers from academia and industry, as well as practitioners in the area of engineering services in mobile environments in order to provide a forum where recent research results can be presented and discussed. The objective is to understand open issues in the software engineering area of services applied in mobile environments, and to build a community of researchers and practitioners willing to collaborate on these issues.

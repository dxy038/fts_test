In wavelength routed WDM optical networks, all-optical connections, called lightpaths, are established between pairs of nodes. Demands to set us lightpaths can be static, dynamic or scheduled. This paper deals with the problem of routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) of static lightpath demands which means that the set of demands is known a priori. This NP-complete problem has been widely studied in literature and several heuristic algorithms have been proposed. The most common objective is to minimize the number of wavelengths used. Suggested is a simple and fast algorithm for the RWA problem motivated by an efficient existing algorithm for the same problem. Testing on a series of random networks indicates that these modifications yield solutions superior in quality to those obtained by the previously suggested algorithm

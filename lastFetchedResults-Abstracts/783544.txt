Objective We examine the procedural
validity of a standardized instrument for the diagnosis
of psychotic disorders in Morocco. Method Twentynine
patients from Casablanca, Morocco, with a psychotic
or mood disorder were examined using the
Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History
(CASH) an adapted version using cultural formulation
to make the instrument more culturally sensitive
(CASH-CS). Chance corrected agreement was calculated
between diagnoses based on these two versions
of CASH and independent clinical diagnoses according
to local psychiatrists. Results Agreement for traditional
CASH versus clinical diagnosis and for CASH
versus CASH-CS was low (kappa = )0.19; SD 0.16
and kappa = 0.21; SD 0.16, respectively). De CASHCS,
showed good agreement with clinical diagnosis
(kappa = 0.79; SD 0.11). Conclusion Standardized
instruments for the assessment of psychosis such as
the CASH may be liable to cultural misinterpretations.
This may be relevant to the interpretation of the high
incidence rates of schizophrenia among immigrants.
Significant outcomes Agreement between a culturally
naı¨ve version of a standardized diagnostic instrument
for the assessment of psychosis and clinical diagnosis
by Moroccan psychiatrists is poor. Adding additional
probes and decision rules based on cultural formulation
improves agreement with clinical diagnosis
significantly. Limitations The study was conducted in
a small sample. Both versions of CASH were administered
by the same interviewer in a single interview
session.

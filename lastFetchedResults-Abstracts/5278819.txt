The emergence of WiMAX has attracted significant interests from all fields of wireless communications. WiMAX has been tipped to bring a revolution in the way where broadband services have been used today; those have been strengthened by the optimization of RF. The systematic investigation to establish facts of necessary modification about the theory for smooth optimization is targeted. This paper has considered the map outage factor of the objective function for the invention of a method to produce suitable values which help to realize better output. Simulation results found to be more precise over conventional RF of WiMAX in finding the modification of the existing theory.

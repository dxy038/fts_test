Using a clustered system of sensors able to measure O<sub>3</sub>, NO/NO<sub>2</sub>, CO and CO<sub>2</sub>, we want to compare the performance of several calibration methods. Based on the outcome of the single sensorÂ´s evaluation, the suitability of this cluster is investigated using deterministic or statistical methods such as multivariate regression and neural networks. The objective of the study is to assess if the measurement uncertainty of sensors can reach the Data Quality Objective of the European Air Quality Directive for indicative methods.

The Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is the IETF standard for IPv6 routing in low-power wireless sensor networks. It is a distance vector routing protocol that builds a Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) rooted towards one sink (the DAG root), using an objective function and a set of metrics/constraints to compute the best path. In this paper, we propose a routing metric which minimizes the delay towards the DAG root, assuming that nodes run with very low duty cycles (e.g., under 1%) at the MAC layer. We evaluate the proposed routing metric with the Contiki operating system and compare its performance with that of the Expected Transmission Count (ETX) metric. Moreover, we propose some extensions to the ContikiMAC radio duty cycling protocol to support different sleeping periods of the nodes.

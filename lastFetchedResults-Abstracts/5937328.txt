In this paper we present a solution for providing a fast handover in wireless networks which involve network access control based on the <i>Extensible</i> <i>Authentication</i> <i>Protocol</i>. We propose an approach based on cryptographically generated identities, which reduces the number of round trips during authentication phase and achieves the objective of reducing the impact on existing EAP deployments.

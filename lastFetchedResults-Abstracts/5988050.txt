Infrared imaging of the breast for breast cancer risk assessment with a second generation focal plane staring array system was found to produce images superior to a first generation scanning system. The second generation system had greater thermal sensitivity, more elements in the image and greater dynamic range, which resulted in a greater ability to demonstrate asymmetric heat patterns in the breasts of women being screened for breast cancer. The improved imaging of the second generation infrared system allowed more objective and quantitative visual analysis, compared to the very subjective qualitative results of the first generation infrared system. The greater sensitivity and resolution of the digitized images of the second generation infrared system also allowed image analysis of total breasts, breast quadrants and hot spots to produce mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum temperatures

Background: Reminiscence Functions Scale (RFS) is the most valid measure of functions of reminiscence. Since validity and reliability of the RFS have not been investigated in the Iranian context, it is necessary to study the psychometric properties of this scale. Objective: The present paperaims to study the psychometric properties of the Reminiscence Functions Scale (RFS) amongthe students of Shiraz University.Method:A sample of 247 students studying at Shiraz University during the academic year 2011-2012 wasselected using random cluster sampling method. The participants filled the Reminiscence Functions Scale. Validity of the instrument was examined using factor analysis, principal components analysis and internal consistency analysis. Reliability of the instrument was tested by Chronbach’s alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability method. Results: The results of factor analysis yielded 7 factors. The results of internal consistency analysis showed that the instrument was of a good internal consistency. The total Chronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.91 and the Chronbach’s alpha coefficients of the RFS subscales ranged from 0.76 to 0.89. The total test-retest reliability was yielded 0.57 and the test-retest reliability coefficients of the subscales ranged from 0.36 to 0.71. Conclusion:The results of the present study showed that the ReminiscenceFunctionsScale is appropriately valid and reliablein Iran and can be used in research works and therapeutic interventions (e.g. Reminiscence therapy).

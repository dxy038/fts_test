The first step in a integration processing or for any type of computational program is to know the grammar used by the equipment to be integrated or that will receive the developed program. The same occurs when it is important to extract information in a data mining process into a database produced by equipment or a system. Also, during the integrated operation of several types of equipment in smart-grids, it is fundamental to know very well each different grammar to obtain a correct integration. This objective of this paper is presented four examples of different types of grammar used in different type of applications in control centers and substations.

In this paper, a new multi-scale scheme for image fusion is presented using texture and edge information. The original images are decomposed into texture and edge maps by pyramid structures. The coefficients corresponding to the filtered texture and edge maps are solved by the singular value decomposition and the linear relationship between Gauss filter and Laws texture extract filter. The decomposed images are represented using the texture and edge features in each scale, and fused using fuzzy region based strategy. To evaluate the fusion results, an objective image fusion performance metrics are used. The experiment results demonstrate by several real image data that the proposed scheme can achieve better fusion performance than the traditional pyramid decomposition methods.

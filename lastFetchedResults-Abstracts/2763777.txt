A novel magnetic signature attenuation technique based on reconfiguring the location and orientation of the onboard magnetic sources of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) is presented in this paper. The UAS, GeoSurv II, is intended for high-resolution aeromagnetic survey which requires the magnetic signature of the aircraft to be very low. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to find an optimum configuration given multiple objective functions motivated by the application. The magnetic field contribution from a single servomotor onboard GeoSurv II is modeled as a single permanent magnet dipole, which is then used to build the cost function for the GA routine. The optimization/simulation outcome suggests very little alteration in the current configuration of the GeoSurv II servomotors resulting in a substantial improvement of the overall magnetic signature of the UAS. The simulation results are validated by practical experimentation. The experimental results, in addition to the simulation results, further confirm that the GA optimized configuration substantially outperforms the current configuration in terms of magnetic signature of GeoSurv II.

Background
Myocardial infarction (MI) may be classified as ST elevation MI (STEMI) or non ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). We used the term recurrent MI (RMI's) to denote repeated MI episodes, in a particular patient, in which a different coronary site is responsible for each episode. Recently we reported that most patients with recurrent MI episodes will have either STEMI's or NSTEMI's but not both. A history of smoking was associated with recurrent STEMI's.
Objective

To determine whether smoking cessation will alter the type of RMI in patients with an index MI of STE type.
Methods

The analysis included 128 patients who underwent at least 2 MI episodes. We attempted to include only MI's of native vessels, without the presence of extra cardiac conditions that intensify myocardial ischemia. All 128 patients were active smokers who presented with an index MI of the STE type. Of these patients 94 had recurrent STEMI and 34 had recurrent NSTEMI (STE/NSTE group).
Results

We identified all patients who were no longer active smokers at the time of the recurrent MI: there were 31 (33%) such patients in the STEMI group and 13 (38%) in the STE/NSTE group (p = NS).
Conclusion

Smoking cessation did not influence the type of recurrent MI in these patients.

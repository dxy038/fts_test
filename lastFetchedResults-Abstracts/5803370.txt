Summary form only given. One of the major reasons which has been given for the U.S. loss of global economic competitiveness is a perceived weakness in the design and manufacturing of competitive products. One significant step to rectify this problem is to effectively educate engineering graduates in the product realization process (PRP). For the purpose of this paper, PRP encompasses the full product life cycle, from customer needs, design and manufacturing, to eventual disposal or recycling of the product. The specific objective of this NSF project is to develop resource materials for engineering educators which will assist them to effectively integrate all aspects of PRP into appropriate engineering curricula. The project team consists of nationally recognized industry and university leaders in design education and practice

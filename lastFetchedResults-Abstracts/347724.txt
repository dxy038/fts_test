Objective: To characterize the electroencephalographic (EEG) findings in patients with Kufs disease, the adult autosomal recessive form of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis.
Methods: We reviewed the EEG findings in 5 patients with biopsy-proven Kufs disease from our institution and 14 case reports of Kufs disease in the literature. The criteria used for patient inclusion were clinical evidence of a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, biopsy-proven evidence of Kufs disease, and EEG recordings during the course of the illness.
Results: One patient had phenotype A with generalized atypical spike and slow wave complexes and marked photoparoxysmal responses, particularly at low flash frequencies. Three patients had phenotype B with generalized slowing. One patient in the miscellaneous category showed focal sharp and spike waves and quasi-periodic slow waves maximal over anterior regions of the head. Review of the literature identified 14 case reports that met the inclusion criteria.
Conclusions: The inheritance, mechanism, and manifestations of Kufs disease are not well understood. EEG findings may guide clinicians toward a confirmatory pathological diagnosis and distinguish various phenotypes of this disorder.
Significance: The EEG may assist in the diagnosis of Kufs disease

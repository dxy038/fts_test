Objective
To establish the reference values for serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 and their ratio in Chinese adolescents aged 12–19 years.
Design and methods
2102 Chinese adolescents were randomly selected from all secondary schools in Hong Kong with 1734 having IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels as measured by automated chemiluminescent assays (IMMULITE 2000®). LMS (Lambda-Mu-Sigma) method was used to generate reference percentile curves for IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and their ratio.
Results
After excluding participants with abnormal thyroid function, 798 boys and 894 girls were included in the analysis with a mean (± SD) age of 15.3 (± 2.0) and 15.7 years (± 2.0), respectively. Both serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels tended to be higher in girls than boys before the age of 16. In boys, there was progressive decline in IGF-1 after a pubertal peak at the age of 13–14. In girls, there was a similar decline after the age of 12. In both boys and girls, there was progressive age-dependent decline in IGFBP-3 after the age of 15–16. The pattern of changes for IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio was similar to that of the IGF-1 levels.
Conclusions
These reference values of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in healthy adolescents should facilitate the clinical management of adolescents with GH–IGF axis disord

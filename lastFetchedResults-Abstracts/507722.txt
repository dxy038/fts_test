OBJECTIVE: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age characterized by the presence of polycystic ovaries, menstrual dysfunction and biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism. Lifestyle modification is important in treatment of obese and overweight women with PCOS. This study was performed to evaluate the benefit of aerobic exercise training on obesity and insulin resistance in young women with PCOS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty obese PCOS patients aged 15-30 underwent a 12-week aerobic training program. Anthropometric parameters (weight, height, maximum oxygen consumption, waist circumference, waist to hip ratio and body fat percentage), metabolic and hormonal profiles (glucose and insulin) were assessed and compared at the baseline and after the 12-week training program.
RESULTS: After a 12-week aerobic training program body weight decreased from 76.9 ± 11.69 to 74.01 ± 11.82 Kg, body fat percentage decreased from 37.01% ± 4.16 to 35.57% ± 4.13 and waist circumference decreased from 86.4 ± 8.75 to 82.29 ± 6.59 cm (P  <  0.05). There was also a significant increase in V02max, from 34.77 ± 1.86 to 35.87 ± 1.94 (P = 0.006). Changes in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance were not significant.
CONCLUSION: Aerobic training program improves anthropometric parameters, and metabolic and hormonal profiles in young women with PCOS.

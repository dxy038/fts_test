Compared with the subjective assessment method, the objective assessment method evaluate image quality by means of these criterion indexes such as average grads, standard deviation, spatial frequency, entropy, mutual information and so on. The limitation of these methods is only to analyze the images themselves, which lack the association with subjective factors. Proper introduce human visual system characteristics to image evaluation could improve the evaluation accuracy. Aiming at these reasons, a new evaluation index is introduced by means of the accumulation of different component of power spectrum fitting HVS characteristics. The method takes frequency domain information as the main structural information for the image and gets a frequency domain function of the image from weighted frequency components after a fast Fourier transform based on the human visual system with different sensitivities in the frequency domain. Experimental results show that this model is more consistent with the human visual system and can assess the image quality more precisely than others single factor assessment methods.

Image fusion has been over-studied recently. Nevertheless, few works aim to how to evaluate the performance of image fusion algorithms. In this paper, we extend the work in image quality evaluation to a novel metric for objective evaluation of image fusion. Firstly the input images and the result image are converted into local sensitive intensity (LSI) by Radon transform. Then we use the sensitive intensity to measure how many information have been transferred from each source into the fused result by the difference of LSI. Finally all the LSI pairs are incorporated into the expression according to Weber-Fechner law. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric is compliant with subjective evaluations and outperforms other recently developed objective metrics of image fusion.

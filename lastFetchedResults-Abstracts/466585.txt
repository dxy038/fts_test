Objective: This study was undertaken to assess the effect of multiple factors that influence the success rate and time to conception among couples undergoing donor sperm insemination. Study Design: A retrospective analysis of 960 cycles of frozen donor sperm insemination was performed at the University of Florida. Cycle pregnancy rates and cumulative probability of pregnancy were compared using several variables. Results: The pregnancy rate was 12.1% per treatment cycle, and the cumulative probability of pregnancy exceeded 80% for the entire cohort. Seventy percent of pregnancies resulted in a liveborn infant. Age had a profound impact on the cycle pregnancy rate. The cycle pregnancy rates for women younger than 30 years, between the ages of 30 and 35 years, between the ages of 35 and 40 years, and older than 40 years were 15.8%, 14.6%, 8.2%, and 0%, respectively. There was a trend toward higher cycle pregnancy rates in women with prior pregnancies versus women without prior pregnancies of 14.4% and 12.3%, respectively. Parity had no effect on the cycle pregnancy rate or the cumulative probability of pregnancy. There was a trend toward higher cumulative probability of pregnancy in women whose partners were azoospermic versus oligospermic. There was no difference in pregnancy rates obtained with the Percoll wash gradient versus the Isolate gradient. At >20 million total motile sperm per insemination, there was no threshold above which the pregnancy rate was improved. Conclusion: The most significant influence on pregnancy rates in the donor sperm insemination program at the University of Florida was maternal age. Nulligravidity and a diagnosis of mild oligospermia in the man may have a negative impact on pregnancy rates. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:332-37.)

Buying an off-the-shelf sensor or actuator device has become a common practice with individual developers or universities that are keen on exploring ways of flexibly building networks for increasing possibilities of use. Their objective might not be on a targeted single application or an integrated product, but by conducing trials, suitable development and research, they explore novel networking opportunities and fit them to suitable applications. Internet of Things is a concept that promises a world of interconnected IP entities to be facilitated by new underlying capabilities in the Internet. This new initiative meets the vast population of Wireless Sensor (and actuator) Networks that have been deployed in an ever-increasing ranges of applications. The paper shows an understanding of how topics can be coherently combined behind a target for developing a regional and multi-application system and grouping the research topics that would foster its further development.

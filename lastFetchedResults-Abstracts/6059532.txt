Through the subjective and objective evaluation, this research focuses on the evaluation of indoor air quality (IAQ) of two gymnasiums in the school and the relationship between the IAQ and the exercise intensity, using the ZG106 CO<sub>2</sub> detector, etc. and the questionnaire according to the feeling scale of the ASHRAE. The results review that: the Air Acceptance Ratios of the two gymnasiums are lower than the standard value; at the fairly level of the exercise intensity and insisting on the same time, the effects on the IAQ are different between different events; the more the RPE value changes, the more the concentration of the CO<sub>2</sub> changes after exercises; the Air Acceptance Ratio after exercises is lower than before, and it is going to be lower when the density indoor increases. To achieve the best effect of the exercise, we can restrict the number of the courses according to the course itself.

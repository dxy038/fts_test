This paper proposes a novel Delay Optimal Data Delivery (DODD) scheme that aims at achieving a delay-minimal bundle delivery in the context of an intermittently connected vehicular network. The realization of this objective is challenging since network information is completely unavailable. The concept of Virtual Space presents an efficient solution that allows the source to perform necessary data bundle retransmissions to a subset of arriving vehicles. In turn, these vehicles will secure earlier delivery of the retransmitted bundles to the destination. The mathematical performance evaluation of DODD as well as extensive simulations show that this scheme exhibits a delay improvement of 22:6% to 40% relatively to other existing schemes.

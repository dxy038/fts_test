Objective(s): To determine the Healthy Eating Index (HE!) score and its relation to intake of nutrients and the number of servings from each food group of adolescents residing in district 13 of Tehran.
Material & Methods: This study was conducted within the framework of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), as part of a dietary intake assessment according to the Food Guide pyramid of individuals residing in district 13 of Tehran. In this study 819 adults, aged 19 years and above, was chosen. Dietary intake assessment was undertaken with 2-day 24-hour recalls. HEI was calculated based on 9 components (The groups of Food Guide pyramid: components I to 5, the percent of fat and saturated fatty acid intake, cholesterol consumption: component 6 to 8 and dietary variety score: component 9). The score range for each component was 0 to 10. Therefore the sum score of this index was 90. In this study HEI score modified to the previous studies. Dietary variety score was determined according to the number of consumed foods in the sample size of this study. The HEI score was categorized into three groups: less than 45 (poor diet), 45-72 (needs improvement) and more than 72 (good diet). Partial correlation was used to show the relation between HEI score and intakes of nutrients and the number of servings from each food group. The score for each component was calculated and grouped into three categorize: <5, 5-8 and >8. The percentage of people according to each components of HEI was determined.
Results: The mean score of HEI was 65.1+9.8 in men and 64.9+8.8 in women. The results showed that the serving number of food groups and approximately nutrients except selenium in those with good diet was significantly higher than the group with HEI less than 45 (P<0.05). In contrast the percent of total fat and saturated fat intake in those with HEI >_72 was lower than other groups (P<0.00I). The number of food items in individuals with HEI score >72 was significantly more than others (p<0.00i ). There was a significant positive correlation between the serving number of grains group (r = 0.2, P <0.001), vegetable (r = 0.4, P <0.001), fruit (r = 0.4, P <0.001), dairy (r = 0.3, P <0.001), meat (r = 0.1, P <0.001) and HEI. There was a significant negative correlation between Total fat intake, percent of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol consumption (r = -0.1, P<0.001) and HEI score. The number of food items had a strong significant positive correlation with HEI (r = 0.5, P <0.001), There were significant positive correlation between HEI and nutrients intake. The results showed that 73.3% of adult's diet needs improvement.
Conclusion: HEI is an appropriate tool for assessment of diet quality in adults. The diet of most adults needs improvement and nutrition education is necessary in this age group.

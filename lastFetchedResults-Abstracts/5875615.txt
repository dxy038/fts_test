This paper proposes a topology of a three- level 4 times 3 conventional matrix converter with 12 bidirectional switches. PWM control and modulation index compensation have been investigated. Operation theory has been verified by the simulation results using Matlab. The simulation results show that the switching output performance of the proposed matrix converter is more efficient than that of existing matrix converters.

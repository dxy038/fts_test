The objective of present work was to develop a three-dimensional numerical simulation on the basis of the finite volume method for predicting the penetration and mixing characteristics of a single row of coolant jets injected normally into a heated crossflow in a constant area duct. Two types of mesh size were developed to evaluate the ability of the standard and the (RNG)k–ε turbulence models. The effects of jet-to-mainstream momentum flux ratio, in the range of 6.0–23.5 and duct height to hole diameter ratio and relative spacing of adjacent jets to hole diameter ratio, within the range of 4.0–12.0 and 2.0–4.0, respectively, were investigated. Comparisons between the present numerical results on the temperature profiles and the experimental results of Holdeman and Walker (AIAA J. 15 (2) (1977) 243) demonstrated reasonable agreement.

Background: Supracondylar fractures of the humerus are common in children and there are many difficulties in management of these fractures.
Objective: To determine the success rate in treatment of supracondylar fractures of the humerus by dosed reduction and percutaneous pinning .
Methods: This study was implemented on 26 children treated by closed reduction and percutaneous pinning in Shahid Rajaee hospital of Qazvin from October 1998 till March 2001.
Findings: The results were excellent in 46.15%, good in 34.61%, fair in 15.38% and poor in 3.84% of the cases. There was no movement limitation in elbow, the complications were minimum, and all the fractures healed soon in 6 weeks.

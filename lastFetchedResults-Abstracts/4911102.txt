In this paper, we study the scheduling of off-line subjective tests for evaluating alternative parameter values of control schemes in real-time multimedia applications. These applications are characterized by multiple counteracting objective quality metrics (such as delay and signal quality) that can be affected by the control schemes. However, the tradeoffs among these metrics with respect to the subjective preferences of users are not defined. As a result, it is difficult to use the proper control value that leads to the best subjective quality without carrying out subjective tests. Since subjective tests are expensive to conduct and the number of possible control values and run-time conditions is prohibitively large, it is important that a minimum number of such tests be conducted, and that the results learned can be generalized to unseen conditions with statistical confidence. To this end, we study in this paper optimal algorithms for scheduling a sequence of subjective tests, while leaving the generalization of limited off-line subjective tests to guide the operations of the control schemes at run time to a future paper. Using an example application in the design of the play out scheduling (POS) algorithm for a two-party VoIP system, we study the accuracy and efficiency of conducting subjective tests simultaneously.

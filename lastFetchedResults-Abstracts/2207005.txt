A proper understanding of the relationships that connect processing conditions, microstructural evolution and mechanical properties is important for any materials scientist to improve productivity and product quality. The objective of this work is to experimentally and statistically analyze the effect of physically measurable features of the starting microstructure on the yield stress of 6022 Al alloy. Quantitative parameters obtained from microstructure characterization and stress analysis were analyzed by a multiple regression analysis technique to determine the relative influence of various microstructural parameters on the observed stress response. The geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density was determined to be the most important measured parameter affecting the yield stress. Experimental and statistical analysis showed a linear relationship between the yield stress and square root of the GND density.

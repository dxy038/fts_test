Background
al treatments have been selected to treat advanced osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the humeral capitellum.
e
luate the clinical results of surgical treatments for advanced capitellar OCD lesion and to clarify problems of poor clinical results.
s
were reviewed for 27 patients with advanced OCD lesions treated operatively. All patients were male baseball players, with a mean of 13.3 years at the time of surgery. Drilling only was performed for 3 patients, fragment fixation for 13 patients, and removal of the detached fragment with drilling for four patients. Since 2004, reconstruction of the articular surface with use of osteochondral autograft from the rib has been performed for 7 patients with osteochondral defect. Mean follow-up was 37.4 months. Follow-up assessment included modified elbow rating system, evaluation of radiographs, and return to sports.
s
ubjective score improved significantly from 70 to 96 postoperatively. Mean objective score improved significantly 71 to 81 postoperatively. A postoperative return to baseball was achieved by 25 patients. On the final radiographs, 4 patients showed flattening of &gt;70% of the capitellum or degenerative changes, including insufficient remodeling of the lateral margin of the capitellum. Although patients could return to baseball, postoperative total arc of the elbow was decreased compared with the preoperative total arc.
sion
al treatments were useful to restore advanced OCD lesions. Our results suggest that reconstruction of the lateral margin of the capitellum is important for achieving good clinical results.

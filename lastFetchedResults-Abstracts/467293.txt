Objective: Elective cesarean delivery has been postulated to improve the outcome of term fetuses in breech presentation. We retrospectively compared the short- and long-term outcomes of term infants who were delivered from a breech presentation at a single center. Study Design: We reviewed 699 consecutive term breech presentations according to the intended mode of delivery at a single center between January 1993 and December 1999. The short-term outcome measures were perinatal death, neonatal death, or serious neonatal morbidity; the long-term outcome measures were developmental delay and spasticity. Results: The rate of serious perinatal morbidity in the trial-of-labor and cesarean delivery groups was 2.3% and 0.5%, respectively (P = .12). There was no perinatal or neonatal death in either group. With a median follow-up period of 57 months (range, 13-100 months), the rate of developmental delay was 1.9% and 0.5%, respectively (P = .29). Spasticity was not noted in any of the children. Conclusion: Our data suggest that planned vaginal delivery remains an option for selected term breech presentations. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:1694-8.)

Objective:
In the present study, we determined the frequency of Δ32 allele distribution and its relationship with various carcinomas in a Turkish population.
Design and methods:
We determined the allelic frequency of CCR5-Δ32 in 267 healthy individuals as well as 39 breast, 34 laryngeal, 30 thyroid and 20 brain carcinomas in a Turkish population using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Results:
The frequency of mutant Δ32 alleles in the Turkish population was 2.18%. The population was in the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of the mutant allele was the highest in patients with breast carcinoma (3.85%) among all the carcinomas studied, but there was no statistically significant relationship (P = 0.334).
Conclusion:
The frequency of the Δ32 allele detected in the Turkish population was slightly lower in comparison with the previous reports. The frequency of heterozygote genotypes remained an independent risk factor for the development of breast cancer (odd ratio = 1.628; confidence intervals = 0.442–5.992) as well as other cancers examined in this study.

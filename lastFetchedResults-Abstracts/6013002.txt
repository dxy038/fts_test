With the development of ultra high voltage (UHV) grid, the importance of UHV compact transmission technology is increasingly recognized. In order to optimize the configuration of UHV compact transmission lines, an optimized multi-objective(MTO) model is set up in this paper, which aims at enhancing surge impedance loading(SIL) and natural transmission power per unit cross-sectional area(SILP). On the basis of adopting weigh vectors to coordinate the objectives, this paper constructs an augmented Lagrangian function to transform an inequality constrained model into an unconstrained model, based on the interior point method, and adopt simplex method to solve the problem. Besides, we can use the finite element analysis method to verify the precision of the analytical method and, finally, offer the comparatively more optimized configuration of UHV AC compact transmission lines.

Background and Objective: Learning style is one of the factors that affect learning and academic achievement of learners so that understanding it helps individuals adopt a more appropriate way of learning. Teachers' learning styles also affect selected teaching activities and learning environment. This study assesses the learning styles of students and faculty members in pre-clinical stage of medical education at Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted in the 2011-12. 221 medical students and 106 faculty staff in preclinical stage at Tehran University of Medical Sciences participated in a census study. Kolb's Learning Style Inventory was used to conduct the research.
Results: Much of the studentsâ€™ learning style was converging (34.4%) and accommodating (30.8%) while the majority of the faculty learning style was respectively converging (41.5%) and absorbent (26.4%). There was a significant difference (p=0.000) between learning styles of the students and the faculty staff. 
Conclusion: Similarity between learning style of medical students and the faculty increases learning motivation and achievement. We recommend that the faculty, regardless of their learning preferences, use laboratory and problem solving method in their teaching. In addition, the communication skills of medical students should also be strengthened.

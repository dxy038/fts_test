The solid transportation problem arises when bounds are given on three item properties. Fuzzy solid transportation problem arises when the nature of the data problem is vague. This paper deals with the fuzzy solid transportation problem in the case in which the fuzzyness affects only in the constraint set, and a fuzzy solution to the problem is required. Moreover, an arbitrary linear or nonlinear objective function is considered. In order to end a fuzzy solution to the problem, a parametric approach is used in obtaining an auxiliary parametric solid transportation problem associated to the original problem. As there isnÂ´t solution methods proposed in literature to solve the parametric solid transportation problem, in this paper is proposed a genetic algorithm based solution method, which can be applied to find a &#8220;good&#8221; fuzzy solution to the fuzzy solid transportation problem

A genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to solve a fuzzy multi-objective nonlinear programming (FMNP) problem is presented and applied to water resources allocation. A FMNP model of regional water allocation is established originally. The objective functions of the model include three conflicting goals which are economic profits, environment goal and society goal. By turning the FMNP to an optimal level cut problem, the ldquofuzzy optimal solutionrdquo is solved by using a genetic algorithm. An example of the Dongyingpsilas water allocation strategy is provided by using the proposed method.

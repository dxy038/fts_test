The objective of this study was to investigate the behavior and characteristics of discretionary users through studying their interactions with word processing software. Discretionary users of two commercial word processing software packages (one command-driven and the other menu-driven) executed a standard set of editing tasks. As they edited, their verbal protocols and video tracings of the screen were obtained. The authors classified the verbalizations in the protocols according to a categorization scheme which defined novice-like versus expert-like utterances. They also did a detailed procedural analysis of how the subjects carried out each task. The results indicate that discretionary users exhibit expert-like characteristics on a small set of routine editing tasks. However, beyond this core set of tasks their behavior is quite novice-like. They reach a steady state of performance where they accomplish most tasks using a small subset of commands. Their subjects showed no interest in becoming experts or in gaining more knowledge of the system. Their limited knowledge of the command repertoire and functions in the system proved to be a hindrance in accomplishing any non-routine task

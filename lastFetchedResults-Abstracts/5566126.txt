Optical bidirectional transmission over a wide-range high splitting passive optical network (PON) is discussed. As major issues, the optical amplification of the burst-mode upstream signal and the nonintrusive ranging were identified and solutions to overcome them were proposed. Further lab experiments are planned and results will be presented at the conference.

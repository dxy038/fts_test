The objective of this study is to investigate remote-learning methods in the context of mechatronics education, and in particular, for the study of claw-pole type stepping motors widely employed in information devices. While hypermedia-based courseware and computer-assisted instruction are widely used in conventional desk-type learning, very few examples exist of remote learning that involve experiments. The authors therefore developed a prototype client-server system for remotely conducting experiments on small control motors. The prototype system consists of two stepping motors with slight construction differences but displaying significant differences in positioning characteristics. The server computer is connected to the motor laboratory, and the visual image and sounds of the experiment are transmitted to the client computer in real time. The remotely located student can operate the motors and conduct experiments through the client computer. Through demonstrations to students the authors conclude that this is a very suitable teaching aid for in-depth learning of modern mechatronics design practices

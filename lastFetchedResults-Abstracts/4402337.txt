In this paper we propose a data center traffic engineering method based on multi-objective optimization. We define a problem of traffic engineering in data center networks as a multi-objective optimization problem with two contrary objectives: load balancing and energy saving. Traffic engineering models for load balancing and energy saving are represented as a linear programming equation. Our simulation results show that the proposed method enables data center operators to change the relative importance between load balancing and energy saving. We also show the traffic engineering results with the predefined upper bound of maximum link utilization and energy cost in response to service requirements and energy OPEX. The contributions of proposed traffic engineering method are (a) to minimize both maximum link utilization and energy cost simultaneously; (b) to minimize maximum link utilization with upper bound of energy cost; and (c) to minimize energy cost with upper bound of maximum link utilization.

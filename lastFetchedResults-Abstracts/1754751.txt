Objective
aining and Support Program (TSP) was designed to equip parents of children with disabilities with a simple massage skill for use with their children in the home environment. The effectiveness of the TSP was examined in a randomized controlled trial with a wait-list control group.
s
s were trained in massage by suitably qualified therapists in eight weekly sessions, each lasting 1 h. The sample comprised 188 parents who were randomized to an intervention group (n=95), who attended the TSP with their children immediately, or a control group (n=93), who were offered the TSP after 4 months of follow-up. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaires at baseline and at 4-month follow-up.
s
jority of participants were mothers (88%), with a partner (88%), and White European (82%); 40% worked full-time or part-time, and 34% had health problems (e.g., chronic fatigue, cancer, and arthritis). The TSP demonstrated statistically significant positive effects on parental self-efficacy (PSE) for managing children's psychosocial well-being and depressed mood (0.004 and 0.007). There were trends toward improvement on parental satisfaction with life (P=.053), global health (P=.065), and parental ratings of children's sleeping (P=.074) and mobility (P=.012). Effect sizes were small (0.11â€“0.23). Levels of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress were all higher than published norms.
sion
P is an effective means of improving PSE and depressed mood. Additional means of supporting parents need to be investigated.

OBJECTIVE: We applied deoxyribonucleic acid polymorphism analysis on the basis of differences in the number of short tandem repeat sequences to genetically differentiate dizygotic twins with complete hydatidiform moles and normal fetuses from partial moles presenting a similar appearance.
STUDY DESIGN: Six pregnant women exhibiting apparent moles and coexisting fetuses were the subjects of this study. Eight polymorphic loci including short tandem repeat sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from deoxyribonucleic acid of peripheral leukocytes of parents, umbilical cord, grossly normal placenta-villi, and molar tissue. The segregation of alleles among samples were determined by comparing band patterns on polyacrylamide gels.
RESULTS: In all 6 cases amplifications of polymorphic loci provided sufficient information to determine the parental origin. At informative loci the alleles of cord and placenta-villi were transmitted from both patients and husbands whereas molar tissue had only paternal alleles. These allele segregations indicated 2 different genetic origins, namely, normal parental for a fetus and androgenetic for molar tissue, and thus the diagnosis of dizygotic twins with a complete hydatidiform mole and a normal fetus was made. Additionally, the molar component was defined as a heterozygous mole in 2 cases.
CONCLUSION: Short tandem repeatâ€“derived deoxyribonucleic acid polymorphism analysis was demonstrated to be a useful and precise procedure for the differential diagnosis of a complete hydatidiform coexisting with a normal fetus and the determination of its zygosity as well.

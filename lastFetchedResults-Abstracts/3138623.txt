This paper presents a general and efficient tool for the computer-aided nominal design of integrated circuits. The design method is based on an interactive optimization approach and on a soohisticated interface to the circuit level simulation package SPICE providing a high level tool for the task of designing cells at transistor level. The efficiency of the design tool proposed is demonstrated by an application to a multiple objective design task of an analogue circuit.

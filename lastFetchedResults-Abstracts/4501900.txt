Sensitive circuits contained in an optoelectronic receiver module must meet worldwide standards for electrostatic discharge (ESD). Enclosing these circuits in a package becomes an extremely important consideration in achieving acceptable module performance. The authors describe the packaging requirements for an optoelectronic module that will meet the objective. Experimental tests were conducted on various packaging designs to determine the significant features affecting ESD susceptibility. Areas investigated included metallurgical vs. metal-filled epoxy assembly of the package elements (housing, lid, substrate), and low resistance vs. full closure between the packaging elements. The packaging features required to achieve acceptable ESD voltage levels were determined and implemented in the design

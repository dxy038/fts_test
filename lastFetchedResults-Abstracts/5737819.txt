The objective of this study is to further evaluate the relationship between removal effect of dissolved organic pollutants (DOC) and their characteristics (biodegradability, adsorbability and molecular size distribution) in different running stage of BAC filter. The experimental results showed that during early period of operation, BAC filter mainly removed adsorbable DOC (that is ADOC), but after continuously running for five months, the main body to be removed by BAC filter was adsorbable and biodegradable DOC (that is A&amp;BDOC), and the distribution of molecular weight for this fraction of DOC was 3kD~1kD and &lt;;0.5kD. Biological regeneration of BAC only can keep its continuous removal efficiency for B&amp;ADOC but canÂ´t remain that of NB&amp;ADOC.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the antimicrobial, antioxidant and darkening inhibitory activities of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared from chitosan and xylose, and their effects on the preservation and quality of semi-dried noodles. The development of brown color and UV absorbance changes indicated the proceeding of Maillard reaction. The antimicrobial activity, reducing power, DPPH radical scavenging activity, copper-chelating activity and PPO inhibitory effects of chitosanâ€“xylose conjugates increased with the reaction. Addition of MRPs could improve the textural and cooking quality of semi-dried noodles. Incorporation of 0.35% MRPs (6 h) into semi-dried noodle resulted in an extension of shelf life for more than 7 days than the control noodles (at room temperature). The discoloration caused by the addition of MRPs was limited, and MRPs could inhibit darkening of the noodle effectively. Results suggested that the MRPs could be used as a novel promising preservative for semi-dried noodles.

This paper proposes a new modelling approach for modelling sequential activities with detailed message descriptions. Message Sequence Chart (MSC) notation is used for describing a communication scenario that can occur between communicating entities. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used for defining the details of the messages sent during the communication scenario. The objective is that the proposed modelling approach can be used in different applications areas where monitoring of sequential activities is involved. As an experimental case, the proposed modelling approach is applied in part of network intrusion detection where intrusions and legitimate network traffic is modelled using the approach. The experimental case will demonstrate that the proposed modelling approach provides simple but effective way to model different activities and utilize those models in network intrusion detection.

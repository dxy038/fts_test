In the competitive environment of international higher education-related services, the concept of students as &#8220;customers&#8221; becomes a competitive imperative. Seeing students as &#8220;customers&#8221; increases a dialogue-based relationship between universities and students having a positive impact on students´ satisfaction. And students´ satisfaction has a significant positive effect on their loyalty which even can promote their success. In order to increase students´ satisfaction with their university, in this paper we propose a mobile application Fer Droid that can be used for data aggregation from different student information systems. Our application saves students´ precious time leaving them more time for other activities (e.g. studying, training and dating). We made both subjective (using students´ surveys) and objective analyses of Fer Droid and concluded that students are more satisfied and can retrieve information much quicker when using our solution than when using complex web pages on phones.

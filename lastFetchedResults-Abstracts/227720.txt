A bidirectional power flow, three-phase AC/DC converter is presented to implement
power factor correction, regulate the DC-bus voltage and draw balanced and sinusoidal line
currents from AC source. Four switches are adopted in each converter leg to generate a three-level
PWM waveform on the AC terminal to neutral-point voltages. Compared with conventional threephase
three-level converters, the proposed converter has a simpler circuit configuration and fewer
power semiconductors. The classical proportional-integral voltage controller and carrier-based
current controller are adopted in the outer loop and inner loop to implement DC-bus voltage
regulation and current-command tracking, respectively. Simulation and experimental results verify
the validity and effectiveness of the control scheme.

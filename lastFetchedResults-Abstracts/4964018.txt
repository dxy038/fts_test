This paper presents the design and implementation of power converters for wind generator (WG) controlled by a digital signal processor. The system is composed of a wind generator, lead-acid batteries, a DC/DC boost converter and a bidirectional DC/DC converter. The wind generator is the main power source of the system, and the battery is used for energy storage and power compensation to recover the natural irregularity of the wind power. Since the output power of wind generator varies with the change of wind speed, the flexible control strategy is used to determine the system working state and the operating mode of bi-directional DC/DC converter. In charging mode, the battery is charged by multi-stage current charging method with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm to raise the charging efficiency and completely employ the finite power. This paper adopts wind generator simulation system as the power source. Finally, a 100 W power converter system is constructed and the performance is verified.

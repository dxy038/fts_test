Injection molding is a material processing field in which a lot of new developments have been arisen last years. These new developments are related to new processing technologies derived from conventional injection molding, such as in-mold decoration injection molding, usage of recycled row material, and technologies that imply non-asymmetries in flow advancement into the mold. Rheological characterization of the behavior of material for these new situations is hard to carry out by traditional methods like a capillary rheometer. By the other side, the rheological characterization is necessary when working with CAE systems, to simulate injection process an advance. The objective of the research carried out is mainly to develop a methodology for rheological characterization of materials by means of a spiral mold, which can take into account non-conventionalities of injection molding. It is also an objective to apply the developed methodology to the characterization of a recycled material, to obtain the rheological model constants and viscosity curves, that allow to introduce them into a CAE system. Results obtained will detail the steps to follow when applying the methodology, and its application to extract the rheological model constants for a recycled material and its corresponding virgin material.

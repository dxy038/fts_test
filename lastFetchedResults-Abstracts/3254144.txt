This paper presents results in cloning Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) component behavior using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) component. Both FIS and ANN components are part of the intelligent framework VIMAS developed in Java programming language. VIMAS objective is to enable integration of the computational methods in a holistic manner. The FIS component generates training set for the ANN component containing a sequence of representative input combinations accompanied with the respective output. The FIS component sends necessary configuration data and training set data to the ANN component. After the training, the ANN component is presented with input data, and results are compared.

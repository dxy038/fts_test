This work deals with the problem of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function(BRDF) from a fractal surface. In this paper, the rough surface are modeled by a band-limited Weierstrass fractal function. According to the Kirchhoff approximation for rough surface scattering, an expression of the BRDF for the fractal rough surface is derived. The angular distributions of the BRDF from the fractal surface for different fractal dimensions and different fundamental wave number are studied by theoretic analysis and numerical calculations.

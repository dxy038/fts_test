Objective
m of this study was to investigate the possibility of Jixueteng as a preventive and therapeutic drug for the periodontitis. We investigated the inhibitory effects of Jixueteng on Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced bone loss in mice, antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis and differentiation of osteoclast and viability of cells.
als and methods
four male, 4-week-old C57BL/6N mice, were randomly divided into the following three groups of 18 mice each; group A served as the P. gingivalis non-infected control (sham group), group B was infected orally with P. gingivalis and group C was administered Jixueteng extract in drinking water and was then infected with P. gingivalis. In order to evaluate the effect of Jixueteng, the distance from the alveolar bone crest to the cemento-enamel junction was determined. P. gingivalis suspension was exposed for 1, 15 and 60 min to 5 ml of the Jixueteng extract. Furthermore, to clarify the mechanism of the inhibitory effects of Jixueteng on osteoclast formation, Jixueteng extract was added to the culture of mouse bone marrow cells, osteoclast precursor.
s
stration of Jixueteng along with P. gingivalis infection significantly reduced alveolar bone loss compared to P. gingivalis infection. Jixueteng treatment at the concentration of 0.01% significantly inhibited osteoclast formation. The addition of Jixueteng extract (0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001%) to the culture showed a significant inhibition of the number of surviving osteoclasts in a dose-dependent manner.
sion
eng has an antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis and inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis, it may be useful as a therapeutic drug in the treatment of P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis.

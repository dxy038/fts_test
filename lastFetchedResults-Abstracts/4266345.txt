The authors describe an indoor bidirectional message paging system which has good frequency utilization and serviceability. The trial system adopts microcells (with a zone radius of 50 to 100 m) and half-duplex communication using the carrier-sense multiple-access with collision detection access method in the 420 MHz band with an occupied bandwidth of 12.5 kHz and a transmission power of 10 mW, according to the Japanese RCR STD-3 standard. Messages of up to 64 alphanumeric or 32 Japanese (Kanji) characters can be transmitted from a pocket-sized mobile terminal using a direct-conversion FSK (frequency-shift keying) modem. The modem enables the size of the mobile terminal to be the same as that of the conventional message pager. The basic concept of this system can also be applied to future microcell public message communication systems

Urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) is the second common form of tuberculosis (TB) in countries with severe epidemic
situation and the third common form in regions with low incidence of TB. UGTB is complicated by bladder
TB in more than half of cases; late diagnosis and/or absence of pathogenetic therapy leads to the development of
shrinked bladder. The intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) after transurethral resection (TUR) in Ta and
T1 bladder cancer provides a significantly better prophylaxis of tumour recurrence than TUR alone. Nevertheless
alongside with positive results many complications of BCG therapy, including lethal, were noted. We describe two
cases of shrinked bladder TB – one was caused by M. tuberculosis, and second – by M. bovis.

The technology of high precision attitude determination with low precision sensors based on data fusion is the objective requirement of modern small satellite. This paper presents a new attitude determination algorithm termed Pre-process EKF(PP-EKF) based on preprocess of sensor data. It can enhance the overall modeling accuracy by using the quadratic penalty function to correct the kinematics model error and angular velocity error in real-time. The measurement model of EKF is linearized by introducing q method the solution error of which is also corrected to futher improve the accuracy of the measurement model and make better use of measurement data from low precision sensors, so as to ultimately obtain good attitude determinination results. At last, the simulation results demonstrate the high reliability and advantages of the proposed algorithm.

Optical-wireless access technologies have been considered the most promising solution to achieve effective delivery of wireless and baseband signals. They increase the bandwidth and extend the transmission distance at a lower budget and environmentally friendly. The means to accomplish this aim is to simplify the design by gigabit passive optical networks (GPON) via radio over fibre (RoF), which is able to provide much higher total bandwidth at a longer connection distance. The integration of an 18 channel coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) in the GPON, allows the use of less expensive, un-cooled lasers, operating with reduced energy consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate the deployment of a combined wireless system, 3.5GHz WiMAX, 2.6GHz LTE and baseband signals with a bit rate of 2.5Gbps downlink and 1.25Gbps uplink in GPON-CWDM via RoF technology. The signals are transmitted to the bidirectional splitter-32 for 160km bidirectional SMF length and from the splitter to WDM-DEMUX for 50km SMF length. The CDF and CFBG are utilized to increase signal transmissions distance. As a result, we achieve an extension of the transmission distance to 600km. Furthermore, the results indicate open eye diagrams, a clear RF and bandwidth spectrum and consultation diagram as well as low-energy consumption; Q- factor, SNR and OSNR have improved.

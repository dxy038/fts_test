In this paper, we propose neural network approach for multicriteria solid transportation problems(STP). First we suggest a neural network architecture to solve single-objective STP according to augmented Lagrange multiplier method. Due to the massive computing unit-neurons and parallel mechanism of neural network approach can solve the large scale problem efficiently and optimal solution can be got. Then we transform the original multicriteria problem into a single objective problem by global criteria method and adopt the neural network approach to solve it. By this way we can get the satisfactory solution of the original problem. The procedure and efficiency of this approach are shown with numerical simulations.

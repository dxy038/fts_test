This paper considers a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with discrete event simulation to solve redundancy allocation problems in systems subject to imperfect repairs. In the multi-objective formulation, system availability and cost may be maximized and minimized, respectively; the failure-repair processes of system components are modeled by Generalized Renewal Processes. The presented methodology provides a set of compromise solutions that incorporate not only system configurations, but also the number of maintenance teams. The multi-objective GA is validated via examples with analytical solutions and shows its superior performance when compared to a multi-objective Ant Colony algorithm. Moreover, an application example is presented and a return of investment analysis is suggested to aid the decision maker in choosing a solution of the obtained set.

As computer power has increased, so has the capability of software developers to write programs that assist people with time-consuming tasks. Mathematica is such a program. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how Mathematica, a symbolic programming environment, can be used to aid simulation analysis. In addition to a general discussion of MathematicaÂ´s uses, advantages, and disadvantages, several examples are presented. The examples include using Mathematica for distribution fitting, queueing analysis, random number generation, and creating a surface plot for optimization

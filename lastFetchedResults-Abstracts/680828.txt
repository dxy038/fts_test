A one-way nesting technique is implemented in the mesoscale model MEMO with the objective to generate numerically lateral boundary values for high resolution wind flow simulations. This is of special importance in cases where measured data are too sparse for the proper description of the flow outside of the model domain. The presented technique does not require a filter to dampen spurious wave energy.
The nested version of MEMO is used to simulate the wind flow in the Greater Athens Area (GAA) in the framework of the international model intercomparison activity APSIS. Simulation results of both the nested and the unnested model version are evaluated by the aid of measured data. The evaluation results reveal that implementing the nesting technique in the prognostic mesoscale model MEMO improves the calculated results.

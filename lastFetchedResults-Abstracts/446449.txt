Background: Axillary lymph node status is important for staging and planning therapy prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancers (LABC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of axillary ultrasonography coupled with fine needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) to determine lymph node status prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Methods: Patients with a LABC, defined as a breast cancer clinically larger than 3.0 cm or a cytology positive axillary lymph node, were evaluated by clinical examination followed by ultrasonographic evaluation. Lymph nodes were categorized as suspicious for malignancy based on size >1.0 cm, decrease in the fatty hilum, or parenchymal echogenicity. US-FNAB was performed on all patients. Most patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by definitive surgery. Axillary surgery consisted of axillary lymph node dissection. Axillary status by clinical examination and US-FNAB was compared with that obtained by axillary node dissection.

Results: From January 1998 to May 2001, 26 patients (27 axillae) presented with LABC to our institution. The median age of these patients was 48 years. The sensitivity and specificity of US-FNAB for evaluating axillary metastatic disease in patients with LABC were 100% and 100%, respectively.

Conclusions: In patients with locally advanced breast cancer, axillary ultrasonography coupled with fine needle aspiration biopsy can accurately stage the axilla. It is particularly useful and should be used more frequently in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The use of ultrasonography to stage the axilla in patients who present with small breast cancers should be explored.

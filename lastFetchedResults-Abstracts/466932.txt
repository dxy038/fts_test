Objective: This study was designed to determine whether immediate cesarean delivery for patients with severe preeclampsia confers any benefit to the mother or neonate. Study Design: This retrospective chart review included all deliveries complicated by severe preeclampsia between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000. Cesarean deliveries performed for malpresentation, previous classic incision, multiple gestation, placenta previa, and herpetic outbreak were not included. Demographic variables, maternal outcomes, and neonatal outcomes were collected. Results: Of 114 patients, 93 had an option regarding route of delivery. Thirty-four had an immediate cesarean section and 59 had induction of labor. Thirty-seven of 59 were delivered vaginally and 22 of 59 underwent cesarean delivery. Pulmonary complications in the mother and neonate were more common in cesarean delivery (P< .05). No morbidity was decreased by cesarean delivery. Bishop score and gestational age did not affect the labor induction success rate. Conclusion: Immediate cesarean delivery confers no benefit to patients with severe preeclampsia.

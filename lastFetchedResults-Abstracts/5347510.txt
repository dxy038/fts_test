The channel assignment problem is the problem of determining an optimal allocation of channels to mobile users that minimizes call-blocking and call-dropping probabilities. The power control problem is the problem of determining an optimal allocation of power levels to transmitters such that minimizes power consumption. In wireless mobile networks, channels and transmitter powers are limited resources and an efficient use of both these resources can greatly increase the network´s capacity. However, very few papers have attempted to concurrently optimize both resource with significant success. We propose a multi-objective evolution strategy that combines the optimizations of channel assignment and power control. Preliminary results show substantial increase in network´s capacity when compared with some current channel assignment method

  Objective(s):In insulin resistance, the insulin action in liver, muscles and adipocytes decreases and result in hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hyperinsulinemia. In this study we evaluate the effect of Zataria multiflora extract on insulin sensitivity in high fructose fed insulin resistant rats, since this extract was shown antihyperglycemic effect in streptozotocin induced diabetes in rats.   Materials and Methods:Experimental rats were fed with high fructose diet for 6 weeks and then were treated with Z. multiflora extractor a pioglitazone solution for 2 weeks. Blood and tissue samples were collected for analysis at the end of two weeks. Blood glucose, serum level of triglyceride and cholesterol were measured by auto analyzer. Insulin and adiponectin levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Plasma free fatty acids profile was studied by gas chromatography.  Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR.γ) and Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT.4) gene expressions were assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting. Results: Animals were treated by Z. multiflora extractshowed insulin (43±11pmol/l), adiponectin (5.3±0.5 μg/ml), glucose (144±9.8 mg/dl), and triglyceride (120±10 mg/dl) levels significantly improved as compare with the control group [insulin (137±34 pmol/l), adiponectin (3.9±0.15 μg/ml), glucose (187±15mg/dl), and triglycerides (217±18 mg/dl)]. PPARγ protein level, also significantly increased in Zataria multiflora treated group. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the beneficial effects of Zataria multiflora extract on insulin resistance in rats fed with a high-fructose diet through at least three mechanisms including direct insulin like effect, increasing in adiponectin and of PPARγ protein expression.

The selection of projects for implementation in the competitive telecommunications market is difficult after deregulation. Most projects are governed by the complexity of a firm´s policy structure and the inexactness of the database behind them. This research studies project ranking with a fuzzy expert system in order to help practising managers to prioritize projects for deploying telecommunication nodes to target buildings in an efficient and effective manner. A criterion function is constructed by which the relative merits of the projects in achieving a set of objectives are evaluated for assessment. Fuzzy theory with linguistic characterization of the projects´ entries and a compositional interference set are employed for the assessment of the value, cost and risk associated with project compatibility. The problem domain is confined to access-network project ranking issues of the competitive fixed telecommunication network services industry in Hong Kong, where the monopoly industry was deregulated in the second half of 1995. A prototype of a fuzzy rule-based inference system called TANPR (Telecommunication Access Network Project Ranking) is developed to evaluate the importance of a pool of compatible projects meeting the objective specifications

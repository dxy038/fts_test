This paper compares the effectiveness of five state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) together with a steady state evolutionary algorithm on the meanâ€“variance cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem (MVCCPO). The main computational challenges of the model are due to the presence of a nonlinear objective function and the discrete constraints. The MOEAs considered are the Niched Pareto genetic algorithm 2 (NPGA2), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), Pareto envelope-based selection algorithm (PESA), strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2), and e-multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (e-MOEA). The computational comparison was performed using formal metrics proposed by the evolutionary multiobjective optimization community on publicly available data sets which contain up to 2196 assets.

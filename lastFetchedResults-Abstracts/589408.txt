Background and Objective: Concerning performing effective exercise (intensity, duration, type and number of sessions in a week), there are different recommendations for diabetic patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of five weeks of daily aerobic exercise training and every other day aerobic training for ten weeks in the women with type 2 diabetes. 

Materials and Methods: Thirty six women with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into three groups: daily 5-week aerobic exercise training group (12 women), every other day 10-week aerobic exercise training group (12 women) and control group. Aerobic training was conducted with an intensity of 60%-70% of maximum heart rate for 30-60 min per session. Measurements and blood sampling in the beginning of research protocol, after 5 weeks and 10 weeks after implementation of research protocols were conducted. For analyzing the data, ANOVA with replications and One-Way ANOVA were applied. 

Results: Five-week daily aerobic exercise training did not have a significant effect on weight (p=0.5), body fat index (p=0.54), BMI (p=0.65), adiponectin (p=0.91), and insulin (p=0.06). Ten week every other day aerobic exercise training also did not have a significant effect on weight (p=0.35), body fat index (p=0.30), BMI (p=0.27), adiponectin (p=0.51), insulin (p=0.51), HbA1C (p=0.34), glucose (P=0.94) and the insulin resistance index (p=0.53). There was not also a significant difference between these two protocols of aerobic training. 

Conclusion: Five week daily aerobic training or 10 week every other day aerobic training do not have a significant effect in diabetic patients and for effective aerobic training, these patients should perform these trainings within a prolonged duration.

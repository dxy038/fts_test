It is intended that the German regulatory authority establishes a quality regulation for electricity distribution networks. Therefore reliability indices are evaluated and based on this a monetary punishment or recompense of network operators is realised. In order to estimate the financial risk induced by this procedure, the probability distributions of the reliability indices are necessary. Within this paper a method is introduced with the objective to estimate the probability distribution of reliability indices of medium voltage networks. In consequence of this research project it is possible to compare different alternatives of quality regulation approaches and to estimate their effects on the network operators.

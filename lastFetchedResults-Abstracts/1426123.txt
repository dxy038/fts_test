Objective
lyse the quality of life (QoL) of patients with panic disorder of recent onset and to find related clinical variables.

disorder patients with and without agoraphobia (N = 125) in the first stages of the disorder (median of 8 months since the first panic attack) were compared with a community control group. Quality of life was evaluated by 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and by a single-item scale evaluating subjective well-being.
s
disorder patients had worse scores than the general population in all of the dimensions of the SF-36. Anxiety and depressive symptoms, age, frequency of panic attacks and agoraphobic avoidance accounted for 18â€“42% of the variance in QoL scores. Frequency of panic attacks and agoraphobic avoidance were variables accounting for poor QoL in physical functioning and mental health respectively. However, unspecific factors in addition to panic symptomatology, particularly depressive and anxiety symptoms, significantly contribute to the worse QoL of these patients.
sion
disorder of recent onset is a deteriorating condition. Clinical variables do not equally affect mental health and physical functioning, and unspecific factors in addition to panic contribute to the poor QoL.

Introduction: Corrosion is a physical and chemical reaction occurring between a substance and its surrounding environment leading to the change in the substance properties. Nowadays, corrosion has become one of the biggest issues in water quality control and can financially damage the water pipes and other water transmission and distribution installations. In addition, the penetration of heavy metal into water as a result of corrosion can be a threat to the consumers' health conditions. Because of such negative health effects, regular chemical quality control of water seems mandatory.

Objective: To investigate the corrosion or precipitation potentials of drinking water in Anzali, which is supplied by Guilan water treatment plant and deep water wells.

Materials and Methods: To do so, parameters including pH, temperature, calcium hardness, alkalinity and Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) were measured and based on their values, four indices including Langelier Saturation Index, Ryzner Saturation Index, Aggressive index and Pokurious index were determined.

Results: As revealed, the average values for Langelier Saturation, Ryzner Saturation, Aggressive and Pokurious indices were respectively(-0.89), (9.29] (12.4) and (8.82).

Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that Anzali water resources have corrosion potential and are corrosive and thus can threaten the consumers' health status in the long term.

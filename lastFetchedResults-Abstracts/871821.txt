Bali sardine resource in Bali Strait is abundant enough. However overfished of the resource has occured due to
excessive exploitation. Objective of this research was to determine the smallest mesh size of gillnet. Two
different mesh sizes of the gillnet were used to define gear selectifity, namely 2.54 cm and 3.75 cm. Biological
parameters to be examined were total length, body girth, body weight, sex, and gonad maturity. While length of
frequency data was analyzed by applying the approach of normal distribution. In addition, the research applied
curve selectivity approach to determine the smallest mesh size of fishing gear. Result showed that value
selection factor (S) of the gear toward the fish was 5.89. While minimum mesh size of the gear to catch mature
fish (Lm ? 17.1 cm) was 2.94 cm. The research reccommended that minimum mesh size of gillnet be at 2.94 cm
and size of fish landed be higher than 17.3 cm.

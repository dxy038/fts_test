A Versatile image processing technique used in a system can be very instrumental for radiologist in detecting and diagnosing subtle signs with more accuracy and reliability than distinctive screening programs. In this paper, an algorithm based on morphological processing for enhancing architecture distortion alias subtle signs patterns in digital mammograms is suggested. The results demonstrate that proposed method has improved contrast both in objective as well as subjective manner. The proposed method in comparison to other methods gives better results in terms of various quality metrics used in algorithm.

Capabilities-based weapon system of systems planning (CBWSoSP) problem is widely researched in defense domain nowadays. To solve this problem, a tri-level mission-capability-project analysis framework is proposed. This framework mainly focuses on relationship analyses, which are mission-capability relationship and capability-project relationship. Then a bi-level programming model is presented to solve CBWSoSP problem. In the upper layer of the model, the objectives are maximizing the possibilities of mission achievement with the amount of resources as decision vectors. In the lower layer, the maximization of capabilities is formulated as objective functions with resources allocation as decision vectors. A SPEA2-based algorithm is used to solve the model under some hypothesis. The difficulty of the model building in real world and future work are discussed finally.

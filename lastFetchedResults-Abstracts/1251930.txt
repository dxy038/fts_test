In this study, an inexact fuzzy-chance-constrained two-stage mixed-integer linear programming (IFCTIP) approach is developed for flood diversion planning under multiple uncertainties. A concept of the distribution with fuzzy boundary interval probability is defined to address multiple uncertainties expressed as integration of intervals, fuzzy sets and probability distributions. IFCTIP integrates the inexact programming, two-stage stochastic programming, integer programming and fuzzy-stochastic programming within a general optimization framework. IFCTIP incorporates the pre-regulated water-diversion policies directly into its optimization process to analyze various policy scenarios; each scenario has different economic penalty when the promised targets are violated. More importantly, it can facilitate dynamic programming for decisions of capacity-expansion planning under fuzzy-stochastic conditions. IFCTIP is applied to a flood management system. Solutions from IFCTIP provide desired flood diversion plans with a minimized system cost and a maximized safety level. The results indicate that reasonable solutions are generated for objective function values and decision variables, thus a number of decision alternatives can be generated under different levels of flood flows.

Of the remaining 68 mothers, finally, by the clinical interview, 26 subjects (age: 29.23M =  39.2SD =) achieved the Inclusion criteria. Then, they were appointed in control and experimental groups by random assignment. Members who attended in experimental group achieved 10 sessions of weekly group therapy by existential method,   but the control group received no intervention. Finally, members of both groups completed   Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS).

The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) is the next generation Department of Defense (DoD) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) satellite communications (SATCOM) system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the code division multiple access (CDMA) waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. In addition to providing point-to-point capability between MUOS Functional Terminals (MFTs), MUOS also provides connectivity for the user to communicate with users on the Defense Switched Network (DSN) via the DoD Teleport sites. This allows the user on-demand capability for real-time reachback through the DSN. The current MUOS baseline allows for secure communications using the Secure Communication Interoperability Protocol (SCIP) to other SCIP-compatible and enabled devices within the DSN; however, the user community requested additional capability to allow MUOS users to establish and receive nonsecure voice calls through the DSN. The Narrowband SATCOM Systems Engineering Group (NSSEG) was given the responsibility of researching and developing solutions to allow MUOS users to connect to DSN with unclassified voice while still meeting encryption requirements over the satellite. The NSSEG was successful in identifying the requirements, candidate solutions, and obtaining the necessary funding for implementation. This paper will describe the results of the study and the implementation which has been recommended for development.

The objective of this study was to evaluate emitters clogging by root of grass for four types of inline emitters under subsurface drip irrigation system. The experimental treatments consisted of four discharge emitters include 3.5, 4, 2.2 and 2 liters per hour (respectively T3, T2, T1 and T4).  The four treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications for two years.  The soil texture of site was silty clay loam. Uniformity indexes at the beginning and end of the experiment consists of emitter flow variation (qvar), coefficient of variation (CV), coefficient of uniformity (CU), emission uniformity (EU), Range and statistical uniformity (Us)were measured. The EU value was 96, 87, 94, and 94% for new emitter in the beginning of the experiment and was 79, 19, 45, and 85% in the terminated of the experiment for T1, T2, T3, and T4 treatments, respectively. Our results showed that emitter clogging by root were 4% for T1 and T4 treatments, 24% for T2 and 36% for T3 treatments. Based on the findings emitters that were installed in the pipe (flat integral drip line) was more efficient than the cylindrical tube emitters clogging rooted.

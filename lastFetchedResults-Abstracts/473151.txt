These 25 lessons 1) review the roles of plasma renin levels for causing malignant and most essential hypertension and their related vascular injuries (heart attack, heart failure, kidney failure and stroke); 2) review how antihypertensive anti-R drugs that block renin activity (beta blockers, the first converting enzyme inhibitor from venom, and the first angiotensin receptor blocker) were used to reveal plasma renin involvement in the hypertension of medium and high renin patients and to show; 3) that the 30% with low renin essential hypertension do not respond to R drugs, are not prone to heart attack or stroke, and BP is corrected instead by the natriuretic anti-V drugs (diuretics, spironolactone, CCB, alpha blockers); 4) thus, all hypertensives can be divided into R patients who have too much renin vasoconstriction or V patients who instead have predominant sodium-volume mediation. Furthermore, all antihypertensive drug classes can be divided into R drugs that block the renin factor, or V drugs that reduce body sodium volume; 5) these findings document our conception of two biochemically and physiologically different final factors that sustain all BP in which the sodium-volume factor continuously sustains cardiac output and flow while plasma renin-angiotensin sets total peripheral resistance (TPR), which, within the Poiseuille Equation (BP = cardiac output [CO] × TPR) describes our [Na+-volume × renin-angiotensin vasoconstriction] model that supports all normotension or hypertension; 6) in this light, we designed a visit-by-visit method for treating untreated hypertensives using the ambient plasma renin level and BP responses to guide primary drug therapy against either the V or R factor; and 7) for also correcting nonresponders receiving multiple drugs where renin testing correctly guides addition or subtraction of drugs depending on whether the test indicates unresponsiveness due to a reactive sodium-volume excess, or to lack of effectiveness of an R drug in a V patient or of a V drug in an R patient, or from large reactive increases in renin that override the R drug, calling for strengthening the R and/or removing V drugs. This objective, biochemically based method results in effective longterm BP control of nearly all patients using fewer, but the correct drug(s) for each individual.

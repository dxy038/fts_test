A Monte Carlo simulation technique evaluates the reliability indices of restructured power systems with a hybrid market. A model for optimal transaction curtailment for a contingency state in a hybrid market is developed to incorporate the changes brought about by deregulation. The objective of the contingency optimal transaction curtailment for each individual generation company is to minimise its revenue loss. The problem is formulated as a linear programming problem and solved using an optimisation technique. Customer load curtailment, which is the basic parameter for reliability evaluation, is determined using a load-shedding philosophy which is based on the results of the optimal transaction curtailment by the genco. Supply and demand transactions of the market participants are represented by a transaction matrix. The impact of the firm and nonfirm bilateral and reserve contracts on customer reliabilities have been studied. The technique has been illustrated by application to the IEEE Reliability Test System.

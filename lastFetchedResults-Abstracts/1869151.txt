Background and Objective: Bio?lm is a complex microbial community embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix. We aimed to study the extent of biofilm formation by S. Areas isolates and its relation to some phenotypic and genotypic criteria. 

Material and Methods: One hundred-fifty strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from Gorgan were studied. Microtiter plate assay method was used for investigation of biofilm formation.The biofilm formation of strains were recorded and its relation to accessory gene regulator (agr) and antibiotic resistance were assessed by X2 test.

Results: Eighty-four isolates (56%) were able to form biofilm. The strength of biofilm formation in agr group I was more than that of other groups. The biofilm formation among S. aureus isolated from the wound and urine (both with 75 %) had the highest capability. Methicillin-resistant isolates had a greater ability to biofilm formation.

Conclusion: Methicillin resistant isolates had a greater ability to biofilm formation. Given the importance and treatment related problems of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) especially Community Acquired-Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (CA-MRSA), it is a necessity to control or remove the biofilm formation alongside antibiotic treatment.

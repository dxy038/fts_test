Objective: Assess the applicability of ion chromatography (IC) for human saliva studies. Materials and methods: The behaviour of an ion chromatograph (DX-100, Dionex) in the analysis of human saliva was examined in the following respects: calibration, reproducibility, recovery, and effect of pre-treatment conditions (dilution, temperature). The eluents used were 1.7 mM NaHCO3 + 1.8 mM Na2CO3 + 100 mg/L p-cyanophenol (2 mL/min) and 1.6 mM perfluorobutyric acid + 0.3 mM sodium hydroxide (0.3 mL/min) for inorganic and organic anions, respectively. Results: The calibration curves were satisfactorily linear, but did not have unit slope (logâ€“log plot) in the case of chloride, phosphate, sulphate and acetate. No significant effects were detected for centrifugation temperature, or between runs on the same occasion. Conclusion: IC appears to be a valuable technique well-suited to the efficient analysis of several salivary anions.

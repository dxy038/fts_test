The objective of this work is to study the effect of pMOSFETs lightly doped drain (p+LDD) using two different species of dopants; boron and boron di-flouride using TCAD Simulation. The result from this simulation was compared with electrical measurements on silicon wafers. In our experiments, we used the same dose for both of the dopants, at dose A. We only systematically split the energy for BF2 into three splits. 2D simulation results using TSUPREM-4 and MEDICI help us to understand the mechanism involved. Our results show improvement for the junction profile by comparing BF2 and boron. It has been reported before, that incorporating fluorine from BF2 dopant is very useful for the shallow junction devices (J.R. Pfiester et al., 1990). This beneficial effect of a BF2 p+LDD will make improvement on the device performance. Since the experiment is comparing the simulation data with the experimental data, it will be very useful for the process engineer to tune their process implant parameters for a future technology.

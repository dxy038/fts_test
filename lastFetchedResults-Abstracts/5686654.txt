Cloud computing is a promising IT paradigm which enables the InternetÂ´s evolution into a global market of collaborating services. Cloud computing semantic interoperability plays a key role in making this a reality. Towards this direction, a comprehensive and systematic survey of Cloud computing interoperability efforts by standardization groups, industry and research community is carried out. The main objective of this survey is to derive an initial set of semantic interoperability requirements to be supported by existing as well as next generation Cloud systems. O&#770;he survey motivates and encourages the Cloud community to adopt a common Cloud computing interoperability framework with core dimensions the creation of a common data model and a standardized Cloud interface (API), which will constitute the base for the development of a semantically interoperable Cloud environment.

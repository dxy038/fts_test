OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of transvesical prostatectomy with transurethral resection of prostate in respect to the presentation and severity of postoperative urinary incontinence.
DESIGN: Comparative study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: This study was carried out in two tertiary care centres. Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro from where all cases of TRUP were collected and Muhammad Medical College Mirpurkhas where all transvesical prostatectomies were performed. It was a two years study from April 2004 to March 2006.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups were made and 50 cases were kept in each group by
adopting non-probability convenient sampling technique. Patient underwent TURP were kept in
group A and transvesical prostatectomy group was titled as group B. Patients having
associated stricture urethra, urinary bladder stones or bladder diverticulum and later on proved
as carcinoma of prostate were excluded from the study. Urinary incontinence in patients after
both procedures was compared.
RESULTS: From group A 07 (14%) patients developed incontinence postoperatively and all had
stress type of incontinence. While in group B 11 (22%) patients developed urinary incontinence;
among them 05 (45.45%) had stress incontinence and 06 (54.55%) developed continuous urinary
leakage. Rate of recovery after conservative measures remained rapid with group A as
compared to group B.
CONCLUSION: Frequency and severity of postoperative urinary incontinence is more with
transvesical approach. But the facility of TURP is not freely available. Therefore improvement in
the technique of open prostatectomy is mandatory.

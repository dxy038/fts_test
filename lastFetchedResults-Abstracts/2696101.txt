The focus of this book (with invited papers from an International Conference) is to bring together the most active scholars working on the latest techniques, standards, and emerging deployment of wireless communications and smart vehicular systems. The objective is the successful fusion of speech, dialog, video, image, vehicular sensory data and wireless communication modalities in order to model driver??s behavior and use that model towards personalization of the vehicle to provide a more comfortable and safer driving environment. The book is divided in four parts: 1) driver and driving environment recognition, 2) telecommunication applications, 3) noise reduction and 4) dialog in vehicles.

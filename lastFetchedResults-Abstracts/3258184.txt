Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) under uncertain environment is still an open issue. The objective of this study is to propose a new AHP method based on Z-number. First, Z-number are taken into consideration. Zadeh [1] proposed a notion, namely Z-number, which is an order pair of fuzzy numbers (A, B). The first component, A, plays the role of a fuzzy restriction and the second component B is a reliability of the first component. It is new concept which has more power to describe the knowledge of human being and will be widely used in the uncertain information process [2, 3]. Second, a new AHP method based on Z-number is proposed to deal with linguistic decision making problems. Finally, by Z-number analytical hierarchy process (Z-number-AHP) a model is developed to search the criteriaÂ´s for the evaluation of best universities.

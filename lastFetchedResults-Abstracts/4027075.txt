The objective of this work is to develop a general method for the synthesis of a solution to the problem of designing positive real functions of a prefixed Hurwitz denominator polynomial. Such a synthesis problem is reduced to the calculation of the solution of an equivalent algebraic system of linear equations. The dual problem of designing the denominator polynomial for a prefixed given numerator polynomial is also focused on. The problem is first solved for rational realizable functions and extended in a natural way to nonrational ones by simply addition of single derivative blocks of positive gain. The possibility that common factors can appear &#8220;a prior&#8221; in the decomposition of the numerator polynomial in its real and imaginary parts is considered in the given synthesis procedure and it is then theoretically solved

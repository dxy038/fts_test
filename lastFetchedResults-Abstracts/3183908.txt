The objective of this paper is to develop a Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger. Since the heat exchanger is a highly non linear system, the operating zone of the system is divided into different zones. For each zone, a model is developed. Even though PID controllers are widely used for the control of heat exchangers, there is still a need for optimizing and conservation of energy. Here, a Model Based Predictive Controller is designed and is used for controlling the temperature of a fluid stream flowing out through the Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger. A PID controller is also designed. The tuning of PID controller is done using Zeigler Nichols method. The simulations of MPC and PID controller are performed using MATLAB. The transient results obtained using MPC is compared with that obtained using PID controller and an analysis is conducted.

The experiment was conducted using Fraxinus ornus plants grown outside under full sunlight irradiance, and supplied with 100% (well-watered, WW), 40% (mild drought, MD), or 20% (severe drought, SD) of the daily evapotranspiration demand, with the main objective of exploring the effect of excess light stress on the activity of antioxidant enzymes and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Net CO2 assimilation rate at saturating light and daily assimilated CO2 were significantly smaller in SD than in WW and MD plants. Xanthophyll-cycle pigments supported nonphotochemical quenching to a significantly greater extent in SD than in MD and WW leaves. As a consequence, the actual efficiency of PSII (ΦPSII) was smaller, while the excess excitation-energy in the photosynthetic apparatus was greater in SD than in WW or MD plants. The concentrations of violaxanthin-cycle pigments relative to total chlorophyll (Chltot) exceeded 200 mmol mol−1 Chltot in SD leaves at the end of the experiment. This leads to hypothesize for zeaxanthin a role not only as nonphotochemical quencher, but also as chloroplast antioxidant. Reductions in ascorbate peroxidase and catalase activities, as drought-stress progressed, were paralleled by greater accumulations of esculetin and quercetin 3-O-glycosides, both phenylpropanoids having effective capacity to scavenge H2O2. The drought-induced accumulation of esculetin and quercetin 3-O-glycosides in the vacuoles of mesophyll cells is consistent with their putative functions as reducing agents for H2O2 in excess light-stressed leaves. Nonetheless, the concentration of H2O2 and the lipid peroxidation were significantly greater in SD than in MD and WW leaves. It is speculated that vacuolar phenylpropanoids may constitute a secondary antioxidant system, even on a temporal basis, activated upon the depletion of primary antioxidant defences, and aimed at keeping whole-cell H2O2 within a sub-lethal concentration range.

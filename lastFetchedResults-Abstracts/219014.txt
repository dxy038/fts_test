Objective(s)
This study planned to assess the value of PCR IS6110 assay in tissue specimens of needle pleural biopsy in patients suspicious to pleural tuberculosis.
Materials and Methods
Sixty eight patients with lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion underwent pleural biopsy. Tissue samples were sent for pathologic examination and PCR IS6110 assay. The results of PCR reported as positive/ negative and assessed according to the current gold standard pathologic diagnosis.
Results
Twenty nine patients had tuberculous and 12 had malignant pleural involvement, respectively. The remaining 27 samples were reported as non-specific pleurisy. Results of PCR were positive in 35 out of 68 total subjects and in 19 out of 29 TB patients. Sensitivity and specificity of PCR were calculated as 67.9% and 62.5%, respectively. 
Conclusion
An acceptable sensitivity and specificity for PCR examination of pleural tissue can serves it as a useful adjunct in undergoing needle pleural biopsy for possibility of tuberculosis

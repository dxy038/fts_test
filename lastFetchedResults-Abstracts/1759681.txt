AbstractObjective
rrent study sought to evaluate patterns of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in a sample of Latino and non-Latino white (NLW) children with asthma to determine whether parental beliefs about conventional medications and barriers to obtaining these medications were related to CAM use and to assess whether CAM use was associated with decreased adherence to controller medications.
s
ipants included 574 families of children with asthma from NLW, Puerto Rican (PR), and Dominican backgrounds from Rhode Island (RI) and from Island PR. All parents completed a brief checklist of barriers to medication use and an assessment of CAM approaches. A subsample of 259 families had controller medication use monitored objectively for approximately 1 month by MDILog (fluticasone propionate), TrackCap (montelukast), or dosage counter (fluticasone/salmeterol combination).
s
ence of CAM use was high among Latino families. Perceived barriers to obtaining medication were related to increased CAM use in PR families from RI. Elevated medication concerns were positively associated with CAM use among NLW and Island PR families. CAM use was positively related to objective adherence within NLW families, and unrelated in other groups.
sions
e is common among Latino families with asthma. Among some families, CAM use may be initiated as a way to cope with barriers to obtaining medication or when parents have concerns about conventional medications. Families who report CAM use do not appear to be substituting CAM for conventional asthma medication.

To meet the needs of the underwater vehicle hovering control, the paper developed a digital simulator for water system entities hovering underwater vehicle physics platform. A vector equation of motion underwater vertical transport is created and the deep manipulation of the equations of motion and equilibrium equations is given. Therefore, the underwater vehicle motion parameters is obtained. The injection pressure of the water tank drainage model is established. To further improve the accuracy and make the simulation results close to the actual test, the media flow conduit model, the movement model of the electro-hydraulic ball valve, slothing model of three DOF coupled fluid and multivariate function generator model is established. The motion parameters are also carried into these models to obtain correction coefficient for objective function. The results show that the proposed system has good performance in control precision, synchronization, response time and steady-state error which can meet the engineering requirements of simulating the process of hovering control of actual underwater vehicle.

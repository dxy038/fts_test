This work presents the application of fuzzy predictive control to a solar power plant. The proposed predictive controller uses fuzzy characterization of goals and constraints, based on the fuzzy optimization framework for multi-objective satisfaction problems. This approach enhances model based predictive control (MBPC) allowing the specification of more complex requirements. A brief description of the solar power plant and its simulator is given. Basic concepts of predictive control and fuzzy predictive control are introduced. Two fuzzy predictive controllers using different membership functions are designed for a solar power plant, and they are compared with a classical predictive controller. The simulation results show that the fuzzy MBPC formulation, based on a well proven successful algorithm, gives a greater flexibility to characterize the goals and constraints than classical control.

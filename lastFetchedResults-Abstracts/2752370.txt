This paper presents a method for two-way ultrasonic communication and power delivery through thick metallic enclosures without physical penetration. Acousticelectric channels are implemented using a pair of coaxially aligned piezoelectric transducers having 25.4 mm diameters and 1 MHz nominal resonant frequencies, mounted on steel walls having lengths in the range of 57.15 to 304.8 mm. A protocol is described which uses ultrasonic waves to achieve simultaneous bidirectional communication through the metallic enclosures. It is shown that such channels are very frequency selective, and a carrier frequency selection and tracking algorithm is presented to choose a frequency of operation at which both adequate power delivery and reliable full-duplex communication are achieved. Using this algorithm, sufficient power is harvested to allow for the continuous operation of internal electronics which require an aggregate of less than 100 mW. Reliable communication of sensor data is achieved at rates in excess of 30 kbps.

We propose a novel approach to drawing graphs that simultaneously optimizes two criteria (i) preserving proximity relations as measured by some embedding objective, and (ii) minimizing edge crossings, to create a clear representation of the underlying graph structure. Frequently, the nodes of the graph represent objects that have their own intrinsic properties with associated distances or similarity measures.

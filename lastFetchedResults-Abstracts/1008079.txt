This paper presents the results of current research on the fatigue life prediction of carbon/epoxy laminate composites involving twelve balanced woven bidirectional layers of carbon fibres and epoxy resin manufactured by a vacuum moulding method. The plates were produced with 3 mm thickness and 0.66 fibre weight fraction. The dog bone shape specimens were cut from these plates with the load line aligned with one of the fibre directions. The fatigue tests were performed using load control with a frequency of 10 Hz and at room temperature. The fatigue behaviour was studied for different stress ratios and for variable amplitude block loadings. The damage process was monitored in terms of the stiffness loss. The fatigue life of specimens submitted to block loading tests was modelled using Palmgren–Miner’s law and taking in to account the stress ratio effect. The estimated and experimental fatigue lives were compared and good agreement was observed.

A methodology for implementing the Newton-Euler (NE) equations of motion on the mu PD77230 signal processor is presented. The targeted application is the control of robot arms, with a dual emphasis on performance and flexibility. The controller interprets high-level control commands and performs required computations without host intervention. The design objective was a relatively inexpensive host computer to control multiple robot arms without substantial programming or computational overhead. An option is provided for dividing torque computation into parallel tasks for improved speed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

This paper presents a study of the dynamic behavior of joining hybrid parts, stainless
steel and aluminum alloy, by MIG welding. The objective is to analyze the effect of
welding on dissimilar plates of stainless steel and aluminum. A finite element model of
joining stainless steel and aluminum alloy by welding was built using a structural threedimensional
(3D) solid modeling element. Impact testing using hammer excitation and
accelerometer response measuring techniques was conducted to measure the vibration
properties of the hybrid parts. The natural frequency and the mode shape graph from
experimental modal analysis were then compared with the results that were obtained
from finite elements (FE) and showed good agreement. Joining welding gives effect to
dynamic properties (mode shape) of modal analysis, especially mode 1,3 (bending
pattern) and mode 4 (second twisting). The results show significant points about the
effect of MIG welding of dissimilar plate in terms of their dynamic properties compared
to welding of the same material. Through comparison of the simulation results and the
experimental measurements, it can be assumed that, besides the welding-brazing
process, other key manufacturing processes such as cladding, buttering and heat
treatment should also be taken into account to accurately predict the dynamic properties
in the whole range of dissimilar metal joining.

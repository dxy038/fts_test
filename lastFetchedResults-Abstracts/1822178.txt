Objective
m was to examine dental and periodontal status of adult Croatian 18th century population and compare the results with available literature data.
als and methods
ecimens from the crypt of Po≈æega cathedral were grouped into three female and three male groups according to age. Caries was determined by visual inspection and dental probe. Ante and post mortem teeth losses were recorded. Periodontal status was determined according to the length of exposed tooth root from alveolar crest to cemento-enamel junction. The presence of dehiscences and fenestrations was recorded on facial and oral plate of alveolar bone.
s
ole sample exhibited ante- and post mortem teeth loss of 19.57% and 24.91%, respectively. The teeth most frequently lost postmortem were incisors. The canines were best preserved. The frequency of caries in both jaws was the highest in molars (26.63% in maxilla and 28.10% in mandible), whilst central incisors exhibited the least carious lesions (11.59 and 1.92%). The most frequently affected surfaces were occlusal, then proximal and facio-oral. The percentage of teeth with either moderate or considerable bone loss was higher in females. The frequency of considerable bone loss increased significantly with age. The frequency of dehiscences was 3.11%. It was higher in maxilla than in the mandible. The frequency of fenestrations was 5.65% and it was significantly higher in maxilla.
sions
sults demonstrate poor oral health amongst 18th century population of continental Croatia, exhibiting high antemortem teeth loss, high periodontal disease frequency and occlusal and proximal caries frequency.

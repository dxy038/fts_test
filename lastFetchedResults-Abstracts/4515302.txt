We introduce an algorithm for reconstructing a solid model given a series of planar cross sections. The main contribution of this work is the use of knowledge obtained during the interpolation of neighboring layers while attempting to interpolate a particular layer. This knowledge is used to reconstruct a surface in which consecutive layers are connected smoothly. In most previous work, each layer is interpolated independently of what happened or will happen in the other layers. We also discuss various objective functions which aim to optimize the reconstruction, and present an evaluation of the different objective functions by using various criteria.

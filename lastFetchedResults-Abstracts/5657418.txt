The traditional evaluate method can not deal with the evaluation of the air quality with fuzzy information, the degree of air pollution has a fuzzy concept, it means that the fuzzy mathematics theory can be used to evaluate the air quality. As the praxis of fuzzy mathematics, fuzzy mathematics assessment is prevalent used in many fields, for it is a simple mathematical model that can be easily used by us. Fuzzy mathematics assessment has advantage to solve the complex problem which has many different factors. Using it to evaluate the quality of water can get an objective result. It´s known to US all that sandstorms and the dust and gases from volcanoes pollute the earth´s atmosphere naturally, but the most serious kind of air pollution comes from human beings. It´s significant to constrain human activities and prevent air pollution by grasping situation of air quality scientifically.

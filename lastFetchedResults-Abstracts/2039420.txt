The main objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and business flexibility, which can be useful for a wide range of users of financial statements in making economic decisions. Financial information should be related to the decisions of users, including investors. In Iranâ€™s financial standards, parent companies are required to give both consolidated financial statement as well as non-consolidated (parent- only) financial statement. Hence, the following questions arises- which one of these two sets has a higher value relevance and thus, can provide the required information to investors and other users. In this study, the value relevance of information of consolidated and non-consolidated financial information of member companies in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) has been studied, for a period of 6 years, the years 2007 to 2012. The multiple regression models based on stock price valuation approach are used to test hypotheses and investigate the relation between consolidated and non-consolidated accounting information, and stock price. According the results of the F-Limer and Hausman tests to estimate each of the models, the panel data with fixed effects are used. Research findings suggest that the consolidated accounting information has a higher value relevance than non-consolidated accounting information. In other words, the consolidated accounting information has more information content. In addition, the results indicate that the information provided in both consolidated financial statement and parent- only financial statement together, has more value relevance than consolidated financial statement.

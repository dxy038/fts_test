Objective: To analyze the frequency and visual outcome of anterior segment involvement in accidental ocular trauma in children. Methodology: This descriptive case series was conducted in the Department of Ophthalmology Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from 15th June 2007 to 15th October 2008 on 200 cases of anterior segment involvement in children during accidental ocular trauma. Patients were admitted through casualty or Outpatient Department. After detailed history, systemic examination and complete ocular examination was done including visual acuity, slit lamp examination and examination under anesthesia when necessary. Results: In this study, male children constituted 74.5% (149) and females 25.5% (51) of the total. Children between ages of 6-10 years are more vulnerable (42 %). Injury caused by blunt object was seen in 64.05% (129) of children and mostly it was due to stone in 21.50 % (71). The commonest place of injury was indoors in 38.50% (77), followed by playgrounds in 28.00% (56) and on streets and roads in 21.5% (43). The visual acuity on arrival was PL + ve in (35.5%) and open globe injury was observed in 36.0%. At the end of two months 13.5% eyes were phthisical. Conclusion: Blunt ocular trauma is a common ocular trauma in children with males more vulnerable. School going children are more at risk. Blunt trauma especially because of stone is the main culprit with devastating visual results.

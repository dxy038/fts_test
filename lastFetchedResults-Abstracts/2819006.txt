Currently, all Internet and ICT users need basic levels of cyber security awareness and knowledge to perform their daily activities securely. Many security specialists and, indeed, nations are acknowledging the need for populaces to be aware of and educated about being more cyber secure. To achieve cyber security in current populations and to ensure continuity in future populaces, a &#8220;self-renewing&#8221; belief which affects behavior is needed. In an organizational context this need is met through the fostering of an information security culture (ISC). Similarly, in a societal context a cyber security culture (CSC) ought to be fostered. This raises the question of what precisely would constitute a CSC and how it differs from an ISC. The objective of this paper is to propose ways in which a CSC may be defined and viewed in comparison to an ISC.

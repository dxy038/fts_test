H.264 is a new video coding standard which contains some novel coding functions and provides more coding efficiency than previous standards. However, video streams are sensitive to channel errors that often degrade the visual quality of the decoded sequence, not only corrupt the current frame but also propagate to subsequent frames. In order to solve this problem, the error concealment in the decoder is very important and useful, neither bit rate nor delay will increase during the transmission. In this paper, we propose an error concealment method by utilizing the temporal correlation of the lost macroblock and its neighboring macroblocks to reconstruct the damaged data. Simulation results show that both of the subjective and objective performances of the proposed techniques are superior to conventional temporal concealment methods for H.264 standard

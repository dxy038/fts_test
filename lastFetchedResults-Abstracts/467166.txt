Objective: Our purpose was to review the management and outcome of pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of fetal congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung (CCAM). Study Design: A retrospective review was performed of all cases since 1995 with a prenatal diagnosis of fetal CCAM from the sole tertiary perinatal referral center in Western Australia. Results: Twenty-one pregnancies with CCAM were identified. The gestational age at diagnosis was <22 weeks in 86% of cases. Macrocysts were seen in 76% of cases during ultrasound examination. Seventeen pregnancies continued until term. Regression of the sonographic appearances was observed in 19% of cases. Fetal hydrops complicated two cases. One neonate died within 24 hours of delivery because of pulmonary hypoplasia. Twelve children have required pulmonary lobectomies. No adverse sequelae are evident in surviving children. Conclusion: Most cases of prenatally diagnosed CCAM have had a good outcome. This review has positively influenced the counseling of women with this diagnosis. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:950-4.)

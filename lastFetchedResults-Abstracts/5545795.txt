Total hip arthroplasty is a well-established reconstruction technique for deteriorated hip functions. Canal fill ratio, which indicates stability of the stem implanted into the femoral bone, were proposed. However, almost of all the conventional methods were semi-automatic or manual segmentation of the stem, the cortex bone, and the cancellous bone, which can cause variation of the analysis result and wasting massive evaluation time. The canal fill of the stem should be evaluated three-dimensionally in order to adapting to actual situation. The objective of this study is to propose an automated three-dimensional evaluation of canal fill ratio of the stem in CT image. The proposed method could automatically segment the stem, the cortex bone, and the cancellous bone. In addition, three-dimensional canal fill ratio was also evaluated.

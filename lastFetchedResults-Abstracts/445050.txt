Objective
To compare the Stereotactic excisional breast biopsy ABBI (Advanced Breast Biopsy Instrumentation) system with “open” excisional breast biopsy with needle localization. Methods: Twenty-three women underwent excisional breast biopsy using the ABBI system, 23 women concomitantly underwent needle localization and excisional breast biopsy. All women had mammograms displaying microcalcifications or nonpalpable noncystic nodular densities suspicious for cancer.
Results
Biopsies with ABBI were undertaken with local anesthesia whereas needle localization biopsies were undertaken using general anesthesia. The ABBI system allowed completion mammography. Although preoperative mammograms were comparable, biopsy specimen diameter, volume, and weight were less with ABBI, and patient acceptance was higher. Efficacy, procedural duration, and blood loss were not different between the techniques.
Conclusions
The ABBI system is a minimally invasive yet efficacious excisional breast biopsy technique. It is utilized with local anesthesia in an environment more relaxed and less expensive than the operating room. It allows for smaller biopsy specimens and higher patient acceptance and is as efficacious as needle localization biopsy techniques. The ABBI system belongs in the surgical armamentarium against indeterminant nonpalpable mammographic breast lesions

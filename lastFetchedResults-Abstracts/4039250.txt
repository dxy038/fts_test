A fast, effective service restoration method is designed for large-scale distribution systems with priority customers. The service restoration problem is formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. A ranking-based search method employing analytical information obtained from three-phase power flow simulations is designed to restore service to as many priority customers as possible while maximizing the amount of total load restored and minimizing the number of required switch operations. The proposed method is designed with consideration to networks which have predominantly manual switches. Comprehensive simulation results of the search method, including priority customers, single and multiple faults and multiple out-of-service areas are presented for a 416 bus distribution network


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The bioavailability of IGF1 is regulated by the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). IGFBP3 is an inhibitor of IGF1 and inhibits growth cell and induces apoptosis by joining to it. Some studies have shown that reduction of IGFBP3 level cause to increase risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of this study was to investigate incidence of mutant allele of IGFBP3 polymorphism rs2854744 in Iranian community and to examine the association of genetic variants in IGFBP3 (rs2854744) with risk of colorectal cancer.
METHODS: In this case-control study, genotyping of IGFBP3 gene were determined in series of 120 colorectal cancer patients (with positive result for colonoscopy and pathology) and 120 controls (with negative result for colonoscopy and pathology ) by using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping assay (PCR-RFLP) and compared.
FINDINGS: Frequency of CC, CA and AA genotype in patients in IGFBP32854744 was 33.3%, 47.5% and 19.2%, and frequency for controls was 34.2%, 45.8%, and 20%, respectively. Frequency of C allele in patients was 0.57% and for A allele was 0.42%. Also frequency of C allele in controls 0.57% and in A allele was 0.42% that no significant difference was seen.  
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that polymorphism IGFBP3 rs 2854744, is not associated with increased risk of CRC.

This paper presents the control strategy of a wind turbine based on a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). The final objective is to conceive a wind-tidal hybrid real time emulator. In the first part, the hardware in the loop simulator (HIL Simulator) is presented. The second section is dedicated to explain the structure of wind-tidal coupling adopted in our approach. Finally the modeling of the wind turbine system and the control strategy are presented. Matlab / Simulink software is used to modeling the system in order to analyze the performances of the control strategy.

This paper presents a deterministic approach of energy management in a hybrid system composed of PV generators, batteries storage, loads demand and the distribution grid. The objective is to supply load demand with the least cost while satisfying the constraint on power exchanged with the batteries and the grid. The algorithm proposed here finds the optimal power flow taking into account PV power availability, batteries state of charge, load power demand and electricity grid prices. Moreover, batteries performances losses due to the ageing process are integrated into the battery model. The batteries lifetime is estimated and replacement cost is taken into account into the global cost. Results are presented for two electricity grid prices contexts. It is carried out that the batteries replacement cost has a significant importance on the global cost and it should be taken into account in the management decision procedure.

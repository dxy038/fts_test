A PID parameter optimization method based on genetic algorithm was presented in this paper. A performance index based on integral of absolute error, rise time, controller output and overshoot was given as an objective function of optimization, and genetic algorithm was applied to optimizing parameters of PID controllers. Simulation results indicate that genetic algorithm is a reasonable and effective method for parameter optimization of PID controllers.

Objective
To evaluate the effect of two additives, aldehyde or diketone, on the wear, roughness and hardness of bis-GMA-based composites/copolymers containing TEGDMA, propoxylated bis-GMA (CH3bis-GMA) or propoxylated fluorinated bis-GMA (CF3bis-GMA).
Methods

Fifteen experimental composites and 15 corresponding copolymers were prepared combining bis-GMA and TEGDMA, CH3bis-GMA or CF3bis-GMA, with aldehyde (24 mol% and 32 mol%) or diketone (24 mol% and 32 mol%) totaling 30 groups. For composites, hybrid treated filler (barium aluminosilicate glass/pyrogenic silica; 60 wt%) was added to monomer mixtures. Photopolymerization was affected by 0.2 wt% each of camphorquinone and N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine. Wear (W) test was conducted in a toothbrushing abrasion machine (n = 6) and quantified using a profilometer. Surface roughness (R) changes, before and after abrasion test, were determined using a rugosimeter. Microhardness (H) measurements were performed for dry and wet samples using a Knoop microindenter (n = 6). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (Î± = 0.05).
Results

Incorporation of additives led to improved W and H values for bis-GMA/TEGDMA and bis-GMA/CH3bis-GMA systems. Additives had no significant effect on the W and H changes of bis-GMA/CF3bis-GMA. With regard to R changes, additives produced decreased values for bis-GMA/CH3bis-GMA and bis-GMA/CF3bis-GMA composites. Bis-GMA/TEGDMA and bis-GMA/CH3bis-GMA copolymers with additives became smoother after abrasion test.
Significance

The findings correlate with additives ability to improve degree of conversion of some composites/copolymers thereby enhancing mechanical properties.

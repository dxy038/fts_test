According to the Chinese central cities rural-urban continuum traffic safety has become worse and worse, the high rate of traffic accidents prominent contradictions. In this paper, as an example to Songbei district in Harbin, based on the areaÂ´s road conditions, traffic accidents in recent years, and characteristics, utilization of the theory of road traffic safety, combined with major impact on road traffic safety, to adopt amendments of the entropy of ANP (the analytic network process), the establishment of an integrated non-linear model to evaluate and algorithms, effectively solve the general linear methods can not solve the non-independent relationships of same cluster indexes in the complex system, as well as the mutual feedback relationships of the indexes of the cluster between upper and lower, for realizing more reasonable and objective evaluation of traffic safety of the central cities rural-urban continuum.

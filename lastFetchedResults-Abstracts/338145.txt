Objective
To define effects of strain on PHSC (primitive hematopoietic stem cells) senescence (decline in function with age) in vivo, and to map a locus that regulates PHSC senescence.
Materials and Methods
Long-term function and self-renewal were compared in bone marrow cells (BMC) from old and young mice of three strains: BALB/cBy (BALB), DBA/2 (D2) and C57BL/6 (B6), using competitive repopulation and serial transplantation in vivo. BMC from each old or young donor were mixed with standard doses of congenic, genetically marked BMC and transplanted into lethally recipients. Percentages of donor-type erythrocytes and lymphocytes in the recipients determined the functional ability of donor PHSC relative to the standard, where one repopulating unit (RU) of donor BMC equals the repopulating ability of 100,000 standard competitor BMC. Using similar techniques, repopulating abilities of old and young recombinant inbred (RI) donors of 12 strains derived from BALB and B6 were compared in NK-depleted BALBxB6 Fl recipients to map a locus that appears to have a major role in PHSC senescence.
Results
PHSC function declined about 2 fold with age in BALB and D2 BMC, and increased more than 2-fold with age in B6 BMC, with all old/young strain differences significant, p < .01. Ten months after serial transplantation, young B6, BALB, and D2 PHSC had self-renewed 1.6-, 4.2-, and 3.2-fold better than old, with BALB and D2 old/young differences p < .01. Young B6 PHSC self-renewed 1.9- and 2.9-fold better than young BALB and D2 PHSC. The PHSC senescence phenotypes (old/young RU ratios) for 12 CXB RI strains suggested a genetic linkage to D12Nyul7 on Chromosome 12.
Conclusion
PHSC senescence is genetically regulated, and is much delayed in the B6 strain compared to the BALB and D2 strains. A locus on Chromosome 12 may regulate PHSC senescence.

We have developed a low cost 1.25 Gbps WDM bidirectional module using two integrated optical subassemblies which are composed of a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) platform and a silicon optical bench (SiOB) platform. The low cost module is achieved by employing a flip-chip bonding method with passive alignment using a Fabry-Perot laser diode (FP-LD) with a monitoring waveguide-photodiode (PD) on a PLC platform and a receiver with a PIN-PD on a SiOB platform. We also observed the optical coupling loss between laser diode and waveguide and the performance of receiver sub-assembly.

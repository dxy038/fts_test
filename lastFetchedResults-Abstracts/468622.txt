Objective: Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors have different selectivity for inhibitory action on the isoforms of the enzyme. Our purpose was to compare the tocolytic and maternal toxic effects of various cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors in the lipopolysaccharide-induced preterm birth in pregnant mice. Study Design: We randomly assigned 50 ICR pregnant mice into five groups of 10 mice each and treated them intraperitoneally with either phosphate-buffered saline solution or lipopolysaccharide (50 Î¼g) on day 15 of pregnancy. Of the four groups that received lipopolysaccharide, three groups also were treated either with nonselective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin [1 mg/kg/d] or diclofenac [2 mg/kg/d]) or with the cyclo-oxygenase-2 preferential inhibitor, meloxicam (2 mg/kg/d), with a gavage tube on days 15 through 18 of pregnancy or until maternal death. The mice were killed immediately after preterm birth or on day 21 of pregnancy. Preterm birth rates and maternal side effect profiles were evaluated. Results: Preterm birth occurred in 90% of mice after intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection and in 20% of mice after phosphate-buffered saline solution injection. Indomethacin and meloxicam, but not diclofenac, significantly decreased the incidence of preterm birth that was induced by lipopolysaccharide (33.3% and 33.3%, respectively; P = .028). Although the overall incidence of maternal gastric and/or renal toxicities was not significantly increased in the indomethacin or meloxicam groups, a significant increase was noticed in the diclofenac group compared with the lipopolysaccharide-treated control group (P = .006). Conclusion: Indomethacin and meloxicam, but not diclofenac, inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-induced preterm birth in an animal model. Meloxicam appears to have no advantage over indomethacin with regard to tocolysis and maternal side effects. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;189:261-6.)

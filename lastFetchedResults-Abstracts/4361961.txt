With the increased role of technology in video production, several types of complex video special effects editing have begun to appear. We consider wiping special effects editing in MPEG-2 compressed video without full frame decompression and motion estimation. We estimated the DCT coefficients and use these coefficients together with the existing motion vectors to produce these special effects editing in the compressed domain. The results show that both the objective and subjective quality of the edited video in the compressed domain closely follows the quality of the video edited in the uncompressed domain at the same bit rate.

Our objective was to test the hypothesis that short-term (8 days) treatment of prepubertal heifers with melengestrol acetate (MGA) and subsequent steroid withdrawal would stimulate LH secretion and follicular growth. Angus heifers were divided randomly into two groups; MGA-treated (n = 8) or control (CON; n = 9). Puberty was determined by monitoring circulating concentrations of progesterone and ovarian morphology during a 14-day period following MGA withdrawal. LH secretory patterns were assessed upon initiation of MGA (Day 0), during MGA (Day 7), and 1 day after withdrawal of MGA (Day 9). All MGA-treated heifers, versus four CON heifers, exhibited corpora lutea and luteal phase concentrations of progesterone within 10 days after treatment (p = 0.01). Mean LH and LH pulse frequency increased (p = 0.005 and 0.0001, respectively) between Days 0 and 9 in MGA-treated heifers. In CON heifers, mean LH concentrations and pulse frequencies did not change. During the same period, diameter of the largest follicle increased in MGA-treated animals (p = 0.003) but did not change in the CON heifers. On the basis of these results, we suggest that MGA withdrawal enhances onset of puberty by stimulating pulsatile LH secretion that accelerates follicle growth to the preovulatory stage

The objective of this study was to describe a specific form of persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) in three German pinscher dogs and to analyse the mode of inheritance in the breed. This type of PRAA is characterised by a left retro-oesophageal subclavian artery in combination with a ligamentum arteriosum originating at the aberrant left subclavian artery (PRAA-SA-LA). This rare combination of anomalies has only been reported in two isolated cases in other dog breeds and the occurrence of any form of PRAA was not previously known to occur in the German pinscher. In the present study, 18 cases of this congenital anomaly were ascertained and their high degree of relatedness and inbreeding could be shown through pedigree analysis. Three of the affected dogs underwent further clinical investigations, and post-mortem examination (two cases) and findings at surgery (one case) verified the diagnosis of PRAA-SA-LA. A monogenic autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was not likely.

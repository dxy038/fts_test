Introduction: In spite of various methods available for treatment of Alopecia Areata, treatment of diffuse Alopecia Arcata is still a difficult problem. Although systemic corticostcroids are frequently effective but long term consumption of oral steroids is not recommended because of complications.
Objective: To determine response to treatment and relapse in patients with diffuse Alopecia Arcata.
Materials anti methods: In this interventive and quazi- experimental we studied 26 patients with Alopecia Areata (first attack or relapse in the current year).
Intravenous Methylprednisolone, 500mg, was prescribed for 3 successive days and the patients were examined in the months of 1,3, 6 and 12. Photographs of scalp were taken at each visit.
Results: Results were registered in the forms prepared for each patient and analyzed statistically (Fisher test). Of a total of 17 patients with multifocal Alopecia Areata, 53%, 76.5%, 76.5% and 64,6% showed response to treatment at 1.3,6 and 12 months respectively. Relapse occurred 17.5%, 23.5% and 35% in the months 3,6,12 respectively. From the 7 patients with Alopecia Universalis, only one patient showed response. in two patients with Ophiasis (one case) and Totalis (one case), no response to treatment was seen.
Conclusion: All responses to treatment were obtained in the patients with diffuse muttifocal Alopecia Arcata. There was no statistically significant difference between response to treatment and relapse in patients with first attack and repeated attacks.

Background: Infertility is a complex crisis in couple's life and can produce severe psychological pressure on both partners. Depression, stress, low self-esteem, and marital sexual dissatisfaction are among the psychological outcomes of infertility.

Objective: This study was aimed to determine the relation between infertility and sexual satisfaction.

Methods: This was a cross sectional study in which depression and sexual satisfaction rate among 150 infertile versus 150 fertile couples (in Tabriz- in 2005) were investigated and further analyzed. Random Sampling was used to select study population. Data gathering was performed using a questionnaire consisting of 2 parts including a section on demographic characteristics, and also a Larson standard questionnaire for determining sexual Satisfaction). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods, independent t-test, and

Findings: There was no significant difference associated with mean sexual satisfaction rate between infertile and fertile men and infertile and fertile women (p=0.707, t=0.377 in men; p=0.370, t=0.898 in women). However, a statically significant relationship between sexual satisfaction score and duration of marriage, income status, number of unsuccessful treatment, length of time when infertility diagnosed, and performance of diagnostic tests was found. Conclusion: Considering the unpleasant effects of sexual dissatisfaction on physical and emotional health and also the occurrence of infertility-originated divorce, attempt has to be made for early diagnosis and treatment of undesirable situation in both partners.

As the rapid raise of transportation in China, increasingly importance has been attached to the convenience and safety of driving on trunk roads. Therefore, advanced traveler information system (ATIS) which can enhance efficiency and safety of driving greatly by using modern technologies has a brilliant prospect in this field. There are no standard ATIS design methods for trunk roads in China at present and the researches in this filed are fewer. In order to research on the standard system design method and explore a Chinese way in developing ATIS for trunk roads, an ATIS spiral rapid design method (ATIS-SRD) was provided under the Spiral Model according to the theories of software engineering. The method can be divided into 11 general steps including project feasibility analysis, travel information service (TIS) status investigation, project objective identification, travel information requirement survey, user service determination, logic architecture design, physical architecture design, application project composition, application design, design evaluation and design amendment, and an increment design step. The operation process of each step was also worked out. The ATIS-SRD was applied to the ATIS design for the Jiangsu section of 312 national road (G312) and the results prove that the method can raise efficiency for designers in trunk road ATIS designing greatly.

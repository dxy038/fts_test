The authors suggest some new approaches to designing fast state regulators for high-dimensional linear plants x&#729;(<e1>t</e1>)=<e1>Ax </e1>(<e1>t</e1>)+<e1>bu</e1>(<e1>t</e1>) under control constraints. These high-dimensional models arise as finite-dimensional approximations to an underlying infinite-dimensional system. The objective is to formulate design procedures that take explicitly into account the tradeoff between the available control authority and the speed of the response of the controlled system

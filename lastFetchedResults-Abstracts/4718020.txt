Low duty cycled scheduling can largely prolong the lifetime of a wireless sensor network (WSN) but also brings longer end-to-end (E2E) delivery delay. In this paper, our design objective is to pursue the near minimum E2E energy consumption subject to a desired success ratio that the E2E delay is below a delay bound. Accordingly, we design a Markov decision process based geographic routing protocol such that each relay node currently holding a packet makes localized forwarding decision on continuing waiting or transmitting immediately to the so far best forwarder candidate based only on local network state information. Simulation results show that the designed protocol can achieve expected success ratio subject to given delay bound and also high energy use efficiency.

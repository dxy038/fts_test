This article proposes a new modeling approach for traffic flow using bond graphs. The objective is to provide a new description of the dynamic phenomena which govern traffic flows starting from a phenomenological representation of vehicle flow transfers in a traffic network. Among the attractions of using a bond graph approach are, the underlying graphical vision which contributes to crystallizing the analysis, the systematic formulation of the analytical models of traffic flow and its broad applicability across all engineeringÂ´s fields. As such, bond graphs enormously facilitate the integration task of road activity in the supply chain.

This paper develops a metadata-driven framework of information resource management based on metadata and XML in railway industry. This framework consists of three levels of structure including client, server and metadata database. Client can adopt traditional desktop, Web page or mobile Web page. Server is composed of many components, including facade component dealing with request/response, basic metadata management: component and other advanced components driving basic components and data through metadata. Facade component calls and destroys components dynamically through querying metadata database. Basic components include metadata-maintaining components, metadata-querying components and components that can extract data according to metadata. Advanced components include data market components, data interoperation components and semantic interoperation components etc, whose definitions and realization flow are explicated in this paper

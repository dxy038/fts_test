The robotic control is a very popular research topic due to its wide range of applications. In this paper, the problem of position tracking control of a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator is investigated in presence of uncertainties and bounded external disturbances. Due to complexity of robot manipulators and system uncertainties, a robust control technique is required to solve this problem. In this paper, two different robust control schemes including twisting second-order sliding mode and robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback are designed and their performances are compared in simulation. RISE feedback is a recently developed continuous control strategy that can compensate uncertainties and bounded external disturbances and results in asymptotic trajectory tracking. To avoid selecting the gains of controllers by time-consuming trial and error method, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used. The objective of the PSO algorithm is to detect a set of parameters that minimizes the mean of root squared error as the fitness function. A comparative assessment of both control strategies to the system performance is analyzed and discussed.

In this paper is presented a methodology for reactive shunt compensation in power systems. The proposed methodology includes stationary and dynamic analysis. Stationary analysis is based on linear sensitivities of voltage with respect to reactive shunt compensation, and optimal power flows (OPF) with an objective function minimizing the installation of reactive shunt compensation through the power system. Both formulations are applied in order to obtain an optimal-cost based compensation scheme, while nodal voltages are maintained between predefined limits. The steady-state final scheme is evaluated under stability- transient conditions in order to define if the shunt compensation are to be continuous or discrete. The application of the proposed methodology is illustrated by a real-life case developed on a transmission network of the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), and results of both approaches are compared.

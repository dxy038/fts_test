Summary form only given. The computer science discipline, especially in large scale distributed systems like grids and P2P systems and in high performance computing areas, tends to address issues related to increasingly complex systems, gathering thousands to millions of non trivial components. In this paper, we present two computer science grids: Grid\´5000 and DAS3. We describe the motivations, design and current status of these two systems. We also present some of their key results, not only in terms of scientific results in computer science, but also the impact of these two systems as research tools. The success of Grid\´5000 and DAS platforms is the basis of an international initiative, having the objective to deploy a European level "computer science grid".

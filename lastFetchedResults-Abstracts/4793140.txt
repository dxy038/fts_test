This paper has the main objective of illustrating the importance of controllers in energy saving opportunity of partial loaded three-phase induction motor in textile mill (ring spinning frame) applications. It investigates the economics of a 100 HP induction motor with and without particle swarm optimization (PSO) controller. In this study, the flux level in a machine has been considered to adjust to give maximum efficiency for the textile mill load diagram. The study shows the controller introduces significant difference in the economics in terms of operating cost (energy cost and demand charge cost). The results of a case study show that economic motor will be controlled by PSO controller, because the high price of electricity forces the choice to efficient controllers suitable to variable shaft load. Standard benchmark problem (Rastingen) has been considered for validation of the proposed PSO controller for induction motor loss minimization.

Objective: The objective of this study was to find the role of High Resolution Computed Topographic (HRCT) scan of the chest in the diagnosis of Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD) in our local population. Methodology: A prospective study of fifty patients already diagnosed as ILD on transbronchial or open lung biopsy was performed in the Medical B Unit of the Department of Medicine Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar from January, 2008 to December, 2008. Both male and female admitted patients above 15 years of age were included in this study. Results: Of the fifty patients meeting the inclusive criteria 18 were male and 32 were female. The commonest affected age was 40-60 years. The commonest symptoms were shortness of breath and cough respectively. Inspiratory crepts and wheezes were the most common physical findings followed by clubbing, raised jugular venous pressure and edema feet. HRCT Scan revealed ILD in 88% with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 75% having 95% positive predictive value and 75% negative predictive value. Conclusion: HRCT Scan of chest is the most sensitive non invasive test in the diagnosis of ILD compared to chest X ray, pulomary fuction tests and can abate the need of lung biopsy in many cases.

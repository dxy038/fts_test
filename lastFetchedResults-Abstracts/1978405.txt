Introduction and objective: In all societies, with the increase of age bone
mass also decreases. Osteoporosis is a common disease among middle-age
and older persons, especially women. Therefore, the necessity of implementing
strategic plans to prevent osteoporosis is significantly important. This study
was designed to determine the prediction of osteoporosis preventive behaviors
through the use of the Health Belief Model (HBM).
Methods: This cross-sectional study was done among 402 women in Mashhad
in 2014. A multi-stage cluster sampling was used. In order to gather collection
a questionnaire consistent with the structures of HBM and IPAQ and FFQ was
used. Data were analyzed using the SPSS16 and descriptive analysis (frequency,
percentage, mean ± SD) and analysis (correlation coefficient, regression and
Linear regression). The significance level was 0.5.
Results: The mean age of the participants were 36.5 ± 8.1 years. Average
monthly calcium intake was 14703.1 ± 8377.5 mg; 63.7% of the people with
lower physical activity were among inactive groups. Construct barriers perceived
(p = 0.008) had a significant impact on the feeding behavior of calcium
intake. Self- efficacy (p >  0.001) had a significant impact on physical activity behavior.
Conclusion: The results showed that the HBM to predict well for osteoporosis
preventive behaviors in women. Its use in training programs will be effective.

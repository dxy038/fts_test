The production control of a single-product manufacturing system with arbitrary number of machine states (failure modes) is discussed. The objective is to find a production policy that would meet the demand for the product with minimum average inventory or backlog cost. The optimal production policy has a special structure and is called a hedging-point policy. If the hedging points are known, the optimal production rate is readily specified. Assuming a set of tentative hedging points, the simple structure of the optimal policy is utilized to find the steady-state probability distribution of the surplus (inventory or backlog). Once this function is determined, the average surplus cost is easily calculated in terms of the values of the hedging points. The average cost is then minimized to find the optimum hedging points

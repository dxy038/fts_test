The main objective of this research is to design campus-wide secure information systems using multi-purpose smart cards as the portable security devices. The security of our system is based on public-key cryptography and our main applications are for on-campus non-financial applications. In our campus card system, the same H8/3113-based smart card has multiple applications, such as physical access control, electronic mail, library book lending system, etc

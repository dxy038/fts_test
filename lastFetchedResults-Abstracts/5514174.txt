In this project an evaluation of two approaches for voice-controlled Arduino-based autonomous systems is performed. The first approach uses an embedded voice recognition (VR) system that is interfaced with an Arduino-based hardware platform. In the second approach a speech recognition programming module is integrated into the development environment of the Arduino-based system. The main objective is to provide a mechanism for controlling an autonomous quadcopter using natural language voice commands. A supplemental goal of this research is to increase the knowledge base and skill set of undergraduate engineering students by developing a curricular component for inclusion in laboratory courses, such as a speech processing course or a course in mechatronics, or even in research experiences of undergraduates.

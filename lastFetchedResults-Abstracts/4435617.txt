The main objective of this paper is to present the mathematical framework of the Ultra Wideband (UWB) antennas considering the directional gain, polarization, frequency dependence and matching. The detailed simulation procedures for obtaining the transmitting Antenna Impulse Responses (AIRs) either in frequency domain or in time domain using Electromagnetic (EM) simulation tool would be illustrated. The theory of reciprocity would be applied successfully for computing the receiving AIRs. Furthermore, the real-world measurements will provide a comprehensive verification of this UWB AIRs modeling technique.

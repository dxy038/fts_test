Objective
To assess the gender-specific prevalence and determinants of abdominal obesity (AO) within the population and lifestyle diversity of an urban district in Sri Lanka.
Methods

Prevalence of AO (defined by waist circumference) was estimated in a cross-sectional study of 1400 adults aged 20–64, residing in the district of Colombo in 2004. Demographic, socio-economic and lifestyle factors were assessed in gender-specific logistic regression models to identify determinants of AO.
Results

Prevalence of AO was 44.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 41.0, 48.5) in females and 25.7% (95% CI: 22.6, 29.0) in males. Significant determinants of AO were age 35–49 (adjusted odds ratio: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2, 2.5), moderately urban sector (1.9; 1.3, 2.9) and insufficient level of physical activity (1.7; 1.1, 2.4) among females in contrast to household income > Rupees 10,000 (6.1; 2.7, 13.5), increased alcohol (medium: 1.9; 1.2, 2.9; high: 2.1; 1.2, 3.5), low-fiber diet (1.6; 1.1, 2.4) and frequent large meals (1.7; 1.0, 2.8) among males. Determinants common to males (M) and females (F) were age ≥ 50 years (M: 2.5; 1.5, 4.2 and F: 2.9; 1.9, 4.4), most urban sector (M: 2.0; 1.3, 3.1 and F: 1.8; 1.2, 2.7) and married status (M: 2.2; 1.3, 3.6 and F: 2.4; 1.6, 3.6).
Conclusions

A distinct gender differential was observed in the prevalence and determinants of AO. It appears vital that preventive strategies of AO be developed to be more ‘gender-sensitive’ in urban districts.

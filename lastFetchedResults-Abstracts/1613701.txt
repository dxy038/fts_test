 Background & Objective: Improving the quality of education is the most central values of academic institutions and higher education. Given professors have played a decisive role in this context, -for assessing the quality of education- we need to evaluate the quality of instruction. One of the common methods for professors’ evaluation is evaluation by students, that it usually takes place at the end of each semester. With regard to the professors’ evaluation, data are of various types: the longitudinal data or repeated measurements over time, therefore to evaluate it; the quality of instruction should be used with longitudinal data analysis. However, such methods often are explained by complex methodology. This article introduces multilevel linear model and generalized estimating equations approach and value-added models by simple and applied expression as appropriate models for analysis of longitudinal data such as professors’ evaluation data.

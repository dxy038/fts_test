BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease. Its incidence in the last decade has been steadily growing. Because of the effect of magnesium sulfate as a muscle relaxant in acute attack of asthma, in this study we investigated the effect of nebulizing of this drug in compared with normal saline in children with acute asthmatic attack.
METHODS: A clinical trial on 80 patients with moderate to severe asthma was done (according to GINA criteria). Two groups consisted of 40 patients were classified into intervention (magnesium sulfate + nebulisedsalbutamol) and the control group (salbutamol + normal saline). Sex and age were noted. Isotonic magnesium sulfate and normal saline were used 3 ml with 0.15 mg/kg salbutamol, every 20 min up to three times. Pulmonary index before 30, 60 and 90 min after treatment were assessed. (IRCT 201110024396N3)
FINDINGS: There was no significant difference in mean pulmonary index before treatment among children with asthma in the intervention group (5.5±1.5) and control (5.5±1.4), but at 90 minutes after treatment this mean in intervention group (2.2±0.8) was significantly lower than the control group (3.1±1.5) (p=0.000). PEFR values before treatment of asthmatic children in the intervention group (127.6±44.4) and control (129.3±36.6) was showed no significant difference, but at 90 minutes after treatment in the intervention group (171±48.1) was significantly higher than the control group (149.3±39.7) (p=0.031).
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the effect of magnesium sulfate + salbutamol nebulizer in comparison with salbutamol + saline nebulizer had better effect in treatment of acute asthmatic attack.

Particle accelerator safety problems are primarily those of activation and shielding. The phenomena of activations from various nuclear particles and from photons is relatively well known. Use of low activation materials at exposed locations and of adequate shielding at all locations is basic to the art of constructing an accelerator facility that will be safe in operation and require minimum cooling time. Side effects must also be considered relative to safety. These may include fire, heat, noxious gas, electricity and possibly sound, each of which may prove hazardous to personnel and may interfere with successful experimentation. The know-how and the materials existing today make possible the design and construction of large and small particle accelerators of various types that are radiologically safe both in operation and after shutdown. Good design and construction, followed by routine safety procedures associated with such facilities, will accomplish this objective.

In the past decade, computer generated virtual environment and virtual humans have become ubiquitous in numerous applications. Creating realistic virtual humans in real-time interactive virtual environment has been a challenging objective in the areas of computer science research and technology industry. This paper focuses on creating real-time intelligent interactive virtual environment, which integrates the real-time simulated virtual environment with autonomous intelligent virtual humans. First, an approach for fast prototyping real-time simulated virtual environment is presented; then, an integrated framework for modeling behaviors and motions of virtual humans with high level autonomy is described; finally, the integration of autonomous virtual humans and simulated virtual environment is studied. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach proposed.

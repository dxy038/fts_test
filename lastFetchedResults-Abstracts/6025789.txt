This paper discusses a third-year engineering elective course, &#8220;Engineering and Science in the Arts.&#8221; offered by the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering at the University of Toronto. The paper will detail the unique course deliverables that require the engineering students to, first, create original works of art and, secondly, to explain how these works connect to engineering or science. A key objective in the course was that students eradicate the boundaries separating engineers and artists, and this paper will consider the courseÂ´s success in this regard.

The recent concept of biological tolerance proposed in the technical literature for the manâ€“environment interactions makes possible a dimensional transformation of the involved quantities to obtain quantities all homogeneous among them.
In the present work, a metric for these transformed quantities is proposed. Hence it is possible to achieve the advantage of having only one metric in studying each kind of interaction.
The new scale appears to be a useful instrument in studying together different sensorial interactions and in comparing different algorithms that refer to the same objective quantities.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether high-dose inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP), alone or in combination with salmeterol (SAL), is as effective as oral prednisolone in reducing airway inflammation and obstruction in cats with experimentally-induced acute asthma. Six cats sensitised to Ascaris suum (AS) were enrolled in a prospective controlled therapeutic trial and underwent four aerosol challenges, at 1-month intervals with AS allergen. The allergen – stimulated animals received four consecutive days treatment with either oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg twice daily, 500 μg of FP inhaled twice daily, or a combination of FP/SAL at 500 μg/50 μg inhaled twice daily, respectively, according to a randomised cross-over design. Treatment-related changes in lung function, airway responsiveness (AR) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology were assessed. Barometric whole-body plethysmography (BWBP) was used for the assessment of respiratory variables and AR.

nificant differences in respiratory rate or Penh (an estimate of airflow limitation measured by BWBP) were detected among treatment groups. Allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness was significantly inhibited by all three steroid treatments (P &lt; 0.05). The mean BALF eosinophil percentage (±SEM) was lower after oral and inhaled corticosteroid treatment and these changes were significant for groups receiving prednisolone and the FP/SAL combination. Findings suggest high-dose FP, particularly in combination with SAL, is effective in ameliorating airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness in this model of acute feline asthma, and highlight the potential use of these drugs in cats experiencing acute exacerbations of the naturally occurring disease.

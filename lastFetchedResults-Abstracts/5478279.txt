By establishing organization model of hybrid data and autonomous storage management model to meet demand of continuing availability and data integrity, and, to achieve the ultimate objective that we must strengthen damage restorability of cloud storage system. By analysis on data with sequential and dynamic characteristic, one can make a real-time data predicting service easier to be obtained, under the circumstances that the data set is updated unceasingly.

The objective of this study was to develop a quantitative Monte Carlo exposure assessment model for mycotoxins in dairy milk and to assess the potential human exposure levels. Mean concentrations of mycotoxins in milk were estimated using the simulation model (Aflatoxin M1 = 0.0161 μg/kg, Ochratoxin A = 0.0002 μg/kg, Deoxynivalenol = 1 μg/kg, Fumonisin B1 = 0.36 μg/kg, Zearalenone = 0.39 μg/kg, T-2 = 0.0722 μg/kg) while the simulated tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) from milk for males and females all fell below European Union guidelines. Aflatoxin M1 was the toxin of greatest concern as it had potential to exceed the EU limit of 0.05 μg/kg in milk. The sensitivity analysis identified the concentration of toxins in maize as the area which needs most attention in relation to crop management and agricultural practice. The sensitivity analysis assessed also identified the carry over rate as a factor closely related to risk and as a factor which required further research.

To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of paclitacxel and carboplatin on advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Forty-eight patients with locally advanced (stage IIIb) or metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC were enrolled into the study. The patients received paclitacxel 55â€“60 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15, carboplatin at an AUC of 5 on day 1, administreted in 28-day cycle. An objective response was obtained in 37.5% of patients (two complete and 16 partial responses). Significant difference existed between the naive patients and pretreated patients (46.4% vs. 25.0%, P < 0.05). The main toxicities were bone marrow suppression, nausea/vomiting and alopecia. The combination of paclitacxel and carboplatin is an effective, well-tolerated scheme in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. The efficacy is higher in the naive group than in the pretreated group.

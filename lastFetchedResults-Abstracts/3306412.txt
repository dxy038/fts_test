This paper deals with the isolation of the failed components in the system. Each component can be affected in a random way by failures. The detection of the state of a component or a subsystem is carried out using tests. The objective of this research is to exploit the techniques of built in test and available knowledge to generate the sequence of tests which makes it possible to locate quickly the whole of the components responsible for the failure of the system. One considers an operative system according to a series structure for which one knows the cost of tests and the conditional probability that a component is responsible for the failure. The various strategies of diagnosis are analyzed. The treated algorithms call upon the probabilistic analysis of the systems.

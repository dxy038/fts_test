Practical training objective is to prepare students for their future jobs. Many university programs integrate practical training as a course component due to its benefits. Application is one of the main processes in practical training. Managing application process manually is a tedious task, thus a system to manage practical training application is proposed to be developed using Rapid Application Development methodology. This methodology is chosen as it allows fast implementation of the system in real environment. The development had started in the mid of semester December-April 2009 and the development process had been iterated based on the requirements acquired. The practical training application system had been implemented for three semesters and the rapid application development is proved to be a right methodology for this project as it serves the goal of fast implementation for a small size system.

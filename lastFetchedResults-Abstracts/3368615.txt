Based on the relative motion dynamic model illustrated by C-W equations, the problem of robust Hinfin control for a class of spacecraft rendezvous systems is investigated, which contains parametric uncertainties, external disturbances and input constraints. An Hinfin state-feedback controller is designed via a Lyapunov approach, which guarantees the closed-loop system to meet the multi-objective design requirements. The existence conditions for admissible controllers are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the controller design is cast into a convex optimization problem subject to LMI constraints. An illustrative example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control design method.

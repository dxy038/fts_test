In this article we describe an optimization-based design method for non-uniform, planar, and circular antenna arrays with the objective of achieving minimum side lobe levels for a specific first null beamwidth and also a minimum size of the circumference. Central to our design is a hybridization of two prominent metaheuristics of current interest namely the Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) and the Differential Evolution (DE). IWO is a derivative-free real parameter optimization technique that mimics the ecological behavior of colonizing weeds. Owing to its superior performance in comparison with many other existing metaheuristics, recently IWO is being used in several engineering design problems from diverse domains. For the present application, we have modified classical IWO by incorporating the difference vector based mutation schemes from the realm of DE. Three difficult instances of the circular array design problem have been presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the hybrid Differential IWO (DIWO) algorithm. The design results obtained with modified IWO have been shown to comfortably outperform the results obtained with other state-of-the-art metaheuristics like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE) in a statistically significant fashion.

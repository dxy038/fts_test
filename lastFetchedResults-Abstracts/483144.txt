Abstract
Background & Aim: Impressive research demonstrates the importance of essential fatty acids for many physiological and behavioral mechanisms in both humans and animals. Experimental research showed that deficit in learning and memory is induced after kindling. The objective of this study was to investigate whether dietary cis and trans fatty acids, pre and during pentylenetetraxol(PTZ) kindling would effect learning deficits in male rats.
Materials and Methods: This is an experimental research. Eighteen Wistar rats were assigned in three groups. The control group received standard diet. The cis and trans groups received cis and trans fatty acids respectively. The kindling process was initiated one month after the start of the experiment, and the shuttle box learning ability was assessd one week after kindling. Data were analyzed using one way ANOVA and Tukey test.
Results: Results showed control and trans groups had impairment in shuttle box learning and no considerable differences were found between these two groups. However on the other hand administration of dietary cis fatty acid reduced impairment in shuttle box learning in pentylenetetrazol kindled rats.
Conclusion: The results of this experiment suggest that dietary treatment of kindled rats with cis fatty acids reduced learning deficits induced by PTZ kindling in rats.

A radiation pattern reconfigurable antenna for WLAN applications is proposed in this paper. The antenna consists of center monopole, a pair of parasitic elements and PIN diodes. By controlling the switch states of the PIN diodes, the antenna can be worked as a monopole antenna with an omnidirectional pattern (Mode 1), a monopole antenna with reflector providing unidirectional pattern (Mode 2 and 3) or a 3-element monopole array with bidirectional pattern (Mode 4). The simulated results demonstrated S11 better than -10 dB for all the four modes over 2.4 -2.48 GHz.

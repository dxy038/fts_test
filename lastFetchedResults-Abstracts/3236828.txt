This paper presents a methodology and software for simulating alternatives and works to amend voltage levels provided to affected low voltage customers. The methodology describes a type of state estimation of a low voltage network, using voltage measurements of a single load point. From a set of possible alternatives to amend voltage levels, the main is to install the Portable Voltage Regulator for Low Voltage Networks (PVRLVN) developed on R&amp;D financed by AES Eletropaulo and AES Sul. The objective is to evaluate and to compare effects of each proposed alternative, based on estimation of indexes related to duration of precarious and critical voltage levels. Installation of PVRLVN can offer to power utilities a great technical and economic benefit, in some cases, up to 100% of customers compensation out of allowed voltage levels. The proposed system also allows saving time, avoiding problems before execute corrective works on the network.

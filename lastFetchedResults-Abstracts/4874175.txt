In this paper, we present a new method of the group assessment to treat the rate of aggregative software development risk in fuzzy circumstances. Because the proposed assessment method uses the fuzzy numbers which are either single choices or multiple choices in fuzzy mode for the risk item respective to the criteria for the evaluators rather than the linguistic values to evaluate, and it can be closer to the assessment. Moreover, we revise the model by signed distance instead of centroid method, since if the triangular fuzzy number is not an isosceles triangle, then the result of defuzzified method by the signed distance is more appropriate than by the centroid method based on the maximum membership grade principle. Because of the evaluation method in this paper by group of evaluators, the proposed fuzzy assessment model is more useful, objective and justified than the one we have presented before by only one evaluator.

The role of collaboration between supply chain partners for improving the performance of inventory control is of special interest. This paper develops a single-vendor multiple-buyer integrated inventory model with the objective of minimizing the total relevant annual cost for the assessment of collaboration. A procedure for finding the optimal solution is developed, and three numerical examples are given to illustrate the algorithmic process of the proposed approach.

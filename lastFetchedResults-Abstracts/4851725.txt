Aiming the complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty of the Optimization of cold/heat sources for air-conditioning system, the paper presents a optimization model, which is based on maximizing deviations associated with the gray-coupled. Model is based on program evaluation index values of various properties under the objective difference between the empowerment, the decision-making for program optimization is based on the size of correlation between the various programs and the best program. Through the application of air-conditioning cold/heat sources project, indicating that its easy to calculate, with satisfactory results.

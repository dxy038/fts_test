The objective of this investigation was to identify the elementary twinning dislocations (TDs) for image and image twins by fully characterizing their structure for an Mg crystal. For both image and image twins, we conclude that the 2-layer TD, not the 4-layer TD, is the active TD in twinning. The 4-layer TD can be considered as the combination of two 2-layer TDs with opposite-sign screw components. Molecular statics simulations of the Peierls energy show why the TDs of both twinning modes (for c/a ratios > 1.5) are only activated when the c-axis experiences a compressive strain. The simulations predict that 2-layer TDs are more mobile than 4-layer TDs and that the mobility of these twinning dislocations depends strongly on dislocation character. Correspondingly, the influence of TDs involved in deformation twinning processes on deformation twins is discussed.

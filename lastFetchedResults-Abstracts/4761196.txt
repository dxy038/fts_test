Providing guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) in cell and packet based networks places additional demands upon the design of switch fabrics, and the reliability of the transporting media. Especially challenging is Wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode (WATM) networks, which can have characteristically poor media quality. The provision and prediction of QoS, which is necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of the interconnected fixed ATM network, and the many services it must support, is directly influenced by the design of the lower protocol layers. So far this has not been considered in current WATM designs. In particular, predictable and guaranteed (QoS) can be achieved within the ATM- and MAC layer. This paper focuses on the identification of the functional and technical requirements of the Wireless ATM Layer needed to support QoS. An objective overview of existing technologies and recommendations for WATM and potential carrier systems are critically reviewed under the QoS criteria of ATM with conclusions for current and future WATM systems.

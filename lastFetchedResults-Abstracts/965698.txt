Objective: Cognitive metaphor as a special cognitive mechanism, which facilitates the comprehension of higher level concepts via the comprehension of the lower level concepts, is acquired by bilinguals in the process of second language acquisition by means of collocation and lexical selection following a number of phases. The hierarchical feature of this type of acquisition accounts for certain problems in comprehension and production of second language facing bilinguals. The present research aims to assess the levels involved in the cognitive metaphor acquisition of bilinguals. Method:An ex post facto experimental design with a descriptive-analytic nature is applied to 248 English-Persian bilingual participants in both genders and Persian monolinguals between 11-17 years of age. The research instrument comprises a validated researcher–made questionnaire based on Bloom’s taxonomy within the cognitive domain. The relevant statistical tools consist of mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficient of each question with the total score, alpha coefficient, reviewers agreement coefficient, Pearson coefficient between re-test values, standard T and Zscores, and discrimination analysis. Results:Findings offer a validated cognitive metaphor acquisition questionnaire (0.82 validity and 0.96 reliability) and a database of bilingual levels of metaphor acquisition in the targeted age limit. It is also observed that the level of acquisition of cognitive metaphors along with the level of complexity increases with an increase in age. Conclusion: Although demonstrating a good capacity for acquiring cognitive metaphors at the levels of knowledge and comprehension,bilinguals show a considerable amount of difficulty at higher levels of cognitive domain, namely analysis and synthesis.

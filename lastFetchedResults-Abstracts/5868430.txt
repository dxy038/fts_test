The power demand is more than the generation and it is not economical &amp; reliable to increase the generation by conventional sources. Day by day the use of non-conventional sources has been increased due to their economy and pollution free characteristics. This paper deals with the synchronization and stability of non-conventional source like Pico and micro hydro plant with thermal based synchronous generator as a major objective. The other objectives of this paper are controlled voltage and frequency for variable load. The various papers on this issue with and without controller are referred and conclusions are summarized in the results for considering V and f for stabilization.

Objective To compare multi-axial (DSM-IV) with uniaxial
diagnostic system (CCMD-3, Chinese Classification
and Diagnostic Criteria of Mental Disorders) as diagnostic
methods to determine the prevalence of personality disorders
(PDs) in Chinese psychiatric outpatients.
Method 3,075 outpatients were randomly sampled from
clinical settings in China. CCMD-3 PDs were evaluated as
per routine psychiatric practice. DSM-IV PDs were assessed
using both self-reported questionnaire and structured
clinical interview.
Results The prevalence estimate for any type of PD in the
total sample is 31.93% as reflected in the DSM-IV. This
figure is nearly 110 times as large as the prevalence estimate
for the CCMD-3. Only 9 outpatients were diagnosed
with PD based on the CCMD-3. Amongst the 10 forms of
DSM-IV PDs, avoidant (8.1%), obsessiveâ€“compulsive
(7.6%), paranoid (6.0%), and borderline (5.8%) PDs were
the most prevalent subtypes. This study found that PDs are
commonly associated with the following: (i) the younger
aged; (ii) single marital status; (iii) those who were not
raised by their parents; (iv) introverted personalities;
(v) first-time seekers of psycho-counseling treatment; and
(vi) patients with co-morbid mood or anxiety disorders.
Conclusions PDs are easily overlooked when the diagnosis
is made based on the CCMD-3 uni-axial diagnostic
system. However, it was found that personality pathology
is common in the Chinese psychiatric community when
using the DSM-IV classification system. Existing evidence
suggest, at least indirectly, that there are important benefits
of moving towards a multi-axial diagnostic approach in
psychiatric practice.

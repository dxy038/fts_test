In the past, a number of methods have been proposed to model and validate communication protocols that have already been designed. However, design criteria and design aids are still lacking for designing correct protocols. The objective of developing automated protocol synthesizers is to provide a systematic way of designing new communication protocols such that their correctness can be ensured.

Drying is one of the main processes during manufacturing ceramic products. The part shrinks as the water content evaporates. Shrinkage phenomenon during the drying of ceramic materials can cause defects such as crack and deformation as a result. Since many parameters influence the ceramics drying & drying shrinkage, the experimental investigation of all of them is time consuming and expensive. Numerical simulation for drying process can be an appropriate method so as to control and improve the defects mentioned above, and it can also be as a tool for mold and ceramic parts design in reverse engineering. The objective of the current research is to study the drying of a ceramic material with known chemical composition and to analyses the process using Finite Element Analysis method. Deformation values were experimentally measured using machine vision and image processing techniques. Strain vectors were determined based on which a comparison could be performed between analytical and experimental model. The drying model developed was verified by experiments.

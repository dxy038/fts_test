The objective of the program is to demonstrate improved characteristics for large central station superconducting generators. Based on the EEI-EPRI program at MIT, new concepts have been devised, analyzed and selected for a 10 MVA demonstration machine. The present status of the project is given and the design of the machine is outlined.

This presentation describes the results of electron beam injection, propagation and conversion to bremsstrahlung radiation at Naval Research LaboratoryÂ´s Gamble II and on Kharkiv National University Nadia facilities. The objective of the experiments is to evaluate this technique for potential application as an energy density compression technique on the Decade-Quad multi-modular radiation simulator. Initial experiments performed on these generators were reported at the 12<sup>th</sup> International Pulsed Power Conference [1].

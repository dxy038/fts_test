In the care, the communication based empathetic understanding is important. We have examined how to grasp empathetic understanding. We presume that the measurement of electroencephalographic (EEG) changes, those activities that are considered physiological indicators, enables an objective understanding of changes in emotions of those who have difficulty in expressing these through facial expression or physical action. Generally, EEG is used in the hospital to examine encephalopathy and brain disorder. Using an electroencephalograph device to acquire digital data we propose a method to objectively capture changes in the recognition state of people from changes in EEG activities (action potential), and a way to apply it into a clinical situation.

In this paper, firstly a model of solar cell is built using MATLAB SIMULINK and P-V, I-V &amp; P-I characteristics are studied for various values of irradiance &amp; a constant temperature. The maximum power point is tracked using Incremental Conductance algorithm from those curves and then the reference values of power and voltage are measured from that point. Various solar radiation parameters are calculated and the actual power &amp; voltage of the module are determined. After that, the difference between the reference voltage and the actual voltage is applied as input into the servomotor and the angle of rotation of the motor is measured as output. The main objective of this paper is to find out that optimal angle, which is used for positional control of solar module for optimal power tracking. Section I contains an introduction of the work. In section II, we design the model of solar cell. After that the Maximum Power Point Tracking technique is shown in section III. We calculate the solar radiation parameters in section IV. Section V shows the positional control by servomotor. Section VI concludes the paper followed by acknowledgement and references.

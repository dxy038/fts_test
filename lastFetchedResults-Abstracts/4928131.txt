The results show that the channel power exchange at the output of the fiber is equal for some configurations of a unidirectional DWDM system and a bidirectional DWDM system. Thus, for these configurations, it is possible to solve for the output power of each channel in a bidirectional DWDM system by using the unidirectional analytical solution. This is much less computationally intensive than numerically solving the bidirectional differential equations.

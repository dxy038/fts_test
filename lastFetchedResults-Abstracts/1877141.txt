Objective
tudy assessed the feasibility of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The program emphasizes patients' central role and responsibility in managing their illness.
s
ts were randomly assigned to the program, which was led by a cardiac nurse specialist and a CHF patient. Data on performance according to protocol, adherence, and opinion about the program were collected among 186 patients and 18 leaders.
s
 percent of the group sessions were carried out largely according to protocol. Three fourths of the patients attended at least 4 of the 6 sessions. Female sex and lower New York Heart Association classification predicted good attendance.
sion
ly after the program and at 12-month follow-up, approximately three fourths of the patients stated that they had benefited from the program. Recommendations mainly concerned spending more time on several program topics and specifying patient-selection criteria in more detail. The program was considered feasible.

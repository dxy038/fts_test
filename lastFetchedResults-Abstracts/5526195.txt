Based on a kind of typical high speed monohull vessel, the paper discusses an integrate optimization´s method of Synthetical Fundamental Mechanics Characteristic with the materials of some ships and some relevant experience expressions. The authors use the weighted sum of rapidity, sea-keeping ability and maneuverability as the sub-objective function of ship performances; use the weighted sum of static and dynamic properties as the sub-objective function of structural mechanics properties; The weighted sum of these 2 sub-objective functions is just the general objective function. Stability, buoyancy and some other characteristics as well as limits of design variables form the constraint conditions. The mathematic model shows that the synthetical optimization of mechanics properties for ships involves at least 49 design variables, 9 equation constraints and 5 inequality constrains. Evidently, it´s a very complicated engineering optimization. The data was gained after this algorithm(DP- genetic chaos algorithms) had applied to optimize integrate the performance of navigational performance and structure characteristic by VC++, quantities of computation results of different solving methods show that compared with other methods such as GA, chaos algorithm and their parallel algorithms, this complex algorithm can overcome GA´s premature convergence and is reliable and efficient. Above all, the software is programmed. Using this software can conveniently get the possibility distributing function of integrate optimum navigation performance of each design variables, and can provide the condition to integrate evaluation of the ship design project and the integrate decision-making of ship parameters.

Interleukin (IL)-8 and its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, are key regulators of inflammation. However, knowledge of these receptors at the genomic level is limiting or absent in cattle. Therefore, our objective was to identify bovine orthologs of human CXCR1 and CXCR2. Alignment of bovine CXCR2 reference mRNA to the bovine genome revealed two regions of similarity on BTA2 approximately 20 kb apart and on opposite strands. Comparison with the human genome suggested the more centromeric region to be CXCR2 and the more telomeric region to be CXCR1 which contradicts the current annotation of the bovine CXCR2 reference mRNA. This observation was verified by sequencing RT-PCR products of specific regions within each predicted IL-8 receptor and comparing with human sequences using ClustalW. Further examination of coding and non-coding regions within the IL-8 receptor genome complex revealed that both bovine and canine CXCR1 and CXCR2 genes had more conserved sequences in common with the human genes than either mouse or rat, and may offer more suitable animal models for certain applications. This molecular information provides a stepping stone for greater understanding of the role each IL-8 receptor plays in inflammation and will enhance our ability to develop strategies against inflammatory based diseases.

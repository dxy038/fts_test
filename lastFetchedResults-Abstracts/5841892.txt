Public parking facility location is a multi-index and multi-restriction problem. Based on the urban parking comprehensive planning and parkerspsila behavior decisions, it aims to meet the requirement of the parking service under the constraint of limited resources. Itpsilas not all of the parkers that will choose the nearest parking facilities, but all the demand points in facility that is influenced need to be served. By analyzing the objective functions and constraints of the classical models, a public parking location model is formulated with the objective to minimize the total cost. Max-Min Ant algorithm within limited pheromone space is then proposed to fully search the solution space. Finally, a numerical example is carried out to illustrate the proposed model and algorithm.

Recent Developments in sensor networking for industrial application emphasized need for reliable integration of sensor networks with the internet. For sensor network deployed to record the industrial process parameter in various place of industry, it is important that collected information be delivered as fast as possible with minimum delays. In this paper, an integration module is proposed. The objective of the module is to integrate be sensor information with www through cloud. The integration controller and Sensor node will communicate through SOA. The cloud will provide a functionality to deploy the service as well as store the data. The cloud computing objective is to make data always available to users and it offers feature extendibility of new application server as well as new data base.

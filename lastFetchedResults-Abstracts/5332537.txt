The objective of this paper is to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the linkages between three multidisciplinary research themes Healthcare management concepts, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Knowledge Management (KM). We introduce Organization Current Knowledge Design (OCKD), a KM framework for Healthcare Institutions (His). The OCKD framework is likely to be the first holistic KM framework for His which would assist His to discover and create new knowledge. We review relevant literature on the need for knowledge management in healthcare and develop theoretical propositions, validated by a pilot case study, to build a conceptual KM Health framework. The conceptual KM Health framework is then validated via sub case analysis and two additional cases, and a final version of the KM framework is presented.

Distributed autonomic management systems following contradictory objectives raise difficult design challenges. We proposed a generic architecture to address this concern and exemplified it via manager integration solutions for multi-objective micro-grids (low-tension networks of the size of a district). This demo showcases some of these sample implementations via the MisTiGriD simulation platform with the aim of inspiring designers facing similar challenges.

This paper highlights potential of the near field antenna performance check in the field. It is important, because techniques to develop an objective picture of the phased array antenna performance in situ on a regular basis have particular significance in maintaining radars at the peak of operational capability. Introduced in this article is a very innovative approach of the near field antenna performance check in the field - in situ, since most radar systems are at remote locations. Described solutions can be very cost efficient for the near field antenna measurements, while mentioned briefly only, robust mathematical support is gathering more importance as the technology grows.

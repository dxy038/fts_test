The modulation scheme in a mobile radio communication system must primarily satisfy the objective of achieving high spectral efficiency and narrow power spectrum. The emerging modulation technologies in the family of linear modulation and constant envelope techniques are described. Multilevel modulation, spectral efficiency, power spectrum and intersymbol interference are discussed. The effect of coding on transmission rate and improvement of SNR requirement is considered

The objective of the study was to determine the effects of different emitter spaces and water stress on crop yield, such that the tomatoes would be suitable for processing and paste output (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill cv. Shasta). Such variables were also analyzed with respect to crop quality characteristics (e.g., mean fruit weight – MFW, fruit diameter – FD, penetration value of fruit – PV, pH, total soluble solids – TSS, and ascorbic acid contents – AA). The experiment was conducted under ecological conditions typical of the Konya Plain, a semi-arid climate, in 2004 and 2005. Drip irrigation laterals were arranged in such a way that every row had one lateral. Emitters were spaced at 25, 50, and 75 cm intervals in the main plots, while four levels of water supply, irrigation at 7-day intervals with enough water to fill the soil depth of 0–60 cm until capacity was reached (I1), and 25, 50, and 75% decreased water supply levels were applied as subplots of the experiment. Results of the field experiments showed that yield suitable for processing (68.7–72.7 t ha−1) and paste output (12.2–12.9 t ha−1) were obtainable under conditions of I1 application (p < 0.01). MFW, FD, PV, and TSS were significantly affected from treatments (p < 0.05). High stress resulted in the highest soluble solids. The total irrigation water amount and water consumptive use of the mentioned application (I1) were determined as 426 and 525 mm in 2004. In 2005, the total irrigation water amount and water consumptive use of the same treatment were 587 and 619 mm, respectively.

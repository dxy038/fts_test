Objective
e considerable effort to identify correlates of psychopathology in people with epilepsy (PWE), research has yet to identify consistent predictors. We tested the association between factors predicted by a model of adjustment to illness and psychopathology in PWE.
s
 PWE recruited from a tertiary referral centre, we examined the cross-sectional relationship between psychosocial factors (illness representations, coping, self-illness enmeshment and self-efficacy) with depression and suicide risk, while controlling for condition-related and demographic factors.
s
ariate analyses confirmed previous findings showing that condition-related and demographic variables did not consistently account for unique variance in depression although employment status was found to be a significant predictor of suicide risk. In multivariate analyses escape-avoidance coping and the illness consequences subscale of the illness representation questionnaire predicted unique variance in both depression and suicide risk.
sion
sults provided partial support for a model of adjustment to illness. Specifically, those who believed epilepsy was serious and coped through avoidance were more likely to be depressed and report a current level of suicide risk. These results suggest that interventions that target coping strategies and illness representations may be warranted for PWE with psychopathology.

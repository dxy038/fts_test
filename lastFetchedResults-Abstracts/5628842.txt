Femtocell is an effective technology to improve the system performance. In this paper, we address the problem of sub-channels allocation in OFDMA two-tier femtocell networks. Our objective is to maximize the rate sum of multiple femtocells with consideration of cross-tier interference between macrocell and multiple femtocells. A resource optimization approach based on Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm is proposed to implement the solution process of system. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms not only improve the capacity of the femtocell system but also provide good proportional fairness among the femtocell users, as compared with the traditional algorithm.

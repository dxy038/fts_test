The opportunity for the research objectives and results presented in the paper was offered by the setup and certification of an electromagnetic compatibility laboratory, targeted on development and compliance testing of mobile communication devices, concerning their ability to provide safe working conditions to the user. The experiments are designed to assess the compliance of the emitted radiation level with the basic restrictions expressed in terms of the dosimetric estimate, i.e. the specific energy absorption rate, physical quantity widely known by its acronym, SAR. A numerical model, based on the implementation of the finite element method was designed in order to replicate, as good as possible, some experimental results. After validation, the numerical model is intended to become a flexible tool, useful for intensive dosimetric analysis, with objectives complementary to the experimental goals and possibilities. The paper introduces the experimental arrangement and the numerical model, both designed accordingly to the current testing standardization in the field. A comprehensive set of results gives data for the comparison between measurements and calculus, with the specific objective of the calibration and validation the numerical model, in conformity with the experimental setup.

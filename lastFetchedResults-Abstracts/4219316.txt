The objective of this study is to investigate design and control strategies for realizing human-robot symbiosis, and to develop a human symbiotic humanoid robot, Hadaly-2, which can communicate and collaborate with human. In this paper, mechanism design methodologies, specifications, and control strategies of a mobile manipulation system of the Hadaly-2 will be described. First, mechanism design concepts of the manipulation system for the human symbiotic robot are proposed. Next, two force controlled anthropomorphic manipulators (WAM-10R, and L) and a body-vehicle mechanism are developed in consideration of the design concepts. Then, the communication and collaboration abilities of Hadaly-2 are evaluated by means of several behaviors, such as gesture motion, shaking hands with human, and block carrying tasks. From the results of evaluation experiments, it is confirmed that the Hadaly-2 can realize efficient interaction and collaboration with human

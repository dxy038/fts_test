A single-stage bidirectional converter, which is available for a grid-connection with an inverter and a battery charger of PEV (Plug-in Electric Vehicle) is presented by employing a buck-boost with two switch elements. The proposed bidirectional converter combines a front-end H-bridge ac-to-dc converter with a back-end buck-boost dc-to-dc converter. To explain how the proposed converter works, we divide into four operational modes according to circuit functions. Mode 1 and mode 2 operate when a battery charges from the grid while mode 3 and mode 4 work when a battery discharges to the grid. Each mode is illustrated and explained in detail. To verify the validity of the proposed approach, we carry out computer-aided simulations using PSIM.

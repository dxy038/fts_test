Factors influencing human behavior have seldom appeared in signal processing disciplines. Therefore, the goals of the article are to illustrate why human factors are important, identify emerging issues strongly related to signal processing, and to demonstrate that signal processing can be effectively used to model, analyze, and perform behavior forensics for multimedia social networks. Since media security and content protection is a major issue, the article illustrates various aspects of issues and problems in multimedia social networks via a case study of human behavior in traitor-tracing multimedia fingerprinting. We focus on the understanding of behavior forensics from signal processing perspective and present a framework to model and analyze user dynamics. The objective is to provide a broad overview of recent advances in behavior modeling and forensics for multimedia social networks.

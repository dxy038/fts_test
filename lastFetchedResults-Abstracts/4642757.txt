This paper presents the application of graph theory to reinforce a power distribution network against voltage sags. Voltage sag is considered as one of the main power quality problems which may cause sensitive equipment to malfunction and process interruption. The objective of the proposed method is to reinforce system voltage profile during voltage sag by means of network reconfiguration. The concept behind the reinforcement is by placing the weak areas as far as possible from the main power source. In the network reconfiguration process, the graph theory is used for finding a suitable impedance path towards the fault current.

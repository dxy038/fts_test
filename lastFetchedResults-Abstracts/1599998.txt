The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis genotypes in Shiraz, Iran. Two hundred twelve cervical swab samples were collected from women attending Shahid Motahari Polyclinic in Shiraz, Iran. The endocervical specimens were screened for C. trachomatis by plasmid PCR. Genotyping was performed in C. trachomatis-positive samples by nested PCR amplification and sequencing of 571 fragment encompassing VD1 and VD2 of omp1 gene. The overall prevalence rate of C. trachomatis in endocervical specimens determined by plasmid nested PCR was 8%. The deduced serovars found, in descending order of prevalence, were F (46.6%), E (33.3%), and D (13.3%), and serovar G was found in a single sample. Sequence mutation analysis by BLAST search against GenBank reference sequences identiÔ¨Åed 4 genetic variants. This study can be considered a contribution to increasing knowledge on C. trachomatis genotype distribution and sequence variations within each genotype in Shiraz. Further studies are needed to better define molecular epidemiology of C. trachomatis serovars and to investigate its genotype variations in Iran.

In this paper, a fuzzy Controller (FC) based Variable Structure Control (VSC) with Slide-Mode (SM) for a liquid level system is presented. The main objective is to obtain an improved performance of this non-linear system. It is aimed to control level set point by adjusting the flowrate o f a liquid entering the tank. Both the FC and the system are represented by the affine Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model.

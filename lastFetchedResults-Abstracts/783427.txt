Objective To investigate predictors for
competitive employment in a three-year follow-up
study of discharged schizophrenia patients. Methods
The nationally representative sample comprised
2168 schizophrenia patients aged 15–64 years, who
had been discharged from psychiatric hospitals in
1986, 1990, and 1994 in Finland. Comprehensive data
were collected from psychiatric case records on the
patients’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics
at discharge and use of services during the followup
period. The patients were interviewed 3 years after
discharge using a structured interview schedule,
which included questions on employment. Results At
follow-up, the competitive employment rate declined
among the three cohorts (1989: 7.4%, 1993: 2.6% and
1997: 1.5%), whereas the rate of non-competitive
employment remained at the same level (8.4%, 7.2%
and 9.6%). The probability of competitive employment
was higher for those who, at the time of discharge,
were not on disability pension and had a
current or past history of marriage, and had been
discharged in the late 1980s. The probability of being
competitively employed was lower for those who had
no occupation at discharge and for those who had
spent more time in hospital care during the three
years after discharge. Conclusions The high unemployment
rate and continuous changes in work life,
which characterized Finland in the 1990s may have
negatively affected the employment prospects of
schizophrenia patients. Work rehabilitation should be
more commonly offered, to increase their opportunities
for obtaining competitive employment and for
improving their quality of life

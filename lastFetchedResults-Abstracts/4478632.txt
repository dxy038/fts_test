This paper is concerned with switching systems which belong to a special class of Hybrid Dynamical Systems. The objective is to estimate switching times and to recognize the current mode. The general principle of the method is to use indicator signals, named residuals, which are generated by projecting the sensor measures into a subspace related to the input signals on a given time window. The advantage of this residual generation method is that the values of the model parameters are not needed, only the kind of model (linear, bilinear, ...) is used. The set of residuals may be used, under discernability conditions, to detect mode switching. An extension is proposed to identify the new mode by using a database constituted by sets of collected data that characterize each mode. An illustrative example is taken in order to show the effectiveness of our method.

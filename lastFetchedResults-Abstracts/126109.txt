introduction & Objective: Awareness during operation is an important complication which may produce neurosis, anxiety, irritability, and so on. The spectrum of awareness includes dreaming before complete recall.This complication occurs most often during cardiac and cesarean section surgeries. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of awareness when propofol or halothane-thiopantal is used during cesarean section surgeries.
Material & Methods: This a douvle blind clinical trial conducted in 1382 in Shiraz city. 151 healthy pregnant women were chosen randomly and enrolled in 2 groups. Induction of anesthesia in the first group was done with Na-thiopental (5 mg/kg) and maintenance of anesthesia was done with halothane and 02 - N2O (50%) but induction in the patients of the second group was done with propofol and maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with propofol (100 mic/kg/min). Finally, the incidence of awareness was detected 24-36 hr's after operation via direct interview with the patients.
Results: 1.3% of patients in both groups reported pain sensation during operation. Whereas hearing during operation occurred in %5.3 of the first group and in 2.6 percent of the second group. Dreaming also occurred in 2.7% of the patients in the first group and 2.8% of the patients in the second group.
Conclusion:The incidence of awareness was equal in both groups and no significant difference was detected between the two groups.

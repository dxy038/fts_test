DC to DC converters are widely used in applications such as computer hardware peripherals, power supplies, car auxiliary power supplies, servo-motor drives and medical equipments. Luo converter is a recently developed DC-DC converter. Negative output Luo converter performs the conversion from positive source voltage to negative load voltage. Parallel connection of DC-DC converters is used when available converters are of lower current rating but load requires higher current. Because of dissimilarity in devices and components used in each converter, current drawn or supplied by each converter may be unequal which will lead to converter failure or mal-operation. Therefore the main control issues in parallel-connected converters are to equalize the output currents among the converters and to ensure constant load voltage under supply and load disturbances. The objective of this work is to develop PID and fuzzy logic controls for paralleled negative output Luo converters using MATLAB software. The simulation results are presented and evaluated. They validate the superiority of fuzzy control developed.

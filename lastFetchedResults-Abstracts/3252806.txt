In this paper, we study the strategic coexistence of macro and pico cells and investigate a utility based resource allocation technique for heterogeneous networks. Aiming at finding an objective driven allocation of resources, we focus on time domain inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) techniques. Macro and pico cells optimally select their almost blank subframe (ABS) muting rate and cell range bias values, so that inter-cell offloading and enhanced ICIC (e-ICIC) are jointly performed. A theoretical closed form solution is provided for our utility based resource allocation algorithm as well as a heuristic solution. To substantiate our theoretical findings, system level simulations are carried out in which the proposed heuristic solution is compared to a baseline ICIC technique. Interestingly, our proposed solution is shown to yield significant gains of up to 36% compared to the baseline approach.

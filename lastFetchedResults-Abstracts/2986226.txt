Summary form only given. Product developing companies search for competitive advantage by speeding up time-to-market and through efficiency and quality of the product development process. Product development is also a critical activity, where failures may be disastrous. We define the quality of R&amp;D simply through its ability to fulfil requirements and expectations. It becomes immediately necessary to ask: what is excepted from a well performing R&amp;D function.

Such capability includes knowledge of basic technology, knowledge of good designs, and knowledge of design and manufacturing processes

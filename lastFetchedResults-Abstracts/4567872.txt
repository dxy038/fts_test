The main objective of this paper is to investigate the performance and applicability of two GPC (generalized predictive control) based control methods on a complete benchmark model of the Stewart platform made in MATLAB V6.5. The first method involves an LQG controller (linear quadratic Gaussian) and GPC and the second method use a combination of velocity feedback and GPC

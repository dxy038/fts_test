Wireless sensor network (WSN), has been a much attracted area for researchers for quite a while. Even with the extensive research activity over the last few years, WSNs still has a lot of ground to cover. Sensor Networks are basically data- centric wireless self-organizing network which is created by the many individual sensor nodes. They are battery driven devices, and as any battery powered devices it too has a limited lifespan. WSNs are widely used for tracking wild animals and border surveillance, enemy tracking, etc. Hence it may not be possible to recharge batteries frequently so the main objective will be to reduce energy consumption. It can be reduced in many ways like effective node placement, clustering, data aggregation, synchronized transmission etc. In this paper we are analyzing some of the available protocols for our further research.

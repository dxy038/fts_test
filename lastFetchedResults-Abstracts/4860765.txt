Areas for near-term and long-term research in joint industry-academia projects for development of intelligent distributed microgrids are presented. Advanced concepts for intelligent adaptive power grids with distributed intelligence is a longer term objective of intelligent distributed microgrids. The near-term objective is the modeling and analysis of advanced concepts for integration of distributed generation energy resources and intelligent sensing agents in microgrids within a defined regional electric distribution system, or target microgrid. The emphasis is placed on the distributed generation and distributed sensing strategies, particularly intelligent sensing agents in an overall framework of intelligent distributed microgrids

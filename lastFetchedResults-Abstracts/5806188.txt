Owing to the limit of the technological tools in the past, digital resource management can only be presented in static state. This study utilizes tags as the core, constructing digital resource management mechanism. Because of the flexibility of tags, the users can build up their own personal resource classification, through which there also constructs a social network that combines tags, information and users. Furthermore, in this study, we also introduce the concept of knowledge map, presenting the amount of objective data in graphical interface to reflect the overall system, and general application, distribution and preference of resources, in order to compensate for the disadvantage that the tagging system can only read one-dimensional information. We also develop a knowledge-map node retrieval steps in which we can ensure that we can keep the relevance between nodes and we can identify popular information from the beginning of the getting of tags.

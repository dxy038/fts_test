The need for faster and more reliable yield ramp-up when introducing new CMOS technologies is driving the effort to acquire and analyze valuable information from production test, for the process of identification of yield detractors. This paper addresses a key step in the phase of "industrialization" of these processes: standardization. The objective of standardization is to enable a seamless flow for production integrated scan diagnosis in a multi-tool, multi-vendor environment. To make analysis of chips failing the production test more efficient, a process flow and a file format to store the failing response of the chips is proposed. This enables a smooth exchange of production test data from ATE to diagnosis, failure analysis, design and process

Background: The level of serum creatinine is important affected parameter in presence of type 2
diabetes. The choice of type 2 diabetes drug therapy is crucial to control the serum creatinine
level. The drug treatment effect can only be captured through repeated observations in the
patients.
Objective: The aim of this work is to compare the drug treatment effect (i.e. “Metformin plus
Pioglitazone” and “Gliclazide plus Pioglitazone”) in presences of repeatedly measured missing
observations to control serum cretinine levels in type 2 diabetes patients.
Method: The joint longitudinal modeling approach is applied to deal with missing observations.
The presences of missing observations are assigned with missing at random and not random. The
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to carry out the iteration procedure.
Results: The “Metformin plus Pioglitazone” is found more effective to control serum creatinine
in comparison to “Gliclazide with Pioglitazone”. The joint longitudinal model with consideration
of missing assumption proffers enhanced tool for inference on clinical trial data analysis.
Conclusion: The presence of missing observation is natural in repeated measurement. The
tendency is to overlook the trial having observation and conclusion with missing observation.
The elaborated method can be applied in other clinical trial problem to reduce the inconsistency
due presence of missing observations.

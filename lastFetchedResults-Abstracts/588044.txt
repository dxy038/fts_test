Background: leptin, a hormone product by adipose tissue, plays an important role in regulation of fat-carbohydrate metabolism. 
Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of extended aerobic exercise on serum leptin and insulin resistance in male individuals with type 2 diabetes.
Methods: This semi-experimental study (2011) was performed on 30 obese adult males with type 2 diabetes who were divided into two control and experimental groups. Blood samples were collected before and after aerobic exercise (3 times/week for 12 weeks) to measure the levels of serum leptin, insulin, and fasting blood sugar in all patients. Fasting glucose and insulin were used for calculating insulin resistance. Data were analyzed using t-test and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient.
Findings: There was no significant difference between the two groups in all variables at baseline. Serum leptin and fasting glucose levels as well as anthropometrical indexes significantly decreased in experimental group (P < 0.05). In addition, aerobic exercise led to decrease in insulin resistance in experimental group (P < 0.05). All variables remained unchanged in control group.
Conclusion: Based on data obtained in our study, it seems that prolonged aerobic exercise combined with weight loss to be a non-pharmacological treatment method to regulate systemic leptin and decrease glucose and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients.

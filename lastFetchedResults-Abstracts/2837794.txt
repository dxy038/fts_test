Temperature regulation is an important component for modern high performance single -core and multi-core processors. Especially high operating frequencies and architectures with an increasing number of monolithically integrated transistors result in a high power dissipation and - since processor chips convert the consumed electrical energy into thermal energy - in high operating temperatures. High operating temperatures of processors can have drastic consequences regarding chip reliability, processor performance, and leakage currents. External components like fans or heat spreaders can help to reduce the processor temperature - with the disadvantage of additional costs and reduced reliability. Therefore, software based algorithms for dynamic temperature management are an attractive alternative and well known as Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM). However, the existing approaches for DTM are not taking into account the requirements of real-time embedded computing, which is the objective in the given project. The first steps are the profiling and the thermal modeling of the system, which is reported in this paper for a Freescale i. MX6Q quad-core microprocessor. An analytical model is developed and verified by an extensive set of measurement runs.

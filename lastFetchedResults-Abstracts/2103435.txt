Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) and Choleraesuis (SC) are among the most frequently isolated salmonellae serovars causing enteric disease in swine. Enteric disease in young pigs is of major concern in modern production systems due to the negative implications on animal health, food safety and economic return. Epithelial cells express Toll-like receptors (TLR) that recognize conserved microbial structures and act as mediators of innate and adaptive immune responses. However, little is known about the expression of TLR gene transcripts in swine. The objective of the current study was to characterize the relative abundance of porcine TLR2, 4 and 9 gene transcripts in vitro in a porcine jejunal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) and in porcine mononuclear phagocytes (pMP) in the presence of ST or SC, as well as in vivo in the distal ileum of pigs orally challenged with ST. Our results indicate that TLR2, 4 and 9 are constitutively expressed in vitro in IPEC-J2 cells and pMP and in vivo in the distal ileum. Additionally, transient modulation of porcine TLR was observed in vitro and in vivo in the presence of ST and SC. Further investigation is warranted to determine the effects of ST and SC on functional TLR.

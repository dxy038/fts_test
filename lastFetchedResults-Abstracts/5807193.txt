With the objective of providing the best decision support to facility management and maintenance, this paper presents an agent-based, serviced-oriented approach for integrating data, information, and knowledge captured and accumulated during the entire facility lifecycle from its project planning, design, construction, material / component / equipment procurement, to operations and maintenance. All data / information / knowledge sources and hardware / software applications are loosely integrated through agent-based web services, either proactive or reactive, to provide decision supports over all the stages of the facility lifecycle, and particularly to optimize facility operations and maintenance. Proof-of-concept prototypes have been implemented to validate the proposed approach.

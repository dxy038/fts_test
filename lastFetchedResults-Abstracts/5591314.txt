This paper deals with H<sub>&#8734;</sub>/&#956; DIA control of the magnetic suspension system. H<sub>&#8734;</sub> DIA control is an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control problem which treats a mixed Disturbance and an Initial-state uncertainty Attenuation (DIA) and supplies H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controls with good transients. H<sub>&#8734;</sub> DIA controller has a good initial response property, however its robust performance might be improved. We propose H<sub>&#8734;</sub>/&#956; DIA Control which is to find a multi-objective controller to achieve both the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> DIA condition for good initial responses/transient responses and the structured singular value &#956; condition for robust performance. We apply this proposed approach to the magnetic suspension system, and design a robust controller which has both good properties. Finally experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed control system design framework.

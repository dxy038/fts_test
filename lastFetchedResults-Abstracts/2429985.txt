Background: Hepatitis B virus infection is a worldwide health problem. Vertical trans-mission is a route of Hepatitis B virus infection that is regarded as a considerable factor in Hepatitis B virus prevention program all over the world.
Objective: This study was conducted to screen the hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis B e antigen in pregnant women.
Methods: From September to October 2009, two hundred fifty pregnant women in Zeynabieh hospital in Shiraz, Iran, were recruited consecutively to this study at the time of their delivery. Their sera were examined for detection of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B surface antibody, using enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay. Different demographic data (i.e. age, nationality, vaccination and family history of Hepatitis B virus infection) were investigated to determine the presence or absence of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B surface antibody.
Results: Among 250 subjects, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B surface antibody was 1.2 % and 50%, respectively. Demographic data that showed significant association with prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen were family history of Hepatitis B virus infection (X2 = 7.735, P = 0.05), age (X2 = 3.762, P = 0.05) and nationality (X2 = 5.41, P = 0.02).
Conclusion: The findings of this study recommended the necessity of hepatitis B surface
antigen screening test for pregnant women especially for those younger than 25
years of age and with the family history of Hepatitis B virus infection and also for Afghani
residents.

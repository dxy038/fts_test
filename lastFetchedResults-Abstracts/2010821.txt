Camamu Bay (Bahia, Brazil) is an Environmental Protected Area with mangroves of economic and ecological importance. The objective of this study was to elucidate, through the distribution of the benthic macrofauna and its relationships with trace metals and bioavailabilty, if the current quality of the mangrove sediments of Camamu Bay is acceptable for the protection of aquatic life. Seven sampling stations were selected as representative of the meso-littoral region of Camamu Bay. It was found 581 macrobenthic organisms distributed in 38 species. The highest values of metals occurred at stations located in areas that influenced by barite extraction, while the lowest concentrations were found in areas with relatively lower anthropogenic influence. Analysis of acid volatile sulphide and simultaneously extracted metals showed the occurrence of the ratio SEM/AVS &gt;1, indicative of possible bioavailability of metals, at only one station. The results suggested that Camamu Bay is a nearly pristine area.

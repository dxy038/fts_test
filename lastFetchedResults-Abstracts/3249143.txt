Poloxamer gels have shown promise for repair and regeneration of tissues. Electrically conductive gels can be created by suspending carbon nanobrushes (CNB) in poloxamer gels. These biocompatible gels can support cell proliferation and have wound healing applications. The objective of this work is to optimize gels and mechanically characterize them using rheometry. Poloxamer gels were made using water and DulbeccoÂ´s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). Carbon nanobrushes were added in different concentrations. Temperature, frequency, and squeeze/pull-off tests were conducted on gels. Results indicate that the elastic and viscous properties of poloxamer gels change when carbon nanobrushes are added. Carbon nanobrushes impart conductivity, introduce nanostructure, and can be utilized to tune the macroscopic mechanical properties of poloxamer gels. Ongoing work will optimize poloxamer content and carbon nanobrush concentration for cell growth. This work is applicable for tissue engineering and regeneration in clinical medicine.

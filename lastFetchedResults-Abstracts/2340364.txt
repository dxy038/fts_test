Objective: The effect of herbal medicine is more useful than synthetic medicines. The present research paper aims to show the effects of leaves extracts of Zizyphus Spina Christi (ZSC) on lipid profile, lipid peroxidation and activities of aminotransferase enzymes in streptozocin induced diabetic adult male rats.
Materials and Methods: Fifty six male rats weighing 150-200 gm were included in this study. They were divided into 8 groups. The first group, non-diabetic control rats received distilled water. The second, third and fourth groups, non-diabetic rats were given doses 50 mg/kg body weight (BW), 75 mg/kg (BW) and 100mg/kg (BW) ZSC extracts. The fifth group, diabetic control, received distilled water. The sixth, seventh and eighth were given doses, 50mg/kg (BW), 75 mg/kg (BW) and 100mg/kg (BW) ZSC extracts. Weight and fasting blood glucose were measured every week and the period of treatment continued for four weeks. Serum lipid profile, malondialdehyde (MDA) and aminotransferase enzymes (AST, ALT) were measured at the end of experiment.
Results: In diabetic rats ZSC leaves extract significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C, AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotranferase) (P < 0.05). The serum malondialdehyde markedly decreased (P < 0.001), But HDL â€“C increased significantly (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The present paper revealed that ZCS leaves extract has beneficial effects on lipid profile, lipid peroxidation and aminotranferase enzymes in diabetic rats.

This coverage of scheme candidates given the environment of NTTÂ´s local networks. The bit rate of HDSL is bidirectional 768 kbit/s per pair. The bit rates for the downstream ADSL channel are 1.6-9.2 Mbit/s. ADSL signals are transceived over either POTS or burst-mode BRA signal. Crosstalk characteristics for several ranks of line conditioning are shown in consideration of cable pair-binding structure. Intersystem crosstalk interference with burst-mode BRA is also considered. It is shown HDSL with 2B1QPAM and ADSL with 16-QAM over BRA yield the better performance than the other candidates

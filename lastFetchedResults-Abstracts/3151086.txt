This work studies the effects of the prefilter bandwidth in the sequential symbol synchronizers based on clock sampling by positive transitions. The prefilter bandwidth B is switched between three values, namely B1=&#8734;, B2=2. tx and B3=1. tx, where tx is the bit rate. The synchronizer has two variants, one discrete and other continuous. Each variant has two versions, one manual and other automatic. The objective is to study the prefilter bandwidth with the four synchronizers and to evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio).

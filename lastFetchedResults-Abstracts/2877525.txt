The main goal of this study was supporting economic evaluation by assessing which new projects will be necessary and when they should be operating in order to achieve the customer service level required under a scenario of fast growth in jet fuel demand at Guarulhos terminal. In order to achieve this objective, it was built a conceptual model, data were collected and computer based model was implemented. By comparing the system´s performance under different terminal configurations, it´s possible to choose the most economical solution that performs well in different scenarios. The analysis revealed that the current infrastructure allows achieving the customer service level required until 2018. In 2019, it will be necessary to provide a solution to increase the delivery flow rate by only spending a small fraction of the previously budgeted capital expenditure, while keeping system´s performance.

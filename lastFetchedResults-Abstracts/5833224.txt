This paper presents a novel bidirectional dc-dc converter, which doesnÂ´t use any magnetic component; and thereby reducing the losses and size of the converter significantly. As compared with previous approach Peng, F.Z., et al. (2003), the presented dc-dc converter requires less switching devices and reduces the capacitor losses. For the presented converter, the voltages balance among capacitors can be achieved without requiring high switching frequency as shown in Peng, F.Z., et al. (2003). Moreover, the merits presented in Peng, F.Z., et al. (2003), including: 1) no magnetic components; 2) compact size and light weight; 3) easy manufacturing (possible to build a whole converter system on package, or IC power module); 4) high efficiency (&gt;94%); and 5) low EMI emission, are retained. A converter with 42/14 volt, 330 W has been implemented. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the presented converter indeed provides the above-mentioned features.

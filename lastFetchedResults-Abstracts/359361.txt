Background
Early studies suggested that morbidity and mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were greater for women than men. However, in recent reports, sex-related differences in short-term outcome have decreased as outcomes among women have improved.
Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of sex on long-term mortality among a large cohort of patients undergoing PCI in the contemporary era.
Methods

Three hospitals in New York City contributed prospectively defined data elements on 4284 consecutive patients undergoing PCI in 1998 to 1999. All-cause mortality at a mean follow-up of 3 years was the primary end point.
Results

Of the 4284 patients, 1331 (31%) were women. Women were significantly older than men (mean age 67 vs 62 years, P < .001) and less often white (72% vs 80%, P < .001). Hypertension (78% vs 66%, P < .001) and diabetes (36% vs 22%, P < .001) were more prevalent in women. Prior cardiac surgery (14% vs 19%, P = .001) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) (33% vs 36%, P = .08) were less common among women. Presentation with unstable angina was more frequent in women (45% vs 41%, P = .034), whereas presentation with acute MI did not differ by sex. Congestive heart failure developed more commonly among women (7.1% vs 4.1%, P < .001). The extent of coronary disease (1-, 2-, or 3-vessel disease) did not differ between women and men. Mean ejection fraction was 52% in women and 50% in men (P < .001). Stents were placed in 77% of both groups. Procedural success was 97% for both women and men. Inhospital adverse outcomes including death, post-PCI MI, emergency bypass surgery, abrupt closure, and stent thrombosis were uncommon and not different between groups. Mortality at 3 years was 10% for women and 8.9% for men (P = .197). However, using Cox proportional hazards analysis to adjust for comorbidities and possible confounders, female sex was associated with a significant independent reduction in the hazard of long-term mortality (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.620-0.969, P = .02).
Conclusions

Despite more high-risk characteristics, female sex conferred a long-term survival advantage after PCI.

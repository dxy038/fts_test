This paper investigates the problem of packet scheduling and resource allocation for multi-user wireless video transmission. The problem is first formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the reconstructed video distortion of each user under the radio resource constraints. In order to solve the optimization problem, a crosslayer algorithm with low complexity is proposed by taking the radio resource constraints and the fairness across multi-user into account. Simulation results show that the proposed crosslayer algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art packet scheduling and resource allocation algorithms by up to 1.2 dB in terms of the quality of the reconstructed video, and the fairness across different users is also maintained.

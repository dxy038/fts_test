Several works have established links between congestion control in communication networks and feedback control theory. In this paper, following this paradigm, the design of an AQM (active queue management) ensuring the stability of the congestion phenomenon at a router is proposed. To this end, a modified fluid flow model of TCP (transmission control protocol) that takes into account all delays of the topology is introduced. Then, appropriate tools from control theory are used to address the stability issue and to cope with the time-varying nature of the multiple delays. More precisely, the design of the AQM is formulated as a structured state feedback for multiple time delay systems through the quadratic separation framework. The objective of this mechanism is to ensure the regulation of the queue size of the congested router as well as flow rates to a prescribed level. Furthermore, the proposed methodology allows to set arbitrarily the QoS (quality of service) of the communications following through the controlled router. Finally, a numerical example and some simulations support the exposed theory.

Following suggestions to use the bidirectional domain of remote sensing as a means to reduce the variability in the relationship between f<sub>APAR</sub> and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), the authors investigated the effect of estimating f<sub>APAR</sub> from off-nadir airborne measurements acquired by the Advanced Solid-state Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) during the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) in Kansas. They examined two techniques to estimate f<sub>APAR</sub> using atmospherically corrected data. One utilized the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and simple ratio (SR) and the second made use of linear combinations of red and NIR reflectances

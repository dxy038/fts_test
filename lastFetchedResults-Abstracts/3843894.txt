An objective and relevant methodology for evaluating sensory feedback codes has been developed using electrocutaneous tracking. This methodology involves dynamic (or continuous) interpretation and response by a subject to electrically produced cutaneous sensations. Results from the comparison of ten codes are briefly presented here to show the usefulness of this methodology. A general purpose computer-controlled electrocutaneous stimulation facility being developed is expected to expedite the examination of many other sensory feedback codes.

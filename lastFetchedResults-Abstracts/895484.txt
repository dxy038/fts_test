Background: The objective of this study was to discuss the spirometric
characteristics of anthracofibrosis which is a from of bronchial anthracosis
associated with deformity.
Materials and Methods: Forty anthracofibrosis subjects who were diagnosed
with bronchoscopy were enrolled in this prospective study. Static and dynamic
spirometry plus lung volumes and diffusion capacity were measured in this
group and compared to a healthy control group.
Results: Dyspnea (95%), cough (86%) and wheezing (68%) were the most
frequent clinical findings. Spirometry showed significant decrease in all
parameters including VC (FVC), FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75 and FEF25-75
/FVC. The low value of FEV1/FVC and FEF25-75 and the increment of RV
were in favor of obstructive patterns in 95% of subjects. Improving the
obstruction with bronchodilator was not significant and diffusion capacity was
mostly normal.
Conclusion: Anthracofibrosis should be added to the list of chronic obstructive
pulmonary diseases.

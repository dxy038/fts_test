The crowning objective of this research are to analyze precipitation character of Cb for different dynamical characters in Huai river basin(HRB) with ChinaÂ´s first operational geostationary meteorological satellite FengYun-2C (FY-2C) data. Firstly, 5 cloud patch dynamic parameters with respect to life stage and moving parameters are derived based on the Cb tracking method the author has proposed by combing artificial neural network (ANN) cloud classification[1], and cross-correlation-based approach to track Cb patch motion. Secondly, Cb precipitation over different life cycles and motion characters are analyzed. The result shows that: 1) Rain probability has a similar variation to rain rate, and rain rate is generally not more than 6 mm/hour, and probability is randomly higher than 50%. 2) Both rain rate and probability of single Cb is lower than that of complicated Cb which involves cell-merger and cell-split of some minor Cb patches. 3) Motion features such as horizontal moving speed of cloud patch (HMSP), horizontal moving direction of cloud patch (HMDP), and vertical moving character of cloud patch (VMCP) have no obvious impact on rain.

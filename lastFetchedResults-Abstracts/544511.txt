The purpose of preventive maintenance management is to perform a series of tasks that prevent or minimize production breakdowns and improve the reliability of production facilities. The inspection, repair and replacement of production equipment are tasks that are central to preventive maintenance management. An important objective of preventive maintenance management is to minimize the downtime of production facilities. For this purpose, management personnel have to efficiently allocate resources and determine an effective maintenance schedule. Mathematical models have been developed to solve the preventive maintenance-scheduling problem of assigning skilled personnel to work with tasks that require a set of corresponding skills.
However, there are several limitations in the prior works in this area. The craft-combination problem has not been solved because the craft-combination is assumed to be given. The craft-combination problem concerns the computation of all combinations of assigning multi-skilled workers to accomplishing a particular task. In fact, determining craft-combinations is difficult because of the exponential number of craft-combinations that are possible. This research provides a heuristic approach for determining the craft combination and an integrated solution for the preventive maintenance-scheduling problem with multi-skilled workforce constraints. Two novel preventive maintenance- scheduling models are formulated to automatically produce the optimal solution and craft combination.

This paper presents a new multi-objective function for simultaneous placement of distributed generations (DGs) and capacitors. The proposed objective function includes cost of energy losses, reliability indices and investment cost of DGs and capacitors terms. Two types of load model, two types of energy cost model and three types of DGs model has been studied. Proposed approach is implemented on a medium voltage distribution feeder in Tabriz power electric distribution network. The results of different simulations show, energy losses, reliability indices and voltage profile are optimized appropriately with simultaneous placement of distributed generations and capacitors. Also load modeling, energy cost and DGs modeling lead to more accurate results.

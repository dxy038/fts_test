Objective: The effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on in vitro mushroom tyrosinase and the proliferation of B16 melanocyte were studied. Method: The detection of in vitro activity of mushroom tyrosinase; The determination of cell proliferation rate. Result: The inhibition rate of Rb1 samples at different concentrations to in vitro mushroom tyrosinase is obviously lower than arbutin with an inhibition rate between &#177;0.05. The effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on the proliferation of B16 melanocyte is changed along with the changes of concentration. Conclusion: There is no obviously effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on in vitro activity of mushroom tyrosinase. When the concentration is lower than 125 &#956;g/ml, the proliferation of B16 melanocyte is promoted. But the proliferation of B16 melanocyte is depressed with the concentration of ginsenoside Rb1 above 125 &#956;g/ml.

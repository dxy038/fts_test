Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) is an electric vehicle which has more than one energy source. HEV is powered by battery, photovoltaic (PV), or fuel cell. It needs boost converter linked by bidirectional converter to achieve maximum power output. Maximum power point is achieved by setting reference power to manage bidirectional converter duty cycle. This paper shows design of HEV using PV and battery controlled by fuzzy logic controller. Bidirectional converter is used to adjust the charging current and discharging current of the battery. Regulation of the current is aimed to prevent damage to the battery, and reduces gassing phenomena that occurs in lead-acid batteries. Fuzzy logic controller is designed to optimize battery lifetime and used capacity. Simulation result shows that bidirectional converter has 90 percent efficiency and can regulate the charging current and discharging current. The bidirectional converter also can maintain the output voltage constantly.

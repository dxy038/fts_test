Background and objective: Women’s health is very important. Prevalence of
Urine and genital Tract infection among women is high. This study was aimed to
determine factors associated with urine and genital Tract infection preventive
behaviors among women referred to Gorgan health centers based on health
belief model.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 420 women referred to Gorgan health
centers were selected by two stage sampling method. Data was collected by using
a self-report, reliable and valid questionnaire. Data was analyzed by SPSS18
with descriptive (mean, standard deviation, frequency and percentage) and
analytical statistics (Pearson correlation coefficient, independent t test and one
way ANOVA).
Results: The mean age of the participants was 31.80±9.16. The mean score
of knowledge was 71.93±16.68; perceived susceptibility 92.45±8.51, perceived
severity 76.07±13.80, perceived benefits 95.30±6.37, perceived barriers
69.84±17.87 and the mean score of behavior were 86.71±9.14. There was a significant
positive correlation between behavior with knowledge and perceived
benefits. Physicians, midwives and husbands were the most important guides
to action.
Conclusion: The status of Knowledge, perceived suscep tibility, perceived severity,
perceived benefits and behavior were in a desirable level, but perceived
barriers were at high level. According to the positive correlation between behavior
with knowledge and perceived benefits, it is recommended that educational
intervention be implemented by physicians and midwives with emphasis
on promoting knowledge and perceived benefits of women in regard to preventive
behaviors.

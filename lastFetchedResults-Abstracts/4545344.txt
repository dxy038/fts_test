Business simulations have been used as effective educational environments that allow students to develop thinking and learning skills. Some of these environments have the characteristic of allowing geographical disperse teams to interact in an e-learning setting. The objective of this paper is to comparatively analyze the effect of this e-learning experience in the improvement of collaboration and analytical skills of the students who participate in the Carnegie Mellon business simulator in the UDLAP, comparing them with students that did not participated in the simulation game. The research was conducted using a quasiexperimental design with two non-random groups and only a post-test. According to this research, thereÂ´s evidence to conclude that Carnegie Mellon Simulation is not a determining factor to develop abilities of collaboration learning and analysis capacity in the students that participate.

The problem of service restoration in distribution network has been widely studied. Most of the researches focus on the reconfiguration of the distribution network and omit the trivial procedure of rush repair. In this paper, the problem of service restoration considering the constraints of emergency-response logistics is studied. The main objective of the problem is to reduce the interruption cost of customers. The interruption cost rate may be different and varying along outage time for different customers. The detail solution of service restoration is a series of time-stamped actions that contain both the reconfiguration of distribution system and the dispatch of available resources. So the reconfiguration and the resources dispatching must be considered systematically to figure out a feasible and optimal solution. The genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm are employed to solve the problem. Test results are given to demonstrate the validity of the algorithm.

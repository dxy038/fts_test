Our goal is conducting a comparison between quality of life as a martyr’s wife and wives of other ordinary men in Zanjan city. Our main objective was to compare the quality of life in terms of dimensions such as physical and mental health, social communications and living environment between mentioned wives. Accessible sampling method was used for sampling. In order to do this, we referred to Martyr Foundation of Zanjan and after obtaining necessary permission from the security, all of the martyrs’ wives visiting the foundation were asked to fill out the questionnaires. In the normal group, based on age, education level, socioeconomic status, employment status and place of residence, they were matched with control groups. The sample size of this study was 200 subjects- 100 martyr wives and 100 others ordinary women. According to the objectives of the research, this work is an applied, non-experimental research with causal-comparison approach. In this study, we have been used two types of questionnaire: quality of life and demographic, with 26 questions in four areas. Results indicated that, there was no significant difference in terms of quality of life between wives of martyrs and other wives. However, the performance of martyr wives was a little higher than others. In addition, there was no significant difference in terms of mental health and physical health between them. Moreover, there was a significant difference between them in terms of social communications and living environment so that, ordinary wives have better social communications and wives of martyrs have better living environment.

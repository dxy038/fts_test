tendency to appraise naturally occurring life
events (LEs) as having high negative impact may be a
predisposing factor for the development of depression and
anxiety disorders. In the current study, appraisals of the
negative impact of recent LEs were examined in relationship
to depressive and anxiety disorders in a sample of 653
adolescents who were administered diagnostic and life
stress interviews at ages 15 and 20. Participantsâ€™ appraisals
of the negative impact of LEs reported at age 15 were
statistically adjusted using investigator-based ratings to
control for objective differences across LEs. Higher
appraisals of the negative impact of LEs were associated
with both past and current depressive and anxiety disorders
at age 15 and predicted subsequent first onsets of
depressive and anxiety disorders occurring between ages
15 and 20. In addition, appraisals of the negative impact of
LEs were particularly elevated among those experiencing
both a depressive and anxiety disorder over the course of
the study. The findings suggest that systematically elevated
appraisals of the negative impact of LEs are a predisposing
factor for depression and anxiety disorders and may
represent a specific risk factor for co-morbid depression
and anxiety in mid-adolescence and early adulthood

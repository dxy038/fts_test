Opportunistic scheduling algorithms are effective in exploiting channel variations and maximizing system throughput in multi-rate wireless networks. However, most scheduling algorithms ignore the per-user quality of service (QoS) requirements and try to allocate resources (i.e., the time slots) among multiple users. This leads to a phenomenon commonly referred to as the exposure problem wherein the algorithms fail to satisfy the minimum slot requirements of the users due to substitutability and complementarity requirement of user slots. To eliminate this exposure problem, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm based on two phase combinatorial reverse auction with the primary objective to maximize the number of satisfied users in the system. We also consider maximizing the system throughput as a secondary objective. In the proposed scheme, multiple users bid to acquire the required number of time slots, and the allocations are done to satisfy the two objectives in a sequential manner. We provide an approximate solution to the proposed scheduling problem which is a NP-complete problem. We prove that our proposed algorithm is (1 + log m) times the optimal solution, where m is the number of slots in a schedule cycle. We also present an extension to this algorithm which can support more satisfied users at the cost of additional complexity. Numerical results are provided to compare the proposed scheduling algorithms with other competitive schemes.

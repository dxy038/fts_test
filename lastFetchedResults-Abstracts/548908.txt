Given the fact that planning for lessening the environmental and man- made hazards is an objective of applied geography, access to the proper data and information for creating different databases is a necessity. It would be more important when related to the dynamic, volatile and sensitive nature of environmental and man-made systems. However, inaccessibility to data is one of the main barriers to complete geographical studies in Iran as well as other developing countries. Although data accessibility is a problem, nowadays the expansion of digital data has provided a cheap and easy way to obtain data from the Internet. One of these data sources is the Google Earth (GE) which has widely been used by researchers and scientific communities around the world for various purposes. This paper is an attempt to engage the GE pictorial data and GIS tools and techniques to show the spatial patterns of ignoring the limits of physical and built features in Kermanshah, Iran.

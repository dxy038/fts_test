Background-Measurement of adrenocortical steroids at birth is of paramount importance especially for early diagnosis and treatment of some grave diseases including congenital adrenal hyperplasia and adrenocortical insufficiency. Objective- To determine the serum levels of 17α–hydroxyprogesterone (17α-OHP), 4Δ- androstenedione and cortisol in normal full-term neonates. Methods-The level of the above-mentioned corticosteroids were measured at the time of delivery, and 12 and 24 hours after birth in 15 healthy neonates by use of specific radioimmunoassays (RIA). Results-The present study indicated that there are no significant differences between the adrenocortical steroid levels of the two sexes. The level of each corticosteroid declined in the first 24 hours of life. Conclusion-The mean and standard deviation of the above-mentioned corticosteroids are higher (but not statistically significant) in comparison to studies conducted in different geographical areas, perhaps due to difference in race, consanguinity and high frequency of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in Iran.

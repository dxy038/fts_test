An algorithm is presented to enhance the resilience of block-based video-coding algorithms against channel errors. The error-resilience algorithm described suggests the use of fixed length coding to alleviate the effect of Huffman coding on the synchronisation of the decode under erroneous conditions. The proposed mechanism modifies the order of transmission of the fixed-length video parameters to increase the chance of their arrival. Synchronisation words are sent at fixed-length intervals within the bit stream to reduce the possibility of the decoder falling on similar bit patterns within the bit stream. To limit the effect of error accumulation, the motion prediction process is halted and the differential coding of motion vectors is not applied. FEC techniques are applied on some error-sensitive segments of the reordered video bitstream. The effectiveness of the proposed error-resilience algorithm is evidenced by both subjective and objective results

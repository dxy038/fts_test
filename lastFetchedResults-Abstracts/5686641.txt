A controller design for a dc motor driven robotic manipulator is presented. The main difficulties are caused by the Coulomb frictions, disturbance due to the gravitational pull and the rather stiff spring effect of the link between the drive motor and the manipulator arm. The objective is to design a feedback controller which ensures zero steady state positioning error. It is shown that the proposed controller gives satisfactory results.

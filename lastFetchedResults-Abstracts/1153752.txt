A method is described for calculating the optimum cutting conditions, in turning for objective criteria such as maximum production rate. The method uses empirical models for tool life, roughness and cutting forces. Coefficients of these models were determined based on turning experiments in high speed machining. Four types of commercially available inserts have been used to turn an AISI 4340 steel. Three chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coated inserts and one ceramic tool have been studied. In this work, the machine power and the maximum spindle speed were considered as the process constraints. The method consists on explaining the feed in relation to the roughness which depends on the cutting speed. Then, the cutting speed which gives the minimum production times was calculated. This value is then compared to the allowed values imposed by the constraints. At least, the optimal value of feed was calculated. The obtained results indicate that the described method is capable of selecting the appropriate conditions.

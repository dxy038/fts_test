A variable tap-length LMS algorithm based on adaptive parameters for tapped-delay-line (TDL) structure adaption is proposed in this paper. The objective of this work is to overcome some drawbacks of previous variable tap-length adaptive filter algorithms, including slow convergence speed and high sensitivity to noise. Novel tap-length iteration equation based on adaptive parameters and arctangent-limited value is proposed. The values of adaptive parameters can automatically change according to the filter state, which not only improves the convergence speed but also reduces the steady-state error. The arctangent-limited value can effectively reduce the instantaneous estimated error, which enhances the robustness to noise. Computer simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithm.

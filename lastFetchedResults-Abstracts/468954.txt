Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare the abdominal sacral colpopexy and vaginal sacrospinous colpopexy in the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse.
Study design
Ninety-five women with vaginal vault prolapse were allocated randomly to sacral colpopexy (47 women) or sacrospinous colpopexy (48 women). Primary outcome measurements include subjective, objective, and patient-determined success rates. Secondary outcomes include the impact on bowel, bladder, and sexual function, cost, and quality of life.
Results
Two years after the operation (range, 6-60 months), the subjective success rate was 94% in the abdominal and 91% in the vaginal group (P = .19). The objective success rate was 76% in the abdominal group and 69% in the vaginal group (P = .48). The abdominal approach was associated with a longer operating time, a slower return to activities of daily living, and a greater cost than the sacrospinous colpopexy (P<.01). Both surgeries significantly improved the patient's quality of life (P<.05).
Conclusion
Abdominal sacral colpopexy and vaginal sacrospinous colpopexy are both highly effective in the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse.

Objective
Tumors of the central nervous system constitute the largest group of solid 
neoplasms in children and are second only to leukemia in their overall 
frequency during childhood. The main purpose of the present study is to 
determine the incidence, age, sex, location and histological diagnosis of CNS 
tumors in children, less than 15 years of age, in the Mofid Children’s Hospital, 
in the past 10 years.
Materials and Methods
 In this descriptive retrospective study we reviewed the medical records of 143
children with diagnosis of CNS tumors admitted during the past 10 years in 
neurology and surgery departments of Mofid Children’s Hospital between the 
years 1996 and 2006.
Results
During the 10 year study period, CNS tumor was diagnosed in 143 patients; 
of these tumors, 119 were intracranial and 58 were intraspinal; 51.3% of brain 
tumors were located in the supratentorial and  48.7% in the infratentorial 
regions. The most common intracranial neoplasms were astrocytic tumors 
(36.8%), embryonal tumors (31.1%) and ependymal tumors (13.4%). Of the 
intraspinal neoplasms the most frequently noted were embryonal tumors 
(37.5%), mesenchymal meningothelial tumors (20.8%), followed by astrocytic 
tumors (16.7%). The median age at diagnosis was 8.9 ± 4.1 years with a male 
to female ratio of 1.4:1 (P < 0.5). The most common intracranial astrocytic and 
embryonal neoplasms were pilocytic astrocytoma and medulloblastoma / PNET 
respectively.
Conclusion
Brain tumors in children constitute a diverse group in terms of incidence, 
distribution and histopathological diagnosis.

The project risk assessment is an important basis for construction enterprises to select the bidding project and make decisions during the bidding phase. In this paper, based on the thoughts of idealization and the combination of objective and subjective ideals, the project risk assessment model of Rough set-TOPSIS is proposed. Firstly, adopting Rough set theory, the objective weight of each index of project risk assessment is calculated, and combining them with the subjective weights obtained by used AHP, the hybrid weight of each index is achieved. Then, taking the minimized risk as the objective, according to their closeness coefficient, TOPSIS is applied to rank the orders of the bidding projects. Finally, an example is taken to shown the applying procedure of the proposed method and its effectiveness is verified. Compared with other similar models, the calculation method of index weight is more scientific and realistic. The proposed model can also be applied to solve the problems such as information project selection, material selection and many other areas of management decision problems.

In this paper, a bidirectional converter for hybrid electrical vehicles addressing high efficiency and digital control is proposed. It is based on two switching converters linked through a high frequency transformer and exploits soft-switching technique and an active-clamp circuit. Operating principle, theoretical analysis and design guidelines are provided, as well as simulation and experimental tests performed on a 1.5kW lab prototype.

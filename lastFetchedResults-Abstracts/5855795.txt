The composite vector function is introduced, which is applied to multiobjective programming with equality constraints and inequality constraints, three theorems on the optimality sufficient condition are established in this article. on the Banach space,optimality of composite function and pseudoconvex and strictly pseudo-convex of composite function are redefined. We introduce Jacobian matrix and knowledge of norm approximation. Several optimality sufficient conditions are given on pseudoconvex and strictly pseudo-convex in some part of the objective function and constraints.

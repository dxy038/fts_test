This paper is based on the perception that science and technology policy (STP) in Brazil has followed a steady course over the last decades, regardless of each government´s particular orientation. In this sense, it has acted almost autonomous. The main objective is to analyze in what degree has the agenda of science and technology policy actually changed. In this sense, we explore this policy´s trajectory, emphasizing the more recent period. Based on the evidences we found in the literature and in policy documents, we conclude that although there has been some change in the discourse surrounding STP in Brazil, the policy´s agenda itself has not changed significantly. We argue that this is due to the policy makers´ rationale concerning science and technology.

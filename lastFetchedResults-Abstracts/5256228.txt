This paper presents a method for induction motor (IM) parameters determination with the objective of using the motor itself as its power, torque and speed measuring instrument. Generally the induction motor parameters are measured in no load and blocked tests methods, which do not reveal the real behavior of its parameters in the whole range of operation. Recently developed Harmony Search (HS) algorithm has been used in optimizing processes with positive results. HS algorithm is a music based meta-heuristic similar to the music improvisation process where musician continuously improve the pitches to obtain better harmony. The use of stator and rotor equations in stationary frame and the HS algorithm can provide a way to get the induction motor parameter to the whole range of motor operation and this is a great step to have a confident use of the electrical inputs quantities of the motor together its speed to get the parameters of the whole range operation and thus to change the motor into an instrument to measure its own power, torque and speed that is delivered to its mechanical load.

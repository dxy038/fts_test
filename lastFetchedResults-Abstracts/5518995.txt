The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Technical Center is conducting automatic dependent surveillance (ADS) engineering trials over the Pacific Ocean region in cooperation with the governments of Japan and Australia and participating airlines. The objective of the program is to gain early experience with ADS and satellite data link. Test flights began with a United Airlines B-747-400 aircraft in a flight from San Francisco to Singapore in September 1990. The avionics used in the initial testing are designed to a subset of international standards and are expected to evolve as the program matures. One phase of the program will demonstrate whether satellite position reports can replace oceanic HF radio voice progress reports. The data link experience gained with controllers will be used for implementation and future enhancements to the Oceanic Program. Data collected during these tests may be used to certify the satellite link for transmission of Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Safety Services

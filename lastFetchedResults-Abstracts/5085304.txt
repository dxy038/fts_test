The recently introduced concept-based IEC approach is extended to include robustness to uncertainties of the preferences, of the decision makers, towards sub-concepts and concepts. A novel measure is presented, which allows the decision makers to assess the relative robustness of concepts in a multi-objective evolutionary search process. Examples of interactive scenarios are given to demonstrate the proposed approach.

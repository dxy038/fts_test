The algebraic code excited linear prediction (ACELP) algorithm, due to low complexity and high quality in its analysis-by-synthesis (AbS) optimization, has been adopted by many speech coding standards. In this paper, the scalability of computational complexity to the global pulse replacement search method for ACELP is proposed. In addition, the proposed method can achieve the lowest computational complexity with perceptually negligible degradation. Based on the standard subjective and objective quality measurements, the experimental results reflect the facts.

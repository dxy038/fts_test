Over the past decade, many modifications have been proposed in simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography in order to effectively separate a binary mixture. However, the separation of multi-component mixtures using SMB is still one of the major challenges. In addition, the performance of SMB system highly depends on its operating conditions. Our study address this issue by formulating a multi-objective optimization problem that maximizes the productivity and purity of intermediate eluting component at the same time. A number of optimized isocractic ternary SMB operating schemes are compared both in terms of productivity and amount of desorbent to feed ratio. Furthermore, we propose a generalized full cycle (GFC) formulation based on superstructure formulation encompassing numerous operating schemes proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate that this approach has a potential to find the best ternary separation strategy among various alternatives.

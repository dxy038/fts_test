The performance of the positioning of customer order decoupling point (CODP) directly determines the supply chain lean degree. Focused on its positioning, basic characteristics of CODP upstream and downstream are analyzed. Based on multi-objective, consisting of product function, manufacturing cost and lead time, the positioning of CODP decision-making model is constructed. The entropy technology and ideal point principle is given to derive the optimal solutions of the proposed models. Finally, taken an example, the feasibility of decision-making model and its evaluation method is verified.

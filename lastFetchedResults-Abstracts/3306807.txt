Wireless sensor network (WSN) is usually considered as a large-scale network with thousands of tiny sensors and deployed in hostile environment for military application to gather the sensitive data from the field. The crucial objective of WSNs routing protocol is to gather the sensed information in energy efficient way since the wireless sensor node is resource constrained node. The power consumption can be reduced by means of using the concept of area sectorization and green technology where we can use low power sensor node and base station. The proposed model uses originating green routing protocols which illustrate to be efficient where we consider energy efficiency as the major constraint. The proposed technique is a source of the sectorization concept where the sector partition can be done by means of using different prototype by using cell splitting concept like mobile communication to achieve connectivity as well as for energy efficient routing. The cell sectorization is a new concept in wireless sensor network which gives the limited routing information to resource constrained sensor nodes to efficiency of memory and energy consumption. In this paper, a green energy algorithm is presented.

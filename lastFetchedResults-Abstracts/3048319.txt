System identification is the process of constructing an accurate and reliable dynamic mathematical model of the system from observed data and available knowledge. The choice of inputs used for perturbing the system is critical in the identification and model building exercise. One of the major objectives of system identification is accurate estimation of the system parameters. Identification of chemical process plants is carried out on running plants in real time. The practitioner would thus prefer a ´plant friendly´ input signal. We propose unified multi-objective formulations and solution methods for the input design for two particular cases. The input can be evaluated as a solution to a multi-objective optimization problem.

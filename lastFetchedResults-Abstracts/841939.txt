The objective of this paper is twofold: on one hand we demonstrate the generation of multi-scroll attractors in fractional order chaotic systems. Then, we design state feedback controllers to eliminate chaos from the system trajectories. It is demonstrated that modifying the underlying nonlinearity of the fractional chaotic system results in the birth of multiple chaotic attractors, thus forming the so called multi-scroll attractors. The presence of chaotic behavior is evidenced by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent computed for the output time series. We investigate generation and control of multi-scroll attractors in two different models, both of which are fractional order and chaotic: an electronic oscillator, and a mechanical “jerk” model. The current findings extend previously reported results on generation of n-scroll attractors from the domain of integer order to the domain of fractional order chaotic systems, and addresses the issue of controlling such chaotic behaviors. Our investigations are validated through numerical simulations.

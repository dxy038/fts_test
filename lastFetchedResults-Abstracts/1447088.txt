The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of injection marination with calcium salts on beef longissimus quality traits. Strip loins were injected (11% by weight) with distilled water or a 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 M solution of calcium ascorbate, calcium chloride, or calcium lactate. Non-injected loins served as controls. Visual and instrumental color evaluations indicated that calcium ascorbate accelerated myoglobin oxidation, and increasing molar concentration of any calcium salt caused faster (P&lt;0.05) discoloration. Aerobic microbial plate counts were lower (P&lt;0.05) for treatments containing calcium lactate than those with calcium chloride or calcium ascorbate. Calcium ascorbate inhibited lipid oxidation whereas calcium lactate and calcium chloride appeared to be pro-oxidants of lipid oxidation. No differences for Warner-Bratzler shear force or sensory panel tenderness were found among the calcium salts; however, 0.3 M treatments had lower shear values and were judged more tender than 0.1 M treatments. Calcium ascorbate and calcium chloride treatments resulted in less (P&lt;0.05) beef flavor and more (P&lt;0.05) off-flavors than calcium lactate treatments. In addition, 0.1 M treatments had higher (P&lt;0.05) beef flavor scores while 0.3 M treatments had higher (P&lt;0.05) off-flavor scores. Considering the effects on color life, microbial inhibition, shear force, and sensory traits, we recommend injecting beef longissimus with a 0.1 M solution of calcium lactate to enhance both uncooked and cooked quality.

Objective
rpose is to systematically evaluate the literature regarding treatment of chronic glenoid bone defects in the setting of recurrent anterior shoulder instability to determine if, from an evidence-based outcomes approach, one technique may be recommended over the other.
s
 1966-2009, Embase 1980-2009, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for human studies in English. Keywords were osseous glenoid defects, glenoid bone grafting, Latarjet procedure, iliac crest and glenoid defects, and glenoid rim fractures. Inclusion criteria were all articles evaluating chronic glenoid deficiency in the setting of recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability. Exclusion criteria were surgical techniques not reporting follow-up, glenoid rim fractures treated by open reduction internal fixation, and investigations not quantifying glenoid deficiency assessments.
s
ticles met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All articles were level IV (case series), most (5/6) were retrospective. Multiple techniques involving coracoid transfer and allograft or autograft reconstruction have been described for management of chronic glenoid deficiency. Lack of high level evidence in the form of prospective randomized trials limits our ability to recommend one technique over another. The 6 techniques reviewed here were all effective at preventing recurrent instability.
sions
c glenoid deficiency in the setting of recurrent anterior instability is an extremely challenging problem. There remains a lack of strong evidence guiding the surgeon in the decision-making process. Additional research is needed to optimize the preoperative glenoid defect assessment, further evaluate the reconstruction techniques, and follow the long-term effects of reconstruction on the development of glenohumeral arthrosis.

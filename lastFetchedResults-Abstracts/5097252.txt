How to introduce reliability into the optimization of TOU is the problem to be solved in this paper. Firstly, we optimizes TOU according to the principle of Pareto efficiency, The objective function is to minimize the difference between peak and valley, while the interests of the power supply company and consumers will not decrease on the premise that network constraints are met. Reliability compensation is introduced into benefit analysis of the power supply company and consumers to take into account the effect of reliability on optimization of TOU. Then we apply the particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the TOU optimization problem. Finally the simulation analysis of the IEEE 69 nodes system showed, when considering reliability, the peak and valley difference reduced, while the power suppliersÂ´ revenue and the economic benefits of the power consumers do not reduce.

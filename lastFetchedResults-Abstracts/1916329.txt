BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is an inflammatory mucocutaneous disease which is common in adults. OLP occurred in children rarely.  The aim of this study was to introduce a 13-year-old girl with OLP and her treatment and follow up.
CASE: The 13-year-old patient was admitted with the complaint of erythema of the buccal mucosa and clinical diagnosis was reticular and erosive LP. The patient had no cutaneous signs. After the histopathologic confirmation of LP diagnosis, the patient's condition was controlled with oral health maintenance and corticosteroid therapy and wasnâ€™t relapsed after 3 month follow up.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the pediatric dentists should know the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of OLP in children and should periodically monitor the patients to control the disease recurrence and possible malignant changes.
KEY WORDS: Lichen planus, Oral cavity, Pediatric dentistry.

In this paper we present an application of optimal control theory of partial differential equations combined with multi-objective optimization techniques to formulate and solve an economical–ecological problem related to the management of a wastewater treatment system. The problem is formulated as a parabolic multi-objective optimal control problem, and it is studied from a non-cooperative point of view (looking for a Nash equilibrium), and also from a cooperative point of view (looking for Pareto-optimal solutions “better” than the Nash equilibrium). In both cases we state the existence of solutions, give a useful characterization of them, and propose a numerical algorithm to solve the problem. Finally, a numerical experience for a real world situation in the estuary of Vigo (NW Spain) is presented.

Objective.
To assess the gap between self-perceived and professionally diagnosed physical and mental conditions in underserved minority populations.
Study setting.

The study sample consisted of 287 African-American and Latino heads of households respondents, obtained from a geographically defined random sample of 418 households from three Urban Public Housing Communities in Los Angeles County, California.
Study design.

This study conducted a cross-sectional survey with face-to-face interviews.
Results.

Eighty-five percent (245) of this sample reported that they were suffering from at least one chronic condition. However, 43% of participants who suffer from chronic condition(s) claimed that a physician had never diagnosed at least one of their chronic illnesses. Depression (16%), hearing impairment (10%), arthritis (8%), dental problems (7%), and vision conditions (7%) are the most frequently reported undiagnosed chronic conditions among these populations.
Conclusion.

This study documents significant disparities in the detection and treatment of specific medical conditions among Hispanic and African-American population residing in public housing, which often leads to end-stage complications due to lack of timely diagnoses and treatment.

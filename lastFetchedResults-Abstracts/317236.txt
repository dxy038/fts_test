A retrospective assessment of labial sensory function following sagittal split osteotomy was undertaken by a combination of record analysis, postal questionnaire and objective sensory testing.
Case records for 90 sides operated upon by a single consultant surgeon between 1979 and 1992 identified a prevalence of persisting sensory change at 2 years of 6.7%. A higher incidence of sensory change was seen in patients treated with intermaxillary fixation/upper border wires than those managed with buccal monocortical miniplates.
Postal questionnaire returns for 67 consultant operated sides identified a higher incidence of sensory change than recorded in the notes. 5.9% had long term persisting anaesthesia. Another 28% had more variable subtle sensory impairment. A similar relation to method of fixation was seen. An association between duration of temporary sensory change and magnitude of forward mandibular advance was noted.
Objective sensory testing validated the subjectively reported sensory status but also identified many patients self-assessed as normal had some undetected sensory impairment.
Possible mechanisms for the above findings and implications for clinical practice are presented.

This paper analyzes the feasibility of improving the steering behavior of a trailer self-steering system using variable steering geometry. The motivation is to overcome the performance limitations of passive trailer self-steering systems, without introducing any expensive high-power actuation hardware. The final objective is to realize a low-cost system that reaches the same performance levels as directly actuated steering systems, including the capability of reverse-travel steering and the controllability of the steering angle. With the novel approach described in this paper, only a low-power actuation is required. The objective of this paper is a description of the system structure and a comprehensive assessment of its properties and limitations using simulation experiments.

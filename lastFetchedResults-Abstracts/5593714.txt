This paper presents initial study of new control PID-Active Force Control (PIDAFC) in controlling twin rotor multi-input multi-output System (TRMS). The objective is to control the TRMS response in order to obey the desired output and rejecting external disturbances. To control the TRMS was challenging since the rotor interact badly at the beam between yaw and pitch. For this reason, it considers as multi input and multi output (MIMO) with nonlinear behavior. The new approach using PID-AFC integrate with neural network and fuzzy logic was proposed to compensate the disturbance occur on TRMS. AFC scheme refer as based controller was used to estimate the disturbance torque while neural network and fuzzy logic act as an optimization device. In initial stage PID-AFC can still be used in minimize the tracking error and rejecting the disturbances. The proposed approach is exhibited through the simulation.

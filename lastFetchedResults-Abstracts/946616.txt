The knowledge about the effect of cigarette smoking on the male reproductive function is still limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between active exposure to tobacco smoke and the male reproductive hormone profile in a group of 136 Mexican flower growers. Serum levels of FSH, LH, prolactin, total testosterone, Inhibin B and estradiol were measured using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Weight and height were also measured and a structured questionnaire was applied to get information on sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and work history and alcohol and tobacco consumption (current smoking habit and number of cigarettes smoked per day). Based on this information tobacco consumption was divided into four categories: never-smokers, ex-smokers, current smokers under five cigarettes/day and current smokers over or equal to five cigarettes/day.

Using the group of never-smokers as reference and after adjusting for potential confounders, current smokers of five or more cigarettes/day showed significantly higher levels of LH (β = 0.33, p = 0.01), prolactin (β = 0.18, p = 0.03) and testosterone (β = 0.21, p = 0.02). Current smokers of less than five cigarettes/day also showed higher levels of prolactin (β = 0.12, p = 0.03) and testosterone (β = 0.18, p < 0.01). Hormone levels of ex-smokers were similar to those of never-smokers.

Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that tobacco consumption may act as an endocrine disruptor on the male hormone profile.

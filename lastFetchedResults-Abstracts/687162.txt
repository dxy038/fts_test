The main purpose of this study was to perform an evaluation of the particles’ optical parameters’ influence on surface solar UV-B (280–315 nm) irradiance in Córdoba, Argentina. To achieve this objective UV-B irradiance dataset, AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) database, and TUV (Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible) model were used to analyze the effects of aerosols on surface irradiance on cloudless days during specific days of winter and spring of the period 1999–2006. Together with a direct observer, total irradiance (300–3000 nm) measurements were used as an ancillary tool to verify the cloudless condition. Every year, during this period, important reductions in surface irradiance are observed due to the aerosol load. Aerosols were incorporated in the model through the aerosol optical depth at 340 nm, the asymmetry parameter at 440 nm, and the single scattering albedo at 440 nm, all of them provided by AERONET Córdoba-CETT site. These factors vary from near to zero up to 1.4, from 0.56 up to 0.83 and from 0.43 up to 0.99, respectively. The behaviors of these factors along the year are analyzed considering the meteorology of Córdoba. When AERONET data are included in the TUV model they allow an accurate simulation of the UV-B irradiance, making the agreement with the experimental measurements substantially better. Only a small differences (±2%) remains, which can be attributed to diverse factors. As the AERONET site is 20 km away from the irradiance measurement site, these results show the regional character of the aerosols in Córdoba, although small contributions of urban aerosols are not discarded. An episode of high aerosol and pollutants laden due to fires in the surrounding hills is briefly analyzed. A set of additional studies are needed to describe comprehensively the characteristics and behavior of the Córdoba aerosols. Some of them are being already carried out.

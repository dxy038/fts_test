In this paper, first time we have analyzed Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As as a novel channel material for SOI based Tunnel Field Effect Transistor (TFET) with V<sub>DD</sub> = 0.7. This direct bandgap channel material Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>As is compared with other channel materials that show the good device features. Using this material as channel we can see that the leakage current is very low as well as the Miller capacitance is also very small as compared to other channel materials. The only disadvantage of using Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As as channel is the low ON current that can be improved by using Si<sub>1-x</sub>Ge<sub>x</sub> as source and drain. The main objective of this paper is to introduce Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As as the channel material for TFETs.

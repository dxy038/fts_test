This paper discusses the design of mobile telemedicine for delivering medical health care services in remote areas under the Tele-emergency Project. The system design uses mobile Internet protocol version 6 (MIPv6) combined with rapidly deployable network based on mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) and IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN) technology. The result of our preliminary simulation for the project, which is the simulation of VoIP traffic over MANET, is also presented here. The projectÂ´s primary objective is to create a prototype of mobile telemedicine system including hardware and software that can be rapidly deployed in remote areas or in disaster situation where telecommunication infrastructures are lacking or destroyed

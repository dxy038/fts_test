Since the 1950´s, under the pulling of the requirements of various applications and the pushing of the evolution of associated technologies, Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) technology has developed to come into being synthesized specialized technology, and rapidly becomes a common and strategic technology. At present, the tendency of modern modeling and simulation technology is developing towards networking, virtualization, intelligence, collaboration, and pervasion. Currently, M&amp;S technology combined with high performance computing is becoming the third important means for recognizing and rebuilding the objective world besides the theory research and experiment research. Based on the recent research fruits of author´s group, this paper discusses the connotation of modern M&amp;S technology and its technical architecture, then some focusing points in recent research and application of M&amp;S Technology are discussed and prospected, including &#194;&#191; Networked M&amp;S technology based on modern network techniques, &#194;&#191; M&amp;S technology on synthesized nature /man-made environment, &#194;&#191; Intelligent system modeling and intelligent simulation system, &#194;&#191; M&amp;S technology of complex system and open, complex, huge system, &#194;&#191; Simulation-based acquisition/virtual prototyping engineering technology, &#194;&#191; high performance computing technology, &#194;&#191; Pervasive simulation technology, &#194;&#191; Embedded simulation technology, &#194;&#191; Simulator, &#194;&#191; Simulation language. At last, some conclusions are given.

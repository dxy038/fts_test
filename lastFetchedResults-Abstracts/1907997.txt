Recent clinical studies comparing accelerated versus bolus administration of alteplase tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) suggest similar thrombolytic efficacy, but reveal higher bleeding complications among older patients during the double-bolus regimen. The objective of the present study was to characterize the hemostatic profile of t-PA administered as double-bolus doses of 50 mg, at intervals of 30 minutes. Among 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated by double-bolus t-PA thrombolysis, coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters, as well as t-PA levels, were monitored. Monitored t-PA levels peaked at 5 and 35 minutes and were detectable within the therapeutic range even after 90 minutes. Marked systemic fibrinolytic activation was indicated by 75% depletion of both plasminogen and fibrinogen, as well as by 19-fold and 300-fold increases of fibrin degradation and fibrinogen degradation products. Plasminogen-activator inhibitor activity was completely suppressed. Pronounced procoagulant activation was reflected by a 3.4-fold increase of both factor XIIa and prothrombin fragment 1+2, and by a threefold increase of thrombin–antithrombin complex. Independent of t-PA weight dosage, fibrinolytic activation was more pronounced among older patients (≥63 years). We conclude that t-PA after bolus administration has a long half-life. Double-bolus regimen leads to a long-lasting systemic fibrinolytic state, which is even more remarkable among older patients— a fact that may explain the higher bleeding complications reported for this age group.

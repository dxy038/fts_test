TodayÂ´s remote sensors offer a wide variety of image data with different characteristics in terms of geometric, radiometric and spectral resolution. Although the information content of these images might be partially overlapping the complementary aspects represent a valuable improvement for information extraction. To exploit the entire content of multisensoral image data appropriate techniques for image fusion are indispensable. The objective of this paper is to introduce an image fusion method based on adaptive filters. The method is applied to panchromatic and multispectral image data acquired by the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite IRS-1C. In order to evaluate the quality of the fusion process the merged images are compared to the results of the Intensity-Hue-Saturation and the Principal-Component-Substitution merging procedures

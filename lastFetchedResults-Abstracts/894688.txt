Background and objective: EAP textbooks and materials are probably the most important elements in our academic English courses in Iran. Therefore, their evaluation can help to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and hence, to improve their quality. The purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions of EFL instructors and medical students of their EAP textbook. It was also an attempt to find out about the challenges they may face in their teaching and learning contexts.
Materials and Methods: To conduct this study, we selected 175 medical students and 25 EFL instructors from four medical universities (Tehran University, Shahid-Beheshti University, Tehran Islamic-Azad University, and Zanjan University). The instruments for gathering data were a questionnaire and interviews. Statistical t-test and MANOVA were used for analyzing the data. 
Results: The quantitative analyses showed that there was no significant difference between the students' and EFL instructors’ perceptions of their EAP textbook. However, there were significant differences between their perceptions of six different aspects of the textbook. Moreover, the qualitative data showed that overcrowded classes, lack of appropriate materials to the learners’ needs, lack of clear objectives in the EAP context, and shortage of time were the major challenges instructors and students are faced with.
Conclusion: Although there were positive perceptions of the textbook, most of the instructors did not think that it was enough for an EAP course. Besides, they believed that the number of the students in their classes should be reduced; there should be clear objectives for EAP courses; and based on such objectives, relevant materials should be designed and developed for Iranian context.

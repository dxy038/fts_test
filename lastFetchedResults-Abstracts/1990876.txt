Objective (s): Infertility affects 9% to 15% of the childbearing women population. Infertility is a major life crisis and can lead to depression, anxiety, social isolation and sexual dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate about the effect of an educational package on self-efficacy of infertile women.
Methods: This experimental study carried out in a reproductive health center affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran in 2012. A sample of 104 infertile women attending the center was randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received an educational program in four sessions on four consecutive weeks. Each session lasted for 60-90 minutes. In addition, a booklet was given to the intervention group. The control group only received usual care. Both groups completed the questionnaires at two points in time: at baseline and six weeks after the last educational session. Data were collected by a questionnaire including items on demographic and infertility self-efficacy scale (ISE). Data were analyzed using chi-square, paired t-test and independent sample t test. 
Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups at baseline. However, there was a significant difference between self-efficacy scores in two groups after intervention (P  < 0.0001). 
Conclusion: The findings showed that the educational package was effective in increasing self-efficacy of infertile women. Indeed, implementation of programs to improve self-efficacy in women is recommended.

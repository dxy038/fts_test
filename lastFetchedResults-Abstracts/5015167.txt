This paper proposes a new dc-dc static power converter, designated Bidirectional Current-Fed Flyback-Push-Pull DC-DC Converter. Circuit operation, analysis, simulation, design example and experimental results are included in the paper. What distinguishes the proposed converter from the previous circuits is the existence of input and output inductors, which provides a significant reduction of both the power source and the load side current ripple. The proposed converter is suitable for the renewable electric power systems, such as those having fuel cells as the DC-source power supply. It is also a good candidate for electric vehicle power systems, where bidirectional power flow related with battery charge and discharge is necessary.

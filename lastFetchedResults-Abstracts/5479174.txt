In addition, the most important problem in higher education is quality training of undergraduate students, i.e. teaching them how to learn knowledge and most importantly how to conduct themselves and deal with affairs. As the most important main part to achieve this objective, class tutors play an important role. From the viewpoint of class tutor, the paper describes difference between class tutors in universities and in middle schools, and presents their quality training methods based on features of modern undergraduate students and associated requirements for quality training. Finally, practice results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Objective: In spite of the high prevalence and socio-economic burden of sleep disorders in our country, the present status of our research in this field is unclear. Bibliometry is a method for the evaluation and quantitative measurement of scientific publications by means of statistical methods. The purpose of this research was to assess the bibliometric status of sleep researches in Iran and its comparison with some other countries. Method: Two national databases including IranPsych and IranMedex, and two international databases including Medline and Psychinfo were searched. The period of searching in the national databases was until the end of 1382. This period embraced January 1983 to December 2002 for the international databases. The main searching strategy was through keywords related to sleep in the title of the articles both in Farsi and English. Name of Iran and cities having main universities were the other keywords. The indicators included the total number of articles, number of articles according to the year of publication, type of articles, subject classification of the articles and proportion of sleep articles to the total articles. Some of the indicators were compared with the same indicators in Egypt, Turkey and USA. Results: During the period of this assessment, there was no published research on sleep in Medline or Psycinfo from Iran and we are in a lower rank than Egypt and Turkey in this regard. The number of sleep publications in both Iranian databases was 22 articles. The proportion of sleep articles among the total number of articles was 0.31% in IranPsych and 0.13% in IranMedex. Conclusion: this study showed a paucity of resarch activity about sleep and sleep-related problems in Iran. This neglect may reflect lesser interest in this field or lack of funding.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite of high mortality and morbidity of cesarean section (c/s) in comparison to normal vaginal delivery (NVD), it is on the rise in our country. Mortality and morbidity in emergency c/s is 2.3 times more than elective c/s. The objective of this study was evaluation of the frequency of emergency c/s and its complication
METHODS: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was done on patients with emergency cesarean section in Yahyanejad hospital during first six months of 1999. Information was gathered by questionnaires from patients'files. Then frequency, causes and complications of emergency cesarean section were surveyed.
FINDINGS: Cesarean section was done on 703 cases. Of these, 402 (57%) cases were emergency c/s. The most common causes were fetal distress (30.8%). Repeated c/s (19.4%) and CPD (15.9%) were second and third causes of emergency c/s, respectively. The frequency of post operative anemia was 21.1%. 89.8% of women had post operative decrease of HI) (less than 2 mg/dl) and prevalence of fever was 13.9%. The most common complaint was leakage (39.8%).
CONCLUSION: We should pay more attention to prenatal care, instruction of pregnant women and early diagnosis and treatment of abnormal cases during pregnancy and also the cause of c/s. So we can reduce the frequency of c/s especially emergency c/s.

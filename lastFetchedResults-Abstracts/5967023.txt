Our objective here is to take a step toward the development of intelligent social network analysis using granular computing. In particular one can start by expressing in a human focused manner concepts associated with social networks then formalize these concepts using fuzzy sets and then evaluate these concepts with respect to social networks which have been represented using set based relational network theory. We capture this approach in what we call the paradigm for intelligent social network analysis, ISNA. Using this paradigm we provide definitions of a number of concepts related to social networks.

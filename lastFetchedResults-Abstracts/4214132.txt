In this paper, the operation of bi-directional DC-DC power converters with sliding mode controllers are analyzed, considering that some of the state variables are generated using high-pass filters. The objective of this paper is to determine a design procedure for the selection of the high-pass filter parameters as well as to verify its impact on the performance of the bi-directional DC-DC power converters. In addition, the existence and stability of the sliding modes are verified considering the parameters of the high-pass filters as a part of the dynamics of the converter and controller. For each converter analyzed, a design procedure is developed for the selection of power and control circuit parameters. Simulation and experimental results are presented to support the analysis and to demonstrate the overall performance of the converters

The objective of the work described in this paper is to relate signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-interference ratio at the input of a receiver employing a quantized pulse position demodulator to the decision errors occurring at the output. This paper describes the receiver model and discusses the assumptions made in its formulation. Assumptions concerning the description of desired signals, interfering signals and random disturbances are also described. On the basis of these, an expression for the receiver output signal-to-noise is obtained which has the form (S/N) o 1+ A where (S/N)i is the input signal-to-noise ratio (S/I)i is the input signal-to-interference ratio A and D are constants related to the receiver model and desired signal description B is a constant involving the description of the noise C is a constant for a particular interfering signal description. The interfering signals for which the constant C is presented in this paper are: a single CW, two CW signals, a pulse position modulated signal similar to the desired signal, a double side-band amplitude modulated signal, a single side-band amplitude modulated signal, narrow-band and wide-band frequency modulated signals, and PCM-FSK type interferers.

Based on generalized chaos synchronization theorems for bidirectional discrete system, we construct a He&#769;non area-preserving quadratic system, and design a new 3-dimensional chaotic system called generalized discrete predator-prey system. Furthermore, a new encryption algorithm based on composite two new discrete chaotic systems for sound communication is proposed. This encryption algorithm has 9 keys, and the secure key space is larger than 2<sup>225</sup>. At first, the algorithm uses the key stream generated by discrete chaotic systems to mask secrete image. Second, it uses the least significant bit (LSB) embeddinf method to embed the masked message into audio signals. Our method can be used for steganography in the Internet audio signal communications. The analysis of the key space, sensitivity of key parameters, and correlation of encrypted signals imply that our encryption algorithm has good security.

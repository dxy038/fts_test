The paper objective is assessing the hydropower contribution during the daily peak load and evaluating its effect on the water level downstream Aswan Old Dam (AOD) and the navigation during low flow. Data are collected over 32 years. The data are daily water levels, upstream and downstream Aswan High Dam (AHD) and AOD discharge and the generated hydropower. As the basin is utilized to accommodate the daily peak load discharge; GIS technique is applied to estimate the volume of the basin between the two dams. Quasi two dimension model &#8220;GStare-W&#8221; is applied, Rating curve is produced and simple regression is applied. Criteria for navigation in first reach are established.

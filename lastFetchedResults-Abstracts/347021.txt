Objective: This study examined central and peripheral effects of fatiguing exercise (3 min maximal grip) in healthy controls (n=10) and multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects with weakness, MS-W (n=16) and normal motor function, MS-NM (n=16) in the studied extremity.
Method: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess resting and facilitated motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) of abductor pollicus brevis (APB) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles before and after fatiguing exercise. Exercise-induced depletion and recovery of phosphocreatine (PCr) were measured using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31PMRS) in FCR.
Results and conclusion: MS subjects demonstrated significantly lower peak force and a faster decline in force than controls. Contralateral muscle activation (hand grip) before the fatigue protocol resulted in significantly increased MEP amplitudes in all groups. Contralateral hand grip following fatiguing exercise resulted in significantly higher MEP amplitudes in controls and MS-NM subjects, but not MS-W subjects. Fatiguing exercise resulted in prolonged central motor conduction time (CMCT) in MS subjects, but not controls. No group differences in PCr depletion or resynthesis were observed. All groups demonstrated significant post-exercise depression (PED) of MEP amplitude that persisted beyond the time course of PCr recovery, indicating fatigue was central in origin. MS subjects were less able than controls to increase cortical excitability using contralateral muscle activation following fatiguing exercise, possibly indicating impaired conduction in the corpus callosum.

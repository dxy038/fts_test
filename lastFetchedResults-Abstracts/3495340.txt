In this paper, analysis of the operation of a stand-alone self-excited induction generator (SEIG) with generalized impedance controller (GIC) (voltage source pulsewidth-modulated bidirectional inverter with dc link battery) has been discussed. Model of the SEIG along with the generalized impedance controller, has been developed in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The simulation results obtained for steady-state operation of the system, following speed and load perturbations have been presented here. The simulation results are validated with the experimental ones, which are conducted on a laboratory prototype of the SEIG-GIC system. The generalized impedance controller is found to be capable of maintaining the frequency of the SEIG constant under open-loop condition, following the speed and load perturbations.

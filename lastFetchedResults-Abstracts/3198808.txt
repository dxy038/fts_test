This paper investigates the multi-objective optimization of ride comfort, suspension deflection and tyre grip performance measures for a conventional suspension structure by deriving the analytical solutions for a quarter-car model. The optimization results are compared with two other configurations, one having the same complexity in construction but employing an inerter while the other being the simplest suspension network with one damper and one spring only. The motivation is to investigate the possibility and situations where the inerter can be replaced by some cheaper element such as the spring. The results show that for a low static stiffness and in the situations that ride comfort is less important than suspension deflection and tyre grip (such as race cars), the considered structure would be a reasonable alternative for the one employing an inerter.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of intrauterine transmission of hepatitis B virus. Study Design: Placental tissues from 158 pregnant women who tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen were examined for hepatitis B virus markers, Fc gamma receptors, and hepatitis B surface antigen–anti-hepatitis B surface antigen in different layers of cells. Results: It was shown that the hepatitis B virus infection rate among different layers of placental cells gradually decreased from the maternal side to the fetal side. Furthermore, the closer the infected cell layer was to the fetal side, the higher the risk of intrauterine hepatitis B virus infection. Fc gamma receptors were found on cells of both hepatitis B surface antigen positive and negative placentas; Fc gamma receptors III were found on trophoblastic cells and villous mesenchymal cells, and Fc gamma receptors II were found on only villous mesenchymal cells. Hepatitis B surface antigen–antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in the cytoplasm and on the membrane of trophoblastic cells and villous mesenchymal cells in 2 hepatitis B surface antigen–positive placentas. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that intrauterine hepatitis B virus transmission could be caused through “cellular transfer” in the placenta. One of the means of cellular transfer could be through Fc gamma receptor III–mediated entry of hepatitis B surface antigen–antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen into cells.

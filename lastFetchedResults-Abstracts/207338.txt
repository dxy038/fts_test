The objective of this article was to investigate utilitarianism with respect to its implications for moral education. Utilitarianism is one of the two teleological theories, which, in contrast to egoism, puts great importance on people's happiness, and which, despite deontology, lays great emphasis on common good. Based on utilitarianism, right rules and acts are those which promote highest common good and provide for the pleasure and happiness of the greatest number of individuals. This school, like certain others, believes in final goals for mankind. This goal involves human happiness whose realization requires the promotion of certain ethical dispositions such as considering other people's rights, altruism, devotion, truthfulness, and righteousness in individuals. Utilitarianism implies a number of educational principles including the social nature of human- being, democracy, responsibility, justice, equality and individual freedom, whose promotion by the school may guarantee social happiness.

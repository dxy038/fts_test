HLC (high level control) systems are gaining in importance due to more stringent requirements on the cement quality, legislation on emission control and the increasingly competitive market situation. In 1991, the decision was made to implement a common HLC system in the Group plants in order to meet these new challenges and to improve overall performance. However, none of the HLC systems available at that time could meet the specified requirements, especially in terms of user-friendliness. The decision was thus made to collaborate with a supplier to develop a new generation HLC system. This newly developed system which provides advanced features and enhanced functionality has been implemented since 1992 on a wide scale throughout the Group plants. The typical HLC project includes three major phases: plant preparation, achievement of &#8220;Best Operator Performance&#8221; and continuous process optimization-the latter being the ultimate objective. The experience gained to date through HLC implementation in fifteen of the Group plants has been more than satisfactory with significant improvement having been achieved in heat consumption, product quality and product output. Several key success factors have been determined in the application of HLC

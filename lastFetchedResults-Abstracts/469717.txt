Objective
This study was undertaken to test for structural differences between myometrial radial arteries isolated from women having normal pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.
Study design
Pressure myography was used to study myometrial radial arteries obtained at cesarean section. With the use of a transilluminating system, lumen diameter, wall thickness, wall/lumen ratio, distensibility and stress-strain relationship were studied through a range of pressures. Arteries were then fixed in glutaraldehyde, embedded in resin, cross-sectioned, and studied in greater detail by light and electron microscopy.
Results
Pressure myography showed that arteries from women with preeclampsia had a reduced lumen diameter, thicker wall, and greater wall/lumen ratio compared with vessels isolated from women with normal pregnancy. Light microscopy indicated an identical media content remodeled around a smaller lumen. Electron microscopy indicated enlarged extracellular spaces in the media but no change in myocyte profile size or number. There was no clear evidence of structural changes in myometrial radial arteries isolated from women with intrauterine growth restriction compared with normal pregnancy. No differences in vessel distensibility or stress-strain relationships were detected in complicated pregnancies.
Conclusion
The changes observed in myometrial radial arteries isolated from women with preeclampsia are due to inward eutrophic remodeling. Alterations in these vessels may contribute to increased uterine vascular resistance in preeclampsia.

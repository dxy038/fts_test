The objective of the study is to minimize the whole cost of logistic system in view of the long-term planning level. Based on traditional EOQ model, a non-instantaneous replenishment inventory decision model is presented in consideration of transportation cost and the permitted working duration of the vehicles per unit time. The optimal ordering quantity is obtained by the ideas of getting the minimum values in the cost collection with different delivery times. The algorithm is designed by looping comparison and the effectiveness of the model is verified by the representative examples.

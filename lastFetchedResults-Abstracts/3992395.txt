We address content discovery in wireless networks with infrastructure, where mobile nodes store, advertise, and consume content while Broker entities running on infrastructure devices let demand and offer meet. We refer to this paradigm as match-making, highlighting its features within the confines of the standard publish-and-subscribe paradigm. We study its performance in terms of success probability of a content query, a parameter that we strive to increase by acting as follows: 1) We design a credit-based scheme that makes it convenient for rational users to provide their content (thus discouraging free-riding behavior), and it guarantees them a fair treatment. 2) We increase the availability of either popular or rare content, through an efficient caching scheme. 3) We counter malicious nodes whose objective is to disrupt the system performance by not providing the content they advertise. To counter the latter as well as free riders, we introduce a feedback mechanism that enables a Broker to tell apart well- and misbehaving nodes in a very reliable manner, and to ban the latter. The properties of our match-making scheme are analyzed through game theory. Furthermore, via ns-3 simulations, we show its resilience to different attacks by malicious users and its good performance with respect to other existing solutions.

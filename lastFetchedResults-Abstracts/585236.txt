Objective: To identify the relationship between socioeconomic
status, health system development and the incidence, prevalence
and mortality of tuberculosis in Asia and the Pacific.
Methods: Incidence, prevalence and mortality rates of tuberculosis
and 20 variables of socioeconomic, health system and biologicalâ€“
behavioral issues were included in the study involving all
46 countries of the Asian Development Bank region (2007 data).
Both univariate and multivariate linear regressions were used.
Results: The worst three tuberculosis affected countries were
Cambodia, India and Indonesia, while the least affected was
Australia. Tuberculosis incidence, prevalence and mortality rate
were higher in countries with lower human development index,
corruption perception index, gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita and countries with more people under minimum food
supplements. Among the health system variables, total health
expenditure per capita, governmental health expenditure per
capita, hospital beds, and access to improved water and sanitation
were strongly associated with tuberculosis.
Conclusions: Socioeconomic determinants and health system
development have significant effect on the control of tuberculosis
in Asia and the Pacific region. The study has some policy
implications by means of lowering the corruption and improving
the sanitation.

OBJECTIVE:
To determine survivorship in Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) in a well-defined multicenter cohort.
METHODS:
Follow-up was obtained for 77 of the 85 patients enrolled in the 1990 American College of Rheumatology vasculitis classification study.
RESULTS:
There were 28 deaths (10 females and 18 males) among the 77 patients available for follow-up. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated with mortality data from the general population and from this group of patients with WG (an SMR of 1 indicates that expected and observed survival are identical). Overall survivorship among patients with WG was substantially reduced in this cohort (SMR = 4.685 ± 0.65; for females SMR = 6.814 ± 1.571; for males SMR = 3.998 ± 0.69).
CONCLUSION:
The life expectancy of patients with WG is reduced compared with the general population.

Abstract
Introduction: Today medical world is facing the increase of chronic diseases. Rheumatoid Arthritis as a chronic disease causes pain, fatigue, limited mobility and daily activity, physical function disorder and disability. An important part of controlling chronic illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis is enabling patients to conduct self-care and adjusting to condition of chronic disease.
Objective: Present study aims to determine self-care ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Methods: This is a cross sectional descriptive study which surveyed the level of self-care of 326 patients with rheumatoid arthritis referring to Rheumatology clinic of Razi educational center in Rasht. Data were collected using Health Assessment Questionnaire in order to determine the disability rate and Self-Care Inventory in order to determine the Self-Care ability rate through interview. Data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistical tests (Kruskal Wallis, Mann Whitney and Multiple linear regressions). 
results: The mean self-care ability of patients was 57.65±2.32 which was at a good level. Sex (P < 0.0016)), age (P < 0.001) marital status (P < 0.001), education (P < 0.001), jobs (P < 0.001), income (P < 0.004), duration of illness (P < 0.000) and co morbidities (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with self-care ability. 
Conclusion: Study findings indicate that baseline factors are effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis disease; therefore it is necessary for nurses to determine self-care needs considering effective related factors to develop and implement training programs in order to improve patients’ empowerment.

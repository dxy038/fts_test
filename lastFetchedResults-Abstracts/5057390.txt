The new approach for vendor selection problem was established under the stochastic environment. After establishing the traditional multi-objective programming model, through minimizing the optimistic value of the net cost of the total order quantity, rejected quantity and late delivered quantity, the multi-objective stochastic constrained integer programming model was established based on the stochastic chance constrained programming theory, then a hybrid intelligent algorithm was designed by integrating the stochastic simulation, neural networks and genetic algorithm. The numerical example confirms the model is rational and the algorithm is valid. The stochastic constrained programming approach is feasible. It can solve the vendor selection problem.

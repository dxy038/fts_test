The corrosion state of various components was investigated to improve anti-corrosion performance of automobile by vehicle accelerated corrosion test and parts neutral salt spray test respectively. The corrosion reasons of typical parts such as galvanized bolt, galvanized pipe, painting support, constant velocity drive shaft, were analyzed in this paper. An improvement solution was presented to adopt Dacromat coated bolt, galvanized PVF metal pipe and electrophoresis bracket, etc. The anti-corrosion objective is achieved for a vehicle to ensure that the function parts can operate at service condition for six years. The equivalent relationships of corrosion damage on the typical automotive parts between the vehicle accelerated corrosion test and salt spray test were built, which can provide a new method for anti-corrosion target decomposition of vehicle.

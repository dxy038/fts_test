This article establishes a multi-objective combinatorial optimization model of multi-product single-line layout to minimize multi-product logistics costs, processing time and area occupancy rate, based on the analysis of the shortcomings of single-product single-objective optimization. Considering factors impacting on logistics costs such as the product geometry, density, degree of vulnerability factors etc, this article calculates logistics cost with equivalent logistics quantity instead of logistics quantity. At last, taking workshop B of a company as an example, this article concludes that U-shaped layout is optimal through the calculation and Emplant simulation.

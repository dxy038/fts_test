A cost-effective optimum design criterion for Organic Rankine power cycles utilizing low-temperature geothermal heat sources is
presented. The ratio of the total heat exchanger area to net power output is used as the objective function and was optimized using the
steepest descent method. Evaporation and condensation temperatures, geothermal and cooling water velocities are varied in the
optimization method. The optimum cycle performance is evaluated and compared for working fluids that include ammonia, HCFC123,
n-Pentane and PF5050. The optimization method converges to a unique solution for specific values of evaporation and condensation
temperatures and geothermal and cooling water velocities. The choice of working fluid can be greatly affect the objective function which
is a measure of power plant cost and in some instances the difference could be more than twice. Ammonia has minimum objective
function and maximum geothermal water utilization, but not necessarily maximum cycle efficiency. Exergy analysis shows that efficiency
of the ammonia cycle has been largely compromised in the optimization process than that of other working fluids. The fluids, HCFC 123
and n-Pentane, have better performance than PF 5050, although the latter has most preferable physical and chemical characteristics
compared to other fluids considered.

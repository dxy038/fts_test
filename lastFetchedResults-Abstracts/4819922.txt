The objective of this project is to investigate the potential of the complementary use of TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 data. Both satellites carry second generation SAR sensors capable of multiple acquisition modes like ScanSAR, Stripmap and Spotlight as well as multi-polarization options [1][2]. A systematic combined data use has clear advantages for many applications, for example an improved revisit of an area of interest (AOI), the availability of near coincident dual frequency data acquisitions and the potential for cross queuing of the two sensors. A problem which constrains the complementary usage of both data sources is the fact that both satellites are operated independently. As a consequence, users encounter difficulties at joint acquisition planning with an optimum combination of imaging modes. A detailed understanding on how to best utilize two independent spaceborne SAR systems in combination is therefore required.

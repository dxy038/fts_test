The proportional-integral-derivative(PID) controllers in the process plants like thermal power plants, biomedical instrumentation is of popular use. The priority of such controllers is obviously a fine tuning as a high degree of industrial expertise is required for any other alternative. So in order to get the best results of PID controllers the optimal tuning of PID gains are required. This paper presents the design and performance analysis of proportional integral derivative (PID) controller for the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) system using multi objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II(NSGA-II). It is required to develop the electronic control system for the synchronous generator for the stable operation of power system. The Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) is widely used in electrical power field to obtain the stability and good regulation of the electric system. The characteristics of alternator output required are constant voltage and constant current. To get the constant output, alternator field excitation is controlled by Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR). The Automatic Voltage Regulator maintains the constant voltage up to certain level of load current independently of generator speed and load. This paper further deals with the robustness analysis of the AVR system tuned by NSGA-II algorithm is performed by varying the time constants of amplifier, exciter, generator and sensor in the range of-50% to +50% insteps of +25%.

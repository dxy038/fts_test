This study analyses the feasibility of a unique sliding-mode control law to regulate a bidirectional boost converter with output filter in a seamless manner. The output voltage of the converter is effectively regulated by means of a proportional-integral controller, while the inner current loop has a sliding-mode current controller. The stability of this converter is verified for both step-up and step-down operation modes, considering the converter is part of a determined powertrain arrangement for an electric vehicle. Simulation and experimental results have proven the stability of the system in both operating modes and also during transitions, confirming that sliding-mode control is an appropriate control strategy for a bidirectional boost converter with output filter.

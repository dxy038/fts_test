The objective of this study was to describe the nature of the attention deficits in children with NF1 in comparison with typically developed children using the Virtual Classroom (VC). Twenty nine NF1 children and 25 age-and gender-matched controls, aged 8 &#8211;16 were assessed in a VC. Parent ratings on the ConnersÂ´ Parent Rating Scales-Revised; Long (CPRS-R:L) questionnaire was used to monitor for ADHD. Significant differences were found between the NF1 and control groups on the number of targets correctly identified and the number of commission errors in the VC, with NF1 children performing poorer (p&amp;#60; 0.005). Significant correlations were found between total correct hit and the cognitive problems/inattention scale and two indexes of the CPRS-R:L (the DSM-IV Symptom Subscales and on the ADHD Index). The attention profile of NF1 children include deficits in sustained attention and impulsivity. These results suggest that the VC is a sensitive and ecologically valid assessment tool to aid in the diagnosis of attention deficits among children with NF1

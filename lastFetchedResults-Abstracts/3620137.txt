This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a portable radiation sensor system that uses the pulsed optically stimulated luminescence technique to remotely interrogate an aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:C) radiation sensor via an optical fiber. The objective is to develop a system for applications requiring simple and inexpensive sensors for widespread monitoring of ionizing radiation levels, which can be remotely interrogated at regular periods with little or no human intervention and are easy to install, operate, and maintain. Results on the optimization and performance of the system are presented. The current minimum detectable dose is of the order of 5 &#956;Gy, which is already satisfactory for applications such as the monitoring of radioactive plumes from radioactive waste sites. We also discuss potential developments that could decrease the minimum detectable dose to allow radiation doses as low as the background level to be measured over short time intervals, making the system more versatile for detecting radiological materials.

Objective: Globozoospermia is a rare type of teratozoospermia with incidence of 0.1%
among infertile individuals. Phospholipase C zeta (PLC?) and postacrosomal sheath WW
domain binding protein (PAWP) are the main candidates in sperm taking responsibility for
oocyte activation during fertilization. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the expression of
these two genes at RNA and protein levels in globozoospermic individuals and compare
the results with fertile individuals.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, semen samples of 21 infertile
men with globozoospermia and 25 fertile men were collected. Expression of PLC?
and PAWP at RNA and protein levels were assessed and compared between two
groups by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot,
respectively.
Results: Expression of both PLC? and PAWP were significantly reduced at RNA and protein
levels in infertile men with globozoospermia compared to fertile men.
Conclusion: This is the first study that simultaneously assessing the respective factors in
a large population of globozoospermia, suggested that intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection
(ICSI) along with artificial oocyte activation may rescue failed fertilization in routine ICSI.

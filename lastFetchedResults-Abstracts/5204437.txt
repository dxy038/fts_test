The direct matrix converter (DMC) is an AC-to-AC direct power conversion topology based on controlled bidirectional switches that can generate variable output voltages and sinusoidal source currents with controllable displacement power factor at the input side. The topology is characterized by its reduced size and weight compared to Voltage Source Inverters because the lack of dc-link stage. However, its modulation is rather complex due to the high number of switching states and the fact that they are not constant. In this work a new PWM strategy based on the translation of 2L-PWM converter to the DMC is presented. The modulation scheme is developed using a simple logic functions. Results from open and closed loop tests are presented to validate the correctness of proposed modulation.

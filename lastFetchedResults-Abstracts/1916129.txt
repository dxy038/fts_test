Renal cell carcinoma with tumor thrombus of the inferior vena cava presents a special surgical challenge. The use of surgical techniques derived from the field of transplantation surgery have previously been shown to enable optimal control of inferior vena cava, allowing for the extirpation of most tumors via a transabdominal approach without the need for venovenous or cardiopulmonary bypass. In this report, we provide a stepwise description of the transplantation techniques employed at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital for the resection of renal cell carcinoma with intracaval tumor. In addition, we review the results of centers that have utilized these surgical maneuvers.

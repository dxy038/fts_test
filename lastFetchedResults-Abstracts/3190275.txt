How to provide user-satisfied video services must be solved in the future wireless communication systems. However, most of existing works focused on the PHY-MAC cross layer schemes do not consider the end-to-end video quality of service (QoS) and hence can only provide limited user-perceived video quality improvements. In this paper, a novel video transmission scheme with guaranteed end-to-end QoS over Multiple Input Multiple Output and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems is proposed. The end-to-end video quality is measured by recursive optimal pixel estimation (ROPE) algorithm. Our objective is to minimize the ROPE distortion by jointly optimizing the source encoding parameters of H.264/AVC encoder in the application layer, the adaptive modulation and coding parameters and time-frequency resource block selection in the physical layer. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can provide good user perceived quality.

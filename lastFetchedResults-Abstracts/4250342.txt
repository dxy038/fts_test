In this paper, multi-objective structure selection of RBF networks based on evolutionary computation is considered. The RBF network structures are encoded to the chromosomes in GA. Then, they evolve toward Pareto optimum defined by some objective functions concerning with model accuracy, model complexity and connection weights. Some numerical simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can give Pareto optimum structures.

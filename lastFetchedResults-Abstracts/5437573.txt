Compression of depth maps is important for &#8220;texture plus depth&#8221; format of multiview images, which enables synthesis of novel intermediate views via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) at decoder. Previous depth map coding schemes exploit unique depth data characteristics to compactly and faithfully reproduce the original signal. In contrast, since depth map is only a means to the end of view synthesis and not itself viewed, in this paper we explicitly manipulate depth values, without causing severe synthesized view distortion, in order to maximize representation sparsity in the transform domain for compression gain - we call this process transform domain spar-sification (TDS). Specifically, for each pixel in the depth map, we first define a quadratic penalty function, with minimum at ground truth depth value, based on synthesized view´s distortion sensitivity to the pixel´s depth value during DIBR. We then define an objective for a depth signal in a block as a weighted sum of: i) signal´s sparsity in the transform domain, and ii) per-pixel synthesized view distortion penalties for the chosen signal. Given that sparsity (l<sub>0</sub>-norm) is non-convex and difficult to optimize, we replace the l<sub>0</sub>-norm in the objective with a computationally inexpensive weighted l<sub>2</sub>-norm; the optimization is then an unconstrained quadratic program, solvable via a set of linear equations. For the weighted l<sub>2</sub>-norm to promote sparsity, we solve the optimization iteratively, where at each iteration weights are readjusted to mimic sparsity-promoting l<sub>&#964;</sub>-norm, 0 &#8804; &#964; &#8804; 1. Using JPEG as an example transform codec, we show that our TDS approach gained up to 1.7dB in rate-distortion performance for the interpolated view over compression of unaltered depth maps.

Objective: To evaluate results of open reduction in 9 patients with neglected posterior dislocation of elbow, regarding Range of motion (ROM), stability and pain.
Type of study: Prospective descriptive study.
Place and duration of study: District headquarter teaching hospital, Dera Ismail Khan. May 2005- May 2008.
Materials and methods: A total of nine patients were included in study with mean age of 31 years (range 15- 55 years). Mean time since injury was 2.8 months (range 1- 7 months). Two patients had associated fractures around elbow. All the patients underwent open reduction using Speeds technique. Mean follow-up was 7.4 months (range 2.5-15 months) in which patients were assessed for pain, stability, range of motion (ROM) and ulnar nerve deficit.
Results: All patients showed improved ROM irrespective of duration of dislocation. Mean movement gained was 89° (range 60°-110°). Patients presenting early had better results than those presenting late or with associated fracture. Two patients complained of mild pain after heavy load lifting. All elbows were stable and there was no infection or ulnar nerve deficit.
Conclusion: Open reduction is simple and effective method to restore the joint to stable, pain free and functional state.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of different levels of yeast Saccaromyses Cerveasia and molasses on chemical composition, nutritive value and degradability of Artiplex lentiformis silage. The levels of yeast Saccaromyses Cerveasia include: 0, 2.5 and 5 g/kg dry matter and levels of molasses include: 0, 10 and 15 precent were that added to Atriplex lentiformis silage. The experiment was conducted the factorial method 3 Ã— 3 on based a completely randomized design. The chemical composition were include: dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), aSh, neutral detrjent fibr (NDF), acid deterjent fibr (ADF), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP) and water soluble carbohydrate (WSC). degradation percent dry matter of samples was detemned by in situ technique with using two ruminal fistulated sistani steers. Test results showed that levels of 2.5 and 5 g/kg yeast significantly increased dry matter and decreased water soluble carbohydrate But had no the disarable effect on neutral detrjent fibr (NDF) and acid deterjent fibr (ADF). In contrast, levels 10 and 15 percent molasses reduced the neutral detrjent fibr (NDF), acid deterjent fibr (ADF) and was increased  dry matter content and water soluble carbohydrate levels of 2.5 g/kg yeast and  %10 molasses were showed the highest amount digradibility dry matter and no significant difference with control. The results of this research showed that yeast Saccaromyses Cerveasia and molasses can somewhat improve the nutrition value Atriplex lentiformis silage  but the effect of molasses on the degradation and nutritive value of Atriplex lentiformis was  more beter than yeast Saccaromyses Cerveasia.

   Neighborhood space and district is an issue that has been forgotten in contemporary architecture of cities. With regard to the quantitative increase of districts and also the increase of a unilateral physical view towards them, their security declines and consequently the capacity for crime  increases in the residential spaces and fear of crime occurrence among the residents of the districts. In the environmental design, the CPTED attitude is one of the most effective approaches to enhance security. The main pivot of this article is to study the rate of agreements of the physical elements of old districts of Shiraz with the features of CPTED attitude. The research method is a combination of descriptive and analytical and historical methods and the necessary information has been collected by using the systematic visual taking tools, regulatory checklists, and documentary sources. The results of this research show that the applied principles in the design of historical districts of Shiraz are close to the stable principles of this method. This research presents an opening to the localization of efficient approaches like this which can help with the increase of the security of residential districts. This objective  as the pivot of this research   has been presented within the framework of concluding remarks. On this basis, with regard to the identity of the Iranian residential districts identity, certain approaches have been presented based on CPTED approach.  Having considered them in the process of design, it can lead to the increase of the security in the designed residential districts proportional with the Iranian identity.

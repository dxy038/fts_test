During the smelting process of refined copper strip production, to reduce varied losses caused by obvious superscales of some individual ingredients, the multi-charge diluting optimization method for smelting ingredients of refined copper strips is studied. The multi-object optimization model for smelting ingredients diluting is established. Lagrangian relaxation idea is introduced to transform the multi-objective model, and the detail implement steps of bacteria foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm are designed to solve above model. The experiment result shows that BFO algorithm is suitable for solving complex optimization problems such as diluting smelting ingredient.

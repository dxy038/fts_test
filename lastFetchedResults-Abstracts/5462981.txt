There is a rapidly growing interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially in the current global financial crisis. We briefly review the development of CSR and point out in China the research is quite frequently immature and heavily qualitative. To facilitate the development, we propose a quantitative way to measure CSR and formulate CSR in a multiple objective portfolio selection model as an extension of traditional Markowitz´ portfolio selection model. Based on Chinese stocks by industries, we calculate the stocks´ CSR measurements and perform model optimization by computing the efficient portfolios. Comparing with major indexes of Chinese stock markets as benchmarks by t-tests, some efficient portfolios outperform the indexes and therefore can justify our approach. Moreover, our methodology stems from established measurements of CSR and latest enrichments of programming methodology and finance and therefore can be applicable to CSR research worldwide. At the early stage of research by the intersection of programming methodology and finance, more important and inspiring questions are raised than answered. Consequently, as the frontier is being pushed, definitely being counted are more promising results.

An impact–electric current discharge joining machine, which can simultaneously apply impact load and electric current, has been designed and manufactured to produce a high-strength joint between materials with little change in their appearance. The objective functions of the designed and manufactured impact–electric discharge machine are almost satisfied. Partial joining is achieved between FCD450/FCD450 samples and between FCD450/Al samples and the joints exhibit low fracture stress. Process parameters can be controlled to improve joint strength, by adjusting the setting values of the functions provided in the machine.

The spectral method can lead to a high quality of multi-way partition due to its ability to capture global netlist information. For spectral partition, n netlist modules are mapped to n points in d-dimensional space, and then a linear ordering of these n modules is constructed to be used as a basis for partitioning. In this paper, we propose two clustering based linear ordering algorithms taking into consideration the objective function presented

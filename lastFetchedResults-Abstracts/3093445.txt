This paper focuses on the full RF-modelling of the tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS) operating in the ISM- band at frequencies of 315 MHz and 434 MHz. The main objective is the prediction of the static behaviour of such a system by evaluating the power transmitted from the wheel unit to the receiver placed in the car. The RF modelling procedure for the entire system considering the most significant components as the vehicle, tyres, rims, wheel unit and the receiver is shown and discussed. The modelling and the numerical computations have been made with the software package FEKO based on the method of moments.

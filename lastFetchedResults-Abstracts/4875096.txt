A new queueing priority channel assignment scheme for handoff in the CDMA cellular system is proposed and analyzed. The proposed scheme employs a dynamic priority queueing discipline instead of first-in first-out (FIFO), which differs from the previous ones. Also, the performance of this scheme is evaluated by computer simulation, and it is compared with that of the non-prioritized call handling and FIFO queueing disciplines. The major objective in this scheme is to minimize the time spent by the mobile station (MS) in a higher priority, corresponding to poorer signal reception, by favoring those MS that receives the lowest power level from their current base station (BS) in channel assignment, and as a result is to decrease the probability of forced termination. The priority is defined by the power level that the MS receives from the BS of the current cell

Abstract 
Introduction: Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug, causing reproductive failure in human males or animals. 
Objective: To evaluate the effect of acetylsalicylic acid on sperm chromatin dispersion test, testosterone and LH in adult mouse
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 49 adult male mice were equally divided into seven groups. Group 1 (control) received no drug. Group 2 (sham) received vehicle. Groups 3,4,5,6 and 7 received 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 mg ASA, on daily basis, respectively. All animals were treated orally for 14 days. On day 15, epididymis was removed and evaluations were made by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and SCD test for the study of serum testosterone or LH level and sperm DNA fragmentation, respectively. Data were analyzed using statistical tests of ANOVA, Tuckey or correlation test. Level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results: Serum LH levels were not changed in all groups; however; in groups 5,6 testosterone levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). ASA in groups 5,6 and 7 reduced large halosperms. DNA fragmentation was significantly increased just in 5mg/kg group. There was no statistical correlation between LH levels and SCD test findings. A negative correlation was found between small hallo fragmented sperms and testosterone (p < 0.02 r= -0.347).
Conclusion: The results showed that ASA has deleterious effects on sperm DNA, especially in dose of 5mg/kg. There is a significant correlation between testosterone and sperm DNA fragmentation in higher doses of ASA. These effects may be due to testosterone hormone alterations.

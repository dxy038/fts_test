A simplified antenna model technique is described in this work and applied to real engineering problems. The main objective is the prediction of the antenna performance, in terms of radiation patterns and coverage. The presented method shows a versatile and wide applicability, not only for simple and small antennas, but also for complex radiating systems. The method requires minimum information from the antenna and low computational cost.

Agile Supply Chain Management (ASCM) increasingly becomes an effective and important measure to enhance competitive advantage of modern enterprises. This paper contributes to the discussion on agility in SCM and provides a novel focus on the integration in ASC. The structure of Multi-agent systems inherently meets the requirements of autonomy and decentralization for supply chains. This research proposes a multi-agent-based model of ASCM that is capable of supporting the resource coordination between agents through a combinatorial action mechanism as well as selecting agile supplier. Finally, this model is validated by means of Fuzzy Multi objective linear programming. Using mathematical deduction enables an integrated ASCM model of selecting agile supplier being translated into a linear programming problem and consequently it has been solved by Lingo software.

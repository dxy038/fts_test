A closed loop fuzzy logic control (FLC) with a decentralized architecture has been applied to a passive air conditioning unit. The objective of the studied unit is to guarantee a microclimate with controlled temperature and relative humidity setpoints for crop growth chambers. As the process involves time-varying and distributed parameters, we propose the use of fuzzy logic to implement an expert rule based systems that care of different contexts of the air-conditioning temperature management. In the aim to get a local and global efficient performance, the proposed decentralized FLC architecture is applied on two principal subsystems which composed this global unit. A significant improvement in the system performance is observed on a wide range of operating point conditions.

The objective of this paper is to study the time evolution of multipactor discharges in a parallel-plate dielectric-loaded waveguide. The electron discharge phenomena investigated in this paper include the effects of space charge, as well as the presence of time varying static fields. In order to perform the simulations presented in this paper, an approach considering simultaneously multiple effective electrons has been used. The results obtained demonstrate that multipactor discharges do turn off by themselves under certain circumstances when they occur in such dielectric-loaded structures.

The objective of this article is show the control of electro-electronics devices using a PC software and a embedded system, sending and receiving remote data over one kilometer. The text shows the radiofrequency interface, the choice and programming of a microcontroller and the PC software that controls it. This work shows the control and communication between a microcomputer and a microcontroller over large distance is possible and can be made with few resources.

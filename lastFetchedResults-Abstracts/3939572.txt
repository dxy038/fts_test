The numerical modeling and experimental testing of a nerve cuff technique for selective stimulation of superficial peripheral nerve trunk regions are presented. Two basic electrode configurations (´snug´ cuff monopolar and tripolar longitudinally aligned dots) have been considered. In addition, the feasibility of steering excitation into superficial nerve trunk regions using subthreshold levels of current flow from an electrode dot located on the opposite side of the nerve has been tested. The modeling objectives were to solve for the electric field that would be generated within a representative nerve trunk by each electrode configuration and to use a simple nerve cable model to predict the effectiveness of each configuration in producing localized excitation. In three acute experiments on cat sciatic nerve the objective was to characterize the effectiveness of each electrode configuration in selectively activating only the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Modeling and experimentation both suggest that longitudinally aligned tripolar dot electrodes on the surface of a nerve trunk, and bounded by a layer of insulation (such as a nerve cuff), will restrict excitation to superficial nerve trunk regions more successfully than will monopolar dot electrodes. Excitation steering will improve the spatial selectivity of monopolar and tripolar electrode configurations.

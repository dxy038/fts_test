Background and objective: Adolescence is the most dangerous of lifetime regarding
the onset of substance abuse and education is one of the most important
methods to prevent this problem. The purpose of this study was to determine
the impact of an educational intervention in the prevention of substance
abuse among adolescents in Qazvin city using the theory of planned behavior
(TPB).
Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental study. With multi-stage sampling
method, 216 students participated in the experimental and control groups. Five
focus group discussions (including 8-15 members) were presented to the experimental
group mainly based on role-playing, brain storming and group discussions
methods. Self-reporting questionnaires were used for data collection
consisted of demographic questions, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral
control, intention and preventive behavior with 5-point Likert response
options. Reliability and validity of the questionnaires was confirmed by Cronbach’s
alpha and test-retest coefficient. The data collected before and 2 months
after training were analyzed with SPSS 20 and Chi-square, pair and independent
t-test, and Fisher’s exact test.
Results: The mean scores of attitude (from 26.3±17.4 to 45.7±21.6), subjective
norms (from 20.4±14.6 to 33.4±15.2), perceived behavioral control (from
36.6±20.9 to 58.4±27.3), intention (from 6.24±2.2 to 11.4±3.8) and addiction
related preventive behavior (from 24.11±9.5 to 40.6±13.7) were significantly
improved after educational intervention among the experimental group (p  < 
0.001).
Conclusion: TPB provides an appropriate framework for designing educational
interventions to prevent substance abuse among adolescents and its application
in health promotion programs in schools and prevention of substance
abuse is recommended.

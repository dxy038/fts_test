The paper addresses the problem of the practical stabilisation of manipulation robots which are in the contact with a dynamic environment. The model uncertainties represent the crucial problem in the control of robots within such tasks. Therefore, it is of practical interest to require a relaxed stability condition, the so-called practical stability of the system. A new method for analysis of a practical stability of robots is presented following the basic idea of a decomposition/aggregation method for the stability analysis of large-scale systems. The objective of the paper is to establish for the first time less conservative conditions for the practical stability of the robots around the programmed motion and interaction forces with the environment. The approach appears to be particularly suitable for the analysis of the so-called decentralised control laws. The elaborated procedure is demonstrated on an example

time. The main objective of present study is, the use of satellite imagery for soil erosion
mapping.In order to meet this general objectiv, satellite imagery of landsat TM- 29 April
1987 have used ofter image processing and select RGB731 erosion map of the study are a
was prepared.To test the validity of the erosion map made with this method, the real
erosion map of the study area was selected an compaired. The results shows in 63,61% of

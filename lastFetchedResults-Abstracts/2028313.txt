The diet of earthworms includes soil organic matter, soil microbes and other microfauna, but the relative contribution of these dietary components to earthworm nutrition is not well known. Analysis of fatty acid (FA) profiles can reveal trophic relationships in soil food webs, leading to a better understanding of the energy and nutrient flows from microbiota to earthworms. The objective of this study was to determine the origin of FAs assimilated by the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris L. We analysed the pattern of FAs in: (i) the bulk soil, (ii) soil in the earthworm gut, (iii) the absorptive tissue of the earthworm gut wall, and (iv) the muscular layers of the earthworm body wall. Multivariate analyses performed on the FA profiles suggest that the microbial community in the earthworm gut differs from that in bulk soil. Diverse bacterial and fungal derived FAs, which earthworms cannot synthesize, were found in the earthworm gut wall and body wall, and in the neutral lipids (storage lipids) of the gut wall. The major compounds isolated were 20:4 ω 6, 20:5 ω 3 and 18:2 ω 6, followed by the monoenoic 18:1 ω 7 and 18:1 ω 9c, and the saturated 18:0. The microbial FA assemblage in the gut wall resembled the gut soil more than the bulk soil, and the body wall of L. terrestris showed the same microbial derived FA pattern as the gut wall, although at reduced concentrations. We propose the existence of a specific microbial community in the earthworm gut that provides FAs to the earthworm. It appears that L. terrestris may derive more of its energy and nutrients from gut specific microbiota than from microbiota already present in the ingested soil, based on the trophic relationships revealed through FA analysis.

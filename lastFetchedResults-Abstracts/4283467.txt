The limitations of traditional system certification approaches become clear when they are applied to complex distributed computer architectures that are now the norm in combat systems control, and a broader perspective is required to validate that such systems meet their requirements. The main objective of this paper is to review new strategies for certifying such dynamic systems. The virtual homogeneity concept shows considerable promise in reducing the amount of testing required for system certification while increasing the confidence in the results. In this paper, we have presented supporting methods for statistical inference, process and processor centric timing, identification of system stress indicators in a dynamic environment, and the search for high confidences. A layered approach is indicated for the certification of systems with dynamic allocation of resources. We define the formal parametric framework for controlling system stability, and a model was developed for a paired component system.

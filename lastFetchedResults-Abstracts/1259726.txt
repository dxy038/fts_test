Metakaolin (MK) is a valuable admixture for concrete/cement applications that can enhance the performance of cementitious composites through high pozzolanic reactivity, much like silica fume (SF). While SF concrete is characterized by superior mechanical and durability performance, concrete containing MK achieves comparable properties at a lower price and with better workability. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of cement replacement by MK on the durability of self-consolidating concrete (SCC); the effect of SF at similar levels of MK replacement has also been included for comparison. The durability performance of SCC was evaluated based on the results of drying shrinkage, freezing and thawing, salt scaling, and rapid chloride permeability tests. The results of these tests indicate that highly durable SCC mixtures can be produced using a high MK content with an optimum percentage of around 20%. The results also show that the durability of SCC, especially with high MK content, is higher than that of SCC containing SF.

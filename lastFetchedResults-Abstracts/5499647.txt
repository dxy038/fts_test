The objective of this paper is to provide a comparison of JPEG and JPEG2000 image coders focusing on low bit rates. Coders are evaluated in rate-distortion sense. The influences of different image contents and compression ratios are assessed. Two picture quality measures are used: peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) as traditional objective picture quality measure, and picture quality scale (PQS) as perception based quantitative picture quality measure.

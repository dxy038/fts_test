Abstract
The present paper is an attempt to analyze the onomatopoeic words in Dashtestani dialect (spoken in Boushehr Province) and to give a rather comprehensive sketch of these elements modeling the available works in this area. The research is descriptive and data-based in nature: descriptive in that it aims at illustrating a broad picture of the onomatopoeic words in the dialect, and data-based in that it has taken advantage of objective pieces of data as spoken by the native speakers. The data have been collected through a fieldwork attempt, though one of the researchers has occasionally relied on his intuition so as to evaluate the felicity and appropriateness of the relevant data. The paper falls into two broad structural and semantic parts, and each part is divided into more detailed subcategories, the outcome of all of which yields a number of both structural and semantic generalizations and regularities about the onomatopoeic words.

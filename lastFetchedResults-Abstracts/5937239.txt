A centralized hybrid MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is proposed, where the design objective is to be able to provide reliable quality of services (QoS) control, high throughput, and scalability to networks by utilizing a priority-based hybrid time-coordinated contention and contention-free medium access control (MAC) protocol. The proposed protocolÂ´s resource reservation scheme can provide guarantee throughout access for selected users even under extremely emergent high demand situations, and applies a periodic shutdown scheme for low-power consumption.

The objective of this paper is two-fold. First of all, it aims to put forward an effective solution to the concrete problem of control of active filters for the harmonic depollution of electrical networks. Secondly, it seeks to demonstrate that the &#8220;control synthesis by H <sub>2</sub> optimization&#8221; presented in the ACSYDE CAD software is sufficiently flexible as a CAD tool to be able to deal with this specific problem, and of sufficiently high quality to keep designer effort down, both in terms of the synthesis and the development of the power network control system

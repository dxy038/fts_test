Individual traffic management systems are considered as a solution of the problems caused by increasing road traffic. For bidirectional communication between roadside beacons and individual vehicles, a transmission system with a radio link operating at 5.8 GHz is a suitable medium. To study the link performance in multipath fading channels, a deterministic channel model was derived. Calculations, considering the radiation characteristics of the antennas as well as the reflectors `motorhood´ and `road´, are already confirmed by measurements. Since the mobile channel is in general composed of further reflectors, e.g. cars or trucks, the deterministic model was extended by including additional statistical distributed reflectors. The simulation results presented give information on the average power delay profile. Furthermore, the effect of polarization of beacon and the vehicle antenna on communications is discussed

Objective. Ultrasound transmission velocity (UTV) and bone mineral density (BMD) were examined as possible predictors of the bending strength of osteoporotic long bones in ovariectomized rats treated with calcium-depleted diet.

Background. Changes in cancellous bone quality due to osteoporosis have been well documented, but only a few studies described non-invasive assessment of the biomechanical quality of long bones.

Methods. Forty-three rats were divided into three groups: ovariectomized and calcium-depleted diet, ovariectomized and standard diet, and untreated controls. All femora were scanned by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to measure BMD and cortical dimensions at the mid-diaphysis. Bending strength was determined from the maximum bending moment and the femoral cortical dimensions at the mid-diaphysis. The UTV of cortical bond at the mid-disphysis of the femur was measured in the proximal/distal direction.

Results. It was found that bending strength was significantly different among the groups (p < 0.0001). Despite the fact that bending strength of the osteoporotic rat femur significantly decreased, the osteoporotic effect did not produce a significant change in cortical thickness. UTV in the ovariectomized and calcium-depleted diet was lower than in the other groups; however, no significant differences were found betwene those on the standard diet and the untreated controls. The BMD in ovariectomized rats was also significantly lower than in the untreated controls (p < 0.05); however, the BMD in those fed with the calcium-depleted diet was not significantly different from those with the standard diet. Both cortical UTV and BMD as a single variable may not predict changes in bending strength of the cortical bone at the mid-diaphysis of the rat femur. However, the combined effect of UTV and BMD was significantly better than a single parameter in the assessment of strength.

To meet the demanding time-re-market requirements in VLSI/ULSI design, the acceleration of verification processes is inevitable. The parallelization of cycle-based simulation at register-transfer- and gate level is one facet in a series of efforts targeted at this objective. We introduce dlbSIM, a parallel compiled code functional logic simulator that has been developed to run on loosely-coupled systems. It has the ability to balance the application-specific load of cooperating simulator instances in dependence of the overall load situation on involved processor nodes. Thereby, the load of a simulator instance is expressed in terms of a set of circuit model parts which are to be simulated by the corresponding instance. The centralized load management runs simultaneously with a parallel simulation. Both processes interact after a controllable number of simulated clock-cycles to transmit load information and realize load modifications. dlbSIM is successfully used to simulate IBM S/390 processor models

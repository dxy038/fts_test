Introduction: Successful learning process is expressed as the main goal of any educational system, and a tool to achieve this goal is effective feedback to students. It has been shown in much research that feedback on learning and learners' motivation are effective in learning. The main objective of this research is to identify and categorize feedback characteristics in the literature. The study also intends to investigate the effects of these characteristics on effective feedback.
Materials and Methods: The statistical population of this research consisted of the students of Jahad Daneshgahi at Ahvaz University in 2013. The conceptual model of study was designed based on the literature and the relationship among its structures was determined. The validity and reliability (%91.3) of the questionnaire were confirmed on the basis of a preliminary study. The sampling was performed using stratified random sampling method. Out of 200 participants, 175 filled the questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the hypotheses of this research, and AMOS software to analze the data.
Results: The results showed that the type, structure and timing of the feedback with coefficients of 0.53, 0.64 and 0.85, respectively, had a significant impact on effective feedback at a %95 level of confidence. All hypotheses of the study were, therefore, confirmed.
Conclusion: Based on these studentsâ€™ viewpoints, the three characteristics of type, structure and timing had a significant impact on effectiveness of feedback, and among these three characteristics, timing had the maximum effect.

Conductive polymer composites (CPC) based on insulating matrix with conductive dispersed fillers are extensively studied since many years. A specific feature of such materials is a value of the filler content corresponding to the percolation threshold where a sharp transition insulating/conductive state occurs. The objective of this work is first the study of percolation phenomena in composites based on polypropylene (PP), on copolymers of polyamides (CPA) and polymer blends PP/CPA filled with dispersed iron (Fe) related to their structure but also to pay attention to their specific behaviour in temperature so-called PTC effect which can be controlled according the composition and the structure in the heterogeneous polymer matrix of the composites to elaborate intelligent/smart materials.

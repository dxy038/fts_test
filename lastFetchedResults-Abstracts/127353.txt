Introduction: Muscle cramps are sever, involuntary and painful muscle contractions which mostly occur in the muscles of legs. Muscle cramps in hemodialysis patients are very common and one of the most common causes of discontinuation of hemodialysis.
Objective: In an experimental study the effects of vitamin E in treatment of muscle cramps in hemodialysis patients were compared with placebo.
Methods: During a one-month pretreatment study, the number, severity and duration of cramps were recorded in the checklist, weekly. Patients with at least six cramps per month were included in the study and designated in the case or control group, randomly. Study continued for three months during which patients in the case group received 400 mg vitamin E every night and placebo in control group.
Results: There was no difference between the number of occurrence, severity and duration of muscle cramps in the case and control groups in the first month of study (during pretreatment time). The mean number of cramps in the first month was 23 and in the second month was 7.3 (p<0.001). Duration of cramps in the first and second months was 27.1 and 12.8 minutes respectively (p<0.001) and for the severity of cramps was 8.7 and 4.5 respectively (p<0.01). These variables did not change significantly during the third or forth month, compared to the second month of study.
Conclusion: It can be concluded, therefore, that vitamin E administration might be beneficial for prevention of muscle cramps of hemodialysis patients.

In order to assess the effects of sowing date and plant density on yield and active substance of fennel, a field experiment was arranged in spring of 2001. The main objective of this research was to find out the effect of sowing date and plant density on the seed yield, quantity and quality of active substance of fennel. This experiment was conducted in factorial experiment in the base of randomized complete blocks design with nine treatments and three replications at the Khojir Medicinal Plants Research Station (located at east of Tehran). In this experiment, the effects of three levels of sowing date (25 March, 4 and 14 April) and three levels of plant density (50x20 , 50x30 and 50x50 cm) were studied. The measured characteristics in this investigation were: seed yield per hectare, content of essential oil in seed, essential oil yield per hectare, anethole percentage in essential oil and anethole yield per hectare. The results showed that sowing date had only a significant effect on seed yield per hectare. Also plant density had significant effect on the essential oil yield, anethole yield and seed yield per hectare. According to the results of this investigation the best sowing time is 25 March and the most suitable plant density is 50x20 cm.

This paper presents a newly developed dielectric embedded electronically switchable multiple beam (DE-ESMB) antenna array for MIMO systems. Compared with conventional linear arrays, the DE-ESMB antenna has improved communication performances of compact physical sizes and built-in orientations for wireless routers in MIMO systems. Due to the complexity in physical structures and various conflicting performance specifications to be considered in a MIMO antenna synthesis, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm combined with a frequency domain FEM approach is proposed and employed. A comparison between the conventional linear array MIMO antenna and the proposed antenna has been made.

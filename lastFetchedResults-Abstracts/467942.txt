OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of anti-interleukin-1β and transforming growth factor-β2 on the production of interleukin-1β and prostaglandin E2 by human decidual cells.
STUDY DESIGN: Decidual membranes were obtained from 30 patients between 37 and 40 weeks’ gestation. Decidual cells were isolated and grown in culture. Incubations were conducted with lipopolysaccharide as a control, lipopolysaccharide plus anti-interleukin-1β, and lipopolysaccharide plus transforming growth factor-β2, respectively. Interleukin-1β and prostaglandin E2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunoassay.
RESULTS: At the end of a 24-hour culture with lipopolysaccharide plus anti-interleukin-1β, anti-interleukin-1β decreased the lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 production significantly at the concentrations of 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL (P< .05) and also decreased the lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-lβ production significantly at the concentrations of 10 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, and 100 ng/mL (P< .05). In the medium containing lipopolysaccharide plus transforming growth factor-β2, transforming growth factor-β2 also decreased the lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 production significantly at the concentrations of 1 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL (P< .05) but increased the lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1β production significantly at the concentration of 1 ng/mL (P< .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 production by human decidual cells in vitro may be prevented by anti-interleukin-1β and transforming growth factor-β2, and interleukin-1β production may be prevented by anti-interleukin-1β. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:146-9.)

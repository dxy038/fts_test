We are aiming at the realization of the measurement technology for the biological-substance distributions, such as sebum, on entire faces at the daily-life environment. We proposed the imaging-type 2-dimensional Fourier spectroscopy [1] that is the palmtop-size portable measurement apparatus and has the strong robustness for mechanical vibrations. And the proposed method can measure the wide-field 2-dimensional middle-infrared spectroscopic-imaging of radiation lights emitted from human bodies itself without light sources. In the proposed method, we install the phase-shifter, that can give an arbitrary phase difference for the half-flux of objective beams, at the optical Fourier transform plane of the infinity corrected optical system. The near-common-path interferometer that is a phase-shift interferometer between objective beams can be realized. In this proposed method, the emitted rays from each single-bright-point on measurement surfaces can interfere with each other. Thus, even if the middle infrared-lights from human bodies are the spatially incoherent light, we can acquire the interferograms at each pixel on an imaging array-device in accordance with the amount of phase shift as the 2-dimensional image-intensity changes. We demonstrated the feasibility of the middle infrared spectroscopic imaging of whole human faces without active illuminations.

Objective- Radiological and anatomical study of the Lacrimal apparatus system in one-humped camel of Iran (Camelus Dromedarius).
Design- Prospective study
Animals- Five heads (cut above the third cervical vertebra) of adult Dromedary camels' cadavers were collected from the slaughterhouse of the Najafabad area of Isfahan Province, Iran. Procedures- The anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct of one- humped camels studied grossly and radiographically in 5 camels. Dacryocystorhinography was performed on cadaver heads, using a radiographic contrast media. Anatomic casts of the nasolacrimal apparatus were obtained by cannulation of the duct and use of Rodopas cast material.
Results- The lacrimal puncta were not found within the mucocutaneous junction of the palpebral margin of medial canthus. The duct then traversed the nasal cavity in an S- shape fashion, covered only by nasal mucosa and a thin connective tissue membrane. The opening of the nasolacrimal duct was on the lateral wall of the dorsal angle of the nostril.
Conclusion and Clinical Relevancde- Dacryocystorhinography accurately revealed the nasolacrimal apparatus and compared favorably with gross dissection and Rodopas casts. Since the puncta lacrimalis have not been formed in camels, tears can not drain with it and naturally flow over the lower eyelid.

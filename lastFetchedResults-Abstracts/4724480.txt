Objective: This study describes the analysis of hand preshaping using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to predict hand formation during reaching and grasping tasks of the hemiparetic hand, following a series of upper extremity motor intervention treatments. The purpose of this study is to use classification of hand posture as an additional tool for evaluating the effectiveness of therapies for upper extremity rehabilitation such as virtual reality (VR) therapy and conventional physical therapy. Classification error for discriminating between two objects during hand preshaping is obtained for the hemiparetic and unimpaired hands pre and post training. Methods: Eight subjects post stroke participated in a two-week training session consisting of upper extremity motor training. Four subjects trained with interactive VR computer games and four subjects trained with clinical physical therapy procedures of similar intensity. SubjectsÂ´ finger joint angles were measured during a kinematic reach to grasp test using CyberGlove<sup>&#174;</sup> and arm joint angles were measured using the trackSTAR&#8482; system prior to training and after training. Results: The unimpaired hand of subjects preshape into the target object with greater accuracy than the hemiparetic hand as indicated by lower classification errors. Hemiparetic hand improved in preshaping accuracy and time to reach minimum error. Conclusion: Classification of hand preshaping may provide insight into improvements in motor performance elicited by robotically facilitated virtually simulated training sessions or conventional physical therapy.

Background and Objectives: Birth of healthy term infant depends on normal placenta development with its disturbance causing problems like Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). The aim of this research was to evaluate morphologic and histopathologic changes of placenta in normal and IUGR infants to improve the management of the future pregnancies.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 23 pregnant women with IUGR and 23 normal fetus referred to Imam Reza Hospital between 2007 and 2009. Mother, newborn and placenta data were recorded after delivery. Inclusion criteria were material age of 18-35 yr and gestational period of 32-42w with IUGR or normal embryo. The subjects were matched for age, height, weight, social status. Exclusion criteria were twin pregnancy, gestational age  < 32w, preeclampsia or chronic hypertension during pregnancy and diabetes. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 11.5.
Results: Infarction rate, thrombosis, tissue ischemia, increased thickness of membranes and intervillus fibrin were significantly higher in IUGR group. Mean placenta weight was lower in IUGR group (440 vs. 585g).
Conclusion: Placenta of IUGR newborns were smaller with more microscopic infarction. Fetal placental weight ratio in IUGR group was lower than controls. The gross and microscopic measurements of a placenta are more objective and seem to offer a good way to get proper information about IUGR.

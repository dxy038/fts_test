A novel 2D to 3D effect image conversion architecture integrated image segmentation system and depth estimation is presented. Its objective is to describe the technique used to generate stereo pair images starting from a single image source (a view-point) and its related depth map. The conjunction between segmented image and depth map allows reconstructing artificially the binocular view producing a 3D effect depending on screen dimension and image resolution. The system consists of an online ICA mixture model that performs image segmentation and depth estimation method to obtain the depth information of image. The proposed system is capable of performing automatic multilevel segmentation of images, based on depth information obtained by the image depth estimation method. The system does not reconstruct the real 3D coordinates of any object inside the scene, but simply assigns the most comfortable shift to the source points to give a 3D-entertainment to the viewer. A simple smoothing filtering technique adaptively resolves the occlusions generated by shifting of the source points without introducing visible and/or annoying artifacts.

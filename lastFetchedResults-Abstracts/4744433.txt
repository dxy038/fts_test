The following article presents a segmentation method of range images. This method is based on edge map detection by calculations of depth gradients and orientation gradients and a genetic algorithm. The objective is to delimit the planar patches contained in images to facilitate the labelling of each region. The genetic algorithm is guided by depth gradients and orientation gradients in order to find the edge map of the image

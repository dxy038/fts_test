Bidirectional systems are used to transform between known or desired input and output data in either direction. This paper compares two different methods for transforming from output to input data. It is outlined for transformation systems where the forward transform uses a kernel which has been adaptively/iteratively found but require an inversion scheme which maps exactly the forward transformation

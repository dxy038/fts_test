Long-term electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are important in the presurgical evaluation of refractory partial epilepsy for the delineation of the ictal onset zones. In this paper we introduce a new concept for an automatic, fast and objective localisation of the ictal onset zone in ictal EEG recordings and show with a simulation study that canonical decomposition of ictal scalp EEG allows a robust and accurate localisation of the ictal onset zone.

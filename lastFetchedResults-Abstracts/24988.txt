Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a serious infectious complication in immunocompromised patients. Recent reports indicate its favorable clinical outcomes by early diagnosis with chest computed tomography scan. We retrospectively analyzed our experiences with histopathological evaluation by open lung biopsy in 31 patients (32 cases) with hematologic malignancies, suspected of having invasive pulmonary aspergillosis clinically and radiologically. Although the initial computed tomography findings of all cases were highly indicative of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by demonstrating nodules or masses with a halo sign (16 cases), segmental area of consolidation with ground-glass attenuation (7 cases), both nodules or masses with a halo sign and segmental area of consolidation with ground-glass attenuation (7 cases) and poorly defined centrilobular nodules (2 cases), we could histopathologically confirm invasive fungal infections only in 17 cases (53.1%) by open lung biopsy. There were 13 cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, two cases of aspergilloma, and two cases of mucormycosis. No fungal hyphae were found in the other 15 cases: organizing pneumonia in seven cases, pulmonary hemorrhage in three cases, brochiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia in two cases, and CMV pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, candida pneumonia in one case each, respectively. We could perform open lung biopsy without mortality and significant morbidity. In view of the low positive predictive value of chest computed tomography scan and the very low morbidity of open lung biopsy, this procedure is recommendable for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and determination of its treatment.

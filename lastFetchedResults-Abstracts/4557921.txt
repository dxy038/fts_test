These issues can be classified in three categories; a) program comprehension and analysis issues; b) legacy system migration issues and; c) technology and standards issues. This paper discusses and debates approaches for addressing these issues. The paperÂ´s objective is twofold. First, is to explore the current state of the art in methods, tools and technologies that can assist in carrying out the required work and to identify a taxonomy of current approaches as well as, their strengths and weaknesses. The second objective is to identify open issues and research opportunities in the area of migrating legacy systems in Web enabled environments

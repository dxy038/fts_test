Objective
To determine hormone levels in a population-based sample of pubertal children and evaluate their association with anthropometric parameters.
Methods
Sex steroid levels were assessed using RIA and IRMA.
Results
In boys, changes in weight and height across the period were accompanied by changes in testosterone and SHBG. In girls, anthropometric variables did not change and were not correlated with estradiol.
Conclusions
We observed an association between hormone levels and anthropometric changes when active growth associated with puberty was taking place.

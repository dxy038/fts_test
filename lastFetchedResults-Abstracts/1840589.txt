Several structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities have been identified as primary and secondary chromosomal aberrations in Ewing sarcoma (ES). The majority of these are t(11;22) and trisomies, especially of chromosome 8. Specific chromosomal abnormalities often correlate with particular morphologic or phenotypic subtypes of tumor and play an important role in prognosis. The objective of this report is the cytogenetic evaluation of a case of ES using G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and spectral karyotyping techniques. Multiple chromosomal aberrations were identified including a novel reciprocal t(16;22)(q11.2;q12).

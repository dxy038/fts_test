This paper presents a novel control architecture system which is composed of a multi-objective cost function which Pareto optimizes the programming of cutting parameters while controlling the milling process to new cutting conditions if new constraints appear. The paper combines a self-optimized module which looks for and finds Pareto optimal cutting parameters according to multi-objective purposes and, a multi-model control module which keeps the cutting forces under prescribed upper safety limits independently of programmed cutting conditions and material properties while maintaining the performance of the process. An intelligent algorithm acts as decision support-software to automatically switch to the best performance tracking controller among those available at each required time.

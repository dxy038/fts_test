Background: in spite of prevention and control programs, dermatophyte infections have a high prevalence worldwide.
Objective: To do a descriptive study of dermatophytosis in Guilan.
Patients & Methods: 217 patients whom were visited in Razi Hospital in Rasht in 1381 were screened for dermatophytosis and if had suspicious lesions, direct smear with KOH and culture were done.
Results: 93 patients had positive smear (KOH 10%) and culture for dermatophytes. 50 patients were women and 43 patients were men. The most common patterns of dermatophytosis were tinea cruris (47.2%) , tinea pedis (14%), tinea capitis (12.9%), onychomycosis, tinea manum, and tinea facei.
Trichophyton mentagrophytes was the most common causative agent of tinea cruris that occurred more significantly in hot seasons. Conclusion: Tinea cruris was the most common type of dermatophytosis in this study. High prevalence of tinea cruris specially in women in comparison to the previous studies, may be due to occupational activity (agriculture) and clothing of women in north of Iran.

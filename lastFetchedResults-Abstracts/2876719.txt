A number of multichannel MAC protocols have been developed earlier with the objective of maximizing energy efficiency and guaranteeing QoS requirements in wireless sensor networks. However, the trade-off between energy efficiency and QoS requirements remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose a multichannel MAC protocol so that nodes dynamically switch their interface between the channels to achieve this goal. The proposed protocol works in two phases, the advertisement (ADV) phase and data phase, which run concurrently. During the ADV phase, the nodes having data try to contend the advertisement channel to transmit the ADV packet. The nodes after receiving the acknowledgement from the receiver switch to the available free channel for the transmission of data packet. We analyze the performance of our proposed protocol through simulation. The simulation results reveal the proposed protocol performs better than the existing MAC protocols in terms of data delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and energy efficiency.

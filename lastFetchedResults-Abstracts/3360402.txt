By establishing the mathematical model of the current stress of the isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter (IBDC), this paper comparatively analyzes the performances of IBDC under traditional single-phase-shift control and dual-phase-shift (DPS) control. On this basis, this paper proposes a current-stress-optimized switching strategy for IBDC with DPS control, and the corresponding control scheme is designed and implemented. The current-stress-optimized switching strategy can minimize the current stress, improve the system efficiency, and increase system power capability, and these performances are particularly effective for operation conditions with high voltage conversion ratio and light load. At last, experimental results verify the excellent performance of the current-stress-optimized switching strategy and correctness of the theoretical analysis.

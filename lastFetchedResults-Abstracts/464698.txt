OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to evaluate a surgical technique we have developed that, when used at vaginal hysterectomy, helps prevent posthysterectomy anterior vaginal segment (wall) prolapse. STUDY DESIGN: This modified surgical procedure was used in 966 consecutive vaginal hysterectomies performed from January 1989 through December 1994. Patients returned at 1, 3, and 12 months and annually thereafter for follow-up. The longest follow-up period to date is 5.5 years. RESULTS: Of the 925 patients in our study followed up for â‰¥1 year, 908 (98.1%) retained excellent anterior vaginal support. Symptomatic anterior vaginal segment prolapse occurred in 12 patients (1.3%), and asymptomatic prolapse, with the anterior vaginal wall descending less than halfway from the ischial spines to the hymen, occurred in 5 (0.5%). None of the 42 patients followed up for <1 year has had evidence of prolapse. CONCLUSION: This procedure is an acceptable method to help prevent posthysterectomy anterior vaginal segment prolapse.

Inroduction & Objective: Multiple  sclerosis is a progressive, autoimmune neurodegenerative disease in central nervous system (CNS). Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely accepted animal model for MS. New observations suggest that cobolamins (derivatives of vitamin B12) may modulate the responses of oxidative stress. Regarding the role of vitamin B12 in the formation of myelin sheet, modulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?) and its role in the regulating the immune reactions and anti-oxidant role; this compound is used in the present study as an agent on rat model EAE. 
Material and Methods: The guinea pig spinal cord homogenate (GPSCH) was used for induction EAE in Lewis rats.EAE was induced in 40 rats, randomly placed in four groups and treatment with vitamin B12. The treatment started from the first day post immunization by GPSCH-CFA and lasted until the tenth day.The  ELISA was used for the data assessment. Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical program (version 17 for Windows). In all the cases for comparison between different groups, Mann-Whitney U test was used. Significance level was set at p < 0.05 throughout the experiment.
Results: A meaningful decrease observed in seminiferous tubules diameter pipes in the 45 mg/kg concentration,germinal diameter layer in experimental groups and the number of spermatogony, primary spermatocyte, sperm and leydig in experimental groups in comparison to control group(0.05 > p). The percentage of the moving sperms, the percentage of the sperm's genetic substance and the sperms' morphology demonstrated a meaningful reduction in experimental groups and the hormones assesments.
Conclusion: In this study, we showed that the treatment of EAE with  vitamin B12 decreased the symptoms of disorder, pathological changes, level of serum TNF-?.

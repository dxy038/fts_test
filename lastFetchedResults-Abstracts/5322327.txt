The objective of this research is to identify, develop, adapt, prototype, integrate and demonstrate open access force protection and security technologies and processes. The goal is to provide more open public access to recreational and other non-restricted facilities on military bases and to improve the overall base safety and security utilizing advanced video and signal based surveillance. A testbed was created at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), Kauai, Hawaii to demonstrate novel and innovative security solutions that serve these objectives. The testbed consists of (1) novel sensors (video cameras, radio frequency identification tags, and seismic, lidar, microwave, and infrared sensors), (2) a computer, data storage, and network infrastructure, and (3) behavior analysis software. The behavior analysis software identifies patterns of behavior and discriminates "normal" and "anomalous" behavior in order to anticipate and predict threats so that they can be interdicted before they impact mission critical operations or cause harm to people and infrastructure.

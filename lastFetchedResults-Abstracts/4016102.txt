The problem of joint channel and power allocation in a downlink spectrum sharing cognitive radio network is investigated. The objective is to minimise the average outage probability of the secondary users (SUs). In this regard, a joint channel and power allocation scheme is proposed. The obtained numerical results show that the proposed joint channel and power scheme greatly improves the performance of the SUs.

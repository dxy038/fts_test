In this paper a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive system is investigated. In this setting the receivers in the primary user (PU) group null interference with the application of zero-forcing (ZF) filters and the transmit signals are adapted to meet individual rate constraints. The objective is to maximize the rate of the secondary user (SU), subject to a SU power constraint and individual PU rate constraints. Since the PU receiver cooperates with the SU by actively reserving part of its receive space for interference, the problem critically depends on the feasibility of the PU ZF operation and this in turn translates into a restriction on the number of SU transmit antennas. To investigate the behavior of the system in terms of SU rate and PU power sacrifice a SU transmit antenna selection method is proposed. It is demonstrated that PU cooperation enables SU communication in situations where transmit zero-forcing beamforming or opportunistic interference alignment (OIA) remains infeasible. In addition, simulation results highlight the advantage of PU cooperation over OIA in situations where the SU only just has enough transmit antennas to perform OIA.

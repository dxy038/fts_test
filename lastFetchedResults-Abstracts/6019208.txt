Glaucoma is a major global cause of blindness. An approach to automatically extract the main features in color fundus images is proposed in this paper. The optic cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) in retinal fundus images is one of the principle physiological characteristics in the diagnosis of glaucoma. The least square fitting algorithm aims to improve the accuracy of the boundary estimation. The technique used here is a core component of ARGALI (Automatic cup-to-disc Ratio measurement system for Glaucoma detection and AnaLysIs), a system for automated glaucoma risk assessment. The algorithmÂ´s effectiveness is demonstrated manually on segmented retina fundus images. By comparing the automatic cup height measurement to ground truth, we found that the method accurately detected neuro-retinal cup height. This work improves the efficiency of clinical interpretation of Glaucoma in fundus images of the eye. The tool utilized to accomplish the objective is MATLAB7.5.

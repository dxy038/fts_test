Objective
This study was undertaken to compare magnetic resonance (MR) and ultrasound (US) fetal weight estimates obtained immediately before delivery with birth weight.
Study design
Eighty women scheduled for a cesarean delivery underwent a fast acquisition MR and US for fetal weight estimation within 3 hours of delivery. Prospective MR calculation was based on the equation 0.12 + 1.031 g/mL×fetal volume (mL) = MR weight (g). US fetal weight estimation was calculated by the formula by Hadlock et al. Estimations were compared with birth weight.
Results
Correlation (95% CI) between birth weight and MR weight is 0.95 with a mean absolute error of 129 g (105–155) compared with the correlation between birth weight and US of 0.85 with a mean absolute error of 225 g (186–264). The correlation for birth weight and MR imaging is significantly greater than that of birth weight and US, P<.001.
Conclusion
Birth weight estimation is more accurate by MR imaging than by US in term infants.

Background: Pneumocystis  Pneumonia (PCP) caused by Pneumocystis Jjirovecii (formerly called P.Carinii)  is one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The aim of this study was to assess PCP in HIV-infected patients at the "National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease" (NRITLD).
Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 12 HIV-infected patients who were hospitalized at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital (NRITLD) and diagnosed as having PCP during 2003- 2007. In patients suspected of PCP with symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, fever, cough and related radiological findings, bronchoscopy including broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) were performed and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was obtained from all patients.
Results: Mean age of the understudy patients was 32.8±5.02 yrs. The most common symptom was exertional dyspnea (91.7% of cases). Mean duration from the onset of symptoms until diagnosis was 27.4±18.7 days. All patients were treated with Co-Trimoxazole and no adverse effects were detected. Mortality rate was 25%.
Conclusion: In Iran PCP is one of the common opportunistic infections in HIV-positive patients which is accompanied by a high mortality rate.

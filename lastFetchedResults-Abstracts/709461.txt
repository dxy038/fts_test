The objective of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for Children for its utility in clinical research and nursing practice. The scale was translated from the original English language into the Chinese language and the reliability and validity of the translated scale were tested. Results showed that there was high test re-test reliability, acceptable internal consistency reliability, appropriate content validity, concurrent validity and construct validity. It is concluded that the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for Children presented in this paper supports its feasibility as a research instrument to measure children's locus of control objectively and appropriately in the Chinese population.

Endowing a textile substrate (i.e. fibers, yarns, fabrics) with active functions is a new powerful concept, that has recently given rise to several interesting contributions. In this paper, we will describe a possible approach to this intriguing objective, focusing on the technology and on the electronic model. Future applications for this technology will allow to obtain, for instance, matrices of sensors assembled by textile technology and will ensure to obtain for wearable devices the necessary properties of drapability and conformity to the body that are required for these applications.

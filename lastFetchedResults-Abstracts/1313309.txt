Today, western countries' mass media broadcast subjective and unreal news
aimed at canalizing the minds of individuals across the world. For instance, for a
while they focused on Islamic awareness in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, as well as
Wall Street Movement in American and European countries and India, but now
they concentrate on unrests in Syria and lack of security in Syria and Iraq, and
in future they will deal with other issues in other countries (Ghasemi, 2012, p.3).
The main objective of this article is reviewing the role of opposition media in altering
public opinion and canalizing Tehrani citizens' thought toward having a weak
image about Police as well as recommending approaches for coping with them.
The research method in terms of objective is an applied one, while in terms of
implementation method is of documentary â€“survey type. The under survey population
includes two groups of media experts and police experts chosen based
on their availability.Finally,47 questionnaires were filled in by police experts and
50 others were filled in by media experts, then the results were analyzed by SPSS
and suitable statistical tests.
The findings of the research indicate that among opposition broadcasting
agencies BBC and VOA had the most contribution in the efforts made for making
individuals think that police in not efficient. It also came out that among various
constituents forming police's power and efficiency ( legal, training, equipment
and facilities, managerial and social constituents), social and managerial
constituents have had the most impact and humane and legal constituents have
had the least impact on police's power and efficiency.

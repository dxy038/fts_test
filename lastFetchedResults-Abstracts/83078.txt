A mathematical model is developed to arrive at an optimal conjunctive use policy for irrigation of multiple crops in a reservoir-canal-aquifer system. The integration of the reservoir operation for canal release, ground water pumping and crop water allocations during different periods of crop season (intraseasonal periods) is achieved through the objective of maximizing the sum of relative yields of crops over a year considering three sets of constraints: mass balance at the reservoir, soil moisture balance for individual crops, and governing equations for ground water flow. The conjunctive use model is formulated with these constraints linked together by appropriate additional constraints as a deterministic linear programming model. A two-dimensional isotropic, homogeneous unconfined aquifer is considered for modeling. The aquifer response is modeled through the use of a finite element ground water model. A conjunctive use policy is defined by specifying the ratio of the annual allocation of surface water to that of ground water pumping at the crop level for the entire irrigated area. A conjunctive use policy is termed stable when the policy results in a negligible change in the ground water storage over a normal year. The applicability of the model is demonstrated through a case study of an existing reservoir command area in Chitradurga district, Karnataka State, India.

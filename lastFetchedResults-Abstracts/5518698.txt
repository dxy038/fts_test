The authors present a description, results, and interpretation of comparison testing between the high accuracy inertial navigation system (HAINS) and the KT-70 inertial measurement unit (IMU). The objective of the tests was to demonstrate that the HAINS can replace the KT-70 IMU in the Space Shuttle Orbiter, both singularly and totally. The most significant improvement of performance came in the tuned inertial/extended launch hold tests. The HAINS exceeded the 4-hour specification requirement. The performance of the HAINS demonstrated the transparency of operation with respect to the KT-70 IMU. In addition, an internally compensated INS is compatible with the Orbiter avionics and flight software

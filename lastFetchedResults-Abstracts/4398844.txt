To improve the operation security and reliability of distribution network, correct, effective, reasonable risk analysis, assessment and warning will be used to provide reference. Firstly, considering the risk factor in distribution network, risk type in distribution network is concluded in this paper. Risk in distribution network is classified from different research content, different research purpose and different research time stage. Secondly, based on the risk mechanism, risk identification concept is proposed. Combine risk identification and risk assessment to build a multi-level, multi-objective risk warning system. Then, risk identification and risk assessment theory, implementation steps and indicators are analyzed in detail. Take overload risk identification as an example, multi-stage risk identification method proposed in the paper is verified by simulation. Finally, the difference between risk assessment and risk identification technology is summarized in the paper. Therefore, only combine risk identification technology and risk assessment technology, risk warning can be realized.

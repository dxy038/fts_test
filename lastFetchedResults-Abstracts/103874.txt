Control allocation problems can be formulated as optimization problems, where the objective is typically to minimize the use of control effort (or power) subject to actuator rate and position constraints, and other operational constraints. Here we consider the additional objective of singularity avoidance, which is essential to avoid loss of controllability in some applications, leading to a nonconvex nonlinear program. We suggest a sequential quadratic programming approach, solving at each sample a convex quadratic program approximating the nonlinear program. The method is illustrated by simulated maneuvers for a marine vessel equipped with azimuth thrusters. The example indicates reduced power consumption and increased maneuverability as a consequence of the singularity-avoidance.

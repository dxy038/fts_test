The objective of this paper is to provide a specialised online charging model in order to make use of Service Level Agreement (SLA) characteristics in a mobile telecommunication environment. The proposed model is based on the service enablers concepts in mobile internet environment (related to OMA and 3GPP standards), and termed as SLA-OC model. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) characteristics comprise of Operator´s characteristics such as security and channel QoS, and Service Provider´s characteristics such as service content. So the SLA-OC model will combine the Operator´s value and Service Provider´s value together, and will guarantee accurate payment for customers of different level SLA. The paper describes the SLA-OC model elements and policies, and show how these characteristics can be translated into quantitive elements. It also involves the prototype of SLA-OC model, based on the industrial tools of&#8221; ECharts for SIP Servlets&#8221; and&#8221; SailFin&#8221;. The model´s prototype is applicable in telecommunication industry.

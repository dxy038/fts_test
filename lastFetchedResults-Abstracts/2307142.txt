Human Resources Management (HRM) is one of the branches of management science which, in addition to creating relations with the staff, establishes relations among all policies, decisions and activities of the organization. The focal point of relations between employees and   employers is compensation of services, which plays the main role in organizations. The main objective of the present study is to identify the organizational factors affecting the compensation of services of specialist physicians working in state-run hospitals in Tehran. Compensating physicians’ services was evaluated based on motivational theories and living costs as well as other literature related to organizational components. The population of this descriptive survey is stat-run hospitals of the City of Tehran. To collect data, a questionnaire with the reliability value of 91.4%, measured by structural equations, was applied. The fitness index of the model indicates that the model for measuring organizational components of compensation was appropriate and the general framework for evaluating it is both significant and acceptable. Based on the results of the research, the identified organizational dimension has direct correlation with compensating physicians' services. Further, the role of components of "organizational" dimension, particularly organization's policies, is emphasized. According to the findings, it is suggested that  managers and policy makers should pay attention to the components related to the organizational dimension while making decisions about compensating physicians’ services.

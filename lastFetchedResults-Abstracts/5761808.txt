This paper presents comparison studies of conventional and evolutionary tuning methods for a PI and fuzzy PI controller. Genetic algorithms (GA) are employed as the evolutionary tuning method. These PI-controller tuning methods are based on novel closed loop performance statements and the closed loop stability. The control objective is flow regulation using a laboratory flow rig, which mimics a real industrial process.

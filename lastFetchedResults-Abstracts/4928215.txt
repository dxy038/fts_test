This paper addresses an information-theoretic aspect of k-means and spectral clustering. First, we revisit the k-means clustering and show that its objective function is approximately derived from the minimum entropy principle when the RenyiÂ´s quadratic entropy is used. Then we present a maximum within-clustering association that is derived using a quadratic distance measure in the framework of minimum entropy principle, which is very similar to a class of spectral clustering algorithms that is based on the eigen-decomposition method.


Survey of Electrocoagulation Process in the Removal of Pathogen Bacteria from Wastewater before Discharge in the Acceptor Water


Backgrounds and Objective: Due to population growth and expansion of agricultural industry in recent years, wastewater treatment is unavoidable. Therefore, using the Electrocoagulation process with aluminum electrodes to eliminate bacteria in hospital wastewater.

Materials and Methods: This study is a pilot-scale batch that to verify removal rate of bacteria in hospital wastewater by using direct current electric. In this study, the effects of variables such as time (30, 60, 90 min), voltage (10, 20, 30 v) and type of electrode (Al) on the efficiency of bacterial removal were studied.

Results: The results shows that with increasing contact time and voltage, removal efficiency increases. The results indicate that the retention time and voltage changes can have different effects on bacterial removal efficiency. The rising voltage and time are causing increase bacterial removal efficiency due to the rapid production of hydrolysis products.

Conclusion: The research results indicate that electric voltage treatment is effective for rapid removal of microorganisms in hospital wastewaters.

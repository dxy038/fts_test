The Pareto optimisation approach to multi-objective design of residual generators, which are utilised in fault detection and isolation (FDI) systems for plant monitoring and control, is under consideration. Genetic algorithms are applied to polioptimise this issue. The resulting robust FDI observer servers as a basis for fault detection, while minimising the effects of false alarms.

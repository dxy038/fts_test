Objective: To investigate the effect of IGF-IIP3 Deoxyribozymes (DRz) on the specificity of three kinds of carcinoma cell line. Methods: The inhibitive effects of DRz with various concentration on the growth of three cancer cells lines at different time were determined with MTT, the cell morphology under invert microscope and light microscope DAPI staining, changes in DNA quantity was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, the expression levels of IGF-IIP3 by Western blot. Results: DRzs inhibited the growth of HepG2 and MCF-7 cells lines in vitro. The apoptosis rates at early phase of HepG2 cells treated with DRz were significantly higher than MCF-7 cells and those untreated. The expression levels of IGF-IIP3 decreased significantly after DRz treatment. Conclusions: DRz induced the apoptosis in an expressional IGF-II P3 dependent manner, which had specificity to induce apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma cell.

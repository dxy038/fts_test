In motion control, the major sources of uncertainties are friction, stiffness, inertia and disturbances. These uncertainties should be taken into account by any high performance robust motion controller. Position and speed controllers for two-mass systems with different performances, ranges of applicability and of different complexity need to be used. The objective of the paper is to propose a motion controller for a high performance XY positioning table. The simulated overall system consists of two parts-a motion controller and an observer. A disturbance observer is added to improve the robustness of the overall system in addition to motion controller. The disturbance observer is added to a Kalman filter in order that the algorithm may have robustness against the measurement and system errors. Simulation results show that the proposed motion controller has superior robustness to the parameters variations as well as to the disturbance.

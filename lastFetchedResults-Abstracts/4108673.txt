This study proposes a multi-objective control algorithm for simultaneous process and quality control in non-Gaussian stochastic batch processes. The objective is to control a non-Gaussian process so that each batch is delivered within a pre-specified time. During each batch, the process is controlled by a fixed-parameter PI controller. Between any two adjacent batches the controller parameters are updated by a differential evolution algorithm so that the integral squared of tracking error, entropy of tracking error, integral of absolute processing time error and entropy of processing time error are minimised. the proposed algorithm is applied to a batch continuously stirred tank reactor where promising results have been obtained. The proposed method can be used as a basis for joint probabilistic process/quality control where more complicated quality measures are applied.

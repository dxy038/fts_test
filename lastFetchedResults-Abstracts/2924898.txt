This paper deals with the generation of minimum distance paths for a robot manipulator operating in an environment cluttered with obstacles. These paths are optimised using a genetic approach. The genetic algorithm objective function is formulated in an obstacle avoidance problem context. Evaluation of the genetic algorithm parameters and their behaviour is undertaken in order to determine the most suitable values for this application. Finally cases involving first a mobile robot and then a two-link revolute manipulator are developed

Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess variables that might predict which intern candidates will become excellent teachers of medical students.
Study design
This retrospective cohort study compared demographic characteristics, previous work experience, United States Medical Licensing Examinations scores, honors on core clerkships, membership in Alpha Omega Alpha, and match list ranking of 43 residents to identify predictors of excellent teaching evaluations during residency.
Results
Fifteen residents (35%) were identified as excellent teachers. They were more likely to have had previous work experience, to be older, or to be male. They were not more likely to have higher United States Medical Licensing Examinations test scores, more honors grades, Alpha Omega Alpha membership, or a higher rank list position.
Conclusion
Work experience, age, and male gender are associated with increased likelihood of being identified as an excellent teacher by medical students. Programs in which residents have a significant role as teachers of students may consider these factors in the residency selection process.

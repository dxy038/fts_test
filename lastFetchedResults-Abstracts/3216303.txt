Traditional sparse coding has been successfully applied in texture and image classification in the past years. Yet such kind of method neglects the influence of the signs of coding coefficients, which may cause information loss in the sequential max pooling. In this paper, we propose a novel coding strategy for ground-based cloud classification, which is named soft-signed sparse coding. In our method, a constraint on the signs is explicitly added to the objective function of traditional sparse coding model, which can effectively regulate the ratio between the number of positive and negative non-zero coefficients. As a result, the proposed method can not only obtain low reconstruction error but also consider the influence of the signs of coding coefficients. The strategy is verified on two challenging cloud datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with previous ones.

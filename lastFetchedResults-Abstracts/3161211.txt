Optimization of energy systems for hybrid electric vehicle design must consider three variables: specific power; specific energy; and life (lifetime charge integral specific energy). A simple matrix method of optimization for a specified objective is provided by Linear Programming using the Simplex Algorithm. Three variables are optimized by evaluating three sets of inequality constraints, each defining an energy source. The optimal hybrid design then comprises a Triple Hybrid. The triple hybrid model permits design optimization for local or personal conditions of commercially available and imminent hybrid vehicles including Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles.

The main function of a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) device is to be applied for dynamic compensation of the power system. Supplementary damping stabilizer can be added to the internal AC or DC voltage control channel of the STATCOM inputs to implement the task of power oscillation damping controller (POD). This study presents the simultaneously coordinated design of the multiple damping controllers between PSS and STATCOM-based POD or between different multiple STATCOM-based POD controllers without conventional PSS in a single-machine infinite-bus power system. The coordinated design is formulated as an optimization problem, which is solved by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to search for optimum stabilizerÂ´s parameter settings that optimize a given eigenvalue based objective function. The simulation results reveals that the coordinated designing of the multiple damping controllers provide satisfactory performance in terms of an increasing the damping rate and decrease the settling time in comparison to the individual damping controllers.

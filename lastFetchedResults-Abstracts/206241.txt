This paper is aimed to develope a mathematical model for sustainable forest development by strategic landuse planning. Such plans are naturally multi purpose so that multi-criteria optimization is utilized for modeling. The objective functions are: Maximization of carbon sequestration, net present value of income, stand volume, employment generation and minimization of soil erosion. Lp-norm is used to aggregate the objectives. The model is implemented for Caspian forest in Ramsar. Sensitivity analysis is made by different norms and weights.

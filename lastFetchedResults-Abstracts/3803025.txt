Unique educational and research facilities for teaching and performing research on harmonic-related problems in power systems are discussed. The facilities consist mainly of computer-based three-phase harmonic generators, a data acquisition system to process the data digitally, and a computer control system to control the harmonics levels. Application of the system in teaching, studying and investigating appropriate solutions to harmonic-related problems is the primary objective. The assistance of power industry representatives in formulating the different problems is discussed. A brief summary of six teaching projects and concepts of the computer-based system are included

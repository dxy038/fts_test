Modern production systems and production plants require new and advanced automation features that are characterized by more flexibility and mobility of automation devices as well as multi-media transmission besides real-time data transmission. The EU founded research project &#8220;R-Fieldbus: High performance wireless fieldbus in industrial related multi-media environment&#8221; has the objective to develop a radio based physical layer based on the existing and available radio technologies in the LAN and WAN world. Basis for this development are furthermore the requirements of the production systems, from the user as well as the industrial environment. In this paper we introduce the objectives of the R-Fieldbus project, the requirements as basis for the development as well as the first investigations of the radio channel characteristics in industrial environmental conditions

The aim of this study is cylindrical shell behavior under seismic loading. To this objective, static and dynamic tests and a vibration analysis were performed. At the same time, Finite Element simulations enabled us to understand the effect of frequency excitation. When the frequency excitation is close to first eigen frequency, a coupling between buckling and vibration modes occurs if the load level is equal to 70% of the critical static load. This induced instability leads to large deformations and a great decrease in shell stiffness.

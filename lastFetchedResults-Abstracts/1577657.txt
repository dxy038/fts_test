Biomass measurements of totora and bofedal Andean wetland grasses in the Bolivian Northern Altiplano were correlated over a growing season to vegetation indices derived from 1-km visible and near-infrared bands of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) instrument flown on the NOAA-14 polar-orbiting meteorological satellite. This article discusses the potential and limits of these indices for the assessment of the spatial and temporal variation of biomass and of the fraction of the photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by these herbaceous native forages growing in water-saturated environments. Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization was also investigated based on simple kernel-driven models. BRDF normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) performed the best for both totorales and bofedales vegetation associations, followed by the uncorrected maximum-value composite NDVI. BRDF normalized NDVI was shown to be sensitive to the green leaf or photosynthetically active biomass.

tion of biomass production after Kumar and Monteith (1982) was used to determine the efficiency of solar energy conversion into biomass (Îµb) for the main phenological periods, corresponding to the rainy and dry seasons. Two approaches were investigated for the biomass production estimation: the first one is based on monthly field biomass measurements; the second one is based on estimates from the regression computed previously using Roujean's BRDF normalized NDVI. The values found for these efficiencies for the rainy season agree with those of the literature for grasslands of temperate regions. For the dry season, more accurate information on totora and bofedal senescence and on animal consumption is required to get a reasonable efficiency value. This is not surprising, as other workers have reported biomass estimation with remotely sensed data to be most relevant to the growing season.

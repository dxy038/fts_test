We report three pigeons euthanized in a small household breeding facility, where there was suspicion of an avian tuberculosis outbreak. For rapid identification of Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium direct conventional multiplex PCR was used. Nodular lesions were found on the livers of all three birds, the intestine of one bird and the kidney and ovaries of another. The liver samples and a further 18 tissue samples were examined. Acid-fast rods were detected in all the tissue samples after Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Isolation and diagnosis of M. a. avium (serotype 1 containing IS907) from 17 tissue samples was confirmed using conventional multiplex PCR.

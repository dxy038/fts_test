Discusses a software application, called the GANN (Genetic Algorithm for Artificial Neural Networks) simulator, which is required to conduct experiments using genetic neural network (GNN) techniques. In particular, progression from the initial investigations into artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) to the specific topic of GNNs is provided. The purpose of this application is to provide the means necessary to meet the objective of performing an empirical investigation in the area of GNNs. GANN was analysed, designed and implemented using object-oriented techniques. While the acronym GANN is not unique to this particular application and is also used by P. Andersen et al., this implementation differs considerably

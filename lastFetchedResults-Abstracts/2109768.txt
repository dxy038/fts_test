Background: Progesterone has been suggested to contribute to the regulation of spermatogenesis and to facilitate the production of viable sperm. Investigations have showed that polymorphism of progesterone receptor (PGR) is associated with some diseases.
Objective: To analyze the potential relationship between male infertility and the +331G/A and progins polymorphisms of PGR gene.
Materials and Methods: The cross-sectional study was carried out at the Department of Male Reproduction, Reproductive Medical Center, the Second Hospital of Jilin University. The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique was used to detect gene point mutations. Of the 145 semen samples analyzed, 35 were asthenozoospermic, 50 were oligoasthenozoospermic, 21 were azoospermic, 11 were teratozoospermic and 28 were from fertile male subjects.
Results: Statistical analyses revealed that the genotypes of the +331G/A polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the fertile (?2=0, p=0.534) and oligospermic groups (?2=0.021, p=0.537). Similarly, the genotypes of the progins polymorphisms were also in Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium in both the fertile (?2=0, p=1) and oligospermic groups (?2=0.005, p=1).
Conclusion: Our results indicated that polymorphisms of the +331G/A and progins of the PGR gene are unrelated to male infertility, at least in a Chinese population.

This paper includes method of parameter estimation on a synchronous generator exciter using the particle swarm optimization. A solid round rotor synchronous generator and exciter have been modeled as the linear state variable with additional saturation function. The results of the simulation which the parameters of the exciter could be obtained by an objective function with integral squared error are described.

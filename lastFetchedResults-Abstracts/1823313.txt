The first objective of this paper is to deposit new hard coatings based on compositionally modulated CN/TiCN/TiN multilayer films by dual ion beam sputtering using a combination of TiN, TiC and C targets and an Arâ€“N2 mixture discharge gas. The second objective is to evaluate the physical and chemical characteristics of the multilayer with respect to their practical applications. In this work, we have studied the composition, morphology, hardness and friction coefficient of the films. The deposition parameters were controlled to obtain films that combine ultrahard behaviour with good tribological and wear properties.

The overall objective of this work is to develop a system composed of master, slave and a control system for special medical applications. A PROMIS (Pprime RObot for Minimally Invasive Surgery) system is designed to be cost-effective with a less complication of use and an application-specific for collaborative operations between the surgeon and the robot. This paper focuses on the introduction of a motion safety control methodology for a haptic device. The haptic device is used as a master with a parallel spherical architecture (SPM). The introduced control methodology is based on the workspace of the medical application. Three areas of the workspace are defined with a consideration of the degree of security. An algorithm that constantly keeps the mobile platform in a safe region, when the surgeon moves it, is presented and explained. The developed algorithm runs in real-time using a programmable logic controller (PLC). The control strategy of the haptic device was successfully tested and validated experimentally.

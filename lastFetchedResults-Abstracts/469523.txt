Objective
Renal and cardiovascular function is improved during the first 24 hours of life in preterm ventilated baboons exposed to prenatal betamethasone (BETA). We hypothesized BETA-induced effects would be sustained through day 6 of life.
Study design
Pregnant baboons received saline or BETA (6 mg) 48 and 24 hours before preterm delivery at 125 days' gestation. The newborn baboons were ventilated for 6 days, and assessed for renal, cardiovascular, and endocrine function.
Results
Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values 24 hours after delivery were higher in the BETA group. Kidney Na, K-ATPase activity was higher in the BETA group by day 6. All other measures were similar in both groups by day 6.
Conclusion
Prenatal BETA exposure in the premature baboon: (1) increases MAP and GFR on day 1 without measurable effects by day 6 and (2) increases kidney Na, K-ATPase activity.

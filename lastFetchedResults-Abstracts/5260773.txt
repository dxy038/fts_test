Laser irradiation in the human body using an optical fiber is an effective method of minimally invasive laser treatment. For realizing precise laser treatment in the human body, a two-dimensional (2D) laser scanning micro tool has been developed. A laser is transmitted through an optical fiber and a micro rod lens. The laser is reflected and scanned by a 2D microscanner and focused on an objective area. The fabricated 2D microscanner has three piezoelectric unimorph cantilevers that have a ball joint at each tip and a mirror. The mirror is supported by a pivot from underside and is inclined by pushing down by three cantilevers on the top of the mirror. The maximum inclined angle of the mirror is 30 degrees. Using potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser, a function of the laser scanning is confirmed. For insertion the 2D laser scanning micro tool into a working channel of a conventional endoscope, these components are assembled and packaged into a tube. In the future, this tool can be used not only for laser treatment but also for in vivo microscopic inspection. By combining the 2D microscanner and the microscopic inspection techniques, for example micro confocal laser scanning microscope or Endoscopic Optical Coherence Tomography (EOCT), the tool might be more effective for precise laser treatment.

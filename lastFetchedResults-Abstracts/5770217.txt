The design, engineering and management of urban traffic systems have become increasingly difficult and costly because existing configurations are multiple and complex. Our goal in this article is to present a state of the art modeling techniques, namely the macroscopic model, mesoscopic and microscopic. And we see that in order to solve problems related to space and time encountered in the above models, a new scale model called hybrid appeared. The latter aims to take advantage of conventional models, by adopting the scale model of the phenomenon. The main objective of the system is to improve urban traffic flow and optimize the flow through operating rules and management. However, the problems related to the design of control systems is the control of the spatial and temporal consistency of decisions, given the characteristics of controlled systems and their environment. The second part of this article will be devoted to the study of some tools to help the existing decision. On the other hand, the approach based on agents used to design models of non-centralized control and self-organized and to improve system responsiveness decision. Un agent is a hardware or software that supports context autonomous decision-making The last part of this article discusses these concepts and the concepts of multi-agent approach.

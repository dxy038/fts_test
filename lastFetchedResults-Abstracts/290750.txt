Among the most popular techniques of assisted reproduction for the treatment of male subfertility and infertility are intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The objective of these techniques is to bring more functional spermatozoa closer to the oocyte in order to promote fertilization. These techniques are thus not a cure per se and are only indicated when no specific or effective treatment is available for the male partner, when this treatment has failed or when the improvement of the female fertility status has also failed. While for moderate oligoasthenozoospermia, intrauterine insemination has proved to be a valid treatment, the outcome after conventional in vitro fertilization is limited because of a high incidence of complete fertilization failure. Since the introduction of intracytoplasmic sperm injection, a reliable method has become available in order to achieve fertilization in vitro. Apart from well from ejaculated spermatozoa, epididymal or testicular spermatozoa too can be used successfully for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The surgical retrieval of spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection has therefore become a routine technique in clinical andrology. Although these techniques have been implemented in everyday infertility practice within a few years of their introduction, many concerns about safety continue to exist. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection must be applied with caution, only when no other treatment option is available and when an appropriate prospective follow-up of the offspring is available.

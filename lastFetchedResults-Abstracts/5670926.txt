We investigate joint scheduling and routing construction in IEEE 802.16 wireless mesh networks. We formulate the problem as a linear programming optimization in which the objective is to maximize network throughput. In the proposed optimization problem we take into account reuse of frequency space and thus non-interfering nodes can be scheduled simultaneously. Furthermore, both Centralized traffic (i.e., the traffic from nodes to the BS and inverse) and mesh traffic (i.e., the traffic between nodes) are allowed. After solving the optimization problem which gives the optimum flow assignment, we propose a heuristic algorithm in order to obtain an approximation of the optimum routing tree. Our numerical study shows that the proposed routing trees lead to a better performance regarding to networks throughput in comparison to previous approaches next, we create a routing tree based on link flow. Thus, we get an approximation of the network optimal routing tree, which in turn lead to increased throughput and reduce overall delay in the network. Obtained results reveal that the proposed approach increases the network performance significantly for internal traffic compared to the previous works.

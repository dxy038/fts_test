OBJECTIVE: Measles is one of the acute and contagious diseases of human, and according to the estimation of the world health organization (WHO), it may be eradicated by the year 2010. Therefore, diagnosis of measles is emphasized by using quick and sensitive methods for control and prevention of measles.
METHODS: Various methods are used to diagnose antibody against measles virus, include hemagglutination inhibition(HI), enzyme immunoassay(EIA) , plaque reduction (PR) and neutralization test (NT). One of these methods is dot-immunoassay (DIA). In this method, nitrocellulose paper is used as solid phase instead of microplate.
FINDINGS: In this study, DIA in comparison to HI had 98.8% sensitivity and 85% specificity, and in comparison to EIA had 96.5%, 90% sensitivity and specificity respectively.
CONCLUSION: This technique has advantages such as sensitivity, high specificity , low cost and speed.

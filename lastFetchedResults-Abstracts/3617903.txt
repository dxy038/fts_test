This paper presents a new framework for the completion of missing information based on local structures. It poses the task of completion as a global optimization problem with a well-defined objective function and derives a new algorithm to optimize it. Missing values are constrained to form coherent structures with respect to reference examples. We apply this method to space-time completion of large space-time "holes" in video sequences of complex dynamic scenes. The missing portions are filled in by sampling spatio-temporal patches from the available parts of the video, while enforcing global spatio-temporal consistency between all patches in and around the hole. The consistent completion of static scene parts simultaneously with dynamic behaviors leads to realistic looking video sequences and images. Space-time video completion is useful for a variety of tasks, including, but not limited to: 1) sophisticated video removal (of undesired static or dynamic objects) by completing the appropriate static or dynamic background information. 2) Correction of missing/corrupted video frames in old movies. 3) Modifying a visual story by replacing unwanted elements. 4) Creation of video textures by extending smaller ones. 5) Creation of complete field-of-view stabilized video. 6) As images are one-frame videos, we apply the method to this special case as well

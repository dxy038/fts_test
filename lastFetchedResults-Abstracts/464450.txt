OBJECTIVE: Ovarian remnant syndrome has become increasingly recognized as a cause of pelvic pain after extirpative surgery. The purpose of this review was to compare our patient population with those reported in the literature, as well as to address the usefulness of careful retroperitoneal discussion in the surgical management of these patients. STUDY DESIGN: This article discusses the presentation and surgical management of eight cases of ovarian remnant. RESULTS: Data were obtained through a retrospective chart review of pathologically confirmed cases of ovarian remnant. Discussion focuses on the surgical management of these cases. CONCLUSION: In summary, extensive and careful retroperitoneal dissection is typically required to facilitate identification and removal of the ovarian remnant tissue.

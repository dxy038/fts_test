Heidegger attributes human being with Dasein, Dasein is the term that refers to the human being existence with
special structures. According to him, Dasein is the only being understanding his existence and the reality of being, as
only he can establish special relation with himself and creates new relations with the world and develop them. This
ability means dynamic attitude to self and the world and the extreme possibilities, the existence border and the
distinctive attribute from other creatures. Molasadra also considered the human being existence and this existence
manager distinguished him from other creatures. According to Sadra, human being based on substantial motion is
changing and evolving and is transferred from one world to another and from one level to another one and the
spiritual trend is continued and that person finally is turned into an intellect person to objective person. Questioning
existence and transition of existence to being are of great importance in both philosophical systems. Heidegger by
phenomenology method as it was special form him and Molasadra by metaphysics interpreted and perceived
existence. The present study attempted to investigate the view of both philosophers.

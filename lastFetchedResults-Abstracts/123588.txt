Objective: This study aimed to assess the reliability of the Persian version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for a lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder according to DSM-IV and ICD-10. Method: This project was conducted at three stages of translation of the instrument, reliability assessment and validation, and feasibility and diagnostic reliability assessments for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia using a test-retest methodology. Trained interviewers administered the instrument twice (at 3-7 days' interval) to 100 clients at four university centers (complete CIDI on 65 persons and psychosis/mania module on 35 persons). Results: Test-retest reliability of CIDI for bipolar disorder was moderate in DSMIV diagnostic system and poor in ICD-10. Test-retest reliability of CIDI for schizophrenia was poor in both diagnostic systems. Conclusion: The results showed that the diagnostic reliability was good only for bipolar disorder in DSM-IV, otherwise it was not acceptable. However, since the samples were selected from the clinical population, the results cannot be generalized to the normal population. According to the results, adaptation of the key questions to the Persian culture must be considered.

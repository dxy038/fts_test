There are many published international recommendations and guidelines for the management of Invasive Fungal
Infections (IFIs). It is very important to develop Iranian recommendations to implement those guidelines in a daily
routine practice in Iran considering the local specifications.
This was the objective of this meeting, which was held on November 3rd, 2011 in Tehran. 17 Iranian scientific leaders
met and reviewed all the available published International Guidelines for management of IFIs in different groups of
patients. This was followed by an open discussion to develop local recommendations for appropriate implementation of
International Guidelines using the available treatments in Iran.
This review shows the outcome of this meeting. We believe that, putting these recommendations into practice may lead
to better results of the management of cases with IFIs

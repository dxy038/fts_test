The objective of this paper is to perform an energetic and exergetic analysis on a 660 MWe coal fired supercritical thermal power plant at 100%, 80% and 60% of normal continuous rating (NCR) conditions under constant pressure as well as pure sliding pressure operation and to highlight the benefits of the latter over the former. The energetic input, energetic output, exergetic input, exergetic output, energetic and exergetic efficiencies of various components of the supercritical thermal power plant are estimated at 660 MWe, 528 MWe and 396 MWe load under both constant pressure as well as pure sliding pressure operation. Also the energy losses and exergy destruction in various components of a power plant i.e. Boiler, high pressure turbine (HPT), intermediate pressure turbine (IPT), low pressure turbine (LPT), condenser, gland steam coolers, condensate extraction pumps, low pressure heaters (LPH), drip pumps (DP), deaerator (D), boiler feed pump (BFP) and high pressure heaters (HPH) have been calculated. The results have shown that the boiler has the maximum rate of exergy destruction than any other component in the power plant. After the boiler, turbine has the maximum rate of exergy destruction than any other component of the power plant. The study reveals that there is a significant reduction in the rate of exergy destruction at part load conditions for the turbine in case of sliding pressure operation in comparison to constant pressure operation. The rate of exergy destruction in the turbine at 100%, 80% and 60% of NCR conditions is 49.16 MW/43.22 MW/43.92 MW for constant pressure operation and 47.66 MW/37.88 MW/28.94 MW respectively. The BFP power input reduces by 9.39%, 21.52% and 42.5% respectively at 100%, 80% and 60% of NCR conditions if the unit runs in sliding pressure mode compared to constant pressure mode.

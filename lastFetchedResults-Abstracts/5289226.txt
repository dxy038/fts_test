The EU-funded project EMMA, coordinated by ETRA I+D, aimed at delivering a comprehensive software layer that enables the seamless cooperation of embedded devices objects in the transport domain across various smart spaces. The objective was to open new prospects in the field of embedded systems for cooperating wireless sensors in order to hide the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. EMMA fosters cost- efficient ambient intelligence systems with optimal performance, high confidence, reduced time to market and faster deployment.

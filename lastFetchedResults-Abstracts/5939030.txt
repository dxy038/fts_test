The objective of this research is to perform a long distance navigation in indoor environment, with a unicycle robot that has a wide-type wheel, and has a laser range finder installed on top of the robot. At present, there is no report for long distance navigation by unicycle robot in real indoor environment. We have developed a system that consists of two subsystems; &#8220;Balancing and Maneuvering System&#8221; for moving robot to desired direction while the posture of the robot is stabilized, and &#8220;Navigation System&#8221; for calculation of desired direction and recognition of intersections, using external sensor whose scan plain changes when robot steers. We have implemented the system to a single SH-4 CPU microcomputer, and performed a long distance navigation in actual indoor environment. The paper reports the unicycle robot and the system we have developed, and the experiment result of long distance navigation in indoor environment.

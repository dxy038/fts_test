The traditional approach for sliding mode control design has been the design of a controller to achieve a predesigned sliding objective. However, not much research has been carried out on the design of the sliding surface. This note presents a technique for designing a sliding surface such that when confined to the surface, the closed-loop system has optimality in the linear quadratic sense. The paper also proposes a multirate-output-feedback-based controller that leads the system to the aforementioned optimal sliding mode.

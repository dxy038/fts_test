The economic-emission load dispatch problem which accounts for minimization of both cost and emission is a multiple, conflicting-objective function problem. Goal programming techniques are most suitable for such type of problems. Here, the economic-emission load dispatch problem is solved through linear and nonlinear goal programming algorithms. The application and validity of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated for a sample system having six generators

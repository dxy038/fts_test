This work is directed at reducing patient induced blurring in SPECT imaging due to breathing motion. As image resolution improves this breathing motion is becoming increasingly significant. Method: The NCAT phantom and an associated medical image processing package (RMDP) are used to obtain a breathing cycle of images (both CT and corresponding SPECT) and a full organ segmentation. A process termed ´virtual dissection´ is undertaken which sees individual organs extracted from the main images and independently registered (ICP). These individual registrations are reconciled, combined and used to obtain improved final images. Results: The results of the objective validation techniques are presented together with a comparison of processed and unprocessed images. Conclusion: Within the scope of the synthetic data used and for organs for which the assumption of near-rigid motion holds well the technique works. In the case of the ribs and lungs further development is needed.

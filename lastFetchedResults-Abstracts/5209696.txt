Homeland Security Technology (HST) encompasses many, often disparate fields ranging in complexity, focus, and maturity. From a managerial perspective it is challenging to determine what fields are relevant to solving a HST problem, and to target investment in research which will meet emerging solution requirements. The challenge from the standpoint of a scientific researcher, already familiar with state-of-the-art in his field, is to determine what new approaches, other disciplines, and research partnerships might contribute to scientific innovation. Investigation of the scientific literature is the first step in identifying approaches relevant to a technology solution for each of these potential project team members. Ultimately, text analytics can be used both as a business intelligence tool by project managers and as a knowledge discovery tool by scientific researchers. Its objective is to provide a more dynamic representation of the state-of-the-art and determine the state-of-the-possible.

Aimed at the features of the indoor environment influence factors diversification, dynamic, the comfortable concept fuzzification and the currently ontology construction methods have the problem of shortage in real-time construction, this paper puts forward a fuzzy ontology automatic construction method that faces the field of the indoor environment. Firstly, using formal concept method to analyze the objective physical space and form the abstract description model, secondly, make the physical space map to the information space depend on the model constructed in the first step, thirdly, structure a fuzzy ontology automation generation framework for this space with the help of the thought of fuzzy ontology, lastly, prove the method is feasible and effective through an example with the Jena as a tool.

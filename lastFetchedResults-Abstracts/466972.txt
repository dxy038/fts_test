Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the survival rates and toxicity levels that are associated with multimodal therapy (including neoadjuvant methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin [MVAC]) in patients with stage IIB to IVB cervical cancer. Study Design: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 49 patients who were treated between 1989 and 1997 with neoadjuvant MVAC for advanced cervical cancer. Results: The clinical response rate was 90% (27 partial responders, 17 complete responders). Grade 3 or greater toxicity was mostly limited to neutropenia; no deaths were attributed to MVAC. Combined therapy after MVAC included operation in 34 patients (69%) and radiation in 41 patients (84%). Twenty-one patients (43%) had <2 cm residual tumor at histologic evaluation. Pelvic control was achieved in 86% of patients. Five-year disease-specific survival for patients with stage III disease was 60%. Conclusion: For patients with advanced cervical cancer, neoadjuvant MVAC had a high response rate (90%) and an acceptable toxicity level. Compared with historic control subjects, multimodal treatment may be associated with improved rates of pelvic control. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:1167-73.)

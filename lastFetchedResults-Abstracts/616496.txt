A novel method to remediate dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zones that incorporates in situ density conversion of DNAPL via alcohol partitioning followed by displacement with a low interfacial tension (IFT) surfactant flood has been developed. Previous studies demonstrated the ability of the density-modified displacement (DMD) method to recover chlorobenzene (CB) and trichloroethene (TCE) from heterogeneous porous media without downward migration of the dissolved plume or free product. However, the extent of alcohol (n-butanol) partitioning required for in situ density conversion of high-density NAPLs, such as tetrachloroethene (PCE), could limit the utility of the DMD method. Hence, the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two n-butanol delivery approaches: an aqueous solution of 6% (wt) n-butanol and a surfactant-stabilized macroemulsion containing 15% (vol) n-butanol in water, to achieve density reduction of PCE-NAPL in two-dimensional (2-D) aquifer cells. Results of liquidâ€“liquid equilibrium studies indicated that density conversion of PCE relative to water occurred at an n-butanol mole fraction of 0.56, equivalent to approximately 5 ml n-butanol per 1 ml of PCE when in equilibrium with an aqueous solution. In 2-D aquifer cell studies, density conversion of PCE was realized using both n-butanol preflood solutions, with effluent NAPL samples exhibiting density reductions ranging from 0.51 to 0.70 g/ml. Although the overall PCE mass recoveries were similar (91% and 93%) regardless of the n-butanol delivery method, the surfactant-stabilized macroemulsion preflood removed approximately 50% of the PCE mass. In addition, only 1.2 pore volumes of the macroemulsion solution were required to achieve in situ density conversion of PCE, compared to 6.4 pore volumes of the 6% (wt) n-butanol solution. These findings demonstrate that use of the DMD method with a surfactant-stabilized macroemulsion containing n-butanol holds promise as an effective source zone remediation technology, allowing for efficient recovery of PCE-DNAPL while mitigating downward migration of the dissolved plume and free product.

The objective of this paper is to present a formulation for the Inverse Scattering Problem [1] based on the expansion of the equivalent currents by using the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions [2]. The purpose is to reconstruct the sources from measured near-field data. The goal is to improve the resolution for the equivalent sources characterization, by avoiding the currents discontinuity along the edges when using pulse basis function. Moreover, in order to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed currents, the resulting matrix system has been solved by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. A comparison between the formulation with the pulse basis functions and the RWG basis for the inverse problem is presented.

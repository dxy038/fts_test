By analyzing the pollution mode of urban environment system, this paper intends to establish a quantitative model system for calculating traffic environment carrying capacity (TECC). Moreover, after reviewing and analyzing the present research situation of traffic capacity, this paper classifies urban traffic capacity into macroUTC and microUTC, and quantitatively analyzes the former based on TECC. Finally, TECC and macroUTC model system is quantitatively and qualitatively applied respectively. The result of these applications displays that the model system proposed by this paper can be effectively used to control traffic development scale, seek for some appropriate approaches to improve urban ecological environment, meet the traffic environment control objective and realize the sustainable development of urban traffic eventually.

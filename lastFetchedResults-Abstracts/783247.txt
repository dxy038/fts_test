Objective To present lifetime rates of
service use for psychological and substance use related
problems among regular substance users and to
examine factors associated with service use. Method
Data come from a prospective-longitudinal, epidemiological
study of a community sample of
adolescents and young adults (n = 2548, age 14â€“
24 years at baseline) in Munich, Germany. The Munich-
Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(M-CIDI) was used at baseline and at two follow-ups
to assess substance use and service use.
Results Cumulated lifetime incidence of any substance
abuse or dependence was 43.7%. Of those with
abuse and dependence 23% had ever used any services
for psychological or substance use related
problems. Illicit substance users especially those with
dependence had the highest rates of lifetime service
use (52.1%). Psychotherapists and counseling services
were contacted most frequently among regular substance
users over their lifetimes. Utlilisation rates of
substance abuse services were low (2%). Comorbid
anxiety disorders and distressing life events were
associated with increased lifetime service use. Conclusions
Only a minority of adolescents and young
adults with substance use disorders have ever sought
professional help. Specialized substance abuse services
play only a minor role. The core role of psychotherapists
and non-substance abuse specialized
services needs critical research attention. Linkages
between psychotherapists and the substance use service
system should be strengthened to detect and intervene
at early developmental stages of abuse and
dependence.

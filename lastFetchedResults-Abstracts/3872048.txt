The assignment of process tolerances is vital to the success of production, therefore, a systematic and reliable approach should be developed to assist the process planner in designing the tolerances. Conventional methods assign tolerances without considering the process capability of machinery, as a result, the tolerances allocated may not agreeable economically. This study proposes a new formulation to concurrently maximize the standardized process tolerances; the original multiobjective programming is consolidated into a single objective problem by using the fuzzy technique. Comparison results with other methods indicate that the presented model can design process tolerances by generating the least overall scrap rate

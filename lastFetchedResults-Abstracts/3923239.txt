A power system may be subject to (rotor) angle, frequency or voltage instability. Voltage instability takes on the form of a dramatic drop of transmission system voltages, which may lead to system disruption. During the past two decades it has become a major threat for the operation of many systems and, in the prevailing open access environment, it is a factor leading to limit power transfer. The objective of this paper is to describe voltage instability phenomena, to enumerate preventive and curative countermeasures, and to present in a unified and coherent way various computer analysis methods used or proposed.

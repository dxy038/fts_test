Information superiority is a source of potential advantage in modern warfare. However, to realize the potential benefits of information superiority require available data and information to be rapidly transformed into actionable knowledge - the key to decision superiority. Decision superiority requires a thorough understanding of the C<sup>2</sup> decision making processes and the C<sup>2</sup> information systems that support them. It is with this understanding that we are developing DecisionEdge&#8482;, a scenario-driven, simulation-based training system that is intended to enable trainees to learn both C<sup>2</sup> decision making processes as well as C<sup>2</sup> information systems that support them. DecisionEdge employs a learning objective-guided simulation (LOGS) approach that engages the learner in a first-person, "learn-by-doing" experience. The LOGS approach allows for progressively more difficult training scenarios through systematic manipulation of event density, time stress, and information availability. This learning strategy allows learners to experience a variety of increasingly challenging operational scenarios at a rate commensurate with their learning pace while continuing to keep them involved and motivated.

Cytogenetic investigation of a metastatic lesion appearing 31 years after nephrectomy allowed for the diagnosis of a renal cell carcinoma. The der(X)t(X1)(p11.2;q21.1) found in this case and review of the 14 other cases previously reported indicates that this chromosome lesion may characterize a specific subgroup of renal cell carcinoma, with distinct histology and age distribution that also can occur in females.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect and validity of an intensive laboratory-based laparoscopic skills training curriculum on operative proficiency in obstetrics and gynecology residents. Study design: This was a prospective, randomized, block-design trial of postgraduate year 3 and 4 residents. The following study schedule was used: week 1 (prerandomization) included an orientation to study objectives, the administration of a laparoscopic experience questionnaire, timed video-laparoscopic drills (5 total), and the performance of a video-recorded laparoscopic partial salpingectomy; during weeks 2 and 3, the skills group residents repeated the laparoscopic drills 30 minutes daily for 10 days, and the control group residents had no formal practice sessions; during week 4, the week 1 evaluation was repeated. Operative proficiency was quantified by the Global Skills Assessment Tool through blinded, independent scoring of videotapes. Results: Twenty-six residents (skills group, 12; control group, 14) consented to the trial. Patient-related issues excluded 8 residents (30%). At week 1, no significant differences existed in previous laparoscopic experience, timed video skills, or resident operative proficiency (Global Skills Assessment Tool score) between cohorts. At week 4, both groups significantly improved their timed drill test scores. The percent reduction in time from baseline was of greater magnitude in the skills group versus control group (51% vs 18%,P< .0001). Laparoscopic performance also improved in both cohorts (P = .002). However, only the skills group demonstrated significant intracohort improvement from baseline (mean, 4.9 points; P = .015; 95% CI, 1â€“7.5). Conclusion: A core curriculum of intensive video laparoscopic skills training improves not only technical but also operative performance among postgraduate year 3 and 4 residents.

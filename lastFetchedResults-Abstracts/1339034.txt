Feature selection (FS) is considered to be an important preprocessing step in machine learning and pattern recognition, and feature evaluation is the key issue for constructing a feature selection algorithm. Feature selection process can also reduce noise and this way enhance the classification accuracy. In this article, feature selection method based on fuzzy similarity measures by multi objective genetic algorithm (FSFSM - MOGA) is introduced and performance of the proposed method on published data sets from UCI was evaluated. The results show the efficiency of the method is compared with the conventional version. When this method multi-objective genetic algorithms and fuzzy similarity measures used in CFS method can improve it.

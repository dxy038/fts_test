Objective: To compare rectally administered misoprostol to intravenously administered oxytocin for the management of third-stage labor. Study Design: Subjects were randomized to receive two, 200-μg misoprostol tablets rectally (study medication) plus 2 mL saline in Ringer's lactate intravenously or two lactose tablets rectally plus 20 units oxytocin in Ringer's lactate intravenously (control medication). Blood loss was determined by estimation, measurement, and change in hematocrit values from admission to postpartum day 1. Subjects were excluded if cesarean delivery was required. Results: A total of 325 women underwent analysis. By estimation, 21% of subjects and 15% of controls had postpartum hemorrhage (P = .17). By using measured blood loss, we determined that 70 of 154 (46%) study subjects and 61 of 161 (38%) control subjects had postpartum hemorrhage (P = .17). For 36 (23%) misoprostol subjects and 18 (11%) oxytocin subjects at least one additional agent was required to control bleeding (P = .004). Conclusion: Rectal misoprostol (400 μg) was no more effective than intravenous oxytocin in preventing postpartum hemorrhage. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185: 878-82.)

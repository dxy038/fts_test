Novel circuits, including orthogonal shuffle-type write-read arrays, error correction by weighted bidirectional codes, and associative iterative repair circuits, are proposed for significant improvements of the immunity of static RAMs, (SRAMs) against the effects of total dose and cosmic particle impacts for spaceborne mass storage systems. The implementation of the proposed circuit resulted in fault-tolerant 40-Mb and 10-Mb monolithic memories featuring a data rate of 120 MHz and power dissipation of 880 mW. These experimental serial-parallel memories were fabricated with a nonhardened standard CMOS processing technology, yet provided a total dose hardness of 1 Mrad and a projected single event upset rate of 1&#215;10<sup>12</sup> error/bit/day

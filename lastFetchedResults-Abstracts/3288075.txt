The paper proposes an analytical study about the design and operation of distributed Electrical Storage Systems(ESS) in an active distribution network supplying a Mediterranean island, according to different criteria. The approach is based on the application of a multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II) that outputs a set of optimized schedules of the ESS in different configurations when operated according to different criteria (minimum energy losses in the grid, total generation cost, greenhouse gas emissions, limiting the fluctuations of the generation from fossil fuel plants). Moreover the variability of the voltage profile has been investigated also by a comparison with a reference scenario characterized by the absence of storage systems.

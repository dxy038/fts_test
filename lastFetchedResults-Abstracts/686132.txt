The objective of this study is to estimate the spatial variability of tropospheric ozone in an area using a simple model. The area in this case was applied in the western Mediterranean basin. The study period was from May to September in 2003 and 2004.
A multiple linear regression between ozone concentrations, altitude and distance to the precursor sources in a fluvial basin can be used to estimate ozone values at other sites during the warmer seasons. The correlation coefficients obtained with 2-week ozone values measured at five points with a passive sampling technique were high enough to apply the model (0.77<r<0.99).
To verify the model, ozone concentrations were measured with passive samplers and continuous analyzers at some selected sites, and the values were compared with the estimated concentration. The results of the validations were satisfactory, in 80% of the measurements the estimated levels differ from measured less than 20%, which is included in the bound error for the type of sampler used in this study.

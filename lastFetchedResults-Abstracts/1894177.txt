SummaryBackground
c arrest (CA) is a leading cause of death worldwide. The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) has developed basic life support/automated external defibrillation (BLS/AED) courses for uniform training in out-of-hospital CA.
ive
esent study compares the resuscitation skills of two groups of nursing staff, one taught by newly trained ERC nurse-instructors and the other by newly trained doctor-instructors.

en doctors and 18 nurses were asked to teach a total of 108 nurses in a (BLS/AED) course. One month after its completion, all 108 nurses were asked to be re-evaluated, with the use of the objective structured clinical examination.
sions
tistical significant difference between the two groups was noted in the written test, in contrast with data collected from the practice skills check-list. Nurses in group A could easily identify the patient in cardiac arrest but had difficulties concerning chest compressions and handling the AED. Nurses in group B were more focused during the performances, used AED more accurately and continued cardiopulmonary resuscitation with no delays. Nurses prove to be more efficient in training nurses.

Objective: To study the relationship between expression of IL-8 mRNA in peripheral blood and women with endometriosis and its clinical significance. Methods: The women with endometriosis were treated with Danazol and the level of IL-8 mRNA in their peripheral blood was detected by Real-time PCR. Results: The level of IL-8 mRNA in peripheral blood of women with endometriosis was 1.1339-0.1428. It was high significance between in endometriosis and without endometriosis (P&lt;0.01). However, the level of IL-8 mRNA in endometriosis in stage of I~II and in stage of III were 1.1023-0.1371 and 1.1866-0.1543, few significance difference in two subgroups (P&gt;0.05). After treatment of Danazol for six months, the expression of IL-8 mRNA in peripheral blood was 1.0547-0.1299, without significantly difference between in endometriosis and controls (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: IL-8 mRNA is over expressed in peripheral blood of women with endometriosis and play key role in course of disease. The over expression of endometrium and local inflammatory reaction caused by IL-8 can be inhibited by Danazol therapy.

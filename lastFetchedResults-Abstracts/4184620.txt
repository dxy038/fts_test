Hybrid PV-wind generation shows higher availability as compared to the PV or wind alone. Simulation and control of a hybrid PV-wind generator system connected to the grid are presented in this paper, where every major component of the system is modelled, and then different control strategies are applied to the system. Design and sizing of the power electronic converter components which may be shared by both, and development of the control strategy, are the main aim of the simulation exercise. The system is connected to the grid so that the overall design objective is to maximize the power exported to the grid within the device ratings and the constraint of the grid capability.

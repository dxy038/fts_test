This paper discusses our indentation experiments and the computational method developed to provide tumor size and elasticity. Using force-displacement data from indentation tests on a synthetic breast model, embedded tumors could be differentiated from the surrounding tissue-like material. Analytical equations developed based on a multi-durometer model provided estimates of tissue elasticity, tumor elasticity and tumor size. The estimates of tumor elasticity ranged between 150-990 kPa while the tumor size ranged between 1.0-1.5 cm. The error in tumor size is about 10%. Palpation is used to determine the presence of breast lumps. An objective method of conveying tumor size and location is presented

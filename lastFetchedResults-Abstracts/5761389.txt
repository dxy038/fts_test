Although making changes in hardware is not the only means to enhance security, it still holds the undefeatable advantages for security comparing with software. Trusted computing is such a kind of security technology that relies on the basis of making changes in hardware. Moreover, thus technology is already developed relevant standard specifications and it owns advantages of stronger security and more efficiency in information communications. In the cloud computing era, whose environment requires high security for information and services, trusted computing is proposed by this paper with objective analysis, original improvement and novel evolvement by adding two new modules: Service Authentication List Management (SAL), and Configuration Dynamic Update Module, (CUM). We also present and illustrate an abstract model for Trusted Computing Applied into the Cloud.

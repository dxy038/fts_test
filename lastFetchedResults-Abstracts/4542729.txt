Concept Mapping is a technique that allows information visualization. A Concept Map is a graphical way of representing and organizing knowledge. It is comprised of nodes and links, arranged in some spatial distribution to reflect the domain information. Nodes represent concepts, and links represent the relationship between concepts; both concepts and links are labeled and may be categorized. Inside the educational area concept maps can be used for supporting learning, for assessing learning, and also for organizing and presenting information. Introduction to artificial intelligence is a compulsory subject studied at the first term of the Computer Science degree in the University of the Basque Country. In this work a study carried out by 6 voluntary students with the aim of organizing all the learning resources (theoretical contents, laboratories, exercises,...) related to that subject by means of a concept map is presented. CM-ED is the Concept Map EDitor used to fulfill this objective. Representing the variety of learning resources related to the subject in a visual format makes it easier their organization and their later visualization and searching.

A novel bidirectional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transceiver for chip-to-chip optical interconnects operating at 2.5 Gb/s is proposed, which shares the common block of a receiver and a transmitter on a single chip. The share of the common block of two circuits makes it possible to save 55% or 20% of power dissipation, depending on the operating mode. The chip in 0.18-&#956;m CMOS technology occupies an area of 0.82&#215;0.82 mm<sup>2</sup>, 70% of the total area of a typical unshared transceiver chip. The transmitting and receiving modes of operation show -3-dB bandwidths of 2.2 and 2.4 GHz and electrical isolations of -28 and -40 dB, respectively.

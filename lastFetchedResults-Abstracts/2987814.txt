In the biological systems there are numerous examples of autonomously generated periodic activities. In an artificial spiking neural network (SNN) the information processing and transmission are carried out by spike trains in a manner similar to the generic biological neurons. In this paper, we propose a method for synthesis of spiking neural oscillators (SNO) by SNN, such that the SNN possesses desired autonomous oscillatory responses (limit cycle spike train). We consider a recurrent SNN constructed with integrate-and-fire type spiking neurons. Objective functions are set in such a way that minimization of them with respect to the network parameters realizes the desired SNO. Simulation examples are also provided to verify the efficiency and the applicability of the proposed algorithm

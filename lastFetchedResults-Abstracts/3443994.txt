In this paper, new methods for error concealment of shape information are proposed for compressed MPEG-4 bit-streams transmitted over error prone channels. For spatial domain, the proposed approach employs the Bezier curve fitting to approximate and outline the intra-video object plane (I-VOP). For temporal domain, the proposed scheme uses the weighted side matching criterion to reconstruct the inter-video object planes (P-/B-VOPs). The proposed algorithms get better subjective and objective qualities than previous works.

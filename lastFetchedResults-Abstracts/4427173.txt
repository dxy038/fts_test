Mobility is a key aspect for today´s society. Whether or not a desired high level mobility is achieved, is significantly influenced by airports, which are a central interface between ground and air traffic and, thus, impact the total transportation system and its quality. That today´s airports do not optimally foster mobility, is, for instance, impressively demonstrated by punctuality statistics: Unpunctuality rates of airports reach about 20%. The majority of these mobility issues can be traced back to an inefficient use of the airports´ capacities, which are, in turn, caused by the low level of interconnection between the great number of processes owned by the various stakeholders at an airport (e.g., airlines, ground handlers, air traffic control, airport company, etc.). To improve these numbers and yield a high level of efficient mobility, a total airport management concept has been introduced which aims at optimizing the key performance areas &#8220;capacity&#8221;, &#8220;predictability&#8221;, &#8220;efficiency&#8221;, or &#8220;environment&#8221;. It proposes assistance systems which use multi-objective optimization algorithms to compute appropriate allocation of resources and airports. In addition, it requests a manual implementation of the proposed allocation. This human-machine interaction is introduced and first results are summarized within the scope of this paper.

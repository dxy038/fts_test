This work presents an approach for the dynamic management of the content of several Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) registries. By content, it is meant the announcements of Web services that providers post on various distributed UDDI registries. Unlike other initiatives in the field of Web services, our concerns are the following: availability of several UDDI registries, no predefined communication infrastructure between the UDDI registries, and no centralized component to coordinate the UDDI registries. The solution presented in this paper integrates users and software agents into what we call messengers. When a user is in the vicinity of an UDDI registry, his software agent, which resides in his mobile device, interacts with that registry. The objective is to submit the details on Web services that are stored in the mobile device.

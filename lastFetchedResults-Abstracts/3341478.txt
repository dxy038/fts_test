The paper presents a robust sliding mode controller for a dc/dc, bidirectional converter interfacing storage unit to ensure dc bus voltage regulation in a stand-alone dc microgrid. The dc bus supplies a combination of a constant power load and conventional resistive load. In order to enhance the battery life, a state-of-charge based charging algorithm is also implemented. Depending on the measured dc bus voltage, the controller selects the appropriate operating mode of the converter. The effectiveness of the proposed controller has been validated through simulation results.

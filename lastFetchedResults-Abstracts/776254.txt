Transient natural convection in an enclosure with vertical solutal gradients has been studied in this paper. Transfers in a rectangular
cavity configuration translating hydrodynamic and thermal phenomena are numerically predicted by means of computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) in transient regime.
The objective of this numerical study is to give a fine knowledge of the hydrodynamic and thermal characteristics during energy storage
in an enclosure filled with water stratified by downward salinity gradient. The enclosure is divided into three zones with different
salinity level such as salt gradient pond (SGP). Water is heated by a heating device at the bottom of the cavity.
The Navierâ€“Stokes, energy and mass equations are discretized using finite-volume method, and a two-dimensional analysis of the
hydrodynamic and thermal behaviors generated in transient regime in the cavity are performed. The mathematical modelling has allowed
the prediction of the storage performances by developing parametrical study in view to search the convective heat transfer coefficient at
the bottom of the enclosure. Velocity vector fields show the presence of recirculation zones caused only in the lower region and permit to
explain the increase of the temperature in the lower convective zone (LCZ).
This study shows also the importance of the salinity in the preservation of the high temperature in the bottom of the cavity, and the
important reduction of the phenomenon of thermal transfer across the non-convective zone (NCZ).

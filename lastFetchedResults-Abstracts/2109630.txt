Postharvest fruit quality is so affected by harvest time in Hayward kiwifruit.
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of harvest maturity and
storage time on ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit quality. The fruits were harvested based on
total soluble solids (TSS) content (5.5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5% average) and then stored
in 0.5 oC and 80-90% RH, for 18 weeks. The samples had taken in 6, 12 and 18th
weeks during storage and the changes of water loss, firmness, TSS, TA, TSS/TA,
ascorbic acid, pulp color index (L*, a*) and sensory analysis were assessed.
Results showed fruits which harvested an early time had the lowest water loss
during storage. Fruits which harvested at 6.5 oBrix maitained better firmness during
12 till 18 weeks of storage. Generally, TSS increased in all treatments during
storage. The TA percentage was the lower in the end of storage especially in the
fruits which harvested with higher TSS. The fruit pulp lightness (L*) of all fruits
gradually decreased, particularly in week of 12 (48.46 to 58.1) but was lower in the
fruit harvested with higher oBrix. The value of a* increased insignificantly in all
fruits during storage. Based on physicochemical and sensory analyses is founded
that the Hayward kiwifruit harvest time is when the fruits had at least 6.5 oBrix.
However, if fruits picked up with 7.5 oBrix, it will be suitable for preservation of
fruit quality and flavor to end of storage.

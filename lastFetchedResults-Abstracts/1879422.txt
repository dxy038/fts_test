In this paper, a stochastic model is proposed for planning the location and operation of Fuel Cell Power Plants (FCPPs) as Combined Heat, power, and Hydrogen (CHPH) units. Total cost, emissions of FCPPs and substation, and voltage deviation are the objective functions to be minimized. Location and operation of FCPPs as CHPH are considered in this paper while their investment cost is not taken into account. In the proposed model, indeterminacy refers to electrical and thermal loads forecasting, pressure of oxygen and hydrogen, and the nominal temperature of FCPPs. In this method, scenarios are produced using roulette wheel mechanism and probability distribution function of input random variables. Using this method, the probabilistic problem is considered to be distributed as some scenarios and consequently probabilistic problem is considered as combination of some deterministic problems. Considering the nature of objective functions, the problem of locating and operating FCPPs as CHPH is considered as a mixed integer nonlinear problem. A Self Adaptive Charged System Search (SACSS) algorithm is employed for determining the best Pareto optimal set. Furthermore, a set of non-dominated solutions is saved in repository during simulation procedure. A 69-bus distributed system is used for verifying the beneficiary proposed method.

Background and Objective: Fracture of anterior teeth by trauma is a common problem in children and teenagers. Complex metal-ceramic crowns with considerable loss of remaining sound structure are no longer necessary due to adhesive technique, such as reattachment technique. The aim of this study was to compare the fracture strength of sound teeth with teeth that reattached with two different materials.
Materials and Methods: Twenty four sound central incisor teeth were fractured by an axial load applied to the buccal area and were randomly divided in two groups. The third group was used as control and comprised 12 sound teeth. The teeth were restored as following: 1- reattached with dual cure cement, 2- reattached with flowable composite and 3- include sound teeth all groups were subjected to the same loading in the lingual area. Data analysis was performed using ANOVA and Tukey tests.
Results: average rate for first group was 548.17 N ,in second group was 498.75 N , and in third group was 858.25 N . Results suggest that average of first group with control group (p.value=0.029) and second group with control group (p.value=0.010) had significant differences, but average of group 1 with group 2 had no significant difference (p.value=0.904).
Conclusion: According to the results of this study, material combination used to reattach the fragment dose not play an important role in the fracture strength of reattached teeth. Thus, it is recommended that other methods of fragment reattachment to the tooth to be evaluated.

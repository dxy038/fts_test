A high-performance contactless electrical energy transmission (CEET) technique which employs the inductive energy transmission principle is described. The proposed technique enables the implementation of high-efficiency high-powerdensity fully regulated CEET systems suitable for applications with a wide input and load range. A high efficiency of the system is achieved by recovering the energy stored in the leakage inductances of the transformer by incorporating them in the operation of the circuit, and by employing high-frequency-inverter and controlled-rectifier topologies that allow a controlled bidirectional power flow through the transformer. In addition, a feedforward variable-switching-frequency control of the inverter is used to maintain approximately constant power transfer through the transformer with the input voltage changes, whereas the output-side rectifier employs a local pulsewidth-modulation control to achieve a tight regulation of the output in the presence of load variations. Specifically, the described CEET system is suitable for use in universal-input battery chargers.

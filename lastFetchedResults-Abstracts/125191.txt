Among the achievements of ideational theory, one can refer to the search for the fallacies which have filled the whole history of philosophy. The main conflict between solipsism which is recounted to be the most extreme branch of idealism and realism grounded in ideational theory finds a novel solution which is touched upon by Wittgenstein. The denial of the objective world from the perspective of solipsism has its roots in the confusion between the two differing roles of language, two separate aspects of the subject and the limits of scientific and philosophical discourses. Through careful analysis, one can show that the ideal solipsism is looking for cannot be expressed and insufficient attention to the distinction between the subjective mode and the existential mode of subject and improper appealing to empirical knowledge can lead to the denial of reality. If we observe the distinction consciously, solipsism will come to terms with realism. Statements involving mental acts like "Ahmad believes that Hassan won something." can be shown through careful analysis not to be a good reason for the violation of the principle of universality but to clarify vague or ambiguous statements which can be reduced to empirical or psychological statements having no philosophical significance or construed to necessarily true tautologies which are undoubtedly pseudo-proposition which have nothing to do with idealism.

Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are an emerging technology which provides broadband wireless access services. One of the challenges that still faces high performance WMNs is the capacity reduction due to interference of wireless links. In this paper, we address the problem of assigning channels to nodes in WMNs. For this, we introduce the cluster channel assignment (CCA) approach with the objective of reducing network interference to increase the overall network performance. A clustering approach is employed in order to reduce the complexity of channel assignment into local problems within clusters and taking the advantage of the possibility to reuse the channels in different clusters.

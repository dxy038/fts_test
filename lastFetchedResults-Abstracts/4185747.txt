A distributed object-oriented architecture called DUMPS with explicit primitives for exploiting parallelism that are hardware-independent is proposed. Multiprocessors do not appear as separate entities in the model, but are treated in the same way as multiple uniprocessor nodes. Synchronization and communication between processes is in terms of objective-invocations, so the model does not rely on the availability of shared memory. Continuity of the face of failure a vital characteristic of the system, is discussed

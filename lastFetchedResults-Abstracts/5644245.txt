This research focuses on treatment model of diesel leakage accident near the Weihe River at the beginning of 2010. A technical option is proposed for determination of diesel content in soil by the method of ultrasonic-ultraviolet spectrophotometry, so as to evaluate the soil pollution and reasonably select the remediation scheme according to the pollution degree and the migration and transformation regularity of diesel contaminants in the loess soil. Results show the diesel-soil separation effect comes to the maximal degree during the deposition process using petroleum ether as extraction solvent, and ultrasonic irradiation at 200W for 10min, and then using ultraviolet spectrophotometry to determine the diesel content in soil. The diesel content in soil at each sampling point exceeds the maximum allowable concentration (3g/kg). If physical remediation is applied at the occurrence of the accident and bioremediation is selected later, the migration and transformation efficiency of diesel contaminants can be improved and the diesel content in soil can be reduced. The objective of this paper is to establish a model of the determination and remediation of diesel contaminants in soil, which can be used for reference in the treatment of petroleum leakage accident.

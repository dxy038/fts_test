Background and Objective: The Gross Motor Function Classification System Expanded and Revised (GMFCS E&R) has been widely utilized for objective classification of gross motor function of patients with cerebral palsy (CP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter rater reliability of Persian version of GMFCS E&R in patients with CP.

Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive analytic study, carried out in Tehran on 202 children with CP (95 girls, 107 boys), (SD =0.5). At first, patients with CP were classified by researcher, and then five occupational therapists were asked to classify patients with CP in different levels of GMFCS E&R, at least one hour, up to one week. The result of each tester was evaluated and adapted with researcher. Data analysis was performed using non-parametric McNemar and Cochran tests.

Results: The Cochran test was used for determining inter rater reliability of Persian version GMFCS E&R and it showed p <  0.05 for the total score and showed no difference between testers, so there is high repeatability of GMFCS E&R.

Conclusion: The Persian version of GMFCS E&R is a reliable classification system to classify patients with CP by medical and rehabilitation professionals.

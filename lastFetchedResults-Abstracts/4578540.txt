The objective of this paper is to present and test a hardware model of the Magneto Hydrodynamics (MHD) effect occurring during cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We emphasized on the coupling of magnetic field with flow of blood containing charged particles. We determined and separated between different components of the MHD phenomenon as described in theoretical solutions. We validated the prototype with different sets of experiments that resulted in acceptable measurements similar to calculations predictions values. We concluded toward an interesting development of predetermining and eliminating MHD artifact using such model when combined to software model we have build.

Since a component-based information system has different requirements, components customization for various constraints is needed. Thus, the ability of reusable components to be varied and appropriate to different information systems requirements is a key property in reusable component development, especially in business component (BC) development. In this paper, a BC customization approach is presented. In order to do this, we focus on the variability concept, which is defined as the ability of a software artefact to be changed or customized to be reused in multiple contexts. Hence, the objective of this work is to specify business components with the consideration of commonality and variability in a business domain, in order to increase their reusability and applicability.

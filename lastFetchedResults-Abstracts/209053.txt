Background & Objective: Enteroparasitic infections constitute a serious public health problem
in different populations including developed countries. Patients who receive chemotherapy of
cancer have an increased probability of acquiring parsitic infections, generally with a high
degree of severity. The aim of present study was to ascertain the frequency of intestinal parasites
in patients admitted in oncology ward for chemotherapy.
Materials & Methods: In a descriptive study, all the patients whith malignancy who admitted in
Sina Hospital in Hamadan, Iran, during 2005 were included. Data including demographic
characteristics, type of malignancy, and the time past from the diagnosis entered the
questionnaires. A stool specimen were examined for each patients. Data were analyzed using
SPSS software.
Results: Out of 190 patients, 94 (49.5%) were male and 96 (50.5%) were female. The mean age
was 48.5Â±18.7 years (12-88 years). Thirty-one (16.3%) patients were involved intestinal
parasites. The most common parasites were: Ascaris (41.9%), Giardia (35.5%), Indolimax nana
(3.2%), Blastocytis hominis (3.2%), and Cryptosporidium (3.2%). The highest prevalence of
intestinal parasites belonged to 40-60 years age group
Conclusion: This study indicated that, the prevalence of intestinal parasites in patients
undergoing chemotherapy for malignancy is lower than general population, which can be related
to the effect of antineoplastic agents.

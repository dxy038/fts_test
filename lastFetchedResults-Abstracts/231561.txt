The objective of this research is to develop equations to predict yields for short rotation black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) tree plantations. The data set is from experimental black locust plantation sites located throughout the State of Kansas. Stepwise ordinary least-squares regression techniques are used to derive the equations. The final model selection is based on simplicity of use, statistical accuracy, and consistency with known biological relationships. Two models are selected: both models use precipitation and herbicide treatments as variables, however, one model also includes nitrogen content in the soil. The model predictions are compared to other plantation yield studies in the area and found to give similar yield estimates.

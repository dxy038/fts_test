The author wants to make you more aware of new ways of thinking about things you have been doing right along to achieve career satisfaction and success. Engineers with adequate abilities may see no opportunity for growth; other engineers may expect growth but be unaware of their loss of professional vitality. In either case, a thwarting of personal growth is felt. The ogre, pyramidal organizational structures, contributes to the frustration of an engineer who wants to grow. Failure to distinguish options to pursue different objectives, as contrasted to options of different ways to pursue an objective, clouds awaeness of choices that truly exist.

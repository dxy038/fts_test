Solar combisystems are relatively complex systems with many different components and operational parameters. Before the beginning of IEA-SHC Task 26 (“solar combisystems”), no method was available with which they could be compared. The well known “f-chart” method was introduced by Duffie and Beckman already in the seventies, but was only useful for dimensioning generic combisystems, with a defined hydraulic scheme. It didn’t give a method to compare different designs.

The objective of this work was to develop a simple tool for characterizing the performance of these systems. The method used was to analyse the comprehensive simulation results of Task 26 and to look for relationships between the key external factors of climate and load, and the system performance. The result is a new and simple methodology for characterization of solar combisystems, called the fractional solar consumption (FSC) method. FSC is a dimensionless quantity, which takes simultaneously into account the climate, the space heating and domestic hot water loads, the collector size, its orientation and tilt angle, but which does not depend on the studied system design.

The study shows that fractional energy savings, with and without parasitic energy included, can be expressed as a quadratic function of FSC. The relationship was shown to be valid for a wide range of conditions, but to be limited for certain parameters such as collector orientation and hot water load. The method has been used to create a nomogram and the computer design tool CombiSun.

A new directional filter is proposed for the restoration of digital images corrupted by random valued impulse noise by addressing the limitations of Directional Weighted Median Filter (DWMF) [3]. The proposed filter works better for all natural images corrupted to varied noise levels. The experimental results in terms of objective and subjective matrices favor the proposed filter for both images corrupted with higher or lower levels of noise while preserving the high frequency image details.

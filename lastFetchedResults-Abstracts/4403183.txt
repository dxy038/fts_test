CISPR 16-4-2 to address the measurement uncertainty of EMI test prescribes MIU (Measurement Instrumentation Uncertainty) of measuring instruments, systems and facilities. And also the product compliance assessment procedure based on MIU is described in the standard. However, since MIU does not embrace the whole source of measurement uncertainty, the contribution to improve MIU of EMI testing is limited in its totality. Especially from a standpoint of improving the reproducibility of testing between testing sites, efforts to reduce MIU will not be rewarded much. Therefore, we should consider the whole source of measurement uncertainty which is called SCU (Standards Compliance Uncertainty). To take into the consideration including whole sources of measurement uncertainty, this session is titled "Improving the measurement uncertainty of EMI testing". And the main objective of this session is to shed light on on-going efforts and to discuss issues relating to standardizing of the optimum solution.

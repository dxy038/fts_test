The cardiac conduction system is divided in different sections that play an important role in the cardiac depolarization sequence and define the morphology of the electrocardiogram. In this study we have built several configurations for each section based on anatomical descriptions. The effect of the morphology of the bundle branches, and the density of both Purkinje branches and Purkinje-myocardial junctions (PMJ) has been studied by comparing the pseudo-ECGs obtained with the standard precordial leads of the electrocardiogram. A functional model for the PMJs based on the existence of a conduction adaptation layer is also presented. Simulation results showed a large influence of the His bundle and bundle branches in the pseudo-ECG and helped to elucidate the most appropriate morphology. The functional PMJ model allowed bidirectional communication between the conduction system and the myocardium with realistic transmission delays between both mediums. These results can help to improve current conduction system models and improve depolarization sequences of activation in the ventricles.

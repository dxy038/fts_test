In order to obtain a high-current charged particle beam, a bidirectional line pulse generator system for external pulse injection, which is applicable to a linear induction accelerator (LIA) with line-type cavities, was constructed. The system can attain the energy transfer efficiency of 100% theoretically, because the magnetic cores usually used in conventional LIAs are unnecessary and residual magnetic energy stored in the cavity after completion of the pulse can be made zero. However, the result showed that the waveform obtained experimentally was far from the ideal one and the cause was attributed to an inductance and resistance of a main gap switch, which is a conventional trigatron gas-filled gap switch. Therefore, to obtain an ideal bidirectional voltage waveform, the basic characteristics of a laser-triggered switch using a Q-switched pulsed Nd:YAG laser have been investigated. An experiment with pulse charging of line was carried out in this time taking into account an application to the existing bidirectional pulse generator. The experimental results will be reported.

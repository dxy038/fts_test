This book is based on extensive research experience of the authors. It competes with two popular books on filters-Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures by G. Matthaei et al. and Theory and Design of Microwave Filters by Ian Hunter. Although the book by Matthaei et al. has become a classic, it was published in 1980 and needs updating. The book by Hunter provides excellent coverage of modern microwave filters, but it is not comprehensive. The present book by Hong is successful in carving out a niche that is distinctly different from the two competing books. The main objective of the book is to provide a comprehensive treatment of RF/microwave filters based on the microwave structure. The book consists of 12 chapters and one appendix that presents some useful constants and data.

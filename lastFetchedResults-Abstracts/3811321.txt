The purpose of the paper is to present an approach to the nominal design of integrated circuits by interactive optimization. In solving the nominal design problem, proper values must be assigned to the set of designable parameters of an integrated circuit (IC) such that the requirements of circuit characteristics are fulfilled. The approach is based on a boundary curve of the optimization problem. This boundary curve is used as an assessment criterion to visualize the problem condition and to control the entire optimization process. A standardized representation of the boundary curve suited for graphic terminals is presented as well as an analysis of its characteristics and computational methods for the evaluation of the boundary curve. The approach is demonstrated by an application to a multiple objective design problem of an integrated circuit.

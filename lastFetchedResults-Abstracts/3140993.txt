Most of the traditional dynamic multi-criteria decision-making methods utilize only differences of the systems´ evaluation values (which can be called absolute difference), then the conclusion of the evaluation is unfair to some evaluated objects. In consideration of disadvantages of the traditional method, a new method based on integration of absolute and relative differences is suggested. In this method, differences of systems´ developing status (relative difference) are taken into consideration. So more information can be put in and then produced out so as to approach reality closer. And also both the subjective and objective information are integrated. Finally, a numerical example was given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Introduction: Bacterial vaginitis is one of the most common infectious disorders affecting women. Several types of antibiotics have been used to treat this condition. Although Metronidazole was found to be the most effective, none was completely successful in either cure or prevention.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral Clindamycin and oral Metronidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginitis.
Materials and methods: In this study, 60 women with age range of 16 years or older in whom bacterial vaginitis was diagnosed by standard criteria such as Amsel's and Gram's stain criteria were enrolled in a randomized, double - blind study to receive either oral Clindamycin 300 mg twice a day for 7 days or 500 mg of oral Metronidazole twice a day for 7 days. Women with coexisting vulvovaginal candidiasis or vaginal trichomoniasis were excluded. Test of cure was repeated 7 to 14 days following treatment. Vaginal symptoms, complications, side effects and general complaints in patients were noted.
Results: There were no statistically significant differences in cure rates for oral Clindamycin (93.3%) and oral Metronidazole(86.6%). Adverse reactions were mild in both groups. Four patients who had received Clindamycin developed non - bloody diarrhea and 4 patients who had received Metronidazole developed symptomatic candida vaginitis.
Conclusion: We conclude that Clindamycin may be a safe and effective alternative to Metronidazole for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in women.

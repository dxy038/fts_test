Objective: The paper is to explore the construction of the joint prosthesis model of dental implant and root bisection and mechanical rules of the bone-implant interface of screw-type dental implant. Methods: The Mimics software is applied for loading the image scanned by CT and reverse engineering software for optimizing the model, and Pro/engineer UG software for constructing the three-dimensional model. The model contains all ceramic crown, periodontal ligament, post core, drill base, screw-type dental implant, half of the real teeth, root canal, spongy bone and bone cortex. All the three dimensional finite element models were analyzed using ANSYS Workbench software. Stress distribution on the teeth surface under vertical load (250 N) were calculated for the models. Results: The spongy bone of the dental implant and its stress distribution and deformation rule is obtained. The stress value at the root of the screw-type dental plant is maximum, which is 100.15Mpa; deformation occurs mainly on the real tooth body, the maximum of which is 0.022mm. Conclusions: Acting as the sensory receptor, the periodontal ligament limits the bite force of the joint implant. Thus from the perspective of mechanical engineering, we can conclude that the joint prosthesis of clinical dental implant and root bisection is an excellent repair method.

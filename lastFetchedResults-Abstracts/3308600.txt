Nowadays production improvement of orchids in flower nursery is relying on intelligent environmental management. Such objective can be realized by cooperating with automation controls, computer science, and sensing technologies. In this paper, we introduce our orchid nursing system involving sensors´ alignment processes. Here an enclosed mobile nursery is equipped with a low-cost embedded system for monitoring and control applications. Environment´s information is then detected by peripheral sensors, which are picked out from coarse ones using efficient error convergent algorithms. According to our elimination result of sensors, proposed alignment mechanism can efficiently converge the deviation between sensors and is promising for real-life nursery construction in the future.

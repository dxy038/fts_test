The objective of this paper is to model a linear variable reluctance motor using nonlinear magnetic circuit techniques, in order to account for material saturation and mutual coupling. The magnetic circuit approach has the advantages of simplicity and computational efficiency, so it is well suited for rapid performance evaluation at the initial design stage. The accuracy of the magnetic circuit model is directly compared with results from finite element analysis.

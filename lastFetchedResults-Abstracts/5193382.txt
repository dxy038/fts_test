Progressive image transmission provides a convenient user interface when images are transmitted slowly. However, most of the existing PIT techniques only consider the objective quality of the reconstructed image. Here we present an attention model based progressive image transmission approach to improve the subjective quality of the transmission process. We use both bottom-up image features and top-down semantic information to extract the regions of interest and also propose a new ROI coding scheme based on JPEG2000 to control the trade-off between the transmission of ROI and background. Experiments have shown the efficiency of our approach

The objective of this study was to determine the influence of myofibril isolation procedures and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform composition on myofibrillar ATPase activity as related to postmortem muscle metabolism. Myofibrils from the red (RST) and white (WST) portions of semitendinosus muscles were isolated using two different methods (A and B) at 3 min and 24 h postmortem in control (NS) and electrically stimulated (ES) pork carcasses. Comparison of the relative MyHC isoform profiles between the two different myofibril isolation methods and myosin extracts from the RST and WST at 3 min showed that method B myofibrils were more similar to the myosin extract than method A. Myofibrillar ATPase activity remained constant or increased (P&lt;0.01) from 3 min to 24 h postmortem in NS carcasses and decreased (P&lt;0.0001) in ES carcasses. From the RST, method A myofibrils had higher (P&lt;0.0001) ATPase activity compared to method B across sampling time and carcass treatment. In the WST, method A myofibrils had lower (P&lt;0.01) activity at 3 min, were not different at 24 h in NS carcasses, but had higher (P&lt;0.05) activity at 24 h in ES carcasses versus method B myofibrils. Compared to method B, isolation method A biased the isoform profile of myofibril samples more towards faster MyHC (2A and 2X) in the RST and towards MyHC 2X in the WST. Results suggest that the ATPase activity and MyHC isoform profile of isolated myofibril samples are influenced by method of myofibril isolation, postmortem sampling time, and the rate of postmortem metabolism. Thus, differences in MyHC isoform profile and method of myofibril isolation must be taken into account to determine accurately the relationship between myofibrillar ATPase activity and rate of postmortem metabolism.

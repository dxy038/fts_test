A novel approach is proposed in this paper to solve multi-objective dynamic reactive power and voltage control (Volt/VAr control, VVC). The method is able to attain the Pareto-optimal solutions, based on the day-ahead load forecast, for the VVC considering reducing daily power loss, enhancing voltage profile and optimizing dispatch schedules for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitor switching, which will provide users more options to schedule the dynamic VVC. This approach is applied to the IEEE14 buses system and to the IEEE30 buses system, whose result shows that it has encouraging performance in dynamic reactive power control.

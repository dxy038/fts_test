We propose the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) systems, techniques, and tools to observe the neuron-level activity of the brains of designers or CAD tool developers. The objective is to enable designers and developers to complete their task in a faster and more creative way with significantly reduced number of logical and design errors. While fMRI techniques are already used in economics, decision and several other social sciences, until now their potential for closing the design productivity-silicon productivity (DPSP) gap has not been recognized. By compounding the new approach with techniques for designing integrated circuits and system within fMRI data collection and analysis, we will establish a positive productivity and creativity feedback loop that may permanently close the DPSP gap. As a preliminary and presently feasible step, we propose the creation of behavioral CAD research and development techniques. The usage of judiciously selected verbal, visual information and reintroduction of successful design paradigm and exposure to beneficial synthesis templates may help current and future designers to learn and design more effectively.

This paper provides a brief comparison between two different modulation methods for direct matrix converter (DMC). The power semiconductors are modelled as ideal bidirectional switches and the DMC is controlled using Venturini method, optimized Venturini and space vector modulation respectively. These methods are compared and analysed in some aspects such as total harmonic distortion and harmonic spectrum analysis of output voltage and input current. A simple model of DMC is proposed to represent the power circuit, including the input filter and a three-phase Y-connected RL load. Simulated input and output parameters of DMC are presented using PSIM software for both modulation strategies.

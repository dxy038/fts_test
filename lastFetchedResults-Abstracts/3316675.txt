A new objective method is presented for predicting the perceived quality of multi-stream voice transmission. Also proposed is a joint playout buffer and FEC adjustment scheme that maximizes the perceived speech quality via delay-loss trading. Experimental results showed that the proposed scheme achieves significant reductions in delay and packet loss as well as improved speech quality.

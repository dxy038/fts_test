Economic conditions which are involved in every product designed for the multitudes have prevented the adoption of the various elaborate types of wide range sound reproducers. A consideration of this problem shows that the loud speaker is one of the component parts which has limited the range of radio and phonograph reproduction. This paper describes the result of a program of development on the production of a wide range cone loud speaker capable of delivering large acoustic outputs and at the same time retaining a system free from the complexities of construction usually associated with wide range electro-acoustic transducers. The wide range cone loud speaker consists of a voice coil and coil cylinder segregated into masses and compliances and connected to a cone suitably corrugated to present an impedance to the driving system which would yield uniform response from 80 to 10,000 cycles. Objective and subjective performance tests indicate that this loud speaker is suitable for high fidelity sound reproduction and substantiates the theoretical analysis.

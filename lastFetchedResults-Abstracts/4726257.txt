Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) build a model to improve project outcomes through a collaborative approach and a multi-party agreement. But IPD is short of mature laws and system like liability allocation and risk control. Thus the overall objective of this study is to make a research and discuss into the risk liability allocation problems, where basic risk allocation problems are discussed and effective mechanisms are summarized in this paper. Risk/profit sharing mechanism and liability harbor mechanism are proposed to improve the rationalization and available of IPD. And insurance coverage should be an effective complement in the actual project of construction.

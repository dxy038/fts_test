This article propose a model of teaching quality evaluation, by combining the theory of fuzzy mathematics with classroom teaching quality evaluation system. Quantified by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> approaches, the mode is calculated qualitatively and quantitatively, then gain the levels of teaching quality evaluation. Matlab (a numerical computing environment and fourth generation programming language) is also used for experiments, in order to form a scientific and objective appraise, apply and spread the model.

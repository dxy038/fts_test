Genetic algorithms (GAs) are widely used in the optimization of electromagnetic devices. However, if finite element analyses are needed for the evaluation of the objective function, GAs require a long computation time. They also need a difficult tuning session before starting optimization, to select the best configuration of the parameters that control the algorithm. This paper proposes a universal choice of the GA parameters in order to spare the designer the tuning session and to reduce the computing time for the whole procedure

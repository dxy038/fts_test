According to the needs of simulation research of human riding comfort for vehicle vibration in dynamic environment, the mathematical model of random road is established using white noise. The model has been subsequently introduced into Matlab/Simulink to simulate several different incentive forms of random road, and the time-domain model of random road excitation-according with Chinese Highway Standard is developed. Moreover, vehicle dynamics model is set up in dynamics analysis software ADAMS, and human biological structure model-coincident with Chinese body characteristics is done alike in ADAMS/LifeMOD. These two models are assembled to construct a biomechanical simulation model of human-vehicle system. Aimed to get vertical vibration response of vehicle and human at different speeds and different road levels, the biomechanical simulation model of human-vehicle system is imitatively analyzed by introduction of random road excitation model. Furthermore, an evaluation study on human riding comfort for vehicle vibration in dynamic environment is presented on the basis of national standard GB/T4970. The objective evaluation test on human vibration comfort is carried out on random vibration platform SA30-S802/ST, the experimental results showed that the results of the objective evaluation test basically tally with the simulation results. The research above provides an important method for the design and analysis of vehicle man-machine interface in dynamic environment and has important technical significance for rapid evaluation of human driving comfort.

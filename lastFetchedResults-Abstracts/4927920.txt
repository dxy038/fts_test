The objective of this work was to research antenna design for 2.4 GHz wireless sensor nodes on aircraft and the impact of manufacturing tolerances on antenna performance. In this paper, we present the broadside radiator that was designed using an air cavity embedded in the multi-layer laminate with back-side metal cladding. The use of an air cavity enabled a low cost, low profile design of a rectangular patch antenna with 90 MHz of bandwidth.

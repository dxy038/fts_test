This paper introduces a decentralised negotiation algorithm, where multiple distributed decision makers can propose and refine future decisions to optimise a common team objective function. Based on theoretical convergence results, a practical algorithm is developed. The information requirements of the system, that is, what is each platform required to know, are examined and a scalable cooperative control algorithm proposed. This is applied to the control of a reconnaissance or information gathering task consisting of multiple UAVs.

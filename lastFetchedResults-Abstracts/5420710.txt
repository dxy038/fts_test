The increased use of automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) is creating the need for computerized control algorithms to support the scheduling and picking decisions. This research addresses an order picking problem in a multi-aisle automated warehouse, in which a stack crane performs storage and retrieval operations, and each item can be found in several storage locations. Our objective is to propose algorithms that minimize the total time traveled by the stack crane to complete the retrieval process of orders. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) can calculate the shortest distance between cities, order picking problem of the automated warehouse and the TSP are similar. In this paper, we use recursive algorithm to solve order picking problem. The experiment proved that the order picking optimization of the stacker systems will be of great significance for the RS to improve its efficiency. Finally, the recursive algorithm has been applied to practice.

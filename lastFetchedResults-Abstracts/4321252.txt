In view of the practical problems in hybrid multi-attribute decision-making, a method based on vague sets is proposed. Firstly, the qualitative and quantitative indicator values described by linguistic variables and exact numbers respectively are transformed into vague values. Secondly, a model of hybrid multi-objective decision making based on vague sets is put forward. Thirdly a novel comprehensive evaluation index is proposed, by which the meaning of &#8220;which is closest to PIS (Positive Ideal Solution) and farthest from NIS (Negative Ideal Solution)&#8221; is expressed and the concrete steps of hybrid multi-attribute decision making on vague sets is given. Finally, the proposed method is applied into a case study and the result proves the method is effective.

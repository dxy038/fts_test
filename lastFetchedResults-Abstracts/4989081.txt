This paper presents an efficient variant based particle swarm optimization algorithm with time varying acceleration coefficients (TVAC) to solving the multi objective optimal reactive power flow (ORPF). In this study two objective functions (power loss and voltage deviation) are considered and optimized separately and simultaneously in coordination with series FACTS device. The proposed strategy tested on IEEE 57-Bus, results compared with many variants based standard PSO confirm the efficiency of this proposed variant in term of solution quality and convergence.

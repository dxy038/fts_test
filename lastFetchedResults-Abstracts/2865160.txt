We consider a downlink OFDMA in which users may have different rate requirements and a base station would like to maximize user rate over subcarrier assignment (SA) and power allocation (PA). To attain that objective, we propose suboptimal chunk-based SA and PA algorithms that are less complex and perform better than existing suboptimal schemes. Numerical results show that in certain example the proposed SA and PA can provide user rate up to 98.6% of the optimum rate obtained from a joint SA and PA problem.

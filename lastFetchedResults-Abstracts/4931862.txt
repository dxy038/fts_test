This paper describes TOPGEN, a collaborative project for the demonstration of research results in the field of advanced control and optimization of a power plant. The project is partially funded by the European ESPRIT programme. In TOPGEN, several related technologies are being jointly tested on a 200 MW generating unit of Ballylumford Power Station, Northern Ireland. The objective is to provide operational and engineering recommendations for plant adjustments, in order to achieve performance improvements, during steady-state and fault-free conditions, given a set of exploitation constraints. Thus, the expected result is a software system, fully installed at Ballylumford Power Plant, which will improve the performance of the plant, reducing the amount of fuel necessary to obtain the electrical power required. This system will work online, continuously receiving data from the process

Capacity Factor (CF) is a convenient, dimensionless quantity, which connects rated power of a wind turbine to the actual amount of energy that the wind turbine can deliver. In mathematical form, CF is the ratio of average power to rated power. Before a wind turbine is being installed, it would be useful to estimate how high the CF of the wind turbine would be when it is operating. A high capacity factor would mean that the wind turbine is driving much of its energy in the flat region of the power curve above the rated wind speed. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a study conducted to develop a simple and linear model for estimating the capacity factor of wind turbines in terms of average wind speed of the site.

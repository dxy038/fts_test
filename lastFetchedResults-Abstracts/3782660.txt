The robust control problem for linear systems with parameter uncertainties and time-varying delays is examined. By using an appropriate uncertainty description, a linear state-feedback control law is found, ensuring the closed-loop system\Â´s stability and a performance measure, in terms of the guaranteed cost. A linear matrix inequality objective minimization approach allows to determine the "optimal" choice of free parameters in the uncertainty description, leading to the minimal guaranteed cost

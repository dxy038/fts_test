Background: The measurement of follicular output rate (FORT) has been proposed as a
good indicator for evaluating follicular response to the exogenous recombinant folliclestimulating
hormone (rFSH). This places FORT as a promising qualitative marker for
ovarian function. The objective of the study was to determine FORT as a predictor of
oocyte competence, embryo quality and clinical pregnancy after intracytoplasmic sperm
injection (ICSI).
Materials and Methods: This prospective study was carried out on a group of infertile
females (n=282) at Islamabad Clinic Serving Infertile Couples, Islamabad, Pakistan,
from June 2010 till August 2013. Down- regulated females were stimulated in
injection gonadotropins and on ovulation induction day, pre-ovulatory follicle count
(PFC) was determined using transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVUS), and FORT was
determined as a ratio of PFC to antral follicle count (AFC)Ã—100. Group I consisted of
females with a negative pregnancy test, while group II had a positive pregnancy test
that was confirmed with the appearance of fetal cardiac activity. Linear regression
analyses of categorical variables of clinical pregnancy along with other independent
variables, including FORT, were performed using SPSS version 15.0.
Results: Pregnancy occurred in 101/282 women who were tested, recording a clinical
pregnancy rate of about 35.8%. FORT values were higher in group II as compared to
group I females (P=0.0001). In multiple regression analysis, 97.7, 87.1, 78.2, and 83.4%
variations were explained based on the number of retrieved oocytes per patients, number
of metaphase II oocytes retrieved, number of fertilized oocytes, and number of cleaved
embryos, respectively, indicating FORT as an independent predictor.
Conclusion: FORT is a predictor of oocyte competence in terms of a number of retrieved,
mature and fertilized oocytes. It also gives information about the number of cleaved embryos
and clinical pregnancy rate.

ABB is planning to offer variations of a deltapod robot, which is often used as part for automotive fixturing. Due to the different application requirements of each customer, there exists no one optimal parameter set for this kind of structure. With such a large number of possible solutions, it is necessary to support the engineers in the selection of suitable parameter values. The objective of the configuration concept is to develop a software tool which finds a parameter configuration depending on the specific customer application in a minimum of time.

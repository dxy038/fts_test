For the characteristics of distribution network, a mathematical model based on chance constrained programming (CCP) is given, and an algorithm of stochastic simulation´s particle swarm optimization is put forward to figure out the reactive power compensation capacity, the model´s objective function is to minimize cost, considering the characteristics of distribution network and non-active power characteristics and trends of distribution network processing methods. Use MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation of a distribution network reactive power, voltage, power factor changes, the method of the paper studies the optimization of reactive power compensation, the results show that the simulation model and algorithm is reasonable and effective.

Monitoring and evaluation are the base work for environment protection and management. Maps are the most directly and lucid measure to represent and record geographic environment. As a result, By overlaying maps with different ages and processes of geographic change can be quantitative analyzed and should provides long-term scale, on the other hand, satellite image can be use for short-term investigation to know the wetland change which cause by hazard event. It is shown in this study that local spatial autocorrelation should provide objective classification in training stage, and the spatial autocorrelation also can enhance the pattern of vegetation and water body on image.

Defined breeding objectives and selection criteria may never be practiced unless the
farmer’s perceptions and ideals areaccommodated. Finding selection criteria that are widely
accepted and implemented is a daunting task that requires considerable time and full
interaction between scientists and the farmers. A survey was conducted to investigate the
breeding objectives and selection criteria adopted by breeders representing different goat
breeds and to determine the factors that affect the breeders’ decisions. The importance of
breeding objectives to farmers in Jordan was to increase goat performance by adoption of
both objective and subjective selection criteria. However, results showed that many of the
goat breeders used subjective more than objective selection criteria. Different factors of
goat selection were reviewed to ensure that the selection criteria meet the breeding objectives
of the farmers. Furthermore, the factors that foster emphasis on doe/buck selection
criterion were discussed to achieve the breeding objectives. It is essential that extension
strategies to promote use of objective goat breeding criteria to farmers are put in place. In
addition, further extension of subjective selection aswell as its impact on achieving defined
breeding objectives is required in order to increase farmer awareness of its effectiveness

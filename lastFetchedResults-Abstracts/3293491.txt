The electro-larynx device (EL) offers the possibility to re-obtain speech when the larynx is removed after a total laryngectomy. Speech produced with an EL suffers from inadequate speech sound quality, therefore there is a strong need to enhance EL speech. When disordered speech is applied to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, the performance will significantly decrease. ASR systems are increasingly part of daily life and therefore, the word accuracy rate of disordered speech should be reasonably high in order to be able to make ASR technologies accessible for patients suffering from speech disorders. Moreover, ASR is a method to get an objective rating for the intelligibility of disordered speech. In this paper we apply disordered speech, namely speech produced by an EL, on an ASR system which was designed for normal, healthy speech and evaluate its performance with different types of adaptation. Furthermore, we show that two approaches to reduce the directly radiated EL (DREL) noise from the device itself are able to increase the word accuracy rate compared to the unprocessed EL speech.

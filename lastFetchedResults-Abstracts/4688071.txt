In order to present a feasible evaluation system for logistics centre design and help the actual project decision, this paper established a quantitative and multi-level evaluation indices system of logistics center designs, created a combination evaluation model based on hierarchical structure, used efficacy coefficient method to standardize the indices values of different dimensions, adopted the subjective and objective integrated method of weighting coefficient, and provided an evaluation model solving method of from-bottom-to-top. At last, an actual project was showed as example to interpret the feasibility of the methods above, which obtain a good expected effect.

Recent advances in the time domain methods have led to many new approaches in filter bank designs. The objective of this paper is to derive a unified theory for these time domain methods, based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Topics discussed in this paper include two-channel filter banks, M-channel filter banks and 2-D filter banks. Design examples are presented to demonstrate the theory.

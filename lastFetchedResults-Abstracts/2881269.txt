Network reconfiguration, shunt capacitors, and distributed generators are less expensive options to distribution system expansion. The study of simultaneous use of network reconfiguration, optimal capacitor placement, and optimal distributed generator siting has been limited to the investigation of only two objectives, without regard to the conflicts among the system objectives. This study optimizes three system objectives - power loss minimization, voltage stability improvement, and line loading reduction - by simultaneously performing network reconfiguration with capacitor and distributed generator placement. A new and fast method of multi-objective optimal planning, which can also be applied to real-time system operations, is implemented in this study. Elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and fuzzy decision making analysis is used to obtain the best system configuration with simultaneous installation of capacitors and distributed generators. Test cases reveal that, despite conflicts in the objectives, systems perform best when the implemented plan utilizes all three options. Network reconfiguration following the outage of a capacitor or distributed generator is proven to reverse the decline in, or achieve better, system performance.

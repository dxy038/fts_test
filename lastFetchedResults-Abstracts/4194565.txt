The aim of this paper is to propose a second order sliding mode controller for a brake system. The main objective of the controller is to induce anti-lock feature by means of tracking the slip rate of the wheel, ensuring a shorter distance in the braking process and improving the vehicle safety. The closed-loop system is robust in presence of external disturbances and parameter variations. To show the performance of the proposed design, a simulation study is carried on, where results show good performance of the antilock-brake system.

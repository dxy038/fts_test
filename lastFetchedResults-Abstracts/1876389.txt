Objective
rpose of this study was to document the impact of waiting for first-time elective coronary angiography (CA) on patients' anxiety and health-related quality of life (HRQL).

pective, observational inception cohort pretest and posttest design was used.
g
udy was conducted in a tertiary community cardiac center in Toronto, Canada.
es
e-specific HRQL was measured using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire at baseline (Time 1 [T1]) and 1 week before CA (Time 2 [T2]). The association between time on the waiting list and subjects' perceived anxiety was analyzed.
s
-sample t tests comparing mean anxiety levels at T1 and T2 indicated a statistically significant increase in anxiety levels at T2 that did not seem to be related to the waiting time for CA (P = .000). Comparison of mean Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores at T1 and T2 indicated a trend toward deterioration in HRQL over time.
sions
g for elective CA may have a negative impact on patients' psychologic status and HRQL. Nursing and clinical interventions to reduce anxiety and improve HRQL are indicated for this population.

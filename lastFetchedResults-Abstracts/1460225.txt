The objective of the present work was to study the influence of some reaction parameters (temperature, chemical nature of pre-treatment gas, mass catalyst) on the yield of methane reforming with carbon dioxide on Ni (5%)–Ca (1%)/AC at atmospheric pressure. The obtained results show that the best system was pre-treated under He flow at 650 °C and then following the reaction at the same temperature. It was also detected that Ca plays a co-support role inhibiting the deactivation of catalyst at long periods of reaction. It can be concluded that it is possible to employ activated carbon as support for methane dry reformation obtaining representative methane conversions up to 40% at mild experimental conditions.

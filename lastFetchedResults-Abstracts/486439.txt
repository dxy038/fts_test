Background: The medicinal use of onion dates back to ancient China and India. Men with epilepsy have reduced fertility, and antiepileptic drugs may affect semen quality. Disturbances of reproductive endocrine hormones are more often found in men with epilepsy than in the general population. There is an ongoing debate whether this can be attributed to chronic use of antiepileptic drugs or to the epilepsy itself. 
Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the beneficial degree of sexual behavior in male rats after inducement onion in lamotrigine receiving groups. 
Methods: Forty wistar rats, randomized into four groups (n = 10), were used for this study, five of them male and five of them female. Animals in Group A served as the control and was drinking distilled water. Animals in Groups B: treated with 3cc/rat of onion juice, in Groups C: received10mg/kg/day lamotrigine, in Groups D: received10mg/kg/day lamotrigine plus 3cc/rat of onion juice. In All treatments were for 5 weeks. 48 hours before end of study estradiol benzoate (25 micro gr/kg/day, s.c.) and 6 hours before end of study progesterone 0.3muM were injected. 
Results: Results showed the percentage of erections and couplings and serum testosterone in onion treated groups were significantly increased (p<0/01) when compared to other groups. onion and its constituents are stated to has antioxidant. Enhanced oxidative stress and changes in antioxidant capacity are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis in diseases. 
Conclusion: These findings lead to the conclusion that onion significantly lowered the adverse effects of lamotrigine, and can do beneficial effect on sexual behavior in male rat.

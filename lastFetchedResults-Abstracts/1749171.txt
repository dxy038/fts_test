The application of the hidden Markov models (HMMs) is attempted for revealing key features for the earthquake generation which are not accessible to direct observation. Considering that the states of the HMM correspond to levels of the stress field, our objective is to identify these states. The observations are considered after grouping earthquake magnitudes and the cases of different number of states are examined. The problems of HMMs theory are solved and the ensuing HMMs are compared on the basis of Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. A new insight on the evaluation of future seismic hazard is given by calculating the mean number of steps for the first visit to a particular state, along with the respective variance. We further calculate an estimator of the mean number of steps for the first visit to a particular state and we construct its confidence interval. Additionally, a second approach to the problem is followed by assuming a different determination of observations. The HMMs applied to both approaches, contribute significantly to seismic hazard assessment via revealing the number of the stress levels as well as the way in which these levels are associated with certain earthquake occurrence.

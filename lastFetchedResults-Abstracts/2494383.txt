Background and objective: Adolescents and youth are the most vulnerable groups concerning tobacco use. The present study was performed to determine predictors of intention and preventive behaviors of tobacco use among students based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) constructs.

Materials and methods:  An analytic, cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 students of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences in 2013. Stratified sampling was used to select the participants. In order to collect the data, a validated and reliable questionnaire was designed based on the TPB. Participants fill out the questionnaire in a self-reporting form. Data were entered in SPSS 20 and analyzed by descriptive and analytic statistics, Spearman s correlation coefficient and logistic regression model.

Results: The students  attitude and perceived behavioral control predicted 41% of the variations of their behavioral intention. Meanwhile, the perceived behavioral control could predict 32% of the participants  behavioral variation. There were significant correlations between the participants  attitude and their behavioral intention, the participants  perceived behavioral control and their behavioral intention, as well as between perceived behavioral control of the students and their behavior of tobacco use (p  <  0.001).

Conclusion: The students  perceived behavioral control would be a strong predictor for their intention to use tobacco and the students  preventative performance of tobacco use.

Introduction: The medical and public health communities advocate the use of immunization registries as one tool to achieve national goals for immunization. Despite the considerable investment of resources into registry development, little information is available about the costs of developing or maintaining a registry.
Methods:
The objective of this study was to measure the direct costs of maintaining one immunization registry. Cost and resource-use data were collected by interviewing registry personnel and staff at participating pediatric practices, collecting available financial records, and direct observation.
Results: The estimated direct cost for maintaining the registry during the 3 calendar years 1995 through 1997 was $439,232. In 1997, this represented an annual cost of $5.26 per child immunized whose record was entered into the registry. In all years, personnel expenses represented at least three fourths of the total costs, with the majority of administrative effort donated. Yearly costs increased over time largely because of growing administrative personnel requirements as the registry became fully operational.
Conclusion: Considerable resources are required to establish and maintain immunization registries. Because personnel costs, particularly nontechnical personnel, represent a large portion of total registry costs, it is important to accurately account for donated effort. Recommendations for future registry cost studies include prospective data collection and focusing upon the costs of providing specific outreach or surveillance functions rather than overall registry costs. In addition, registry effectiveness evaluations are needed to translate registry costs into cost-effectiveness ratios.

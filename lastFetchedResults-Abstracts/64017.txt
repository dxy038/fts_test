The objective of this paper is to present an analytic element formulation for groundwater flow in multiaquifer systems. Analytic element equations are presented for wells, line-sinks, and circular infiltration areas. Each analytic element is a solution to the governing system of differential equations, and thus simulates the leakage between aquifers exactly; the head, discharge, and leakage may be computed analytically at any point in the aquifer. Superposition of these analytic elements allows for the simulation of regional multiaquifer flow. A hypothetical example is presented of a system with three aquifers, a river network, and three pumping wells. It is demonstrated that the leakage between aquifers may vary significantly over short distances and that each aquifer has its own water divide.

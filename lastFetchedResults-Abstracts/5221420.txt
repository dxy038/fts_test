Unmanned underwater vehicles have various missions within civilian, military and academic sectors. They have the ability to explore areas unavailable to manned assets and to perform duties that are risky to humans. In particular, UUVs have the ability to perform bearings-only tracking in shallow areas near shorelines. This article compares a Logarithmic Polar Coordinates EKF (LPC-EKF) and Logarithmic Polar UKF (LPC-UKF) for the estimation problem. Its objective is to track the kinematics (position, velocity and course) of a moving target using noise-corrupted bearing measurements.

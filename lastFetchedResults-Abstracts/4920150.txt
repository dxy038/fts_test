In this document, topology control of a large-scale, wireless network by a distributed algorithm that uses only locally available information is presented. Topology control algorithms adjust the transmission power of wireless nodes to create a desired topology. The algorithm, named local power adjustment (LPA), does not rely on information about a nodeÂ´s position, and uses only two local broadcast messages per node to complete. The two objectives of the algorithm are minimizing the maximal and average power used by the nodes for the wireless transmissions. Additionally, the constraint of keeping the entire network connected by bidirectional communication links is imposed.

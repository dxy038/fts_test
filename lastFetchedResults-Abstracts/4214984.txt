In this paper, Krein space robust filtering for fine alignment on the moving base for Strap-down Inertial Navigation System (SINS) is proposed. The state modeling of SINS with parameter uncertainty is established. The system uncertainty is described through Sum Quadratic Constraint (SQC) which leads to optimization problem of an objective deterministic quadratic form. To handle the optimization, the corresponding formal stochastic system in Krein space is established according to the quadratic form, then the priori and the posteriori estimation recursions of Krein space linear estimation to fine alignment for SINS with time-varying bias is given. Finally, the simulation shows the property of proposed method.

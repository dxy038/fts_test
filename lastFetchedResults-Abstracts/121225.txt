BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non Stress Test (NST) is the most common test before delivery that is done in some eases with probability of fetal distress. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of NST in cases with complaint of decreased fetal movement or decrease of amniotic fluid volume according to sonography report.
METHODS: This cross- sectional study was done on 120 women referred to Bahonar hospital in Kerman. It was performed on all pregnant women with gestational age of 38-42 who complained of decrease of fetal movement (84.2%) and a decrease of amniotic fluid volume (61%) was reported in their sonography.
FINDINGS: The, result of NST in 64.1% of patients was nonreactive and in 35.9% was reactive. 41.7% of cases were with fetal distress during labor or delivery, of which 94.1% had nonreactive NST. The sensitivity and specificity of NST in cases with decrease of amniotic fluid were 89% and 74.5%, respectively and in cases with complaint of decreased fetal movement were 63.4% and 32%, respectiviely.
CONCLUSION: Exact heart rate monitor in cases with complaint of decreased fetal movement or amniotic fluid volume and also with nonreactive NST is necessary.

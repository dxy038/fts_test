Background and Objective: One of the air pollutants is volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Benzene, as a part of petrol, is a VOC, known to be carcinogenic to human beings (Group 1) and it has widespread application in&nbsp; various industries and professions. Hence, the aim of the present study was semi-quantitative and quantitative health risk assessment of petrol bank workers exposure to benzene via inhalation in the Tehran, Iran.

Material and method: For these purpose, this descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in three stages. First stage consisted of measurement of benzene in two groups of participants: (1) petrol bank workers and (2) non-exposed people as control group. The second stage included the evaluation of worker's exposure to benzene and semi-quantitative risk assessment, and the third stage was estimating the lifetime cancer risk caused by exposure to benzene.

Results: Benzene mean concentration was near the threshold limit value (1600 &micro;g/m3) and the mean benzene personal air level was 1527&plusmn;246.4 &micro;g/m3 in the petrol bank areas. With regard to semi-quantitative risk assessment method, benzene introduced as the most hazardous chemical with risk ratio of 4.5 has 5th rank in risk levels (Extremely dangerous). Lifetime cancer risk estimation showed that in petrol bank workers the excess lifetime cancer risk was 27.5 times higher than unexposed group and the chance of cancer was one in a 1000 petrol bank workers.

Conclusion: This study indicates that petrol bank workers in Tehran have a potentially high cancer risk through inhalation exposure. Thus, preventative actions regarding to this hazardous and carcinogenic chemical must be started as soon as possible.

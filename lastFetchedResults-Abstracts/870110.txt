The treatment of mail objects in a mail processing centre involves many operations, in particular sorting by destination. Out of the batching problem that we can identify in such a process, there are also staff planning concerns. In this paper, we analyse a treatment area (registered mail) belonging to a mail processing center, where mail objects are treated in a chain production process. The production quantities and the transfer amounts among machines are required to be determined along the daily work period. The objective is to minimize the costs with human resources needed in the process, linked with the lotsizing production plan, by matching staff to work requirements. This leads into a lotsizing and workforce problem, for which we propose an integer programming formulation. A case study of a particular treatment area is also discussed. The formulation is adjusted to the specific constraints of this case study and some computational results are included, considering average, small and high daily amounts of mail arrived to that particular treatment area.

Two permanent pastures (annual pasture v. perennial pasture) were established in 1992 as part of the long-term field experiment, MASTER - Managing Acid Soils Through Efficient Rotations. The primary objective of the experiment was to develop an agricultural system that is economically viable and environmentally sustainable on the highly acidic soils in south-eastern Australia. This paper reports on the effects of lime on the botanical composition changes of annual and perennial pastures over 9 years. In general, lime increased the proportion of the desirable species, such as phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) in perennial pasture and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) in annual pastures, and decreased the proportion of the undesirable species, such as Vulpia spp., in both annual and perennial pastures, ultimately improving the quality of feed-on-offer to animals. As a result, the limed pastures carried 24% more sheep than the unlimed pastures, while maintaining individual animal performance similar for both limed and unlimed pastures. The phalaris-based perennial pasture was more stable in terms of maintaining the sown species than the annual pasture. Lime improved the persistence of phalaris and the longevity of the phalaris-based pasture should be at least 10 years. Lime changed the direction of plant succession of annual pastures. Without lime, Vulpia spp. gradually became more dominant while ryegrass and subterranean clover became less dominant in annual pastures. With lime, barley grass (Hordeum leporinum) gradually invaded the sward at the expense of ryegrass, thus reducing the benefits of lime, but this effect was less for the perennial pastures than for annual pastures. Liming perennial pastures should be more beneficial than liming annual pastures because of the beneficial effects on pasture composition. In addition, previously published work reported that liming perennial pastures improved sustainability through better use of water and nitrogen.

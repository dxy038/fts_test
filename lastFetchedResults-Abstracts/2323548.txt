S?ren Kierkegaard was one of the most influential Christian philosophers and theologians in the nineteenth century. The relationship between faith and rationality in Kierkegaardâ€™s thought is a very important topic for many contemporary theologians and philosophers. He, with a particular interpretation of faith, tried to show that faith is a passion and subjective truth, conflicting with objective categories and intellectual arguments. On the one hand, he attempted to prove that faith is beyond reason and in conflict with it, on the other hand. Using three arguments; the approximation argument, the postponement argument, and the passion argument, he asserts these two claims. This article seeks to answer two central questions about the relationship of faith and rationality in Kierkegaard's thought: First, on what basis Kierkegaard proves that faith is beyond reason and in conflict with it? Second, is Kierkegaard's view on the matter of faith and reason justified and acceptable?

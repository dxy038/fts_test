This work studies the effects of the prefilter bandwidth on the carrier wave phase synchronizers. We consider three different prefilter bandwidths namely B1= &#8734;(infinite), B2=2.tx and B3=1.tx, where tx is the transmission rate. We consider also four carrier wave phase synchronizers, namely, the analog (ana), the hybrid (hib), the combinational (cmb), and the sequential (seq). The objective is to study the prefilter bandwidth with the four carrier synchronizers and to evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) as function of the input SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio).

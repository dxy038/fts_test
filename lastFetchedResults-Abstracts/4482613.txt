Since E-Commerce (EC) is rapidly emerging in different industries with various forms, A comprehensive and efficient evaluation criterion is necessary for comparison and improvement of EC. This paper develops a conceptual framework and quantitative method for evaluating web-based EC applications. First, Based on work flow of EC, it establishes a specified four-part model which consists of sellers, transaction platform, logistics and buyers. Then the key factor in each part is critically examined in terms of factual conditions. Second, a research method, which can convert qualitative analysis into quantitative index, is invited for further constructing evaluation framework. Third, The conceptual framework of evaluating e-commerce is built on the basis of former key factor analysis, which includes three levels from the top to the bottom, namely objective level, evaluating level and factor level. Accompany with the method invited, A comprehensive and measurable model is established for evaluating EC. Finally, it concludes how to evaluate the web-based EC and discusses the key factor varies with different EC forms.

This paper seeks to consolidate in one place several diverse articles and contributions, with the objective of emphasizing the coming importance of step motors in the field of control engineering. Main topics include the theory of operation of the synchronous inductor motor, its performance characteristics, an improvement in the derivation of the transfer function for a generalized step motor, and a review of the current status of step motors.

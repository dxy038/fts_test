The Hypervelocity Launcher Product Office of the US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command has completed the first field experiment for the Hypervelocity Weapon System (NVWS). The HVWS is being developed as a cost-effective, bottom-tier element of the overall Theater Missile Defense (TMD) architecture. The HVWS is C-130 transportable and will complement the total spectrum of TMD assets. The objective of the overall field experiment is to assess the suitability of the HVWS technology to meet the requirements for TMD and Air Defense (AD) missions. To achieve this objective, program effort is focused on resolution of four key HVWS issues: interceptor launch survivability, fire control tracking accuracy, interceptor guidance to intercept, and intercept lethality. Intermediate field experiments will assess the launch survivability, guidance and control issues of the D2 interceptor, and the tracking accuracy of the fire control system. The final field experiment is planned to culminate in the intercept of a SCUD-type target as well as other TMD and AD targets. This paper presents a summary of the results of the first field experiment, which was conducted at the US Army Hellfire Range on Eglin AFB, FL. The specific objectives of an approach used for the field experiments are discussed. Descriptions of the HVWS subsystem technologies employed during the FY93 experiments are presented along with discussions of the experimental results in the key HVWS issue areas

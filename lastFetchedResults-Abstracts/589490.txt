Objective: The present paper examines the role of epistemology in researches conducted in the field of library and information science (LIS).
Methodology: A literature survey method was employed
Findings: To present and outline a philosophy for librarianship, one needs to offer theoretical underpinning and establish philosophical foundations.  Librarianship could address this issue by providing a desired information service using the physical, contextual and social aspects. Outlining LIS philosophy within the framework of creative and comprehensive theories, would require much supporting factors, the most important of which being a thorough study and understanding of philosophy of science from past to present. History and experience attest to the role played by knowledge of developmental course of history and philosophy of science in development of theories and that it could be the pathfinder for librarians and information professionals to find the concourses and branches of the field. It is only in this way that one could adopt constructive and cognizant position vis-Ã -vis the epistemological tension caused by scholars in natural and social sciences and humanities. Through critical thinking the theoretical underpinning of LIS can be strengthened.

Virtual reality involves the creation and experience of environments. Its central objective is to place the participant in an environment that is not normally or easily experienced. This objective is satisfied by establishing a relationship between the participant and the created environment. Accordingly, we developed a three-tiered definition of VR that addresses respectively what VR is, how it is accomplished, and its effect/spl minus/both of VR on the participant and of the participant on the environment. The distinguishing "what" of VR is its extension of the human-computer interface. Engineering discipline requires precise and consistent definitions of each interfaced system. However, despite numerous studies, there are no such definitions of human perceptual systems. We must therefore rely on more qualitative definitions. As a basis for a conceptual VR model, we adopted J.J. Gibson\Â´s descriptions of human perceptual and muscle systems (J.J. Gibson, 1986). The model proposed includes a human model to show the experiential side of VR systems and a technical confection model for the creation of a participatory environment. Together these models define a conceptual VR system from a systems perspective that includes the human participant.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

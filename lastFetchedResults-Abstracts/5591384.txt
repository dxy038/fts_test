The objective of this study is to apply concepts of consumer experience, using qualitative analysis, to construct a new theoretical framework for the housing refurbishment service industry and to adopt confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to verify a consumer experience scale in relation to housing refurbishment. The aim is to explore the factors and relationships among consumer experiences of housing refurbishment services using qualitative and quantitative analyses. Drawing data from semi-structured interviews with 87 consumers, the results demonstrated that the value experience was a new experience created by the housing refurbishment service. This study also offered several relational propositions regarding experience processes and developed a consumer experience scale specific to the housing refurbishment industry. In addition, based on a sample of 601 consumers for quantitative analysis, the results clearly supported the proposed scale of consumer experience in the housing refurbishment industry.

Objective:
Fibroblasts are the main cells of the polyp architecture and play an important role in nasal polyposis through the release of biologically active factors. It has been recently shown that a number of differentiation factors and inflammatory mediators may be involved in nasal polyps growth, but there are not many studies on nasal polyps fibroblast proliferation. In this study, we investigated the influence of Ibuprofen, Nimesulid and Rofecoxib, cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors and Budesonide on the nasal polyps fibroblasts proliferation.
Methods:
Nasal fibroblasts were grown from nasal polyp tissue obtained during usual surgical procedure. Fibroblast proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation.
Results:
Ibuprofen and Nimesulid showed no influence on fibroblast proliferation. Inhibition of fibroblast proliferation was shown by Rofecoxib at a concentration of 10,000 nM and Budesonide at a concentration of 100 nM.
Conclusion:
Proliferation of nasal polyps fibroblasts may be inhibited by Budesonide and a specific COX-2 inhibitor â€“ Rofecoxib.

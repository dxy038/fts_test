Objective: To evaluate AgNOR count, size and pattern in different grades of transitional cell carcinoma.
Design: Descriptive.
Material and Methods: A total of fifty transurethally resected bladder tumour samples (TUR BT) were collected from Mayo Hospital, Lahore and Services Hospital, Lahore and processed for H & E and AgNOR stain. The grading of tumours were made on H&E stain. While AgNOR size, AgNOR count, pAgNOR and AgNOR dispersion were recorded for each case.
Results: The AgNOR size in grade II was predominantly of 2+ while AgNOR size in grade III was predominantly of 3+.A significant higher proportion of cases (p < 0.02) with 3+ AgNOR dispersion were seen in grade III carcinoma.
Conclusion: AgNOR size and AgNOR dispersion were found to be an easy and reproducible alternative to traditional AgNOR counts in grading of transitional cell carcinoma. The demonstration of AgNOR dispersion is also a simple and cost effective procedure.

Introduction & Objective: Pain, rather than any other problems,
would persuade people to pursue remedy and treatment. Muscular
injections are among pain producing factors This technique of
prescription can be followed by some complications from which
pain is the most prevalent one. This study was performed to
compare the pain severity caused by muscular injection of
Tramadole in Z and Bulb methods,
Materials & Methods: This is a clinical trial study in which 90
women who referred to the emergency ward of Shahid Beheshti
hospital in Yasoo] in 2006 were randomly selected. Data collection
instrument was questionnaire. The pain severity was evaluated by
visual scale. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistical method,
independent T and chi square test using SPSS software.
Results: Mean of pain severity in bulb method was 2.B4±1.242
and in Z method was 4.56±1.659. The independent T test
indicated that the differences in pain severity in two injection
methods were statistically significant (p~0.036). No significant
differences were found between age, educational level, job,
rnarriatal status, number of previous injections and BM' of
samples between two groups.
Conclusion: Bulb method injection induces less pain in
comparison with Z method; therefore it is an ideal method for
muscular injections. As such, health care workers, especially
nurses, can, through this method, minimize the patients' pain,
which is one of the most important injection complaints.

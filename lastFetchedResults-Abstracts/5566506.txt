Canoeing is a very competitive sport involving a non-trivial pattern of motion. A group of athletes and coaches approached the authors for aid in quantifying what until today only is qualitative, personal and thereby subjective data. The objective of this work is to present a measurement tool that records paddle and foot stretcher force in a flatwater kayak training situation, i.e. when training on the water. The system facilitates a wireless (Bluetooth) star network link with three sensor nodes and one central unit. Validation data was obtained from a kayak ergometer that is equipped with analysis software. The stroke power obtained from this ergometer system is compared to the force data measured by the presented wireless sensor nodes. We have not been able to find any similar systems that would provide better data for performance analysis.

Power transition constant velocity joint is widely used in the automotive industry. Inner race is one of die power transition joint parts. Conventional method of production is time-consuming with high cost. The main objective in this paper is lo investigate the material flow in precision forging of inner race and to optimize the process using a new tooling concept. In order to define and improve the process conditions, numerical simulation using MSC Super Forge software and physical modeling experiments were performed. To verify simulation results and to investigate material flow, plasticine was used for physical modeling. Results obtained from numerical simulation, are in very good agreement with experimental results

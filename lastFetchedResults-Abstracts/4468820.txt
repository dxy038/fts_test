Economic power dispatch problem plays an important role in the operation of the power systems. It is a method of determine the most efficient, low cost and reliable operation of a power system by dispatching the available electricity generation resources to supply the load on the system. The primary objective of economic dispatch is to minimize the total cost of generation while maintaining the operational constraints of the available generation resources. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization algorithms (PSO) with one of the accelerating coefficients being constant are proposed to solve the economic power dispatch problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is algorithms modeled on swarm intelligence that finds a solution to an optimization problem in a search space, or model and predict social behavior in the presence of objectives. In this study, the proposed technique was tested using the standards IEEE 26-BUS RTS and the results revealed that the proposed technique has the merit in achieving optimal solution for addressing the problems.

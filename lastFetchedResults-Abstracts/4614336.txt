Speckle effect of laser display equipment should be evaluated by objective measurement. An embedded speckle measurement instrument based on linear CCD was designed for the quantified evaluation of the 71 inch laser TV. Comparing the result measured by the instrument based on the linear device with that based on planar device, the agreement was concluded. Analyzing the change of quantified result, the effect of the speckle removal unit is characterized.

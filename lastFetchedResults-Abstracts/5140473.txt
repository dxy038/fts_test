Full characterization of a new DCG-FGT (Dual-Control-Gate Floating-Gate Transistor) transistor model for static and transient simulations is presented. The model is running under electrical simulator (ELDO) and is characterized thanks to ICCAP software. It has been validated on an advanced STMicroelectronics technology. The final objective of this work is to provide an accurate and scalable model available in design framework.

Objective: This was an evaluation of usefulness of bipolar electrocautery scissors for abdominal hysterectomy. Study Design: Fifty women with uterine fibromatosis underwent abdominal hysterectomy: 25 randomly selected patients were operated on with conventional technique and the other 25 patients were operated on with bipolar electrocautery scissors. In both groups operating time, number of ligations, and blood loss were assessed. Data were compared by analysis of variance and Ï‡2 test as appropriate. Results: In the bipolar group the average operating time was 25% shorter than in the conventional group (P< .01), and the number of ligations and the amount of blood loss were significantly reduced (P< .01). There was no increase in the complication rate. Conclusions: Bipolar electrocautery scissors were confirmed to be safe and useful for open surgery by reducing the operating time and blood loss without increasing postoperative morbidity. Thus their use would lower the cost of surgery. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:396-9.)

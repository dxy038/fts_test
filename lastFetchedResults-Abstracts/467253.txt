Objective: Our purpose was to determine whether administering the anti-inflammatory agent ketorolac after abdominal myomectomy reduces the incidence of febrile episodes. Study Design: This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical investigation compared administering ketorolac 15 mg intravenously every 6 hours beginning in the recovery room with saline solution administered in the same regimen in 122 patients undergoing abdominal myomectomy in a large, urban academic medical center. The primary outcome was fever >101.0°F in the postoperative period. Results were analyzed by χ2 analysis, independent samples t test, and logistic regression. Results: Data were analyzed on 112 patients, with 56 in the treatment group and 56 in the placebo group. After confounding factors were controlled with logistic regression, the data revealed a statistically significant reduction in febrile episodes in the ketorolac-treated group (27%) compared with the saline solution-treated group (41%) (P = .04). Conclusion: Treatment with ketorolac after abdominal myomectomy results in a statistically significant reduction in the rate of febrile episodes. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:1450-5.)

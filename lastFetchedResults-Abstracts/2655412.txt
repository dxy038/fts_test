 Background Early childhood caries (ECC) is one of the most
                            frequent chronic diseases among infants and preschool-aged children.
                            Objectives Our objective was to determine an association between
                            umbilical cord blood 25(OH)D level and early childhood caries. Methods
                            This prospective cohort study was conducted at Near East University
                            (NEU) Medical hospital in Cyprus during 2013-2016. All pregnant women
                            followed by NEU gynecology and obstetrics clinic were invited to
                            participate in the study. Cord blood serum samples were collected after
                            birth and analyzed for 25(OH)D levels. Infants underwent dental
                            examinations, and questionnaire information was gathered from parents of
                            infants between 1 and 2 years of age. Results Among 120 deliveries, 90
                            mothers accepted to participate and supply cord blood. 40 of them were
                            excluded; therefore, 50 toddlers were recruited to participate (mean age
                            20.2 ± 3.1 months, male/female: 23/27) and all of them attended the
                            dental and questionnaire evaluations related to participants aged 1 - 2
                            years. Cord blood 25(OH)D level (mean: 25.6 ± 11.6 ng/mL) was found to
                            be seriously low in 12%, low in 20%, deficient in 28%, and optimal in
                            40%. 34% of the infants had ECC. Oral hygiene habits and low cord blood
                            level of 25(OH)D were significantly associated with the development of
                            ECC (P = 0.039 and P = 0.002, respectively). Logistic regression
                            analysis revealed that lower cord blood 25(OH)D level was significantly
                            associated with ECC (P = 0.007). Discussion This study demonstrated the
                            impact of low neonatal 25(OH)D level on the development of ECC. Based on
                            these results, it can be suggested that measuring 25(OH)D levels of
                            mothers during pregnancy can help maintain an optimal maternal and
                            offspring vitamin D level, thereby protecting the infant’s dental
                            health.

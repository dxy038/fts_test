In this paper, we propose several distributed zone partitioning schemes for content-addressable networks (CAN), that is known as a pure peer-to-peer system based on the distributed hash table (DHT). The main objective of the proposed schemes is to balance the load of nodes in the CAN system, in such a way that every node receives almost the same number of inquiries from the other nodes in the system. The result of simulations implies that, by using the proposed schemes instead of a randomized scheme originally implemented in the CAN system, we could reduce the response time for each inquiry to less than 75%.

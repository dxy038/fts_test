This paper considers a type of project scheduling problem with objective of minimizing the total cost, in which project activities have fuzzy duration times and loan is taken into account in the total cost. According to some optimization goal, a fuzzy chance-constrained programming is built to model the project scheduling problem. Moreover, the technique of fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm are integrated to design a hybrid intelligent algorithm to solve the fuzzy model. Finally, a simple numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

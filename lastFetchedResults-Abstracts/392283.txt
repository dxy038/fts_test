Objective: The purpose was to find out whether there is a relationship between the central nervous system involvement and retinopathy in diabetes mellitus. Study Design: In a multidisciplinary clinical study, diabetic patients with and without retinopathy were examined utilising auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing, and the results were interpreted from clinical and pathophysiological point of view. Patients and Methods: Thirty-three diabetic patients with retinopathy (study group) and 20 diabetic patients without retinopathy (control group) were included. Audiometry and ABR testing were made. The results of both groups were compared for ABR parameters. Results: Audimetric results of the study and control groups were similar. In the study group, ABR testing revealed prolonged absolute and interpeak latency of the waves. The difference was significant for Iâ€“III interval (P<0.01). The amplitudes of the waves were similar in both groups and wave V amplitude was significantly diminished in the study group. Abnormal waveforms were recorded by 40 and 12.5% in the study and control groups, respectively. Conclusion: Retinopathy is accompanied with lower brainstem disintegration. Microangiopathy is the possible mechanism that is involved in the occurrence of retinopathy and brainstem neuropathy. ABR can help diagnose retinopathy. Better understanding the role of ABR in diagnosis and early detection of retinopathy in diabetic patients needs further study.

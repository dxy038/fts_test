The utilization of green manures as alternatives to reduce the use of mineral fertilizers is considered a good agricultural practice. However, the effect of each green manure on soil properties and crop yield depends upon its chemical composition. The main objective of this work was to study the effect of incorporating three green manures originating from residues of Trifolium pratense, L. (TP), Brassica napus, L. (BN), and the mixture of TP + BN at rates of 5384 and 8973 kg C ha−1, on soil biological properties (soil microbial biomass-C, soil respiration and soil enzymatic activities), nutrition (leaf N, P and K concentration, pigments and soluble carbohydrate concentrations) and yield parameters of maize (Zea mays cv. Tundra) crop for four years on an Typic Xerofluvent located near Sevilla (Guadalquivir Valley, Andalusia, Spain). All green manures had a positive effect on the soil biological properties, plant nutrition an crop yield parameters, although at the end of the experimental period and at the high organic matter rate, the soil microbial biomass and dehydrogenase, urease, β-glucosidase, phosphatase and arylsulfatase activities increased more significantly in the TP amended soils (79.2%, 92.1%, 93.9%, 99.3%, 87.9% and 96%, respectively) respect to the control soil, followed by TP + BN amended soils (77.3%, 90.9%, 92.8%, 99.1%, 84.4% and 95.7%, respectively) and BN amended soils (76%, 90.1%, 91.7%, 99%, 83.2% and 95.2%, respectively). Since these soil enzymatic activities measured are responsible for important cycles such as C, N, P and S, an increase of leaf N, P an K contents and pigments and soluble carbohydrate contents were highest in TP amended soils, followed by TP + BN and BN treatments. The application of TP in soils at high doses increased the grain protein concentration, number of grains corncob−1 and crop yield 44.6%, 6.3% and 22.1%, respectively, compared with the control soil, followed by TP + BN treatment (41.7%, 5.7% and 20.8%, respectively) and BN treatment (39%, 5.3% and 20%, respectively). The explanation of these results can be a consequence to the different chemical composition of the green manures applied to the soils and its mineralization, aspect controlled by the soil C/N ratio.

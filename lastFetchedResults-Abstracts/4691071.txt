The objective of this work was to develop a robotic apparatus for MR-guided biopsy and therapeutic interventions in the breast. This device facilitates (i) conditioning of the breast, by setting the orientation and degree of compression, (ii) definition of the interventional probe trajectory, by setting the height and angulation of a probe guide and (iii) positioning of an interventional probe, by setting the depth of insertion. The apparatus is fitted with appropriate computer-controlled degrees of freedom for optimal approach for delivering and monitoring interventions with MR-guidance, such as diagnostic or therapeutic trans-cannula or subcutaneous minimally invasive procedures. The entire device is constructed of MR compatible material, i.e. non-magnetic and non-conductive, to eliminate artifacts and distortion of the local magnetic field. The apparatus is remotely controlled by means of ultrasonic actuators and a graphics user interface, providing real-time MR-guided planning and monitoring of the operation

In this paper, we introduce magic surfaces; a novel positioning and networking infrastructure for indoor sensor network applications. To support various kinds of applications, magic surfaces provide positioning, orientation estimation, bidirectional communication and power transmission functions in a contact-less manner by using a magnetic-based technique. This paper describes the design, implementation and performance evaluations of magic surfaces.

Background & Objective: Assessing students' grades in their courses and in national
comprehensive exams may help us in the assessment of educational status of different departments
indirectly. In this study, the internal consistency of medical students' scores in Kerman University
of Medical Sciences was assessed.
Methods: In a historical cohort study, students' grades and other information for entrance years
between 1995 and 2003 were extracted from the central admission office and 10 indicators for
educational achievement were defined for each student. Having used Cronbach's alpha and linear
regression, we checked the internal consistency of scores. Also, we used factorial analysis and
related graphs (Dendrogram) to evaluate the consistency between factors of students' educational
achievement.
Results: Females were more successful in all series of students except for national comprehensive
exams. Although internal consistency in males' scores was more than females'. males' scores in
specific courses of basic sciences were more related to the scores of their basic sciences
comprehensive exams. In addition, internal consistency in males' scores was more than females'
especially in clinical courses. Higher age at entering university could cause a decrease in
educational success. Students' grades in various courses had slight consistency with national
comprehensive exams. Moreover, the internal consistency of scores during clerkship and internship
were significantly lower than the other phases.
Conclusion: Lower consistency of scores in clinical courses may imply lower validity of these
scores. Unlike higher educational success in females. it seems that stability in males' scores was
greater in most indicators.

The objective of the present work, described in this paper, is to synthesize and characterize new conjugated materials with tunable properties, as well as to contribute to a better understanding of their structure and physical properties. This copolymer, derived from poly-phenylene-vinylene (PPV), denoted PPV–ether is amorphous and insoluble in common solvents. It was characterized by infrared absorption (IR), Raman scattering, optical density (OD), gravimetric thermal analysis (GTA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoluminescence. After synthesis and purification the copolymer PPV–ether is obtained with oligomer (F3), a fraction of copolymer, which is soluble. The results of GTA and DTA show that this copolymer is very stable. The IR, Raman scattering, and XPS studies show the good purity of the materials and confirm the proposed structure. The OD and photoluminescence (PL) measurements show that this copolymer can be exploited in optoelectronic applications.

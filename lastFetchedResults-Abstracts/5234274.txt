Electric power is an essential lifeline in mature, as well as, emerging economies. Overhead transmission lines (OHTLs) play a very significant role in the operation of a reliable power delivery system. Because of their physical extent and bold exposure to the elements, OHTLs are vulnerable to a wide variety of failure initiating events. The electric utility industry is in a transient condition brought on by privatisation, deregulation and competition. It is increasingly difficult to obtain the required permitting and funding to build new lines, so utilities are seeking ways to get the most from their existing OHTL assets. One positive approach is to minimize the length of down time following each line failure as much as possible. This objective has led to the development of an emergency restoration system using modular structures. This paper provides an update on the use of this concept

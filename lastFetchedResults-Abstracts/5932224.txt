This paper presents a conventional external scheme for controlling two neighboring static compensators (STATCOMs) from a supervisory level. The two STATCOMs are connected to two buses of a load area in a multimachine power system. The power network analyzed in this paper is a 45-bus 10-generator section of the Brazilian power system. Regulating the voltages at the points of connection to the power system is considered to be the primary objective of the local controllers of the two STATCOMs in this study. Based on the deviations of the voltages with respect to their corresponding reference values, the hierarchical control generates the appropriate signals in the form of the auxiliary reference signals for the line voltage control loops in the two devices. Simulation results are provided to show the proposed external controller improves the performance of the power system during small and large scale disturbances

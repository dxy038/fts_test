The objective of this paper is to present a Predictive Torque Control (PTC) algorithm for controlling system composed by two Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) operating in parallel, fed by a single power inverter. In this system, it is expected that both motors will get the same speed even if they have different conditions of load torque. The principle of PTC algorithm is considered as follows: a model of the system is used to predict the system behavior under a set of configurations of a power inverter, a cost function is built from the predicted values and their references and an optimal algorithm will be solved to find the best configuration to apply to the system in the next time step. Simulation results in Matlab/Simulink indicated that the algorithm (PTC) is well adapted for the synchronism of this system over a wide range of operations.

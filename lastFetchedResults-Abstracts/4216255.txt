The objective of this paper is to present a reliable measurement technique for determining the inter-bar resistance and to provide a comprehensive study of the influence of rotor slot shape, skew, temperature and certain manufacturing techniques on the inter-bar resistance of squirrel cage motors. In order to carry out this study, forty rotors of varying size, slot-type, rotor skew and manufacturing process were provided by a leading motor manufacturer

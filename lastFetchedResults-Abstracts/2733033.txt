In cognitive networks, the cooperative transmission between primary user and secondary user has been regarded as an effective method to promote harmonious coexistence between themselves where how to balance userÂ´s benefits and improve the system throughput is a key issue. In this paper, we study the joint pricing and power allocation strategy for the cognitive relay transmission by using the Stackelberg model which is a classical dynamic game model. We first give presentations of a cognitive relay model over Rayleigh fading channels and then investigate the primary benefits in power saving during this cooperation. According to the profits of primary user (as a game leader) and secondary user (as a follower), corresponding utility functions which describe their overall profits in the cognitive relay transmission are derived one by one. Then, optimal strategies for interference pricing and power allocation are fixed by resolving the objective functions. The existence of the Nash equilibrium and the sufficient conditions for the positive equilibrium are further discussed. Numerical results are presented to show that the algorithm can achieve encouraging outcomes with low-complexity.

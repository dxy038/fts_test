BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with the wide side effect. The herbal medicine has fewer side effects. Numerous references to anti-inflammatory effects of Linum usitatissimum L. have been noted in our traditional medicine. In the present study, anti-inflammatory effects of flaxseed extract has been studied and with anti-inflammatory effects of sodium salicylate was compared.
METHODS: In this experimental study 90 male albino rats (weighing 200?300 gr) were used. Animals were randomly divided into 15 groups (n=6): positive control (sodium salicylate 200 mg/kg i.p.), negative control (DMSO 10%, 10 ml/kg i.p.) and treatment groups received extract (100, 200,400 mg/kg i.p.) in a similar volume. Flaxseed hydroalcholic extract was prepared by maceration. Half an hour after, inflammation was induced by injection (s.c.) 0.1 ml Carrageenan (1% w/v in saline solution) into the hind paw or 0.03 ml xylene behind the ear and or 1 ml ovalbumin (2%) into the hind paw. The paw volume was measured with plethysmometer in 1, 2, and 3 h after the carrageenan (or ovalbumin) injection. In xylene test, 0.03 ml of xylene was injected to the posterior surfaces of the right ear and the weight of two ears after 2 h was also compared.
FINDINGS: The results showed that all doses of Flaxseed hydroalcoholic extract in dose-dependent manner significantly reduced inflammation in both acute and chronic phases in compared with the negative control group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). The extract (400 mg/kg) reduced inflammation in Carrageenan test 56%, the albumin 69%, and xylene 60% when compared with anti-inflammatory effects of sodium Salyslat (50%). 
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that flaxseed extract has significant anti-inflammatory effects but to understand the possible mechanism of this effect, additional research is needed.

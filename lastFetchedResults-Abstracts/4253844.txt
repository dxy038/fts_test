The paper presents a control method of damping low frequency power system oscillations using fuzzy logic based Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) installed in a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) power system. The objective of the Fuzzy Logic based UPFC controller is to damp power system oscillations. UPFC controller based upon amplitude modulation index of shunt converter (exciter) m<sub>E</sub> has been designed. System response with Proportional UPFC controller &amp; Proportional fuzzy logic (using mamdani-type inference) based UPFC controller (PF-UPFC) are compared at variable loading conditions. Respective models have been developed and simulated in Matlab Simulink. The Fuzzy Logic based UPFC controller is designed by selecting appropriate controller parameters based on the knowledge of the power system performance. The results of these studies show that the designed controller has an excellent capability in damping power system oscillations.

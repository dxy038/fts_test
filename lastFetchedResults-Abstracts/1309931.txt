Background: Paraquat (PQ) is a herbicide and exerts its cytotoxicity via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). There is no specific treatment for PQ poisoning.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate of hydroalcoholic ‎ extract Matricaria chamomilla L. (M. chamomilla) ‎‏‏against PQ-induced injury in association with its antioxidant activity.
Methods: The male rats were treated by gastric gavage daily with PQ (5 mg/kg/day) and 
M. chamomilla (50 mg/kg/day) were administered alone or in combination for 7 days. After treatments, in blood sample, lipid peroxidation (LPO), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured.
Results: In this sample, the TAC was lower in the PQ group as compared with control group. PQ increased LPO level, GPx and SOD activities compared control group 
M. chamomilla extract increased TAC and decreased LPO level, GPx and SOD activities compared PQ group. Co-administration of PQ with M. chamomilla extract increased TAC and decreased GPx and SOD activities as compared with PQ group. 
Conclusion: In conclusion, M. chamomilla ‎as natural antioxidant may be considered beneficial for the protection oxidative damage in PQ poisoning.

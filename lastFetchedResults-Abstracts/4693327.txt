PWM rectifiers and inverters can be used in elevator drivers to achieve bidirectional energy flow and thus to save energy. A double-PWM converter is used to develop an elevator energy feedback system. This paper elaborates the mathematical model of the three-phase-voltage-source (VSR) PWM rectifier, the structure of dual-closed-loop control system, the control strategy of the space vector modulation and its realization in the elevator energy feedback system. It also demonstrates the simulation model of the system based on Matlab/Simulink. Finally, parameters in the running experiments are presented showing that the system can stabilize the DC bus voltage while keeping high power-factor either in the rectifier mode or in the inverter mode.

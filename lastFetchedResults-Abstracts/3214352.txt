Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are a collection of wireless nodes that dynamically create a wireless network among themselves without any infrastructure. Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction, and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the simulation of MANET reactive routing protocols that are Ad Hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and temporally ordered routing algorithm (TORA) for Guru Nanak Dev University Campus environment using the High Resolution Video Conferencing application. Comparative analysis has been carried out based on the results obtained by simulations with OFDM (802.11a) and Extended Rate PHY (802.11g) physical characteristics in OPNET Modeler version 14.5. Parameters used are Throughput, End to End delay, Routing load and Media Access Delay.

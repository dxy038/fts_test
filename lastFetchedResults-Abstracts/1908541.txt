Objective
n-sparing surgery has become an accepted treatment technique for renal cell carcinoma in properly selected patients. Although rare, major postoperative hemorrhage can occur and is usually accompanied by gross hematuria with or without acute flank pain at the site of prior surgery. In this retrospective study, the immediate radiologic and clinical success and the long-term follow-up of transcatheter embolization are evaluated.
sion
atheter selective embolization is a safe and effective technique for appropriate management of this postoperative vascular complication.

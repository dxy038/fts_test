The objective of this paper is to describe the implementation of a distributed and coordinated control system for converters in a shipboard distribution system that provides real-time system optimization. Multiple agents take part in the process to determine optimum power sharing for the converters. Optimal power sharing ensures minimum transmission and distribution loss while enforcing constraints such as sourcesÂ´ ramp rates and capacity limits. Other system attributes like Economic Dispatch, Unit Commitment can be added under the same control structure.

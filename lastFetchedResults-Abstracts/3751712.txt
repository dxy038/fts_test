This paper presents a study on electroencephalogram (EEG)-based control of an electric wheelchair. The objective is to control the direction of an electric wheelchair using only EEG signals. In other words, this is an attempt to use brain signals to control mechanical devices such as wheelchairs. To achieve this goal, we have developed a recursive training algorithm to generate recognition patterns from EEG signals. Our experimental results demonstrate the utility of the proposed recursive training algorithm and the viability of accomplishing direction control of an electric wheelchair by only EEG signals.

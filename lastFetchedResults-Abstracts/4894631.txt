The paper presents the multi-objective optimization control strategy of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) under the distorted grid voltage conditions. Based on the mathematical model of DFIG in the positive synchronous reference frame under the distorted grid voltage conditions, the four different control targets are proposed to restrain the harmonic components in stator/rotor current or the ripples in the stator output active/reactive power and electromagnetic torque. Considering that the different control targets are independent and interactional, an enhanced control strategy based on the multi-object particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to ensure the compromising optimization of DFIG operation performance under the harmonically distorted grid voltage. The availability of the proposed control strategy is validated by the simulation of MATLAB/Simulink based on the 2MW DFIG_based wind power generation system.

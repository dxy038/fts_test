Objective: We retrospectively reviewed 21 infections of the spine to correlate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with etiology of spondylodiscitis according to HIV status. Conclusion: MRI allowed the differentiation between tuberculous and pyogenic spondylodiscitis in the chronic stage. Typical findings were not observed in HIV+ as compared with HIVâˆ’ patients, either concerning etiology or characteristic features of the spondylodiscitis.

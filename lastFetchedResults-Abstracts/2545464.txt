Among different approaches of literary criticism, structuralism has a close relationship with the text because a literary work consists of sentences and expressions and the sentencesare per se composed of words. Accordingly, different branches of linguistics are considered as the best instruments for analyzing descriptive aspects of expressions and sentences. The structuralist criticism usually investigates the structure of the work itself instead of investigating affairs such as theme, sense, thought, subjective and objective dimensions. The present study is to investigate the structure of the play Shahrazad using a descriptiveanalytical method. It should be noted that regarding the limited size of the article and the wide scope of the structuralist criticism, the most basic structural concepts are investigated in this play concepts such as main characters, theme, antagonists, protagonists and the setting of the play. The character of Shahrazad is the internal desires of human beings "Abd" is a blackfaced lustful man "Vazir" is a kind righteous person and "Malek" is an ascetic. The interests of these characters to Shahrazad have caused an unknown relationship among them. It is this relationship that gives the characters a symbolic aspect and each of them is a symbol for continuous efforts to understand the unknowns.

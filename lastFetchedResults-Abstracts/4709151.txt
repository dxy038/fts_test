Based on structure first approach, proposed the constraint expressions of blade which have fine structure. On this basis, established a mathematical model for blade geometry based on Structure first approach. As the objective function is non-linear expressions, based on nonlinear programming method, by using fmincon of MATLAB software, solved the objective function and got optimized airfoil blade chord length of all cross-section and pitch angle. Finally compared tne results with the Wilson method.

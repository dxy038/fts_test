Oocyte cryopreservation is an alternative tool in assisted reproductive technology. The
objective of this study was to determine the developmental potential of vitrified goat
oocytes after somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In vitro matured goat oocytes were vitrified
by Cryotop method. The survival rate of vitrified oocytes at 1 h after thawing determined
by fluorescein diacetate staining was 92.1% which was significantly lower than that of fresh
oocytes (99.3%). Live oocytes from both vitrified and fresh groups were used as recipient
cytoplasts for SCNT. No significant difference in fusion rate was found between vitrified
(97.6%) and fresh (93.2%) oocytes. The cleavage rates of vitrified oocytes in the SCNT and
parthenogenetic activation (PA) embryos (29.6% and 27.9%) were significantly lower than
those from fresh SCNT and PA oocytes (80.9% and 91.1%). The developmental rates to 8-
cell stage of SCNT and PA embryos from vitrified oocytes were also lower than that of
fresh oocytes. There was no significant difference among the groups in the development
to morula stage (11–27%). However, the blastocyst rate of PA embryos derived from fresh
oocytes (12.5%) was significantly higher than the other groups (1.2–3.3%). Although high
survival rate of vitrified oocytes was obtained, the cleavage, 8-cell, and blastocyst formation
rates of SCNT and PA embryos from vitrified oocytes were still lower than those of fresh
oocytes.

The performance of a high-power, high-power-density DC-to-DC converter based on the single-phase dual active bridge (DAB) topology is described. The dual active bridge converter has been shown to have very attractive features in terms of low device and component stresses, small filter components, low switching losses, high power density and high efficiency, bidirectional power flow, buck-boost operation, and low sensitivity to system parasitics. For high output voltages, on the order of kilovolts, a cascaded output structure is considered. The effects of snubber capacitance and magnetizing inductance on the soft switching region of control are discussed. Various control schemes are outlined. Coaxial transformer design techniques have been utilized to carefully control leakage inductance. The layout and experimental performance of a prototype 50 kW 50 kHz unit operating with an input voltage of 200 V DC and an output voltage of 1600 V DC are presented

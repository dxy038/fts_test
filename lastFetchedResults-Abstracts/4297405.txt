We present a collaborated camouflaging mobility algorithm to protect mobile hosts´ mobility privacy. Our algorithm alters a mobile host´s straight moving paths into Delta-shaped camouflaging paths, which cause its wireless transmissions to be distributed over a large area, and hence, reduce the probability of generating traceable wireless transmissions. Furthermore, on the premise of not affecting the mobile hosts´ itineraries, our collaborated mobility algorithm clusters the motion paths of mobile hosts to make it difficult for an adversary to identify the mobile hosts. We model the objective of maximizing mobility privacy and minimizing the overhead (e.g. the extra travel distance) as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem and use the solution to the optimization problem as the collaborated mobility. Lastly, we analyze the calculation time of the collaborated camouflaging mobility and conduct simulations to evaluate the privacy improvements brought by the collaborated camouflaging mobility algorithm compared with non-covered mobility.

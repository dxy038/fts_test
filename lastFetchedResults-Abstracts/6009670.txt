A fully bidirectional mixed-voltage I/O buffer using a gated Floating N-well circuit is presented. In addition, to provide appropriate gate voltages for Output stage, a Dynamic gate bias generator without gate-oxide overstress effect is implemented. The proposed I/O also takes advantage of a novel Gate-tracking circuit and a PAD voltage detector by means of eliminating the leakage current such that the compatibility among all subcircuits is ensured. Our design is proved on silicon that when VDDIO is 5.0/3.3/1.8/1.2/0.9 V, the maximum data rate is found to be 80/80/125/100/80 MHz, respectively, with a given capacitive load of 10 pF.

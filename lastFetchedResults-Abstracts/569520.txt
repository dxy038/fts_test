The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between vegetation, landform and physicochemical properties of soil. At the first terrain map unit were provided using the landsat thematic mapper (TM) satellite images, aerial photograph, topographical and geology map. Field sampling was done in the representative area using plot sampling. 104 plots 100 m2 were sampled in each plot landform parameters (slope, elevation, aspect), percentage of vegetation cover, were measured and stoniness and browsing damage were estimated and one soil sample was taken for measuring EC, pH, and texture. Relationship between vegetation and environmental factors was based on correlation analysis, box plot and Kruskal Wallis test (multiple comparisons). Correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between vegetation cover with slope and elevation and a negative correlation with EC. Based on the Kruskal Wallis test there was significant difference in vegetation cover between different geopedological map units. No significant relationships were found between vegetation cover and other soil properties such as pH and texture.

The ENOSYS project, funded by the EC, aims to shorten the time-to-market of high-performance SoCs by providing design and tool flows for the design and the implementation of embedded systems by seamless integration of high-level system specifications, software code generation, hardware synthesis, code optimization and design space exploration. The objective here is to automatically generate code, for implementation in execution platforms such as FPGAs, from validated high level designs incorporating initial end user requirements, system functional and non-functional description, platform modelling. This paper describes the design flow developed in the context of the ENOSYS project and the results of a first industrial evaluation through two industrial test cases.

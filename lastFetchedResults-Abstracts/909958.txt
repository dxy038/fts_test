The objective of this paper is threefold: (1) To present a working methodology for the combined use of modeling technology and
microwave remote-sensing measurements in the assessment of attenuation of electromagnetic waves by the vegetation cover; (2) To
illustrate this methodology with computer calculations of the attenuation for various soil-plant formations; (3) To give a perspective
of the developed methodology applied to the study of global environmental change, including the radiative forcing problem.

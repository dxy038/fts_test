A bidirectional serial search pseudonoise (PN) acquisition scheme in a direct sequence spread spectrum system is investigated. By starting with a common initial phase point, both the forward sliding correlation and the backward sliding correlation are performed and examined simultaneously. Whichever phase point in either direction hits the correct phase point first is selected as the desired reference phase point. The author describes the analysis model of bidirectional serial search and the procedure for calculating the overall mean PN acquisition time. A formula for the overall mean PN acquisition time is derived. The computational result and the performance comparison between the bidirectional serial search and the unidirectional serial search are given.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

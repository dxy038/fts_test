The main intent of this paper is to formulate, demonstrate, and validate a practical means of implementing an evolutionary optimization technique in a rotor-bearing system. The optimum design of a flexible rotor supported on three-lobe bearings is studied for the optimal performance considering system stability along with other design criteria such as fluid film thickness, power loss, film temperature, and film pressure using the genetic algorithm and the method of feasible directions. The results for different operating speed values obtained and presented in this study are to provide a comparison of these two methods, and to show the potential of the genetic algorithm in optimization of rotor-bearing systems. The genetic algorithm obtained reasonably good results for the objective function and comparable to the method of feasible directions. Thus, the genetic algorithm provides the designer an alternative design optimization approach for rotor-bearing systems.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenic patients who receive antipsychotic drugs may be highly prone to
metabolic disorders such as weight gain, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. The objective of the
present study was to compare the effect of atypical and conventional antipsychotics on lipid profile.
METHODS: 128 schizophrenic patients were enrolled into the study. Patients were divided into
two groups. One group had received one type of atypical antipsychotic drug, and, the other, one
type of conventional antipsychotic drug. They were considered as atypical and conventional
groups. Moreover, both groups had not used any other antipsychotic drugs during the past year.
Demographic data and food frequency questionnaire were completed by the participants. Serum
triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterols, and apolipoprotein A and B (Apo B) were tested by blood sample drawing after 12
hours of fasting through the antecubital vein. Studentâ€™s t-test was used to compare atypical and
conventional groups.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in age, gender, duration of illness, period of drug
consumption, and age at onset of illness in the two groups. Patients in the atypical group used
clozapine and risperidone (46.9%) more than olanzapine. In the conventional group 81.3% of
patients used phenothiazines. Comparison between lipid profile in the conventional and atypical
groups showed a significantly higher mean in TC (P = 0.01), LDL (P = 0.03), and Apo B
(P = 0.01) in conventional group than the atypical group.
CONCLUSION: In schizophrenic patients, the level of lipid profile had been increased in both
atypical and conventional antipsychotic users, especially conventional users, so the effect of
antipsychotic drugs should be investigated periodically.

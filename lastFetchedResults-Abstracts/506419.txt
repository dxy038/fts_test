Critical thinking is one of crucial factors in developing the intended and experienced curriculum. Further, secondary education plays a key role in social life of all people. Therefore, the question is how much attention was given to critical thinking in secondary education. Data were collected using a questionnaire administered to a sample of 246 high school teachers responsible for the implementation of experienced curriculum. Findings indicated that critical thinking was not received adequate attention in the experienced curriculum. Nevertheless, each factor has not received the same attention. The order of factors in terms of attention to critical thinking was as follows: objective, teaching style, content, and assessment. Further, private schools paid more attention to critical thinking than public schools.

The Virtual Speech Quality Objective Listener (ViSQOL) is a new objective speech quality model. It is a signal based full reference metric that uses a spectro-temporal measure of similarity between a reference and a test speech signal. ViSQOL aims to predict the overall quality of experience for the end listener whether the cause of speech quality degradation is due to ambient noise, or transmission channel degradations. This paper describes the algorithm and tests the model using two speech corpora: NOIZEUS and E4. The NOIZEUS corpus contains speech under a variety of background noise types, speech enhancement methods, and SNR levels. The E4 corpus contains voice over IP degradations including packet loss, jitter and clock drift. The results are compared with the ITU-T objective models for speech quality: PESQ and POLQA. The behaviour of the metrics are also evaluated under simulated time warp conditions. The results show that for both datasets ViSQOL performed comparably with PESQ. POLQA was shown to have lower correlation with subjective scores than the other metrics for the NOIZEUS database.

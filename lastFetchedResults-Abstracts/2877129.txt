This paper focuses on minimization of interference to primary user (PU) through an optimal strategy of power allocation algorithm for source and relay nodes in multihop cognitive radio network (CRN) under the constraints of outage probability (successful delivery) and data rate over source-destination link. This objective is also studied in the framework of enhanced lifetime of the CRN. Extensive simulations are done for both energy aware (EA) and non-energy aware (NEA) power allocation schemes. Simulation results show that NEA based power allocation offers better capacity than EA scheme at the cost of slightly increased interference to PU. Simulation results also show a three dimensional (3D) relative trade-off performance among the data transmission capacity, network lifetime and total transmission power.

Background: Rosa damascena Mill. is one of the most important medicinal and aromatic plants mountainous areas Kashan. This plant have different genotypes that they are very various in size and colour of flowers, number of petals, amount of essential oil and components.
Objective: Extraction and determine of essential oil combination of three genotypes from Rose of Kashan area.
Methods: The flowers of these three genophytes fully double link, white and yellow was collected from mountainous areas Kashan. The essential oil, by hydrodistillation using an all-glass Clevenger-type apparatus. The analysis of the oils were performed by using GC and GC-MS methods. 
Results: Yields of essential oil of fully double link genotype was 0.025% (v/w) and 39 components was identification. The major components of this genotype were citronelool(%34.7), nonadecane (%14.5) and heneicosane(%10.3). Yields of the essential oil of white genotype was 0.035% (v/w) and 21 components was identification, that major components were found as citronellol (%53.61), nonadecane (%17.75) and geraniol (%12.59). Yields of the essential oil of yellow genotype was 0.7% (v/w) and 29 components was identification, that major components were found as heneicosane (%32), nonadecane (%30) and 9-nonadecene (%10.5).
Conclusion: Monoterpene citronelool was more than 30-50% from essential oil of genotypes fully double link and white, but this component wasnâ€™t in yellow genotype. On the other hand, heavy hydrocarbon component was more than 50% of essential oils component of yellow genotype, but amount of this component was 17% in fully double link and white genotypes.

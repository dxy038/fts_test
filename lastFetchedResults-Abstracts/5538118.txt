The objective of condition based maintenance (CBM) is typically to determine an optimal maintenance policy to minimize the overall maintenance cost based on condition monitoring information. In Aircraft operator and the maintenance people starving to reduce the cost of aircraft maintenance. So the condition based monitoring for electromechanical control valve is very popular recently. This paper has been proposed an optimized Fractional order Proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller for electromechanical actuated worm gear operated fuel shut off valve.

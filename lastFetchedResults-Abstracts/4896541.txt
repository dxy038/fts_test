Power loss in a distribution system is reduced indirectly by doing reactive power compensation. This is done through capacitor allocation at suitable bus locations using a metaheuristic technique named Cultural Algorithm. The objective of this approach is to maximize the profit by reducing the amount of real power loss and improving the quality of power by increasing the voltage level of each bus. Standard 9 bus and 34 bus radial distribution systems have been taken for implementation of this scheme. The real power loss of the first and second distribution system has been reduced from 783.7481 KW to 679.9211 KW and from 221.5 KW to 164.8 KW respectively after capacitors are optimally allocated using Cultural Algorithm. A profit factor for voltage improvement of each bus has been incorporated in this approach for achieving maximum profitable capacitor configuration.

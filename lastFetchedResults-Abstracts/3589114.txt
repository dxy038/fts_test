INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to analyze the Spanish scientific publications in requirements engineering, comparing them with those of the European Union countries. METHOD: Identification, using several procedures, of 2625 publications with which the analysis has been carried out. RESULTS: Quantitative data about the volume of scientific publication, researchers&#8217; productivity, publication patterns and collaboration patterns have been obtained for both Spain and the other European Union countries. CONCLUSIONS: Spain averages similar European countries in both volume of publication and researchers&#8217; productivity. On the contrary, several drawbacks regarding publication and collaboration patterns were identified. Concretely, it has been observed that: (1) Spanish researchers publish an important percentage of papers in low-importance outlets and (2) collaboration with other researchers, either from foreign countries or industrial/commercial organizations, is particularly low, so that most of the papers are authored only by members of Spanish university research groups.

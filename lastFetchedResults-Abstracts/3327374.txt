Although several metrics have been proposed in literature to assess the perceptual quality of bidimensional images, no similar effort has been devoted to quality assessment of stereoscopic images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a methodology for subjective assessment of stereo images. Moreover, in the process of defining an objective metric specifically designed for stereoscopic images, we evaluate whether 2-D image quality objective metrics are also suited for quality assessment of stereo images. Specifically, distortions deriving from both coding and blurring are taken into account and the quality degradation of the stereo pair is estimated.

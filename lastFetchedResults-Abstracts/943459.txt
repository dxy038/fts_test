Abstract
Introduction: Hospitals have significant importance as the largest and most costly operational units in health care system. The rate of efficiency can be used as a criterion for the measurement and performance of productivity and resource consumption in hospitals.
Objective: To determine technical efficiencies of hospitals in Guilan University of medical sciences
Materials and Methods: This study was an analytical â€“description carried out in medical universities hospitals located in the Guilan in the years 2012-13. The statistical population was consisted of 19 hospitals. Preliminary data was collected based on self-made check List with reference to the university Statistical Center and selected University hospitals. For data analysis and Technical efficiency measures, Deap2.1 and SPSS16 software, were used for data envelopment analysis (DEA) method.
Results: The average technical efficiency of studied hospitals was 0.943; also managerial efficiency and mean scale efficiency were 0.961 and 0.980 respectively. In regard to technical efficiency, 8 hospitals have the maximum (1), 10 hospitals have 0.8-1 and 1 hospital have less than 0.8 technical efficiency.
Conclusion: The technical efficiency of hospitals with less than (1) optimal value, was due to different initial and optimal values and had surplus inputs; hence, to achieve maximum performance, hospitals must reduce surplus inputs to achieve the desired performance level.

Equality constraints have been well studied and widely used in deterministic optimization, but they have
rarely been addressed in reliability-based design optimization (RBDO). The inclusion of an equality
constraint in RBDO results in dependency among random variables. Theoretically, one random variable
can be substituted in terms of remaining random variables given an equality constraint; and the equality
constraint can then be eliminated. However, in practice, eliminating an equality constraint may be difficult or
impossible because of complexities such as coupling, recursion, high dimensionality, non-linearity, implicit
formats, and high computational costs. The objective of this work is to develop a methodology to model
equality constraints and a numerical procedure to solve a RBDO problem with equality constraints. Equality
constraints are classified into demand-based type and physics-based type. A sequential optimization and
reliability analysis strategy is used to solve RBDO with physics-based equality constraints. The first-order
reliability method is employed for reliability analysis. The proposed method is illustrated by a mathematical
example and a two-member frame design problem. Copyright q 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

In recent years, body-centric wireless communications have become an active area of research due to their various applications. Whereas UHF bands are subjects of interest especially in Europe, relatively low frequency bands below several megahertz are also in researchers´ and corporations´ interest especially in Japan. Thus, all of the candidate frequencies are in an extremely wide range. Our purpose is to bring objective and unified idea on the frequency characteristics of body-centric wireless communication channels with small wearable antennas. In this paper, we numerically observe the open voltage at several receiving antennas, and examined three different postures.

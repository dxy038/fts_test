The objective of the study was to examine the effects of five plastic coatings on cleanability of concrete flooring. In the laboratory it is easier to use simplified model soils (dirts) than actual soils present in piggeries. The aim of the study was particularly to examine the correspondence between the cleanability of the surfaces using simple model soils in a radiochemical reference method and manure soil in a colorimetric study. According to both colorimetric and radiochemical measurements, coating of concrete improved the cleanability of the flooring. The use of coating can thus be justified in sites in which a high cleanness level is required, probably meaning that coatings will be used only in some sites in animal production buildings. According to the colorimetric results, coating also decreases the time required for cleaning. As an important result for further studies concerning comparison of surface materials for animal buildings, this study demonstrated that cleanability of the surfaces from manure soil could be described by both 14C- and 51Cr- labelled radiochemical model soils (correlation coefficients 0.656 and 0.691, respectively). The quantitative radiochemical method is an excellent way to detect soil absorbed in materials. This is important especially from the point of view of durability, because soil absorbed in the flooring material causes chemical attack, which weakens the material in the long run.

It is well known that in the Noto area in Hokuriku district of Japan, landslides occur in all seasons. Most small-scale landslides, which the authors have investigated, occur near streams in valleys with a gentle slope. Moreover, it is said that underground-water supplied by rainfall and snowfall strongly relates to these landslides. The objective of this study is to find areas where landslides may occur in the near future by using infrared band data and visible band data obtained from a Landsat TM sensor with Thematic-Mapper data related to landslide areas. As a result, at many landslide segments in investigated areas, the authors found that the surface temperature in landslide areas is higher than in non-landslide areas

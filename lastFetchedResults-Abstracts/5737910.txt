A new approach to the mixed H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>&#8734;</inf>control of linear systems is presented. The proposed methodology is based on a new stabilization condition leading the control parametrization to be independent of the Lyapunov function. This nice property allows the use of multiple Lyapunov matrices to the multi-objective control design in a numerical and tractable way. A numerical example illustrates the approach as a tool for H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>&#8734;</inf>control synthesis.

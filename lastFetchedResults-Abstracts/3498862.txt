The main objective of the work presented here is to explore the ability of laser irradiations to determine the SET sensitive depths of a linear device by using several wavelengths. Laser testing at two wavelengths allows the estimation of sensitive depths. The approach conducted here is applied for the first time to a linear device with very deep sensitive depth. The 1064 nm wavelength seems to be the most adequate one to reveal all sensitive areas and, when comparing with heavy ion experimental data, shows a reasonable agreement with heavy ion cross section.

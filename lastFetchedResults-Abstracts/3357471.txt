Fa&#231;ades constitute one of the fundamental systems of contemporary buildings. They serve multiple purposes, such as to ensure proper indoor climate, to provide sufficient daylight, but also to create a desirable architectural image. Integration of these aspects makes fa&#231;ade design a complex task that requires significant effort in order to achieve well-performing results. It is thus desirable that systematic approaches to fa&#231;ade design are developed. In this study, we consider fa&#231;ade design as a multi-objective optimization problem, integrating diverse design criteria, namely indoor daylight distribution, structural performance and cost. We evaluate design performance by making use of simulation. Consequently, we use Differential Evolution (DE) to search for best-tradeoff solutions. We compare the performance of two DE variants, using the Hypervolume metric, and also through qualitative inspection. We report fa&#231;ade designs that demonstrate interesting and often unexpected features, concluding that the proposed approach may lead to a novel, more integrated design process.

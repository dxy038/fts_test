The Communications Research Laboratory (CRL) is conducting experiments on advanced satellite communications using the Engineering Test Satellite VI (ETS-VI), which will be launched in mid 1993. CRL has developed three payloads for the projects. The first is the <e1>S</e1>-band intersatellite communications system which features a 19-element multibeam phased array antenna. The second is the millimeter-wave band intersatellite/personal communications system. The third is the bidirectional space laser communications system. These systems and their associated experimentation are described

Abstract: In most service and production systems, there is a need of planning and scheduling the multi-shifts work. This paper presents a manpower scheduling problem in order to assign a work pattern (shift-day) considering system and workforce requirements. The objective is to minimize all cost incurred in the proposed mathematical model. This problem belongs to the class of NP-complete ones due to its time complexity function that it cannot be solved by traditional optimization methods in a reasonable computational time. For this reason, a number of heuristic methods have been proposed to solve such a hard problem. In this paper, a heuristic-based simulated annealing is designed and applied. A number of test problems are generated at random and the associated solutions are compared with the Lingo 6 software in order to evaluate and show efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

The existing replica location services mostly deal with read-only data, thus the replica location mechanism is relatively simple. This paper aims to provide global replica view in logic for better supporting all-around replica management to realize optimal replication strategy and replication selection strategy. We present the bidirectional linked list based replica location service (BLL-RLS) on tree-based hierarchical unstructured overlay networks, including the deployment of replica location service and the design of the bidirectional linked list based replica catalog. In the absence of the centralized replication management, it can logically provide a global replica view of the original. Based on the bidirectional linked list based replica catalog, replica location and selection algorithm is also proposed. Simulation results show that the algorithm has better performance.

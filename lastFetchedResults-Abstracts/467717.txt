OBJECTIVE: We compared quality of life, utilization, and costs for women undergoing elective abdominal, laparoscopically assisted vaginal, or vaginal hysterectomy within a managed-care organization. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of 287 women who underwent an elective hysterectomy was performed. RESULTS: Patients undergoing a vaginal hysterectomy reported returning to normal activity levels sooner and had more favorable quality-of-life scores than did those undergoing laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy. Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy was often nearly as favorable as vaginal hysterectomy, particularly at 28 days after the operation, whereas the abdominal hysterectomy group consistently reported the poorest postoperative quality-of-life scores. No significant differences were noted in utilization or costs in the 60-day preoperative period, whereas hospitalization and postoperative costs were highest among the abdominal hysterectomy group and lowest for those undergoing a vaginal hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal hysterectomy resulted in better quality-of-life outcomes and lower utilization and costs compared with laparoscopically assisted vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy.

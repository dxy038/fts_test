A roll shape setting model was built for the hot galvanizing and planishing mill. The uniform transversal distributions of the front tension in the exit and the unit pressure were considered as the objective function. At the same time, the quality of the products, the stability of zinc layer, and the homogeneity of spangles were of considerable significance in the planishing process. The model was applied to the roll shape setting of the 1800 cold rolling 3# CGL hot galvanizing and planishing mill of Baosteel Co Ltd. After being planished, the flatness of a strip that was less than 6 I was more than 97%, and the flatness of others were less than 10 I; the pass percentage of the zinc layers reached 100%.

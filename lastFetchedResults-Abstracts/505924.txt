E-business maturity level assessment is more a qualitative activity rather than a quantitative one. So, a method is needed for formulating the effects of different factors on the maturity level of an organization and on the other factors. The objective of the present article is to elaborate fuzzy models of interactions among different factors and their effects on growth of e-business approach in an organization. First, factors mentioned in the literature as affecting e-business approach were indentified and then by using Delphi method they were classified. After that, by using FCM method, graphical representations of factors and their interactions were demonstrated and using those graphs, causal relationships among (node) concepts were identified and analyzed.

Objective
Nociception is the major cause of burn pain and leads to central hyperalgesia. Gabapentin (Gp) is an antihyperalgesic drug that selectively affects central sensitization. We studied the opioid-sparing and analgesic effects of Gp in severely burned patients.
Methods
Ten patients (mean total burned body surface area (TBSA), 25%), received 2400 mg of oral Gp daily from after burn days 3â€“24 in addition to standard pain therapy. They were compared to a retrospective matching group. Outcomes were cumulative morphine consumption and mean daily pain scores. Outcomes were recorded during treatment (21 days) and 21 days after treatment.
Results
During treatment and post-treatment phases, patients receiving Gp had cumulative morphine consumption and a mean daily pain score significantly lower than controls.
Conclusion
Gp use reduced opioid consumption and lowered pain scores that seemed to extend beyond its pharmacologic action probably result from the ability of Gp to prevent central hyperalgesia induced by burns.

Objective: We investigated the association between endometritis and reproductive morbidity. Study Design: Participants were 614 women in the PID Evaluation and Clinical Health (PEACH) Study with pelvic pain, pelvic organ tenderness, and leukorrhea, mucopurulent cervicitis, or untreated cervicitis. We compared women with endometritis (≥5 neutrophils or ≥2 plasma cells), Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis upper genital tract infection (UGTI) or both to women without endometritis/UGTI for outcomes of pregnancy, infertility, recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and chronic pelvic pain (CPP), adjusting for age, race, education, PID history, and baseline infertility. Results: Endometritis/UGTI was not associated with reduced pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.2) or elevated infertility (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.6), recurrent PID (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9), or CPP (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9). PEACH participants with and without endometritis/UGTI had higher age- and race-specific pregnancy rates than 1997 national rates. Conclusion: Among women with clinically suspected mild-to-moderate PID treated with standard antibiotics, endometritis/UGTI was not associated with reproductive morbidity.

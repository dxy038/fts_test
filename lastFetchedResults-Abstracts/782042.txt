The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of some non-genetic factors on birth
weight, weaning weight and daily gain weight in Serrana Transmontano kids. Data from
8930 records were analysed. Results showed that birth weight (BW), adjusted live weight
at 30 days of age (W30), adjusted weaning weight at 60 days of age (WW), average daily
gain from birth until 30 days of age (ADG30) and average daily gain from birth until 60
days of age (ADG60) were influenced by sex, age of dam and birth season. BW, W30, WW,
ADG30 and ADG60 of males were higher than female. The same variables increased with
the dam’s age. Kids born in autumn were heavier than those born in spring, winter and
summer. W30 was lower in kids born in winter. TheWWof kids born in spring was higher
than of those born in winter, autumn and summer and the ADG30 of kids born in spring
and summer were higher than those born in autumn or winter. ADG60 was higher for kids
born in spring. Kids born singlewere heavier at BW, W30 and ADG30 whilst kids born triple
were lighter. Males showed the greatest weights and average daily gains, in the offspring of
3–5 years old females, as well as in single born and in those which were born in autumn

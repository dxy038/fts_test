Wireless access networks have importantly become a part of the telecommunication infrastructure that provides voice, data and multimedia services to mobile users. As traffic increasingly becomes data instead of voice, existing wireless access networks need an appropriate and efficient infrastructure for the delivery of bursty data packet services. This paper presents a network optimization model for topological design of 3G wireless access networks. The main objective of the model is to optimize the network design cost of 3G wireless backhaul networks with acceptable quality of service requirements. This paper also presents an efficient heuristic method to solve large network design problem sizes within a reasonable computational time while obtaining a near optimal solution.

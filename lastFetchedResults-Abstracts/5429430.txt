This paper proposes an analytical framework for performance evaluation of TCP (transport control protocol) over adaptive wireless links. Specifically, we include adaptation of power, modulation format and error recovery strategy, and incorporate some features of wireless fading channels. This framework is then used to pursue joint optimization through maximization of an objective functional, that expresses a trade-off between achievable throughput and energy costs. A set of numerical results is reported, and it is seen that hybrid ARQ schemes may provide significant benefits in the optimization framework

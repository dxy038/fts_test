A Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) controller based on the conditional servo-compensator technique is designed for the robust stabilization of a new satellite launching strategy called (unmanned) airlaunch. This strategy consists in using a two-stages launching system. The first stage is composed of an airplane (manned or unmanned) that carries a rocket launcher which constitute the subsequent stages. The control objective is to stabilize the aircraft in the launch phase. It is developed separately for two nonlinear motion modes of the model, the longitudinal and lateral modes, and is applied to the full multi-input multi-output model of the aircraft. The controller is indeed able to assure system stability for rather large disturbances. Performance of the proposed control algorithm is illustrated through simulations.

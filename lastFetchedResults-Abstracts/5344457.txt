The usage of mobile devices has increased dramatically in recent years. These devices serve us in many practical ways and provide us with many services -- many of them in real-time. The delivery of streaming audio, streaming video and internet content to these devices has become common place. One emerging application in recent years is the use of mobile devices for tracking local traffic incidents and there are several such providers of this content on the Internet as Google Maps, here.com, Twitter, various Department of TransportationÂ´s web sites, various radio stations websites, and many others. Some sites as Twitter only provide text information but are updated often with recent data. Map enhanced websites provide visual information but are often not updated as often. The goal of this project is to integrate all the sources of traffic information together in one place and filter intelligently all the recent incident data so the results are as accurate and up to date as possible thus minimizing the number of false reports and incidents. This process, implemented for iOS 7 using XCode and Objective-C, allows the user to view traffic reports for 15 large US cities with the capabilities for the addition of many more locations. Results for the app are compared with the major individual sources and the percentage of additional incidents detected and false incidents incorrectly identified for several large cities are provided.

Background: The traditional cyclone has been developed for the removal of airborne silica particles from local exhaust ventilation (LEV). The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of veloc ity and particles load on efficiency of cyclone in the Stone Crushing Units at Azendarian Area.
Methods: After the designing and installing the traditional cyclone, downstream and upstream samples of the apparatus were obtained. The mass of all samples collected was determined gravimetrically us ing EPA method with cascade Impactor.
Results: The relation between inlet total and respirable dust concentration to cyclone and cyclone over all efficiency is statistically significant (P= 0.005) and the relation between inlet air velocity to cyclone and cyclone pressure loss is statistically significant (P= 0.002). There was a significant correla-tion between the inlet concentration loaded to cyclone and the efficiency of cyclone.
Conclusion: Increase of respirable dust concentration and also total concentration cause to increase effi ciency of cyclone.

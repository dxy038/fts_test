Background: The study examines psychosocial mechanisms in dietary change using the health action process approach (HAPA) as its theoretical backdrop. Previous studies have supported the model in the domain of dietary behaviors but it has not yet been studied in China. Objective: Dietary planning is assumed to mediate between intentions and dietary behaviors. However, among individuals scoring low on proactive coping, this mediation might fail. Therefore, an extension of the model by including proactive coping is examined. Methods: Psychometric scales were administered at two points in time, three months apart, to 240 young Chinese men and women. Intentions, outcome expectancies, risk perception, action self-efficacy, and proactive coping were assessed at Time 1, whereas planning, coping self-efficacy, and dietary behavior were measured at Time 2. Results: Structural equation models replicated previous evidence on the validity of the HAPA. Intentions and planning mediated sequentially the effects of outcome expectancies and self-efficacy on dietary behaviors. Moreover, the inclusion of proactive coping yielded no main effects, but an interaction between intentions and proactive coping on dietary planning. The intention–planning–behavior chain was moderated by proactive coping which means that this connection operates only well when individuals are proactive. Conclusions: A combination of proactive coping and the motivation to eat healthy foods facilitates dietary planning which, in turn, benefits corresponding behaviors.

Our objective is to integrate business engineering with requirements engineering. Towards this end we develop a conceptual model based on total quality principles with a view to structuring information about business processes in a company. The conceptual model is redefined to ensure its implementation as a hypertext. Once organized in this way, relevant process information can be used to elicit requirements. A structured access directed towards a requirements specification representation helps requirements elicitation. We instantiate the conceptual model with business data from a unit of a large company certified in accordance with ISO 9001 standards

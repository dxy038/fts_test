Increase in electric vehicle mobility has encouraged the growth of vehicle to grid technology. Vehicle to grid technology allows bidirectional power flow between the battery of electric vehicle and the power grid. This allows peak load shaving, load leveling, voltage regulation and improvements of power system stability. Implementation of the vehicle to grid technology requires dedicated electric vehicle battery charger, which allows bidirectional power flow between power grid and electric vehicle battery. In this paper, a new control strategy for bidirectional battery charger is proposed. The proposed control strategy can charge and discharge an electric vehicle battery in both slow and fast mode. The performance of the bidirectional controller is verified by simulation in PSCAD/EMTDC software under different operating modes, which include fast charging, fast discharging, slow charging and slow discharging. The results show that the proposed control strategy performs well in all four modes.

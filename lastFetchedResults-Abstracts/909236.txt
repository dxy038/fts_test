One of the most important requisites in environmental impact assessments (EIAs) is that the evaluation and communication of impacts must be done with objectivity and transparency. Traditional methods as checklists, matrices, geographic information systems (GISs), and causeâ€“effect diagrams fail to reach this objective because, in general, it is difficult to follow the assumptions and rationale behind the evaluation process. In this paper, we show how the use of visual programming languages (VPLs) is a useful tool that can enhances the quality of these studies. The pros and cons of this approach are evaluated based on a study case of a thermoelectric generation plant.

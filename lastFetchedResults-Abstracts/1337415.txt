The objective of this study was to determine whether consumption of tall fescue seed which contained high levels of ergovaline would affect post-exercise recovery of horses subjected to an anaerobic exercise test. Ten Quarter horses were separated into two groups and fed alfalfa hay, commercial sweet feed, and either endophyte-infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E−) ground tall fescue seed. Diets contained 11.8% seed, which resulted in 459 ppb of ergovaline for the E+ diet. During the first 28 days, horses in group A received E+ and group B received E−. Diets were reversed during the next 28 days (crossover design). Horses were ridden for 5 days per week. On day 14, 28 (period 1), 42, and 56 (period 2), they were subjected to a standardized exercise test (SET) that consisted of 41 turns in 4 minutes and was designed to raise the horse’s heart rate (HR) beyond the anaerobic threshold (150 bpm). There was a horse effect (P < .05) on post-SET respiration rate, HR, and post-exercise whole blood lactate level, but not rectal temperature (RT). For these variables or period effects, there was no horse × treatment, period × treatment, or period × horse interactions (P < .05). Treatment had no effect on whole blood lactate level, RT, or HR at any time measured. Respiration rate did not vary by treatment at rest or 1 minute after SET but was higher for the E+ treatment at 5 and 10 minutes after SET (P < .005). Consumption of diets that averaged 450 ppb of ergovaline caused the horses expend more respiratory effort in an attempt to recover to resting RT.

In a companion paper [1], authors presented fundamental aspects of Load Frequency Control (LFC) and review of literature on different LFC methods that were proposed for pre-deregulation scenario. After deregulation of power system, LFC plays key role in providing better conditions for electricity trading. Although, complicacy has increased significantly with additional constraints, LFC has emerged as one of the most profitable ancillary services in the power market. The prime objective of the LFC is to efficiently track the load variations in a multi-area power system and thus maintain zero steady-state errors for frequency deviation. In a deregulated environment, independent generators and utility generators may or may not participate in the LFC, therefore more adaptive and market oriented control techniques are desirable for deregulated power systems. This paper provides literature review on LFC strategies suitable for deregulated power system scenario. Case studies on some of these techniques have been presented for clear illustration of these methods. Finally, key issues and challenges in LFC in deregulated environment have been highlighted.

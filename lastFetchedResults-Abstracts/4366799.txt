This paper presents a constructive algorithm for memory-aware task assignment and scheduling, which is a part of the prototype system MATAS. The algorithm is well suited for image and video processing applications which have hard memory constraints as well as constraints on cost, execution time, and resource usage. Our algorithm takes into account code and data memory constraints together with the other constraints. It can create pipelined implementations. The algorithm finds a task assignment, a schedule, and data and code memory placement in memory. Infeasible solutions caused by memory fragmentation are avoided. The experiments show that our memory-aware algorithm reduces memory utilization compared to greedy scheduling algorithm which has time minimization objective. Moreover, memory-aware algorithm is able to find task assignment and schedule when time minimization algorithm fails. MATAS can create pipelined implementations, therefore the design throughput is increased

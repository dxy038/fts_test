This research tries to view accident data collection and analysis as a system that requires a special view towards understanding the whole and making sense out of it for improved decision making in the effort of reducing the problem of road safety. Under the umbrella of an information architecture research for road safety in developing countries, the objective of this machine learning experimental research is to explore and predict the role of road users on possible injury risks. The research employed Classification and Adaptive Regression Trees (CART) and RandomForest approaches. To identify relevant patterns and illustrate the performance of the techniques for the road safety domain, road accident data collected from Addis Ababa Traffic Office is exposed to many sided analyses. Empirical results showed that the models could classify accidents with promising accuracy.

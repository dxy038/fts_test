In this paper, the application of decision trees (DTs) for online preventive dynamic security of isolated power systems is presented. DTs provide the necessary computational speed for online performance and the flexibility of providing preventive control. Emphasis is placed on the online use of the DTs to test the dynamic security of each generation dispatch scenario and thus to provide corrective advice via generation redispatch. Moreover, the algorithm implemented provides the flexibility of displaying the cost of each redispatch. In this way, the method can help in objective decision-making. Results from the application of the system on actual load series from the island of Crete, where the proposed system is in trial operation, are presented

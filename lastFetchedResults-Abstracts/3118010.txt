Structure synthesis method for reconfigurable mechanism based on genetic optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper. Main characteristics of this method include: (1) POC matrix of the mechanism corresponding to different motion stage of the reconfigurable mechanism is used as the objective function. (2) design variables are determined based on the influence of three basic topological structure elements over POC matrix. (3) According to the genetic optimization algorithm, more than one solution may usually be obtained. The optimum reconfigurable mechanism may be selected based on other engineering requirements. An example is given to illustrate the synthesis procedure.

Fitness assignment and external population maintenance are two important parts of mufti-objective evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new MOEA which uses the information of minimum spanning tree to assign fitness and maintain the external population. Moreover, a Minimum Spanning Tree Crowding Distance (MSTCD) is defined to estimate the density of solutions. From an extensive comparative study with three other MOEAs on a number of two and three objective test problems, it is observed that the proposed algorithm has good performance in convergence and distribution.

Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is commonly used in process control systems. Tuning PID controller parameters are a very challenging problem to improve performance and stability of a process. This paper presents a novel method for PID controller tuning problem using Linearized Biogeography-Based Optimization (LBBO) algorithm. Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) is an evolutionary optimization algorithm based on mathematical model of Biogeography, it permits of sharing the features among candidate solutions (habitats) represented by emigration and immigration. By using Matlab/Simulink and the squared error integral criterion as objective function. The algorithm is applied to benchmarks functions optimization design, and is then compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), BBO, and Modified Biogeography-Based Optimization (MBBO). Simulation results shown that the LBBO is an effective tuning method and has better performance compared with PSO, BBO, and MBBO.

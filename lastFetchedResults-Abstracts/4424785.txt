Sonobuoy is one of the important equipments, which plays a great role in aviation anti-submarine. In modern anti-submarine warfare, multi-base buoys joint search potential way is often adopted for detecting position of underwater target, which wide the detective range of the apply tile submarine and improve the detective efficiency. More and more researchers have concerned this method because of its favorable invisibility. According to the trend of buoy technology, the simulated annealing algorithm, which has the ability of global optimization, was introduced into the nonlinear programming problem of underwater targetÂ´s localization. Firstly, a proper objective function for the system configuration of multi-base passive directed buoys (at first and) is built. Then the appropriate annealing and stop rules are debugged. Many simulation experiments were be analyzed about the positioning performance and convergence parameters of this algorithm. Experimental results illustrate that the objective function can converge to the optimum solution and find the best matched point to realize effective localization, and the feasibility of the simulated annealing algorithm in the multi-base buoys passive localization also is confirmed.

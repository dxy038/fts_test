Objective: Kidney transplant recipients are more predisposed to malignancy. Malignancies are the important causes of mortality in this group. Prevalence of malignancy in transplant patients is 100 times more common than general population. Genitourinary malignancies especially women genital tract are among the most prevalent after transplant. The purpose of this study is evaluation of cervical cancer prevalence in kidney recipient patients.
Subjects and Mathods: All of the married female patient undergoing kidney transplant from 1988 to 2003 are accounted in this study. 81 patients were under triple immunosuppressive regimen and 4 were treated with two agents. With maintaining the necessary criteria, after taking history and GU tract physical examination, papsmear was prepared. Cytology results were reported according to Bethesda system.
Results: 85 patients with mean age of 39 years and average of 5 years after transplant were accounted in this study. No tumoural lesions of vulvovaginal region was seen in physical examination. In 50 patients cervix was normal and there was atrophy in 18, acute cervicitis in 5 , polipoid lesion on exocervix of one patient and the remainders had some evidence in favor of chronic cervicitis. Pap smear was normal in 53 and benign reactive changes was seen in 32 and there was not any low or high grade intraepithelial lesion or malignancy.
Concluisons: These findings suggest that there is a significant difference in the prevalence of cervical malignancy relative to other studies. This may be due to several reasons including fewer number of cases, shorter follow up, less general risk factors than general population and different environmental, ethnics, genetic factors and viral carcinogens.

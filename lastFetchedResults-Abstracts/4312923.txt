Scheduling is a very important step in high-level synthesis. Integer programming (IP) approach was successfully used to solve the scheduling problem, but it suffers from its restricted mathematical model. Constraint logic programming (CLP) was also proposed as a solution technique. Although its flexible model, CLP suffers from high runtimes in large problems. The objective of this paper is to compare the two approaches and to present a hybrid approach that use complementary strengths of integer programming (IP) and constraint logic programming (CLP). These approaches were applied to fifth order elliptic wave filter to solve scheduling with module selection problem and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach

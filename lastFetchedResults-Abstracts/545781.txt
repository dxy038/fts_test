Objective
Brain abscesses represent organized foci of suppuration within the parenchyma. 
Here we report a 3 month-old girl with a very huge complicated cerebral 
abscess, and the course of treatment given. The patientâ€™s recovery was excellent. 
The follow up MRI showed only subtle porencephalic changes as the only 
parenchymal sequelae, which may be due to CNS plasticity in infants.

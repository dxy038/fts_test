Abstract:
Holy places like qadamgah (the place of holy people step), in different religions or Islamic sects, have always respected. Some of these qadamgahs in Iran belong to Imam Reza (AS) and his sisters or brothers. “Beyt-o-nour”, Hadhrat Ma'sumeh?s (SA) qadamgah, is one of the most important qadamgah.
In this study, “Beyt-o-nour” has been examined by anthropological approach. For this purpose, two types reports of its current situation, “objective” and “analysis”, have been provided by comprehensive introduction of target of study, historical identity and geographical location of the place.
In objective report, , the customs, ceremonies and pilgrims’ experiences or emotions have been examined by using the qualitative method of anthropology, cooperative observation technique, document review and interview. In analysis report, we tried to explore the meaning of the activists’ subjective and hidden layers.
Finding of study show “Beyt-o-nour” had given the Qomish people identity. Activists had been effective to deepen the effect of Hadhrat Ma'sumeh?s (SA) journey by simulating brotherhood relation between Imam Reza (AS) and Hadhrat Ma'sumeh (SA) to Imam Hussein (AS) and Hadhrat Zeinab(SA) brotherhood relation.

Cold-roll-forming (CRF) is an important sheet metal forming process. However, product design procedures, in terms of rolls design and rolls pass schedule, remains more an art than science. Finite element (FE) computer simulation can be used to predict the deformation and final product geometry, hence, reduce the design time and cost. The main objective of this work is to develop a FE models to simulate the CRF process, and to predict membrane strain distributions. The model was used to simulate CRF of a trapezoidal channel section, and the simulation results were compared to publish experiments.

Two models were investigated in this paper, simulating strip rolling with friction was investigated using two FE models. The first model involves closing the rolls over the undeformed stock to predict the initial deformed mesh, as a first stage, followed by rolling, as a second stage. The second model involved a rolling simulation with a pre-deformed mesh until the deformation was fully developed. Furthermore, to decrease the computation time and to continue the rolling simulation, a technique using dual meshes and re-meshing was applied to simulate roll-forming trapezoidal channel section.

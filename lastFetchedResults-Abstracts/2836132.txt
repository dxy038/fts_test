This paper presents an integrated design process that combines theoretical analysis and heuristic verification to develop the magnetic components of a commercial 2.5-kW bidirectional charging system for a vanadium flow battery. The design process aims to fulfill a rigid set of electrical, mechanical, and thermal requirements for the battery charger. The design has been verified using simulation and then experimental confirmation in the pre-production converter.

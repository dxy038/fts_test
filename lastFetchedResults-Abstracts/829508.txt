Background and Objective: Using 2 implants in edentulous lower jaw is a standard protocol treatment for improvement of prosthesis retention. Different attachments have been produced in factories. One of these attachments is locator that is now a famous clinical option. In this in vitro study, the effect of inter implant distance on retention in simulated function condition and on 2 brands including Dio and 3i is analyzed.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 24 nylon inserts pairs were provided from dio and 3i system attachment. Then, 2 hollow blocks with parallel walls were constructed. Attachments splinted to analogue and assembly inserted in block with GC reline materials in 2 inter implant distances of 19 and 23 mm and parallelism has confirmed with jelenko surveyor. The samples were assembled in zwick jaws and every sample was loaded at 1440 cyclic loading from vertical. Data is measured at cycles of zero, 120, 360, 720, and 1440 with 34560 cyclic loading exerted. Data were analyzed with proper statistical tests.

Results and Conclusion: The results were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). It was found out that retention value in 23 mm distance was greater than 19 mm until 720 cycles and difference was significant but at 1440 cycles, there was no significant difference.

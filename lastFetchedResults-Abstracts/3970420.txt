An oversampling technique that allows ternary (-1,0,1) filter coefficients is proposed for the implementation of two-band perfect reconstruction-quadrature mirror filter (PR-QMF) integer filterbanks. The optimization algorithm is based on the energy compaction. The resulting filterbank has two advantages: (i) the multiplier-free structure allows small VLSI area and low-power, and (ii) the filters use the whole given integer range leading to better objective performance compared to the previously published approaches.

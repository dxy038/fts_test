In this article, the results of the research related to design and implementation of an experimental prototype of a spectrophotometer, similar to the one which is used roulinly in clinical laboratories, are presented. In this research, after the designing, implementation and testing different optical, mechanical and electronic modules of the system and developing an operating software, for control and signal processing, a complete system capable of selecting the desired wavelength automatically, was implemented. A series of experiments on selected samples were carried out using the implemented system with the objective of testing, calibration and compensation for the errors of the system. The results of the experiments have been presented in this paper.

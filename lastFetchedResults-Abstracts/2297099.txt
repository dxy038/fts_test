Context and objective: The black figure of domestic violence against
women, because of the lack of reports of police and judicial authorities, is
substantially high. This fact led to decision-makers ignorance of this issue.
This research with comparative approach deals with Iran’s and Canada’s
police response to this social issue.
Methodology: This study is descriptive-analytic and library based.
Findings: Iran’s criminal policy response to domestic violence against
women doesn’t have a particular function or approach some plans are proposed
to support the rights and freedoms of women in some specific areas such as
women’s swimming pools and sport clubs, but these plans have not been
implemented yet. Provision of Article 42 of Criminal Procedure Act 1392 had
provided police women for investigation of women and children.
Canadian police response is highly consistence and extensive. Giving
special powers to police officers to separate two sides of violence, and to arrest
culprit, assigning specific phone line to ask for help, creating rapid response
to violence teams, designing and implementing projects to respond to this
problems are among Canadian police activities about this issue.
Results: Police response to domestic violence against women is categorized
to 3 areas- social, legislating and criminal.
In current practices of police in Iran, apart from the provisions of Article 42
of the code of criminal procedure 1392, a special approach to reduce the rate
of violence against women cannot be found. Canadian police in all three areas
has systematic and specific procedures.

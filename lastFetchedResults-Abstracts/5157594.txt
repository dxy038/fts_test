This paper describes the development considerations and logic of an automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS). The system is used as a material handling system for a class of manufacturing assembly lines. First defined is the manufacturing environment from which the design objective and constraints are derived. Queueing and simulation models are employed to identify the key performance parameters, to evaluate design alternatives, and to compare different dispatching rules. Both hardware and software design concept and parameters are briefly reviewed. A work-in-process management policy and a line design concept associated with AS/RS are introduced.

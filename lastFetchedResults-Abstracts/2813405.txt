In this work, we focus on minimizing the overall network energy consumption problem under delay-constrained: N different packets from N time varying channels must be transmitted by a hard deadline of T slots. Each transmitter determines how much power to transmit with, during each time slot based on the current channel quality and the number of un transmitted bits, with the objective of minimizing overall network energy consumption. We transform the non-convex optimization problem into a geometric programming problem which has convex form and propose a distributed approximate optimization algorithm. Moreover, a lazy updating distributed algorithm is also presented for infrequent message passing. Experimental results show that the proposed distributed algorithm converges fast and the results of the distributed algorithm and results of centralized algorithm are very close.

The motivation of the presented thesis emanated from the need for unrestricted wireless communication in a scalable and predictable manner. This need is accentuated by the increasing usersÂ´ demand for spontaneous communication. The objective is to propose a management framework able to leverage the potential of wireless ad hoc networks as an alternative communication method allowing them to coexist with other networks and to emerge as their flexible extension.

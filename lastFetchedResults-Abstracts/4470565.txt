Sleep quality is one of the key elements of the human health status. By observing sleep patterns we can gain information about personal wellbeing. Consumer electronic sleep analysis solutions are now available for use in long-term conditions. In this study we compare different measures for total sleep time and sleep quality. We analyzed visually long- term sleep data collected with actigraphy, sleep logs and ambient sensors to gain more reliable results and compared these results to each single methodÂ´s output. Correlations of visually analyzed total sleep time between actigraphy total sleep time (correlation coefficient (r)=0.662, p&lt;0.01) and sleep log total sleep time (r=0.787, p&lt;0.01) were high. Also comparison between subjective and objective sleep quality was analyzed and small, but significant correlation was found (r=0.270, p&lt;0.01).

Societal concerns over global warming issues and dependence on fossil fuels have caused the vehicle market share of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to grow. A large penetration of PHEVs, however, would likely put higher stress on power systems. To lessen the PHEVs´ harmful impacts on the distribution grid, this paper proposes a two-stage charging control strategy modeled on a renewable-based energy hub. In the first stage, a home-based charging control method is formulated in which the charging cost of PHEVs is considered as an objective. Running this procedure by PHEV schedulers in houses, in the second stage of the proposed strategy, the PHEV coordinator agent (PCA) applies a multicriteria optimization framework to reach optimal charging plans with respect to both the vehicles owners´ and system operator´s perspectives. Total losses of the distribution system, total rescheduling costs, and wind energy utilization for PHEV charging are those factors that are modeled in the second stage. Once the PCA achieved optimal charging plans of PHEVs, the imposed charging demand should be reported to the energy hub manager, and optimal dispatch of the hub would be determined.

Three years following nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, a 54-year-old woman presented with symptoms secondary to ascites, and a large left adnexal mass.

Pathological examination revealed renal cell carcinoma identical to the original tumor. The etiology and appearance of metastatic disease to the ovary are discussed.

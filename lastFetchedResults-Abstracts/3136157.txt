A 1.2&#956;m mixed analog-digital BICMOS technology has been developed and characterized. The objective of this technology is to achieve simultaneously high density CMOS logic (5V) and high performance bipolar transistors for analog applications (12V). In this paper we particulary discuss the results of the optimization of the bipolar device parameters, in order to combine high voltage analog requirements and high frequency performance.

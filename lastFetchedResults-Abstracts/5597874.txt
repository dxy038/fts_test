The authors deal with a control problem when the control objective is to keep the system within some qualitative region called safe. It is assumed that the system is evolving over time, i.e. it is changing its qualitative and quantitative characteristics. This is reflected in the qualitative change of the model of the system which, as a result, must be permanently updated. The goal is to develop a theoretical approach which would provide a methodology for automatic construction of such controllers which are able to solve the above control problem. An approach to the solution of this problem is presented that is based on a combination of control theory and artificial intelligence

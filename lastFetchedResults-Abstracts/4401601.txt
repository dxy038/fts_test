Cloud computing provides dynamic provisioning for real time applications over the Internet. These services are accessed by number of clients as pay per use over the internet. In this scenario, scheduling the current jobs to be executed with given constraints for the real time tasks is an essential requirement. Hence task scheduling is a major challenge in cloud computing. In general, the main aim of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) is to earn more amount of revenue. So, the providers may provide false information about their resources to gain more profit. To enforce the genuineness of information, game theory model is used. In older approaches, a scheduling algorithm is used to schedule the task with maximum estimated gain and executes the tasks in the queue. Therefore it increases the execution time of the task. This paper presents a scheduling mechanism for real time tasks to achieve timing constraint and minimum cost for the job execution. The game theory mechanism ensures that the truthful information is provided by CSPs. we found that the induced results of the proposed algorithm are effective and our simulation results outperform the traditional scheduling algorithms with multi-objective optimization.

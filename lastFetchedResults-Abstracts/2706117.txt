Presented is a novel technique to fuse multi-sensor images using non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) domain I<sup>2</sup>CM. First, multi-scale and multi-directional decompositions of source images can be performed by NSST. The classic ICM is improved to be I<sup>2</sup>CM which is then exploited to capture and extract the characteristics of each of the sub-band images. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed from the fused sub-images by adopting the inverse NSST. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed image fusion scheme is very competitive compared with other conventional ones in both visual effect and objective evaluation criteria.

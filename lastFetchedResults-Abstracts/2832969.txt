This paper deals with a comparison of an optimal solution of equipping a MV distribution network when different financial equivalents of supply interruption are taken into account. The comparison elicits from the studies performed for real feeders of 22kV overhead lines and is carried out for an optimization task whose objective is allocation of telecontrolled switching elements (telecontrolled section switches and reclosers). The results are presented for a single feeder and for a representative set of real feeders.

An AVC strategy coordinating the wind farm substation central compensation devices and doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) is proposed to solve the voltage and reactive power issue caused by large scale wind farm integration. The first goal of this strategy is to bind the voltage of the point of interconnection of wind farm to the reference value given by the higher level control, and the second goal is to give priority to the reactive power output of DFIGs to ensure the dynamic compensation devices could have enough reactive power reserves and meanwhile equipoise voltage reserves among all the controlled DFIGs. The strategy is based on the real time monitoring and control platform, and the interior point filter algorithm is used to solve such a multi-objective optimization model. The simulation results of a wind farm in North China validate the proposed model and strategy.

The advance and reduction in the price that PCs have experienced make possible the development and dissemination of some software programs that before were exclusive of big companies or professionals that worked to a specific task. These simulation programs are powerful analysis tools that are essential to the professionals dedicated to the design in electric and electronic engineering. These tools permit users to analyze different effects produced when a parameter of the circuit or system will be changed, and all without the risk of damage to some device. It is necessary to make the maximum dissemination of this kind of tool, teaching its handling and the possibilities that they offer to the technical degree students, the future professionals of electric and electronic field. This is the main objective pursued in this paper

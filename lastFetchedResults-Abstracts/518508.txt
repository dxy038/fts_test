Materials and Methods: This was a Quasi- Experimental study which female students of secondary schools were randomly divided in to two groups; intervention and control groups. Multi stage cluster sampling, a valid questionnaire covering demographic variables and items related to BASNEF Model- based was administered to 106 students. The intervention group composed of 11 educational sessions (60 min each) through discussion and lect ires. The students were tested by questionnaire that made of different variable based on BASNEF model for one month after education.

Results: Following the educational intervention, the mean score of enabling factors was significantly increased in both intervention and control groups (p<0.0001). Also a significant difference was demonstrated in the mean score of attitude and desired behaviors (p<0.0001) (p=0.005) in two groups. No significant difference was demonstrated in the average of subjective norms in intervention and control groups(p= 0.896). Conclusion: The findings of current study confirmed the effectiveness of BASNEF Model- based educational intervention on the variables of enabling factors, attitude and healthy behaviors, but it seems that much more time is needed to change subjective norms.

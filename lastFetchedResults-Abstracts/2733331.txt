This paper presents the robust damping control of power systems with thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC). A SISO output feedback controller is to be designed for TCSC to improve the damping of inter-area oscillations under multiple operating points. The robust damping control problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem considering both regional pole placement and H 2 performance for multi-model system. The multi-objective criterions are described by a set of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMI) regarding different system models at multiple operating points; then, a two-step method is introduced to solve the BMI optimization problem via linear matrix inequality (LMI) algorithm. The proposed controller is evaluated by simulations on real-time digital simulator (RTDS). Numerical results from the simulations show that the proposed controller can increase the damping of inter-area oscillations under different system operating conditions.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate production-ready assembly processes and materials for mixed technology packaging interconnects that will cost effectively meet the requirements of large area, high density commercial assemblies as well as the harsher environments imposed by military and space applications. Based on earlier investigations performed at Hughes and Lockheed Martin, the project focuses on the use of reworkable organic and inorganic coatings for environmental protection of chip-and-wire assemblies that also contain packaged components. The project is utilizing emerging fine line PWB technologies for first level interconnect and will define key in-process and environmental withstanding test requirements for chip on board assemblies. In late 1996, an industry-wide project team was formed under the auspices of the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) on the basis of common interest, need and complimentary IR&amp;D plans. This report details the tasks to be accomplished by the participants during a thirty month program that was initiated in November, 1996

An approach to Cleaner Production in a small factory of hydrated lime is presented. The work aims to improving fuel and limestone utilization and reducing waste production in the plant. Efforts mainly focus on the calcination stage, where around 50% of the production costs due to fuel consumption occur. To fulfill this objective, new indicators are proposed to evaluate the performance of the lime shaft kiln, in order to develop an operational control method for the calcination process. The systematic use of the developed operational control method is a powerful tool in the daily operation of a small lime factory, since it allows a more efficient calcination process with reduced environmental impact and production cost.

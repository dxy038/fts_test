In this paper, we propose an efficient self-diagnosis approach to multi-channel systems with a single-wired connection technique to connect all speakers serially via sub controllers. The digital interface between the sub controllers and the main controller enables more robust control of sound quality and good channel expansion capability. The key technique of the proposed system is efficient bidirectional communication for digital speaker self-diagnosis. We also design a local test signal generation and fault detection circuitry. The circuitry was implemented in FPGA for both the main controller and the sub controllers.

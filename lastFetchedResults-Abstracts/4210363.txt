Hardware/software partitioning is a key problem in hardware/software co-design. This paper presents a new hardware/software partitioning methodology based on improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. The model of the embedded system was constructed by directed acyclic graph to obtain the objective function. Then improvement strategies are introduced in order to overcome the problems of low precision and divergence in traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm. The improved algorithm can avoid local optimal solution efficiently and be conveniently implemented in the field of hardware/software partitioning.

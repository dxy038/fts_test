International activities in the form of publications, consulting visits, and international meetings occurred sporadically in a career that spanned over forty years and are examined in the context of the international activities of MLA. Method: Selected publications and Dr. Brodman's oral history transcript were reviewed. Results/Conclusion: Dr. Brodman was a keen observer of the international practice of health sciences librarianship and used her considerable skills in writing and historical research to capture the essence of the cultures she visited. Reports and journal articles form a solid record of scholarship and were complementary to MLA international activities occurring during her career. She approached her assignments with empathy, candor, and respect for the cultures she visited.

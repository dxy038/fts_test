ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Given the importance of blood glucose regulation in prevention of diabetic complications and considering the fact that the patients tend to eat foods that reduce blood sugar, the main objective of this study was to determine the effect of apple cider vinegar on postprandial blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: In this clinical trial study, thirty type 2 diabetic patients randomly divided in two groups (each group 15 patients). In fasting condition case group received combine apple cider vinegar, 20 gr and 40 gr of water and control group received 40 gr water and immediately, both groups were given breakfast containing 58 grams of carbohydrate. The cross-over trial was conducted after 1 week wash out. Blood samples were collected at fasting and 90 min post breakfast for glucose and insulin analysis. (IRCT: 201201078630N1)
FINDINGS: Mean (±SE) changes in blood glucose while using apple cider vinegar versus placebo respectively was 118.7±10.31mg/dl, 106.9±10.37mg/dl. Mean (±SE) changes of insulin level when using vinegar was 23.1±3.69?u/ml versus17.3±3.39?u/ml when using placebo. There were no significant differences between two groups.
CONCLUSION: Although results of this study showed that apple cider vinegar has no effects on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin.

The main objective of this paper is to scrutinize current studies of Knowledge Management System (KMS) in organization throughout contemporary literatures. The focus is to discover theories, models as well as their approaches of existing studies. The review analyses 30 published articles between 2003-2010 from high quality journals. The results reveal that the majority of existing studies fundamentally based on traditional theories and conventional models of adoption, acceptance and diffusion to study the impact of KMS in the organization while the focus of factor based study is mainly from implementation study. On the other hand, the theoretical approaches to conduct the research in this field generally from variance whereas the process approach is scant. Therefore, the future research could give more attention on process approach which allows exploiting more on interpretive paradigm and qualitative as methodological approach which could possibly generate new knowledge in this field of study.

Destination registration elevator group control system has become hotter and hotter in these years. Itpsilas a tough job to control the elevator group system in up/down peak traffic patterns. This paper analyzes the new characteristic in destination registration elevator group control system and builds up a destination registration elevator group control system with cellular automata. In peak traffic pattern, one novel multi-objective elevator group control policy with fuzzy neural networks is proposed. Simulation results show that the presented elevator model is effective and the proposed dispatching policy provides satisfied average waiting time, average riding time, long waiting ratio in down peak traffic pattern, and is of greater consideration in elevator group control systems.

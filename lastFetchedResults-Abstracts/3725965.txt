In this paper the results obtained in the realization of an automatic procedure for magnet design in 2D, plane and axisymmetric, will be presented. The proposed procedure combines mesh adaption, based on an &#8220;a-posteriori&#8221; error estimate, and deterministic optimization techniques. The use of an analysis module with mesh adaption capabilities gives the automatic design procedure a more stable behaviour in the evaluation of objective function. In particular, one of important features of this strategy is to allow wide variations in dimensional parameters, with high accuracy. The procedure has been realized with a modified version of the VF/OPERA 2d code, realized by the authors, and an optimization technique, based either on the &#8220;Response Surface&#8221; or on the &#8220;Pattern Search&#8221; algorithm, interacting with the analysis code using parametric commands

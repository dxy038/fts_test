Several software models and utilities have evolved during the last 10 years to calculate consistent, quantitative, and objective Test Program Set (TPS) cost estimates for the Naval Air Systems Command. A historical overview of these methods and utilities, together with lessons learned on the CASS program, are identified and discussed in depth. One of the latest TPS cost estimation tools will also be presented. Finally, projections are offered on how these tools will evolve over the next 5 years, along with how current and enhanced features will support the acquisition, deployment, and life-cycle maintenance costs of CASS and the next generation ATS Test Program Sets

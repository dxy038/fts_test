The objective of this research is to develop a dual growth factor-releasing nanoparticle-in-nanofiber system for wound healing applications. In order to mimic and promote the natural healing procedure, chitosan and poly(ethylene oxide) were electrospun into nanofibrous meshes as mimics of extracellular matrix. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was loaded within nanofibers to promote angiogenesis in the short term. In addition, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) encapsulated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles were embedded inside nanofibers to generate a sustained release of PDGF-BB for accelerated tissue regeneration and remodeling. In vitro studies revealed that our nanofibrous composites delivered VEGF quickly and PDGF-BB in a relayed manner, supported fibroblast growth and exhibited anti-bacterial activities. A preliminary in vivo study performed on normal full thickness rat skin wound models demonstrated that nanofiber/nanoparticle scaffolds significantly accelerated the wound healing process by promoting angiogenesis, increasing re-epithelialization and controlling granulation tissue formation. For later stages of healing, evidence also showed quicker collagen deposition and earlier remodeling of the injured site to achieve a faster full regeneration of skin compared to the commercial Hydrofera BlueÂ® wound dressing. These results suggest that our nanoparticle-in-nanofiber system could provide a promising treatment for normal and chronic wound healing.

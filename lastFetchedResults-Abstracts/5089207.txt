This paper will discuss recent improvements made to the Monte Carlo Scene (MCScene) code, a high fidelity model for full optical spectrum (UV through LWIR) hyperspectral image (HSI) simulation. MCScene provides an accurate, robust, and efficient means to generate HSI scenes for algorithm validation. MCScene utilizes a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach for modeling 3D atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) including full treatment of molecular absorption and Rayleigh scattering, aerosol absorption and scattering, and multiple scattering and adjacency effects, as well as scattering from spatially inhomogeneous surfaces, including surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects. The model includes treatment of land and ocean surfaces, 3D terrain, 3D surface objects, and effects of finite clouds with surface shadowing. This paper will provide an overview of how RT elements are incorporated into the Monte Carlo engine and both spectral and spatial properties of simulations of 3-dimensional cloud fields will also be presented.

Safavid era is one of the most brilliant eras in architectural history of Iran and Chaharbagh Avenue is one of the most valuable and important features of Isfahanâ€™s identity in this era.
The objective of this research is to recognize the physical structure of gardens and lost palaces situated in Chaharbagh Avenue in Safavid era and recreate a mental picture of their design. Since physical signs of these gardens and palaces still exist to some extent, an imaginary picture can be suggested based on available information in various texts and documents, especially travelogues. This research is based on studies and points mentioned in historical texts and documents and analyses their content through exploring these historical resources as well as the researches of contemporary researchers about the structure of architecture and urban planning in Safavid era.
Accordingly, by using a descriptive-historical method and giving voice to the old illustrated documents and comparing these texts with written sources, the characteristics of gardens and palaces of Safavid era in Isfahan are elucidated. The results of this study show that the plans of all gardens of this avenue - except Khargah garden- are rectangular in two directions of northern-southern and eastern-western. Moreover, these gardens can be categorized in different types based on the number of their pavilions (from numerous pavilions to no central pavilion). The use of tent in Khargah garden and octagon pavilion (Hashtbehesht) in Bolbol garden and cages in Shirkhaneh and aviary indicate that there were different forms of built spaces in the gardens of this avenue.

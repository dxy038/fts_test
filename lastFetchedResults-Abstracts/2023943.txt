Abstract	
Purpose: The main objective of this study is to examine the location of public libraries in the fourth region of Tehran, based on the centrality and compatibility criteria, and to suggest more suitable locations for building  new libraries.
Methodology: A database of data collected in GIS environment was formed. According to predetermined criteria, the maps were prepared separately.  Based on the layers overlap the situation of existing libraries was evaluated. And in  the final map  appropriate locations for  new library buildings are proposed.
Findings: The results revealed that existing libraries are in relatively good shape with regard to factors relating to centrality and compatibility criteria. But in terms of factors relating to incompatibility with library applications, existing libraries are somewhat disadvantaged. According to the findings the geographical distribution of these libraries is not appropriate. Based on the findings there are potentially better locations in this region for the establishment of libraries. These suggested locations are marked in white in the final map.
Originality/Value: Considering the Fourth Five-Year Plan of development, it is necessary to build libraries in the fourth region of Tehran before starting to build a new library. It is important that the appropriate location is determined. Results with respect to the centrality and compatibility criteria suggest the construction of libraries in locations that will serve more people, in   relaxed and appropriate environments.

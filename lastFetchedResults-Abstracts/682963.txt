Summer pollution episodes in Hong Kong are related to the passage of tropical storms close to the territory. Between 1994 and 1999, there were six territory-wide ozone episodes in Hong Kong during which the Hong Kong Air Quality Objective for ozone (240 μg m−3, 1 h) was violated. The maximum O3 concentration for the period was 334 μg m−3 recorded in August 1999. Synoptically, tropical storms were in the vicinity on all the episode days. Northwesterly/westerly winds induced by the storms are believed to cause ozone precursor emissions from local power plants in the western part of Hong Kong to impact the territory, and at the same time allowing the import of emissions from upwind sources along the mainland coast. Other important meteorological factors that contribute to the occurrence of the episode events include: stable atmospheres, morning break-up of nocturnal inversions, low winds, strong solar radiation and high temperatures. Trajectory analysis of airflows at 850 hPa confirms the long-range pollutant transport. The strong correlation between non-sea-salt sulphate (NS-SO4) and selenium for the summer of 1999 indicates that the main source of high levels of NS-SO4 in summer in Hong Kong is coal combustion. The correlation between arsenic (As) and vanadium (V) for the summers of 1996–1999 suggests a concomitant influence of coal and residual oil combustion in the region.

The nature of the association between alcohol consumption and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not well understood, but there are indications of effect modification by gender. The authors report data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Iowa from 1986 to 1989. RCC cases (261 men and 145 women) were identified through the Iowa Cancer Registry, while controls (1,598 men and 831 women) were randomly selected from the general population, frequency matched on age and gender. Subjects provided detailed information on a mailed questionnaire regarding demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, dietary, and medical history risk factors. In age-adjusted analysis, there was a decrease in risk for women who reported consuming more than three servings (median among drinkers) of alcohol per week (odds ratio = 0.5, 95% confidence interval: 0.2, 0.9) compared with never drinkers. No evidence of an association among men was noted (odds ratio = 1.1, 95% confidence interval: 0.8, 1.5). Multivariate adjustment for anthropometric, lifestyle, smoking, and dietary factors did not alter the findings. Analysis by type of alcohol suggested that the inverse association was strongest for beer consumption, but estimates were imprecise. These findings suggest an inverse association of alcohol consumption and RCC development among women but not among men.

A design of optical system for CCD matrix photo-receivers including optical elements with antireflection coatings for wide spectral region between 8 and 12 mum is presented. Analysis of objectiveÂ´s design based on Ge and GaAs lenses with multilayer AR coating using materials with high refractive index (Ge) and low refractive index (ZnSe, ZnS, SrF<sub>2</sub>) is carried out. Optical quality of the objectives (image quality) is estimated.

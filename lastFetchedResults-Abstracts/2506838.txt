Objective: The health workforce has a dynamically changing nature and the regular documentation of its distribution is a persistent policy concern. This study aimed to measure the distribution of general physicians in primary health care in Bushehr, Iran.
Methods: This was a descriptive study including all general physicians working in primary health care in Bushehr Province, Iran (2010-2013). We investigated the degree of inequality of distribution of general physicians by calculating the Gini Index and plotting Lorenz curve by DAD 4/6 & Robin Hood index by Excel software, both before and after adjusting for crud mortality and consultation rates. 
Results: The highest value of the degree of inequality was based on the number of consultations which was at the beginning and end of the study period 0.321 & 0.196 (with reduction equivalent to %39), based on crude mortality rate of 0.157 & 0.125 (with reduction equivalent to 20%) and at population level of 0.117 & 0.86 (with reduction equivalent to %26). The number of physicians available for distribution based on the number of consultation relative to the population was twice, approximately. The amount of redistribution of general physician increased from 15 people based on the population to 31 based on the number of consultations and from 10 to 20 in 2010 & 2013, respectively.
Conclusion: It seems that the distribution of general physicians was not proportional to the population & health needs between districts. Based on Gini & Robin Hood Indices, more efforts are needed to tackle health inequality.

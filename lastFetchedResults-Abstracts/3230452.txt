Non-edible filtered Mahua oil based mono esters (biodiesel) produced and blended with diesel were tested for their use as substitute fuels of diesel engines in terms of emission. The major objective of the present investigation is to experimentally access the emission performance of biodiesel and find the optimum blending ratio in a dual cylinder diesel engine used in generating sets and the agricultural applications in India. Diesel; neat biodiesel from Mahua and their blends (10, 20 and 30 by volume) were used for conducting tests at varying loads. It is observed that M10 gives the better emission test (in terms of CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, HC, smoke density) than other blend ratios of Mahua biodiesel. The higher fuel consumption of Mahua biodiesel is due to higher flash point and viscosity than petroleum diesel. The higher the flash point of the biodiesel, the better atomization process will be performed. 10% blends of bio-diesel (bio-diesel produced from non- edible sources like Mahua) have been found to comply with all specification of diesel fuel. The Cetane number, flash point and lubricity of the blended fuel are observed to be better than commercial diesel fuel.

This paper describes a model of a genetic algorithm approach to the multi-objective transmission network planning. The model can be used to avoid the problems such as the locally optimal solutions in using common mathematical optimal models. We have considered three objectives such as the minimum investment cost, the optimum system reliability and the minimum influence to the surroundings. In this paper we use the example of the IEEE-6 node system, and work out a set of optimal solutions of the transmission network planning. The conflicts among objectives have been resolved. So the model has been proved to be effective

A novel high step-up three-port converter is proposed in this paper. By utilizing coupled-inductor technique, voltage lift technique and multi-winding technique of coupled-inductor. However, main switch suffer from high voltage spike during the turned-off period. Hence, for suppressing and recycling the energy, the clamp circuit technique is applied. Finally, the prototype of the proposed converter with 250 W full-load, a low voltage input port (24 V), a bidirectional battery port (48 V), and a high voltage port (400 V) for output is implemented. The efficiency are above 94% at all load conditions of SISO mode.

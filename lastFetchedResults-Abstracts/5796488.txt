The stability of position and force control of an uncertain multiple-robot system is presented. The main objective is to obtain the bounded stable tracking performances for position and force simultaneously when the dynamic system is not exactly known. To perform tasks in a system of multiple redundant robots, the coordination among the robots may be incorporated within the position and force controls of the robots, and the constraints among the end-effectors and the rigid object grasped by the end-effectors. When the physical parameters of the robots are known, control laws which are linear in position/orientation errors may be applied to achieve asymptotic stability in both position/orientation of the object, and interactive force/torque among the object and end-effectors. When the physical parameters are not exactly known, robust control laws may be applied to compensate for the errors caused by the uncertainties. The bounds of the errors are dependent on the bounds of the uncertainties and some design factors that can be specified

Due to the potential detection error caused by information loss in sampling process, collaborative scheme is especially important for compressed sensing-based spectrum detection to improve the detection accuracy. In this paper, a novel energy-efficient low-complexity collaborative scheme is proposed for cognitive radio networks. In the proposed scheme, based on the prediction results of signal sparsity level by Lempel-Ziv-based prediction algorithm, the number of detection devices for spectrum detection is evaluated with the aim of minimizing the objective function, which takes into account both the detection accuracy and energy consumption. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed collaborative scheme by comparing with the existing ones.

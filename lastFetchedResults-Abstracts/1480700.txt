The Huygens subgridding (HSG) is a subgridding technique developed for the numerical solution of the Maxwell equations. It relies on the theoretical equivalence of any physical volume with two or more fictitious volumes connected by equivalent currents. The application of this concept to the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been previously published in the one dimensional and two dimensional cases. In this paper the HSG is extended to the general three dimensional case, the exchange of the electromagnetic energy between the two FDTD grids is investigated theoretically, and some modifications to the HSG algorithm are presented with the objective of simplifying its implementation.

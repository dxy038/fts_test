Unmanned (pilotless) Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly replacing manned military aircraft. Department of Defense initiatives mandate that \Â´by 2010, one-third of the operational deep strike aircraft of the Armed Forces be unmanned" based on Senate National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. Unmanned aircraft for commercial applications, i.e., cargo and passenger transportation, is also being considered. This study documents public opinion of unmanned aircraft for commercial transportation of cargo and passengers. Furthermore, this study assesses if the public can be persuaded into acceptance of unmanned aircraft use for commercial transportation if they are provided education, emotional, and financial considerations. To achieve this objective, cross-sectional descriptive research (i.e. survey research) utilizing standardized questionnaires was provided to study participants. The results of the study indicate that the public finds cargo transportation to be the most readily acceptable form of UAV commercial transportation and when educated on unmanned aircraft, even minimally, the public opinion tends to significantly alter on the issue of passenger unmanned aircraft transportation.

The objective of the work is to propose a context based formal language model of fault tolerant public transport system in pervasive environment. The system is modeled on the basis of context sensitiveness built inside the system to assist the decision making not only to identify the failed components but also to determine the alternate solutions to tolerate the faults when need arises. The fault detection in such a distributed system is achieved to identify the faulty entities at different levels of operations as a fault tree of the entire network. The static device awareness, dynamic signal awareness, location awareness and environment awareness are incorporated in the proposed context based model. A public transport control system is considered to verify the context sensitive model with an effective implementation of multiple services using sensor, mobile and computer networks. In the case of events like late arrivals of the vehicles or accidents, the pervasive system is so modeled and checked to avoid timing faults with the help of mobile services and the smart hidden sensor devices placed at every bus terminals.

Objective: Re-examination of routine pre-contrast computed tomography (CT) through liver. Materials and Methods: 852 abdominal CTs including pre- and post-contrast images were retrospectively reviewed regarding detection of hepatic lesions. Results: 103 cases demonstrated hepatic abnormalities. More liver lesions were seen pre- and post-contrast in 10; more lesions were seen pre-contrast in one case. Tiny calcifications were detected only pre-contrast in three cases. Conclusions: Routine pre-contrast scanning through liver is not cost-effective.

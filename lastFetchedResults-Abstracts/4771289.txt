With the rapid development of wireless multimedia services delivery, it becomes essential for telecommunications service providers (SP) to guarantee the users´ service quality and at the same time maximize them profit as well. For the different grades of multimedia service income and network resources consumption, this paper put forward a parameter of unit price of bandwidth resource (UPBR). With this parameter and by the guidance of user´s quality of experience (QoE), services in the wireless network can be upgraded and downgraded by the relevant reasonable admission control (AC) mechanism to achieve the ultimate objective of SP´s profit and service quality.

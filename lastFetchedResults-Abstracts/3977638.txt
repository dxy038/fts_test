We study relay selection (RS) with the analog network coding (ANC) and time division broadcast (TDBC), which are two major amplify-and-forward (AF)-based protocols in bidirectional relay networks. We consider a bidirectional network consisting of two different end-sources and multiple relays, where each terminal has a single antenna and operates in a half-duplex mode. In this network, a single best relay is selected depending on channel conditions to help bidirectional communication between the two end-sources. Specifically, we first consider RS schemes for the ANC and TDBC protocols based on a max-min criterion to minimize the outage probabilities. Then, for the RS in the ANC protocol, we derive a closed-form expression of the outage probability; for the RS in the TDBC protocol, we derive a one-integral form of the outage probability and its lower bound in closed-form. Numerical results confirm that the closed-form expression of the ANC protocol and the one-integral form of the TDBC protocol are very accurate, and that the closed-form lower bound of the TDBC protocol is also tight.

Advanced power electronic converters can provide the means to control power flow and ensure proper and secure operation of future smart-grid networks. The three-phase, direct matrix converter is an alternative solution to the conventional AC-DC-AC converter for interfacing two AC systems at different voltages and/or frequencies. This paper presents a control analysis of a three-phase matrix converter employed as power interfaces of future electrical grids. The proposed system has been successfully tested for bidirectional power flow operation with different grid operating conditions, such as, frequency and voltage variation.

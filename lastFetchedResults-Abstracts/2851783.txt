The Dolby Digital Plus (DDPlus) multichannel audio codec employs channel coupling for parsimonious transmission of high frequency components of the signal, wherein the transform coefficients of discrete channels beyond a coupling-begin frequency are transmitted as a mono-downmix. The decoder reconstructs individual channels by appropriate panning with frequency-banded gains. While channel coupling is a valuable parametric coding tool for low bit-rate encoding of multichannel audio, the resulting high inter-channel coherence can affect audio post-processors that utilize downmixing, such as headphone virtualizers. To mitigate these effects, a new low-complexity spatial audio coding tool is proposed, whose primary objective is to restore phase diversity in the decoderÂ´s output. In this new approach, a decorrelation signal is synthesized directly from the decoded real-valued and critically-sampled transform (MDCT) coefficients, avoiding the expense of computing the imaginary counterpart (MDST) or signal transformation to a different domain (such as QMF). The decorrelation signal is then adaptively mixed with the dry signal and inverse-transformed as in a conventional decoder. The degree of mixing depends on spatial parameters that are either sent in the bitstream or estimated in the decoder from the discrete (not coupled) low-frequency spectral coefficients. Listening tests demonstrate the significant performance benefits obtained in either mode of operation of the proposed tool.

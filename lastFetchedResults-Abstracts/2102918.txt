The cDNA clone of bovine pim-1 has been isolated from phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and concanavalin A (ConA)-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The full-length cDNA contains a 411 bp 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR), followed by a 939 bp coding region and a 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) that contains 1403 bp. Comparison of the bovine pim-1 coding sequence with the human, rat, mouse, frog and zebrafish counterparts reveals 94, 90, 89, 67 and 40% homology at the nucleotide level, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of bovine Pim-1 shares 98.7, 97.1, 93.3, 68.8, and 52.4% similarity with the sequences of human, rat, mouse, frog, and zebrafish, respectively. The 5′-UTR of bovine pim-1 shares high sequence similarity to the human and mouse counterparts and is G/C-rich (75%) which may promote a high degree of secondary structure. The 3′-UTR of bovine pim-1 contains two potential polyadenylation sites and an A/T-rich motif which has been shown to decrease the stability of polyA mRNA molecules. Southern blot results indicate that a single copy of the gene exists in the bovine genome. Northern blot results show that PMA stimulation of PBLs increases the expression of the pim-1 mRNA. In addition, examination of Pim-1 protein expression in PBLs stimulated with a variety of mitogens including ConA, PMA, anti-CD3 and purified protein derivative (PPD) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, reveals two different types of expression patterns during the course of a 24 h period of stimulation. ConA and PPD gave a biphasic pattern of expression while PMA and anti-CD3 gave single transient pattern of expression suggesting that expression is controlled by more than one signaling pathway.

A soil and water conservation-oriented small watershed management information system had been developed based on geographic information system and remote sensing technology. It is a sub-system of soil and water conservation monitoring system in the upper basin of Miyun and Guanting reservoir, and its main objective lays a strong emphasis on the analysis of soil erosion spatial-temporal change and the benefit evaluation of soil and water conservation measures for each small watershed in the region. The number of small watersheds, especially for those which had been taken soil and water conservation measures by projects, is more than 100. The main functions of the system include data management, data query, information analysis and decision support with functionalities of information abstract and measures effect evaluation et al. The procedures developed will contribute to the decision support for the soil and water conservation planning. The system adopted the client/server mode and the database was built on the support of Oracle and ESRI ArcSDE technology. Based on the COM technology, Arcobject and ArcGIS desktop product, ArcMap, the system was developed with the MS Visual Basic for Applications Development Environment. Simultaneously, DLL was built to implement special functions with the language of MS Visual Basic. Based on the above, a small watershed-oriented management information system really was realized.

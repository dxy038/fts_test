Multilayered beams are an association of beams of different materials and cross sections, usually linked together by some mechanical connection. In some cases this connection cannot provide enough stiffness to prevent the displacement between the components, leading to partial interaction or interlayer slip. Most of the work on partially connected composite beams is restricted to the case of two members, but in many practical applications several layers are present. The objective of this paper is to present a new finite element formulation for the numerical analysis of partially connected multilayered composite beams, based on the analytical solution of the differential equations of the problem. The proposed element enables the simulation of multilayered beams according to Euler and Timoshenko beam theories, and generalizes the two-layer case. Numerical examples are presented to assess the precision and robustness of the proposed numerical scheme compared to exact solutions and other FE formulations.

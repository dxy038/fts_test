In this paper, we present a distributed file system with storage QoS provision for cloud computing. The objective is to maximize the aggregated disk bandwidth utilization with the assurance of allocated disk bandwidth for each data transfer. First, we implement a distributed file system based on the ECNP model, which avoids matchmaker overloading and the lack of up-to-date information in the original matchmaking model. Next, resource selection policies for resource management are investigated to improve bandwidth utilization. Furthermore, we propose several dynamic replication strategies to balance the workload of resource providers. Experiments are conducted in real systems to study the performance on storage QoS with different resource selection policies and dynamic replication strategies.

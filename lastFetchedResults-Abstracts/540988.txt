Inulin is widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom. It has been increasingly used in various foods due to its beneficial nutritional attributes as prebiotic ingredient. The Helianthus tuberosus could be a source of inulin, but scarce studies about its extraction exist. Ultrasound has attracted considerable interest in food science and technology due to its promising effects in food processing and preservation. The use of power ultrasound significantly improves the extraction of organic compounds contained within the body of plants and seeds. The mechanical effects of ultrasound provide a greater penetration of solvent into cellular materials and improve mass transfer. In some cases sonication increased the efficiency of extraction at lower temperatures producing a purer product in a shorter time. It seems that the application of ultrasound would be a promising method to enhance the extraction process. The objective of this study was to develop a set of optimum extraction conditions for Helianthus tuberosus with an aim towards improving inulin extraction yield. Experiment design employed central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM). Determination of inulin content was measured with the difference between total carbohydrate and reducing sugars. Then, Inulin extraction yield (%) was calculated too. Based on canonical analysis, the optimal conditions for maximizing inulin extraction yield (91.26%) were at 45.95 Â°C for 31.44 min and amplitude of 100%.

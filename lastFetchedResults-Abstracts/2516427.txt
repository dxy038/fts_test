Background and Objective: After reperfusion following focal ischemia, free radicals are created, causing cell death. Salviaofficinalis contains antioxidant compounds that may prevent cell death process. For this reason, we will examine the protective effect of Salvia officinalis extracts of infarct volume and neurological deficit caused by ischemic stroke.
Subjects and Methods: In this experimental study, 35 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups of 7 rats in each group. The control group received distilled water, three groups received intraperitoneally hydroalcoholic extracts of Salvia officinalis respectively with doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg for 21 days. Four experimental groups underwent 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion.  Two hours after the last administration of Salvia extracts, middle cerebral occlusion was induced. Then, infarct volume and neurologic deficits were analyzed. Sham operated groups were not pretreated before induction of brain ischemia.
Results: The results of this study showed that all three doses of the extract reduced the amount of infarct volume in the core, penumbra and subcortex as well as score of neurological deficits was reduced compared with control group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: It seems Salvia officinalis due by reduction of infarct volumeand neurological disorders, apply the protective effect against stroke damage.

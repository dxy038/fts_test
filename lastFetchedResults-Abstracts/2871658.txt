This paper discusses the development of a public transit scheduling tool that can be run on a spreadsheet software. The main objective of the paper is to bridge the existing gap between the theoretical knowledge of bus service scheduling and local transport service providers in order for the latter to improve their service. Users of the tool are allowed to input onboard passenger counts, to analyze and graph travel characteristics of a transit line, and to propose a service schedule. This paper includes the theoretical background considered in developing the scheduling tool. The performance of the tool was tested using actual bus survey data. Results show that, on the average, data processes range from 0.80 to 5.63 seconds. Finally, the limitations of the scheduling tool were examined and corresponding recommendations were made to improve it.

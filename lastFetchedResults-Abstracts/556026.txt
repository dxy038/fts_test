Background and objective: Hepatitis C is an asymptomatic disease. The quality of life is a major concern in these patients. In this research, we compared quality of life in hepatitis c with healthy people and finally presented a structural model about it.

Materials and Methods: This is an analytical study in which a total of 61 patients with confirmed hepatitis C and 78 healthy accompaniers of them were included. A questionnaire composed of Persian translation of SF-36 items and Sweden QOL was used for measuring the HRQOL. Then, data were analyzed using SPSS16 and LISREAL 8.80.

Results: Total adjusted score of HRQOL (mean ± SE) was 60.77 ± 3.95 and 67.13 ± 4.80 in patients versus control group (p<0.0001). Age and ALT were 0.15 and -0.19 and had a path coefficient respectively with physical health. Age and Co disease were 0.26 and -0.36 and had a path coefficient respectively with psychological health. Physical health as a mediator accounted for 95 % of the variance and psychological health as a mediator accounted for 78 % of the variance in quality of life.

Conclusion: This study showed that hepatitis C is responsible for great alterations in HRQOL. Every effort is to be made to provide structural models in prediction of quality of life that would play a significant role in resolving of problems.

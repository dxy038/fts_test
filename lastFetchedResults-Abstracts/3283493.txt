This paper presents some of the results of a three-year research project entitled ATLANTIDE, which is aimed at developing a comprehensive digital archive of reference models of Italian distribution networks, including forecasted load and generation development evolving towards future smart grid scenarios. The paper focuses on the models developed for harmonic penetration studies and on how the results of these models can be included in the multi-objective optimization approach used by the Distribution Management System model developed in ATLANTIDE.

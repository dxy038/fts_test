This paper presents the SinPers project. Its objective is to develop a new web based learning environment in project management, capable of building and conducting a complete and personalized training cycle (from the definition of the learning objectives to the assessment of the learning results) for each learner. At the end ofthe project in 2008, the SinPers system will be accessible on the web, as a self-training portal, which will use state of the art IT technologies (metadata and ontology for knowledge manipulation, web services, learner model, and intelligent tutoring systems). This paper focuses on the organization of project management content according to the course ontology developed by the author. The SinPers project concentrates both market demands in e-learning services for adults (mainly project managers from different industries), and the emerging concepts and technologies regarding Internet usage, man-computer interaction, multimedia technologies, knowledge management, according to the IST / FP6 and FP7 - Technology enhanced learning objectives. The project started in 2005 and it is being financed by the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research, CEEX grant no. 82/2005. Project SinPers is run by the National Institute for Research and Development in Informatics, Bucharest, (www.ici.ro) and the Academy of Economic Studies, Bucharest, (www.ase.ro).

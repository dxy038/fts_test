Based on the shape adaptive discrete cosine transform (SA-DCT) and its application in image coding, this paper proposes a new image coding algorithm based on image segmentation and shape adaptive all phase biorthogonal transform (SA-APBT). In this paper, an image is divided into two parts, the region-of-interest (ROI) and the background area, which can be encoded separately. Intra macroblocks (all pixels are located in ROI or background region) are processed with APBT; while marginal macroblocks (part of pixels are located in ROI) are processed with SA-APBT. Experimental results are obtained with the test images. It can be concluded that the coding performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of conventional algorithms. Both the objective quality and subjective effect are improved.

In the article, identification process of linear actuator manufactured by Concens is presented. The objective of research was to elaborate mathematical model (operational transfer function) and to determine characteristic parameters. For this purpose, measurement station was constructed, consisting of: actuator with sensor of DC engine shaft location, linear translocation sensor, accelerometer, measurement control card, DC engine driver, PC computer with software and power supply system. Software for actuator control during research and for measurement data acquisition was developed in LabVIEW environment. Software for analysis of obtained results was developed in Matlab environment.

The objective of this paper is to determine optimum allocation of inputs in different agricultural sub-sectors by using a combination of econometric methods and Geometric Programming. Selected inputs are labor, capital and energy for allocation to sub-sectors of cultivation, horticulture, livestock, poultry, fisheries and agricultural industries. Panel data was used for period of 1997 to 2010. The results showed that the current pattern of input allocation was not optimum and using inputs based on optimal patterns could increase agriculture value added at least by 5 percent (18,730 billion Rials).

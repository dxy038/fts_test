This paper presents the recent developments in hierarchical genetic algorithms (HGAs) to speed up the optimization of aerodynamic shapes. It first introduces HGAs, a particular instance of parallel GAs based on the notion of interconnected sub-populations evolving independently. Previous studies have shown the advantages of introducing a multi-layered hierarchical topology in parallel GAs. Such a topology allows the use of multiple models for optimization problems, and shows that it is possible to mix fast low-fidelity models for exploration and expensive high-fidelity models for exploitation. Finally, a new class of multi-objective optimizers mixing HGAs and Nash Game Theory is defined. These methods are tested for solving design optimization problems in aerodynamics. A parallel version of this approach running a cluster of PCs demonstrate the convergence speed up on an inverse nozzle problem and a high-lift problem for a multiple element airfoil.

This paper introduces a method based on nonlinear predictive control to design optimal surfaces for sliding mode tracking control of underactuated unmanned surface vessel systems. The time-invariant parameters of the sliding mode control first- and second-order surfaces are selected to achieve an optimal performance objective, such as minimum tracking error or minimum energy. The method is demonstrated using simulations based on an experimental USV system.

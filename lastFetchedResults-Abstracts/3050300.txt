In this paper, we propose a temporal error concealment algorithm for video transmission in an error-prone environment. The error concealment algorithm employed an edge detection algorithm and progressive median motion vector concealment. First, the edges are detected and concealed portion by portion. Then, the corrupted MB is partitioned by the reconstructed edges and each partition is concealed by progressive median motion vector individually. The proposed algorithm shows better performance on both objective and subjective quality over the existing temporal error concealment algorithm

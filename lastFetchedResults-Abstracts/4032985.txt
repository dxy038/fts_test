This paper presents two methods for optimizing system dynamics models of social systems, using the Forrester world model as the vehicle of demonstration. Specifically, the extensions necessary to apply 1) parameter optimization techniques and 2) the variational calculus are discussed together with resultant implications for the behavior of the world model. It is proposed that such analytical techniques generate additional objective information and insights regarding model behavior and hence may contribute to subjective deliberations regarding model validity and utility.

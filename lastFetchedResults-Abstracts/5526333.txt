The National Research Council carries out a "decadal survey" in planetary science. The objective is to recommend a decade-long national strategy for solar system exploration for NASA and the NSF. The most recent planetary decadal survey has placed particular emphasis on formulating a strategy that can realistically be implemented with the funds expected to be available for NASA and the NSF in the decade from 2013 to 2022. The plan also includes recommendations regarding funding for research and analysis, technology development, ground-based and orbital telescope facilities, and other topics.

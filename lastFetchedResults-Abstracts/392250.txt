Objective: The aim of this study is to describe the long-term outcome of preserved hearing after vestibular schwannoma surgery.
Methods: Subjects are 20 unilateral vestibular schwannoma patients whose class A hearing of the AAO-HNS classification was preserved successfully after tumor removal. Hearing preservation surgery was attempted via the middle cranial fossa (MCF) or the extended MCF approach. The follow-up periods ranged from 2 to 16 years. The outcome measures included the pure tone average (PTA) and speech discrimination score (SDS).
Results: PTA was maintained in less than 30 dB in 11 out of 20 patients within 2 years follow-up, six out of 13 patients within 4 years follow-up, and two out of five patients within 6 years follow-up, respectively. SDS was maintained in more than 70% in 17 out of 20 patients within 2 years follow-up, ten out of 13 patients within 4 years follow-up, and three out of five patients within 6 years follow-up, respectively.
Conclusions: The preserved hearing maintained about more than 40% of the patients with the class A hearing in every 2 years follow-up. From this result, we can conclude that the hearing preservation surgery could be one of the best treatments for vestibular schwannoma patients with class A hearing. However, further study will be needed to clarify the mechanism of the deterioration in hearing after hearing preservation surgery.

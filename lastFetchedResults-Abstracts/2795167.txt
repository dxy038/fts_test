This paper tried to find a method to evaluate the interactive whiteboard classroom records in primary and secondary schools objectively. An evaluation model was constructed based on coding, clustering and comparison. A table of important teaching and learning behaviors was created for coding. The coding results showed that the features of the good classroom teaching are not the same. The fuzzy clustering algorithm was used to divide the good classroom teaching into several clusters, and the cluster-center was used to represent the clusterÂ´s feature. The correlation analysis was used to compare the unknown-level encode data with the cluster-center data. If they were similar, it can be inferred that the unknown-level classroom records were very likely good too. Otherwise, the unknowns very likely were not good. The simulation results showed that this method was effective. The model had an advantage on objective comparison to decide which one was worse.

In this paper, a Spatiotemporal Probabilistic Neural Network (SPNN) is proposed for spatiotemporal pattern recognition. This new model is developed by applying the concept of Gaussian density function to the network structure of the SPR (Spatiotemporal Pattern Recognition). The main advantages of this new model include faster training and recalling process for patterns, and the overall architecture is also simple, modular, regular, locally connected for VLSI implementation. The CMOS current-mode IC technology is used to implement the SPNN to achieve the objective of minimum classification error in a more direct manner. In this design, neural computation is performed in analog circuits while template information is stored in digital circuits. One set of independent speaker isolated (Mandarin digit) speech database is used as an example to demonstrate the superiority of the neural networks for spatiotemporal pattern recognition

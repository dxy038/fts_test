BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The nature and concept of death are not inexistence but transfer. Death is a transfer from the living world to the Hereafter and is an undeniable fact that encompasses every existing phenomenon. Qur'an mentions the death in different terms and emphasizes that the body and sprite of human beings are fully taken and nothing of them is scattered and lost. The man's death is determinate and imminent fate that nobody can escape from it with relying upon any position. However, the appearance of death and facing to it is not the same for all humans and the conditions of different people are various in moribund time.  Death moment â€“ death agony in Qur'an- is hardly described in verses and traditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the moment of soul separation of human, death and its states.   
METHODS: Agony of death and different reactions of moribund people were investigated in this study based on religious sources, Qur'an, Bharalanvar, Nahjolbalaghe and using keywords.
FINDINGS: Most people always remember the death as uncertain fate, think death equals destruction and the life after death is meaningless, fear the remembrance of death and escape from it because the life amuses them.  Certainly, Qur'an declares the death will come and this is a certain and undeniable fact for every living being but most people are scared of it and it can have multiple causes.
CONCLUSION: The concept of death for everyone is according to his life. It means that the perception of life and death plays an important role and the death time is different for each group of people. (Relatively) losing any person's life is based on his performance and accords with his beliefs and intents.  The role of inclinations to the body, family, property and world is undeniable.

The objective of this research is to develop a new hierarchical optimization-based design framework for balanced coordinated algorithms addressing robust sensor network information distribution problems so that the optimal responses to network damages and the optimal resource allocation will be achieved. In particular, this research will involve a two-stage hierarchical design in which the first stage is a network topology design for robustness and efficiency of connection in the network while the second stage is an optimal weight design for network graphs characterizing efficiency of information dissemination based on the graph topology obtained in the first stage. We convert the first stage design into a multi-objective optimization problem and the second stage design into a constrained optimization problem. To solve both proposed optimization problems, we develop a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) based stochastic algorithm to approximate optimal solutions of the multi-objective optimization problem and a semistable optimal control approach to solve the constrained optimization problem.

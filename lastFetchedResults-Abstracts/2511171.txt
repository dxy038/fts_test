AbstractThe objective of the present study was the utilization of cotton stalk residues for medium density fiberboard production. MDF was produced applying Three press temperatures (170, 180, and 190 oC ) and three pressing times (3,4 and 5 minutes) were used to produce medium density fiberboard (MDF) from cotton stalks fibers. The properties of the laboratory boards were measured and the results are analyzed applying factorial experiment and randomized design. In case, the statistical difference was observed between the averages, then Duncan Multiple Range Test was used for grouping the averages. The results showed that as either press temperature or press time is increased, the modulus of rupture of the of the boards was significantly improved and the highest value was reached when 190 oC press temperature and 5 minutes press time was applied. The internal bonding of the boards was significantly higher when 180 oC press temperature was applied. The effect of press temperature on thickness swelling after 2 and 24 hours immersion in water was statistically significant and the lowest values were obtained when 190 oC press temperature was used. The results of this study indicated that the cotton stalks can be considered as a potential raw material for medium density fiberboard production and the properties of the boards meets the EN requirements.

Tuberculous tenosynovitis involving the tendons of the feet is very rare. Isolated primary tuberculous tenosynovitis of the Achilles tendon was detected in two women aged 19 and 53 years, respectively. The younger patient had a swollen and painful Achilles tendon in the left foot. Complete excision of the lesion followed by antitubercu-lous chemotherapy for six months resulted in complete improvement. Magnetic resonance imaging showed normal findings at the end of six months and no recurrence after 27 months of follow-up. The older patient had diabetes and was on cytostatic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. She had difficulty in squatting and climbing stairs due to swelling and pain in the right ankle. She underwent abscess drainage and excision of the cystic mass. Despite disappearance of symptoms in the affected ankle in the course of antituberculous chemotherapy, she died due to miliary tuberculosis in the sixth month. Tuberculous teno-synovitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients suffering from persistent swelling and pain in the hind foot.

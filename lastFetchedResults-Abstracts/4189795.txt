This paper proposes an object-based image retrieval using a method based on visual pattern matching. A visual pattern is obtained by detecting the line edge from a square block using the moment-preserving edge detector. It is desirable and yet remains as a challenge for querying multimedia data by finding an object inside a target image. Given an object model, an added difficulty is that the object might be translated, rotated, and scaled inside a target image. Instead of segmentation and detailed object representation, the objective of this research is to develop and apply computer vision methods that explore the structure of an image object by visual pattern detection to retrieve images from a database. A voting scheme based on generalized Hough transform is proposed to provide object search method, which is invariant to the translation, rotation, scaling of image data. Computer simulation results show that the proposed method gives good performance in terms of retrieval accuracy and robustness.

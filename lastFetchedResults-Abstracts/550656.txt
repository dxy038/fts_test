Purpose: The objective of our study was so to show the impact of different chemotherapy regimens on induction of amenorrhea (CIA) in premenopausal women with breast cancer at different 1 ages. Method: This is a follow-up study in 226 premenopausal women with breast cancer, who received one of the three groups of chemotherapy regimens: Conventional (CMF), antracyclinebased, and anthracycline-Taxanes based. They were evaluated for incidence of CIA in the follow-up clinic of jCBGIranain Center for Braest Cancer (ICBC). Statistical analysis using SPSS software was performed and logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of CIA. Results: From 226 patients with a median age of 40 yrs (26-56 yrs) who participated in this study, 154 patients (68.1%) were developed CIA, which in 101 patients (65.6%), CIA was established and never resumed. CIA was present in 52.5% of patients treated with conventional regimens (CMF), in 66.7% of patients treated with anthracyclines and in 78.7% of patients treated with anthracycline-taxan. So the frequency of CIA was significantly higher in Taxanes based chemotherapy group than the others (p=0.015). Although a slightly superior incidence of CIA in patients with hormone-insensitive tumors (ER-and PR-) versus hormone-sensitive tumors (ER+/or PR+) treated with combination regimens was observed, no statistically significant difference was found (p=0.629). From all the risk factors that were evaluated, anthracycline-taxan based regimen (OR: 44-4.059, CI95%:4.6-10.^ 1.6-9.8) and age>40 yrs (OR: CI95%: 4-:7-6.41.9-6.6) were the most important factors in developing CIA in
the study. Conclusion: The type of chemotherapy and age at the breast cancer diagnosis are the most important risk factors in CIA and Taxanes-based regimens induced more CIA than the other regimens. Key words: chemotherapyinduced amenorrhea, Taxanes, breast cancer

One of the most significant issues discussed in both religion and science is the first creation of man and his generation. To prove consistency of Islam with the scientific beliefs in this respect can undoubtedly contribute to promotion of Islam, which serves as the major objective of the present research. Using a descriptive-analytic methodology, this paper seeks to examine Darwin’s theory of human evolution based on the outlook of Allameh Tabataba’i, the great philosopher and exegete of the world of Islam, as provided in Al-M?z?n Commentary. According to Allameh’s view, the verses of the Quran explicitly state that all human beings are decedents of Adam and Eve and are created through natural processes. However, the physical aspect of the creation of Adam and Eve is autonomous and directly from soil and mud and the spiritual aspect of their creation refers to the Divine Will and Divine Breathing. According to Darwin’s theory of evolution, man evolved from other animals as a result of the environmental requirements. One should admit, however, that this remains a scientific hypothesis which has not reached the level of scientific proof and certainty, as their proponents have failed to provide convincing responses to the challenges posed by scientists, philosophers and religious scholars. In view of Allameh Tabataba’i, there is consistency between science and religion and the theory of evolution remains a scientific hypothesis for which there is no absolute support, and even on the condition that it be true and given that it be supported by scientific and absolute evidence, the outward meaning of some verses of the Quran which reject this theory is open to interpretation.

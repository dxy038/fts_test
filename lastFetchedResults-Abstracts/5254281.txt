Green Cloud Computing aims at a processing infrastructure that combines flexibility, quality of services, and reduced energy utilization. In order to achieve this objective, the management solution must regulate the internal settings to address the pressing issue of data center over-provisioning related to the need to match the peak demand. In this context, we propose an integrated solution for resource management based on organization models of autonomous agent components. This work introduces the system management model, analyzes the systemÂ´s behavior, describes the operation principles, and presents a use case scenario. To simulate the approach of organization, theory and implementation of migration policies and reallocation changes were made as improvements in the code of CloudSim framework.

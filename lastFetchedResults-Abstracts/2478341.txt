BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic renal failure may affect the oral cavity because of the variety of metabolic and pathophysiologic changes. The aim of this study was to compare the xerostomia  in  unstimulated and pilocarpine-stimulated whole saliva of hemodialysis patients with the control group.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 30 hemodialysis patients aged range of 35 to 65 and 30 healthy volunteers as control group. Patientsâ€™ individual data such as age, sex and duration of hemodialysis and their complaining of xerostomia, taste change and malodor were recorded. The xerostomia status of patients was evaluated by filling out the standard questionnaires. To determine the salivary changes unstimulated and pilocarpine-stimulated whole saliva was collected from both the patient and the control groups..
FINDINGS: Complaining of xerostomia was the most common oral manifestations among the patients. Dry mouth , taste change and malodor were recorded in 19 (63.3%), 14 (46.7%) and 14 (46.7%) of the patients, respectively. The unstimulated whole saliva was significantly lower in hemodialysis patients compared toin the  control group (p < 0.05). In addition, stimulated whole saliva was significantly lower in patients underwent hemodialysis (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the decrease of unstimulated and pilocarpine-stimulated whole saliva in hemodialysis patients compared to the control group may cause xerostomia in these patients.

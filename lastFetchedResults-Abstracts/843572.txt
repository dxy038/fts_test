A map modelling a discrete bidirectional associative memory neural network with delays is investigated. Its dynamics is studied in terms of local analysis and Hopf bifurcation analysis. By analyzing the associated characteristic equation, its linear stability is investigated and Hopf bifurcations are demonstrated. It is found that there exist Hopf bifurcations when the delay passes a sequence of critical values. Numerical simulation is performed to verify the analytical results.

Green Information Technology has recently become one of the main focuses in research and practice with its primary goal to reduce power consumption. This research will contribute to Green IT by efficiently managing personal computer (PC) power consumption in an organization. The objective of this research is to explore the factors surrounding PCs which may affect their power consumption. Observations, interviews, and a survey were conducted at the Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) campus to collect vital data. A monitoring service tool will be deployed to log PC usage activities and power transition events. This data will be used to draw meaningful conclusions on users´ behavior toward shutting down PCs after using them. The preliminary monitoring result of power event transition in one of UTP´s computer labs shows that more than 30 percent of PCs were left powered on after usage had ceased.

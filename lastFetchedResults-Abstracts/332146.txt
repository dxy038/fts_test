A computer controlled dental anesthetic delivery system was studied with the Objective of evaluating and comparing the unit to the traditional method of anesthetic delivery. The research design and Method  of study involved the use of trained dentists who used both types of delivery systems on patients seen during their routine practice of dentistry. After the dental appointment was finished each dentist completed a survey concerning the injection. Patients completed a survey before the injection concerning their previous anesthetic experiences and completed another survey at the end of the dental appointment concerning the injection they had just received. Statistical analyses yielded Results showing the two methods were rated very similarly by both patients and dentists. Conclusions  resulting from the study are that computer controlled dental anesthetic injections and traditional anesthetic injections were accepted equally well by both dentists and patients.

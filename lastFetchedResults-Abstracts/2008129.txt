The objective of this study was to elucidate the impact of a change in fish consumption on the intake of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by Japanese women. A probabilistic assessment model for EPA&amp;DHA intake was first proposed to describe the relationship between fish consumption and EPA&amp;DHA intake, and was compared with the survey data. Various scenarios were designed for women representing potential responses to an advisory on fish consumption recently issued in order to avoid risks associated with intake of methyl mercury (MeHg). Elimination of women's consumption of fish species with high and medium levels of MeHg resulted in a reduction of EPA&amp;DHA intake from 0.85 g/d to 0.82 g/d. The percentage of women with an EPA and DHA intake over 0.25 g/d also decreased from 99.5% to 99.0%. The model results suggested that the changes in fish consumption related to MeHg advisories have a minor influence on the intake of EPA&amp;DHA and on the percentage of women with EPA&amp;DHA intake exceeding the guideline for Japanese women. Nevertheless this simulation could aid the selection of fish species in order to ensure adequate intake of EPA&amp;DHA while minimizing exposure to MeHg.

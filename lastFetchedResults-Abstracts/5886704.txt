Differential evolution (DE) is population based, direct search, global optimization new algorithm. DE is simple and efficient, so solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOP) using DE has become a new hot research topic. It was found in the research process that there are deteriorations in the process of solving MOP based on DE. Due to deterioration occurs, thus the convergence can no longer be guaranteed for the algorithm, and the efficiency is reduced for solving. This paper proposed resolve methods correspond to these two deteriorations. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

We study minimum latency multiflow scheduling in duty-cycling multi-hop wireless networks. Given a set of multi-hop flows in duty-cycling wireless networks, each flow has a source node and a destination node, the objective is to schedule all multi-hop flows within a minimum latency. Under the uncoordinated duty-cycling model, we design transmission scheduling that can achieve a small constant factor of the optimal latency. The approximation ratio is independent of the period length p where p is the period length of duty-cycling networks. We also propose a duty-cycle-aware multiflow scheduling method based on node coloring. Finally, we study the routing and scheduling for multi-hop multiflow in wireless networks where each node has a full duty-cycle.

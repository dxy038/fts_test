Objective: Tempromandibular disorder (TMD), is a kind of disease that results from occlusal interferences and psychological factors. Because there were controversy about the role of occlusal interferences and psychological disordres in TMD, we decided to investigate the most important causes of TMD. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of occlusal interferences and psychological factors in TMD patients and individuals without TMD symptoms.

Subjects and Methods: Two grous of 37 (sex- and age-matched) subjects, with and without TMD symptoms were selected in this study. Patients in this study required full dental occlusal. The subjects were given HAD scale test for assessment amount of anxiety and depression. They were examined clinically for assessment occlusal interferences in centric, working, non working and protrusive situation.

Results: Results of this study showed that there was no meaningful differences between occlusal differences in both case and control groups (p>0.05) but there was significant difference in the psychological disorders between the case and control groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Results of this study showed that occlusal interferences plays as a cofactor in producing TMD, because cclusal interferences are relatively prevalent among the general population, who also are free of TMD sign and symptom and psychological factors play a more important role in the development of TMD.

The robust design of non-linear structures with path-dependent response is stated as a two-criteria optimization problem and is solved by the method of mathematical programming. To this end, the perturbation technique is applied in conjunction with the incremental loading procedure for the response moment analysis of path-dependent non-linear structural systems with random parameters. Furthermore, the sensitivities of mean and variance of the structural performance function are evaluated using direct differentiation in the framework of perturbation based stochastic finite element analysis. By introducing a weighting factor in the compound objective––resp. desirability function, and feasibility indices in the constraints, the mathematical model of structural robust design problem is formulated and is solved with a gradient-based algorithm. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of the presented method.

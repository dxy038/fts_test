This investigation proposes an improved particle swam optimization (PSO) approach to solve the resource-constrained scheduling problem. Two proposed rules named delay local search rule and bidirectional scheduling rule for PSO to solve scheduling problem are proposed and evaluated. These two suggested rules applied in proposed PSO facilitate finding global minimum (minimum makespan). The delay local search enables some activities delayed and altering the decided start processing time, and being capable of escaping from local minimum. The bidirectional scheduling rule which combines forward and backward scheduling to expand the searching area in the solution space for obtaining potential optimal solution. Moreover, to speed up the production of feasible solution, a critical path is adopted in this study. The critical path method is used to generate heuristic value in scheduling process. The simulation results reveal that the proposed approach in this investigation is novel and efficient for resource-constrained class scheduling problem.

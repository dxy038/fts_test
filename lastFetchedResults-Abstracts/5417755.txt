Recent advances in micro/nanotechnology devices have demonstrated periodic line-space structure with dimensions of order less than ten nm. Laser scatterometry is a noncontact measurement method for collecting and analyzing of scattered light from the structures. Methods using laser scatterometry can characterize periodic line-space structures. The objective of this paper is three-fold: (1) characterization of laser beam quality which is used for optical metrology; (2) optical characterization of periodic line-space structures; (3) some conclusions regarding experimental results are presented.

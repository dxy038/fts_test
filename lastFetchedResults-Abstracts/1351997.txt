The objective of the European 6th framework Integrated Project (IP) EUROTRANS (EUROpean Research Programme for the TRANSmutation of High Level Nuclear Waste in an Accelerator Driven System) is to demonstrate the feasibility of transmutation of high level nuclear waste using subcritical Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS). The spallation target represents the most challenging new component in an ADS since it is the component coupling the accelerator and the nuclear core and is subjected to very high thermal load in a high radiation field. In this document the thermal hydraulic activities which led to reliable design rules for a windowless target are presented and the status of the heavy liquid metal target mock-up experiment at the KArlsruhe Liquid metal LAboratory (KALLA) are reported.

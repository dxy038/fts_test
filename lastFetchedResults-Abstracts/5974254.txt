OBJECTIVE: To find a method which establish the identity of given person based on the EEG, and the rates of identification were satisfied. METHOD: Several signal processing methods were proposed to use for feature extraction, such as Welch arithmetic, Wavelet transform, and multi layer BP neural network was used for classification of person identification. RESULT: Satisfactory results were obtain with more than 80 percent identification rate for different participators, and identification of specific frequency was done, where with 21-30 Hz of participators was highest in contribution. CONCLUSION: EEG which was proposed to used for person identification could be used by persons with Disabilities and the general public, so it have better adaptation.

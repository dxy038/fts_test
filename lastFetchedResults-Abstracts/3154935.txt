In this paper, China´s major passenger car market is classified by the objective criterion. Through the regression analysis of 135 models market data, the passenger car market is divided into five categories by value and size. The value of each segment was estimated, and the total value of China´s major passenger car market is estimated not less than 18 billion Yuan. We can get the conclusion that the model relationship in the same segment of the model is competing, and the relationship between models which are not in the same market segments is weak competing. It is important significance for the companies to determine their market orientation.

Optical and electronic components of image forming devices degrade objective and subjective quality of the acquired or reproduced images. Classical restoration techniques usually require an explicit estimation or measurement of parameters for each error source. We propose to derive restoration parameters in a training phase with suitable test patterns for a particular system to be corrected. Space varying properties of different classes of image degradations are considered simultaneously. It is shown how training is performed in such a way that colors are reproduced correctly independently of the used test patterns.

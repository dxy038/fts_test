Traditional interaction devices such as mouse and keyboard do not adapt very well to 3D environments, since they were not ergonomically designed for it [1]. The user may be standing or in movement and these devices were projected to work on desks. To solve such problems it has been designed a Accelerometer based 3D virtual glove which can be used in various robotic applications [1].
In this project it can be designed a Pick and Place robot which will follow the 3D glove worn by the user. User can design UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, PICK and PLACE actions via wireless glove. Moreover, in the current interaction model for immersive environments, which is based on wands and 3D mice, a change of context is necessary every time to execute a non-immersive task. These constant context changes from immersive to 2D desktops introduce a rupture in the user interaction with the application [3]. The objective of this work is to develop a device that maps a touch interface in a virtual reality immersive environment. In order to interact in3D virtual reality immersive environments a wireless glove (v-Glove) was created, which has two main functionalities: tracking the position of the userâ€™s index finger and vibrate the fingertip when it reaches an area mapped in the interaction space to simulate a touch feeling. Quantitative and qualitative analysis were performed with users to evaluate the v-Glove, comparing it with a gyroscopic 3D mouse [2].
This project is ideally suited for critical applications such as Gas plants, Chemical Plants, Nuclear reactors and for hazardous applications such as Coal mines, Sulphur mines, under sea tunnels Oil mints etc.

The objective is to introduce fast-Fourier-transform based algorithms for the computation of the bispectrum of deterministic real signals on polar rasters, in the triangular region that corresponds to angle 0&#176;&lt;&#952;&lt;45&#176;. This region is enough for a completed description of the bispectrum. These algorithms compute the bispectral values by employing the time-domain signal directly. Three different algorithms are described and compared: the direct approach, the zero-padding approach, and the super-FET approach. A generalization of these three algorithms for efficient computation of the trispectrum is also given

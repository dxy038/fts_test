The aim of this paper is to present a full system on chip (SoC) solution for electrical actuator control. The implemented controller is based on Actel fusion field programmable gate array (FPGA). The objective of this work is to evaluate the ability of the proposed SoC solution to ensure all the required performances in such applications, especially in terms of integration capacity and time/area performances. To this purpose, a current control algorithm for a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) has been implemented. This machine is associated with a resolver position sensor. In addition to the current control closed-loop, all the necessary motor control tasks are implemented in the same SoC fusion device. The analog to digital conversion is ensured by the integrated analog to digital converter (ADC) avoiding the use of external converters. The resolver processing unit (RPU), which computes the rotor position and speed from the resolver signals, is implemented in the FPGA matrix, avoiding the use of external resolver to digital converter (RDC). The sine patterns used for the Park transformation are stored in the integrated flash memory blocks.

This paper presents a methodology for evaluating teleprotection system applying statistical process control techniques. The system was installed in a power transmission line at CTEEP (a Brazilian transmission utility), where it was implemented an information acquisition system from protective relays and teleprotection equipment. The information are automatically collected, synchronized by GPS and stored in a database. The objective of the system is to obtain information to be processed through statistical techniques to evaluate teleprotection system performance and conditions, assisting management of teleprotection maintenance.

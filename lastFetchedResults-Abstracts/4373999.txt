Locating access point (AP) and achieving wireless network covering with the fewest access points is a difficult research point in the wireless local area network (WLAN) design. The cost of organizing WLAN can be reduced effectively if the problem is resolved. Based on analyzing the transmission model of WLAN, a new optimized model was built. The improved adaptive genetic algorithm (IAGA) was introduced at the same time. It is able to optimize multi-objective constrained problem and determine the distribution of each AP of WLAN. Through computing the examples, the simulation result displays the efficiency of the scheme evidently

Objective: To assess tuberculin skin testing practices of physicians after community-wide screening of 1400 children exposed to a pediatrician with active tuberculosis (TB).
Design: A self-administered questionnaire.
Setting: Medium-sized city in eastern Pennsylvania.
Participants: Pediatricians and family practitioners seeing pediatric patients.
Main Outcome Measures: Percentages of physicians who followed published recommendations for placement and reading of TB skin tests published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Results: Questionnaires were completed by 60/80 (75%) physicians. The 60 physicians had practiced a mean of 17 years (range 3â€“38 years), and only one did not do TB skin testing for pediatric patients. The 59 physicians doing TB skin testing reported routinely tuberculin testing more than 900 children per month. Only 8/59 (14%) physicians followed published guidelines for placement and reading of tuberculin tests. Those physicians screened 158 (17%) of the pediatric patients undergoing TB skin testing in a typical month.
Conclusion: In this community where a highly publicized TB case prompted massive pediatric screening, most physicians seeing children in private practice do not follow standard TB skin testing guidelines. Increased understanding of how private-practice physicians learn about and decide to use recommended standards are needed if tuberculin tests are to be correctly performed and TB appropriately diagnosed.

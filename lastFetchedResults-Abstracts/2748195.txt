This paper details the design of an 8-lane bidirectional link for both within-the-box and external communications in 22 nm CMOS technology. A low profile connector with a high density cable assembly ensure a data rate of up to 32 Gb/s per lane while maintaining channel loss below 25 dB. Channel equalization is performed by a combination of a 3-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE), single-stage continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and a 6-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). Collaborative timing recovery is used to enable lane characterization without degrading jitter performance. Phase error decimation, with a conditional phase detection scheme, is used to reduce the DFE complexity by 50%. Power consumption over a wide range of data rates from 4 to 32 Gb/s is reduced by using regulated CMOS clocking with lane bundling, low swing transmitter with a source-series terminated (SST) driver and a highly reconfigurable receiver with an active inductor CTLE. At a lane data rate of 32 Gb/s, over a 0.5 m cable with 16 dB of loss, a transceiver lane consumes 205 mW from a 1.07 V supply. The power scales down to 26 mW from a 0.72 V supply at 8 Gb/s, when transmitting over a channel with 8 dB loss. The active silicon area per lane is 0.079 mm<sup>2</sup>.

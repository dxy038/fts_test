In this paper, the necessity of introducing device discovery mechanism into lighting control system is analyzed, objective evaluations to the device discovery approach of traditional lighting control system is given, then their defects are pointed out. A device discovery mechanism appropriate to lighting control system is proposed, and we make it as an important judgment for measuring the device discovery mechanism of network lighting control system. At last, a feasible and effective discovery mechanism for next-generation lighting control system is supposed.

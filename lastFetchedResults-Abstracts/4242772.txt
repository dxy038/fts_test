Electrical vehicles (EVs) have drawn much attention recently. The appropriate energy resource to charge EVs is one of the key factors in EVs´ development. On the other hand, how to reduce abandoned wind energy is one of the main problems in wind power application. The conception and the benefits of &#8220;wind-EV complementation&#8221; are presented in this paper from the viewpoint of transmission grid. A mathematical model of EVs charging/discharging in aggregator mode is presented, based on which the problem of how to reduce abandoned wind energy is researched. The simulation results of the coordinated and uncoordinated charging, different EVs penetration and different charging modes (unidirectional and bidirectional mode) are compared in reducing abandoned wind energy. It can be concluded that with more EVs´ total charging capacity and higher wind energy proportion to the charging energy, the abandoned wind energy will be less and the &#8220;wind-EV complementation&#8221; effect will be better. Finally, the benefits of &#8220;wind-EV complementation&#8221; are concluded and the future research prospects are pointed out.

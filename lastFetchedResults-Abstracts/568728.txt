Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading major causes of death in the world. Coronary angiography is the most important routine diagnostic procedure for coronary artery disease.
Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the effect of bed-rest duration time and sandbag time on hematoma and hemorrhage after coronary angiography.
Methods: This study is a randomized clinical trial. Patients undergoing nonemergency angiography via the femoral artery are randomly assigned into intervention (65 patients) or control group (65patients). The patients in the intervention group are allowed to be out of bed after 4 hours. The sand bags are taken off two hours later. The patients in the control group received routine care. Hematoma and hemorrhage were measured at regular intervals after the procedure.
Results: In intervention group bleeding occurred in one patient in four hour and one patient immediately after coming to ward in control group. In intervention group hematoma occurred in one patient in two hour and in control group one patient in one and two hours and two patients in four hours. The Chi square test showed no statistically significant difference between groups.
Conclusion: This study showed no relationship between increased chance of hematoma and hemorrhage and bed-rest for four hours and sandbag applied for two hours in patients undergoing angiography.

Objective of the present study was to estimate the genetic parameters and (co)variance
components for different economic traits in Malpura sheep. The traits analyzed were birth
weight (BWT), weaning weight (WWT), 6-month weight (6WT), average daily gain from
birth to weaning (ADG1), average daily gain from weaning to 6-month (ADG2), average daily
gain from birth to 6-month (ADG3), Kleiber ratio from birth to weaning (KR1), Kleiber ratio
from weaning to 6-month (KR2) and Kleiber ratio from birth to 6-month (KR3). Six different
animal models including or ignoring maternal genetic or permanent environmental effects
were fitted for all traits. Akaike information criterion (AIC) was applied to determine the
most appropriate model for each trait. For BWT, WWT, 6WT, ADG1, ADG2 and KR2 the model
including permanent environmental effects due to ewe over direct genetic effects was the
most appropriate. Model which included only direct genetic effects was the best model
for ADG3, KR1 and KR3. Direct heritability estimates of 0.21, 0.24, 0.23, 0.23, 0.13, 0.22,
0.20, 0.12 and 0.23 were obtained for BW, WW, 6MW, ADG1, ADG2, ADG3, KR1, KR2 and
KR3, respectively. Ratios of phenotypic variance due to maternal permanent environmental
effects were 0.24, 0.07, 0.01, and 0.05 for BW, WWT, 6WT and ADG1, respectively. Estimates
of direct genetic correlation were very low to high in magnitude and varied from
−0.27 for
BW–KR2 to 0.97 for ADG1–KR1. Estimates of phenotypic correlation were very low to high
in magnitude and varied from
−0.27 for WW–KR2 to 0.96 for ADG3–KR3. The moderate
estimate of direct heritability for body weight, growth rate and Kleiber ratio suggests that
Malpura sheep can be improved through selection for economic mutton production.

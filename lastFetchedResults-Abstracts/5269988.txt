In this paper, the nonlinear optimal control problem is formulated as a multi-objective mathematical optimization problem. Bacterial Chemotaxis (BC) algorithm is one of the new heuristic algorithms based on colony intelligence. The BC optimization algorithm is introduced for the first time in solving the nonlinear optimal control problem. A case on the nonlinear optimal control problem is presented to show the methodologyÂ´s feasibility and efficiency, compared with the existing optimal planning methods, the search time of the BC optimization algorithm is shorter and the result is close to the ideal solution, simultaneously.

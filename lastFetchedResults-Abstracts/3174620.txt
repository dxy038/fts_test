In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to mitigate unbalanced voltage sag with phase jumps by Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) with minimum real power injection. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been used to find the solution of the objective function derived for minimizing real power injection of UPQC along with the specified constraints. The proposed method is validated through detailed simulation studies.

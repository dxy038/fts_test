The microstrip u-shape patch antennas are gaining attenuation in various WiMAX applications since last two decade. The u-shape Microstrip antenna has become a rapidly growing area of research with their potential application like mobiles and satellite communication. In this paper design of u-shape microstrip antennas is proposed at 2.5 GHz. It can be used in WiMAX communication systems. The objective of this paper is to analyze, design and validate rectangular u-shape microstrip patch antenna. The substrate material rogers RT/duroid 5880 with permittivity of 2.2 and dielectric loss tangent 0.0009 is selected for u-shape microstrip patch antenna design. The HFSS 13 based model is proposed to measured different bandwidths and gain for different dimensions.

A semi-analytical method, the so-called Scaled Boundary Finite-Element Method (SBFEM) is employed for solving two-dimensional steady-state reaction-diffusion equation with constant diffusion and decay coefficients which are widely used in contaminant transfer, chemical engineering and heat transfer problems. This method has been successfully applied to various problems of engineering such as elastodynamics, fracture mechanics and seepage. This method has the advantages of both boundary element method and finite-element method. Only the boundary is discretized reducing the spatial dimension by one. Unlike the boundary element method no fundamental solution is required. Interpolation over the boundaries is approximated using shape functions the same as in the finite-element method. Singularities, anisotropic problems, non-homogeneities satisfying similarity and radiation condition at infinity used in modeling unbounded domains are simply modeled by this technique. In this study, after derivation of the scaled boundary finite-element formulations for reactionâ€“diffusion equation, the equations are solved using the proposed solution procedures. The accuracy and performance of the SBFEM is evaluated using three numerical examples. Reasonable agreement exists between the results of the scaled boundary finite-element method, the analytical solutions and the popular numerical approaches.

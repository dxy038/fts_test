In this paper, a comparison of six representative topologies for the implementation of Solid State Transformers (SST) is performed. The objective is to help identify the most suitable topology capable of supporting additional functionalities as compared to a regular transformer, e.g. on-demand reactive power support to grid, voltage regulation, and current limiting. The comparison is based on switch loss, switch count, control characteristics and supported functionalities. It has been concluded that a three-stage configuration comprising distinct AC-DC, DC-DC and DC-AC stages results in the most suitable implementation. A Simulink model corresponding to this three-stage configuration is developed to demonstrate the desired characteristics and functionalities of the SST.

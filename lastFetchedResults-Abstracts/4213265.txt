The Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) to collision avoidance is a well-known and elegant method in the mobile robotics field. It provides a collision-free navigation between obstacles, and takes the dynamic properties of the robot into account. Numerous variants had been proposed for this approach, most of them are using an objective function consisting of weighted terms. The solution named Global Dynamic Window Approach with Receding Horizon Control (GDWA/RHC) uses a global navigation function - which is a scalar-valued function representing the distance from the goal point - as the objective function. In this paper, a real-world implementation of the DWA and the GDWA/RHC methods is introduced.

Objective(s): To determine the prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea and different treatment practices among college students in Sirjan.
Methods: The study was designed as a cross-sectional. 390 students selected by multistage sampling completed anonymous questionnaires for this survey.
Results: The reported prevalence of dysmenorrhea among students was 79.9%. There was a significant association between dysmenorrhea in students and experience of similar disorders in their mothers and sisters (P=0.02). 74.8% of those with dysmenorrhea reported that it limited their activities. The most common drugs used to treat dysmenorrhea were those of the NSAID family (42.6%).
Conclusion: The results of this study confirm the previous epidemiologic findings. Prevalence of dysmenorrhea among students is high, and these people lack sufficient knowledge to confront the problem effectively. Raising students' awareness and effective treatment measures should be considered as a priority. A wide range of professionals including teachers, health educators, doctors and nurses can play a role in this process.

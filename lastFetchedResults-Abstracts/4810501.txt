In this paper the authors analyse the algorithms and the relevant numerical optimisation techniques for the design of magnetic power devices, with reference to axial flux PM machines. Some numerical optimisation algorithms are briefly reviewed, such as the simplex method, the Powell method, the genetic algorithms, and their applications to the design technique are described. Objective functions to be minimised are discussed, such as mean torque, power losses, total weight. Numerical results allowed to evaluate the efficiency and the reliability of each method

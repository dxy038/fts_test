The development of mobile communication technologies and smart portable device has great impact on the society, which makes the ubiquitous computing and seamless service come true. However, a major challenge is that how to provide a software platform supporting personalized and context-aware services and applications. Research on universal service terminal (UST) aims at providing light-weight application layer to enable the interconnection between the terminals and providing user with always the best service experience (ABE). In this paper, we propose a dynamic aggregation mechanism, which introduces the multi-objective optimal functions to optimize the user satisfaction. Furthermore, a rapid optimal algorithm based on simulated annealing algorithm is provided to improve the search efficiency.

ntroduction & Objective: Prostate cancer is the forth common
cancer in the world with different prevalence rate based on age,
race and geographic area. Prevalence of prostate cancer in
patients with PSA between 4-10ng/ml is reported to be about 20%
in some studies. The aim of this study was to define the prevalence
of prostate cancer in patients with 4-10 ng/ml PSA. in different age
groups, based on Gleason grade.
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional descriptive-analytic
study, after taking informed consent, TRUS (Tran rectal ultrasound
biopsy) was done in all patients with PSA of 4-10 ng/ml who
referred to Labafinejad hospital from 2005 to 2006. Their pathology
was classified into 3 groups, from 1-10, according to Gleason
grade. Patients with cancers were divided into three groups; 50-60,
60-70 and 70-80 years old, according to their age. Collected data
were analyzed with SPSS software and descriptive tests.
Results: Prevalence of prostate cancer in 155 studied patients that
underwent TRUS biopsy was 17.4%. Considering the age of
patients, the rate of prostate cancer was 29%, 48.1% and 22.2% in
50-60, 60-70, and 70-80 years old patients. According to Gleason
grade, the rate of prostate cancer was 3,7%, 74% and 22.2% in
grades 1-4, 5-7 and 8-10, respectively.
Conclusion: Prevalence of prostate cancer in patients with PSA
between 4-10 ng/ml in this study was 17.4 percent and most of
these patients were in 50-60 year-old age groups and have
Gleason grade less than 7. The majority of these patients are
curable by radical prostatectomy.

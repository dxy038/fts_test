This paper contributes to objective video quality assessment of broadcasted HDTV content without reference. In this context we present a new No-Reference video quality metric taking into account the behavior of Human Visual System. This new metric called WMBER is based on macro-blocks error detection weighted by saliency maps computed at the decoder side. Moreover, both macro-block error detection and saliency maps processing require only partial decoding allowing real-time performance. A subjective experiment has been carried out to evaluate the performances of the proposed metric. The results are compared to the Full Reference metric MSE. The evaluation of the results shows that the proposed method provides a very good prediction of subjective measures.

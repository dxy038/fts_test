Module partition is the key part of the modular design technology which has been widely used in increasing fields. To divide product objective and reasonably will build the good foundation for each stage of the module design realized. Firstly, the principles of module partition are proposed in this paper. Then the hybrid fuzzy clustering algorithm based on PSO is used to make module division of the product. Finally, the automatic labeling machine has been taken as an example to justify the validity of the algorithm. Classification results show that the algorithm is superior to the traditional FCM algorithm on convergence rate and global search capability.

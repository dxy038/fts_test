Due to the changing nature of threats to the United States, the US Army is in the process of changing the way it is organized, equipped, staffed, and even how it fights. This new army is called the objective force and incorporates distributed, collaboration technologies as a force multiplier. To research how to effectively use these technologies, the Army Research Laboratory, the Battle Command Battle Laboratory - Leavenworth, and instructors of the Command and General Staff Officers Course exposed two sections of a core course in tactics to a group support system to perform mission analysis. This paper details the mapping of the mission analysis to the group support system and summarizes the experiences of these officers.

Objective
Evaluation of serum and synovial fluid OPG and sRANKL in 37 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis.
Design and method
OPG and sRANKL were measured using ELISA.
Results
OPG, sRANKL and sRANKL/OPG were increased in osteoarthritis patients' serum. Synovial OPG was higher than serum OPG, while sRANKL/OPG was higher in the serum; both correlated with disease severity.
Discussion
RANKL/OPG pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of knee osteoarthritis being a suitable target for therapeutic intervention.

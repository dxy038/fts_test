The purpose of this paper is to describe a new energy survey course for technical students. The course presents an integrated overview of energy sources that will be available for use in the 21st century. A secondary objective of the energy course is to present the content of the National Academy of Sciences content standards. The course presumes knowledge of college level physics with calculus, and mathematics through calculus of several variables. This level of preparation is not traditional for energy survey courses, but enables a more sophisticated treatment of a wide range of topics that is suitable for technical students.

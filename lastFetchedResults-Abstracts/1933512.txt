The virus porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is associated with different disease entities, including reproductive failure. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of a semen processing technique for the elimination of infectious PCV2 in semen. PCV2 was chosen as a model virus because of its small size, high resistance to inactivation and as a known risk factor for boar semen contamination.

ts of ejaculates were spiked with PCV2 and processed by a double processing technique, consisting of Single Layer Centrifugation on Androcoll™-P followed by a “swim-up” procedure. Samples were collected from the resulting fractions during the selection process and analyzed for the presence of infectious PCV2. Virus titres were determined by performing a 50% tissue culture infective dose assay (TCID50) by end point dilution and with the use of an indirect peroxidise monolayer assay technique. With an initial infectious virus titre of 3.25–3.82 (TCID50)/50 μL the two-step sperm selection method eliminated 2.92 ± 0.23 logs of infectious PCV2, corresponding to more than 99% reduction. Sperm quality was not affected by the selection procedure.

This paper is intended to present some important theoretical and experimental result that we have faced during setting up a VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) server with the well known open source VoIP server Asterisk@Home. The first part of the paper presents the project objective with some introductory theory about VoIP. The second part contains the implementation of GnuGk PBX and at the end of the paper the Asterisk server setup configuration is added. We used GNUGK for testing H.323 PBX performance and Asterisk@Home for SIP performance testing and found much more stability and accuracy using Asterisk@Home.

For pt.I see ibid., vol.35, no.1, p.74 (1989). Subjective evaluation of 20 actual television pictures using a five-point grading scale is reported. The main purpose of the study was to determine on if subjects could successfully evaluate focus quality on the grading scale and if so, what parameters are used by subjects in the evaluation. Multidimensional scaling was used to determine dimension used in the evaluation. Results show that subjects use only one dimension and that they are able to evaluate pictures very accurately on a five-point grading scale. The results show that the objective evaluation, discussed in part I is valid

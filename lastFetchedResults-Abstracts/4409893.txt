In TD-LTE-A system, the objective of conventional non-codebook beamforming algorithms is to maximize sum capacity to accommodate more users. However, fairness among users is not considered by these algorithms, and the performance of users with poor channel quality will always be bad. To relax the fairness requirement in resource allocation, this paper first introduces two parameters of user satisfaction into TD-LTE-A system for Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Non-GBR traffics, respectively. Then a user-satisfaction-based beamforming algorithm is proposed. This algorithm employs user satisfaction parameter to adjust the weights for weighted Signal-to-Leakage-plus-Noise Ratio (SLNR) algorithm. Finally, the weights of different traffics are also considered in the proposed beamforming algorithm so that average user satisfaction across different types of traffics can be modified according to the requirement of telecommunication operators. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve user satisfaction and user fairness, and average user satisfaction of GBR and Non-GBR traffics can be adjusted by changing of GBR priority parameter.

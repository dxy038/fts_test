The proliferation of the Internet is leading to high expectation of the fast turnaround time. Clients abandoning their connections due to excessive downloading delays translates directly to profit losses. Hence, minimizing the latency perceived by end-users has become the primary performance objective compared to more traditional issues, such as server utilization. The two promising techniques for improving Internet responsiveness are caching and replication. In this paper we present an overview of recent research in replication. We begin by arguing on the important role of replication in decreasing client perceived response time and illustrate the main topics that affect its successful deployment on the Internet. We analyze and characterize existing research, providing taxonomies and classifications whenever possible. Our discussion reveals several open problems and research directions

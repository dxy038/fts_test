The objective of this study was to collect all the conducted studies on nitrate concentration in water resources of Iran. To achieve this purpose, the published papers in ISC and ISI journals as well as conferences and seminars were evaluated. The results of this survey showed that 116 studies have been carried out in 26 provinces of Iran. But,there was no published paper in Ilam, Alborz, South Khorasan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, and Lorestan provinces. According to these studies, the largest number of studies was performed in Hamadan province (14 cases), Khuzestan, and Mazandaran provinces (10 cases) and the least number of studies was conducted in Ardabil, Bushehr, Qazvin, Qom, and Kermanshah provinces. In Hamadan province, more than 1435 water samples were collected from water resources of this province, which is representative of large number of studies in this region. Maximum nitrate concentration (318 mg/L) was reported in Isfahan province and then in Zahedan city (295 mg/L), Sistan and Baluchestan Province. Based on the reported results in these studies, the nitrate pollution in water resources of Iran is at medium level. In most of the studies, high nitrate concentrations are due to lack of sewage collection network, discharge of urban and industrial sewage to water resources, and agricultural activities, which use high amounts of manure and fertilizer.

This article considers bilevel linear programming problems where the coefficients of the objective functions and the constraints in the problem are given as fuzzy parameters. Stackelberg solutions under fuzziness are defined by incorporating the notions of possibility theory into the original concept of Stackelberg solutions. It is shown that Stackelberg problems under fuzziness are transformed into deterministic bilevel linear or nonlinear programming problems, and that the resulting problems are exactly solved by using conventional bilevel linear or nonlinear programming techniques.

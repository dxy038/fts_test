The appropriate location of distributed generation (DG) is very important for loss reduction in a radial distribution system. In this paper a methodology for determining the optimum size and location for installing the solar photovoltaic (SPV) based DG system for supplying the active power at the node in a radial distribution system for loss reduction is presented. The objective of this paper is to apply heuristic search strategies to determine the node for the appropriate placement of DG. In heuristic approach, a critical node, called sensitive node is selected based upon maximum power losses caused for installing DG system. This method ensures that voltage constraints are met. This heuristic approach is useful for large distribution system and can be useful for online implementation. Test results have been tested on IEEE-33 bus system and presented.

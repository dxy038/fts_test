The purpose of this paper is to present a model of the circulatory system, with central baroreflex control that has been developed in the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory of the University of Santa Catarina, Brazil. This model was conceived to match some concepts of circulatory system optimization. The main objective is to characterize the relative influences of baroreflex and muscular pump on the first seconds of exercise

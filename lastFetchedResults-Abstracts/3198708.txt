It is often focus on not only the efficiency improvement, but also the safety enhancement in the practical operations of busy airport. A model of multi-objective airport gate assignment problem with the safety constrains of the taxi-in and push-out conflict avoidance is proposed in the paper and an optimizing solution is given by ant colony algorithm. The illustrative examples with the realistic flight data show the validity of our approach for offering both the safety and the efficiency to busy airport operations.

Recent research efforts have been geared towards developing high-resolution rainfall products from satellites for hydrological applications. A necessary step in assessing the potential and utility of these products is to quantify the uncertainty associated with them at validation scales appropriate for hydrological applications. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of the widely-known PERSIANN-CCS high-resolution (hourly, 0.04° × 0.04°) satellite rainfall products against high-quality NEXRAD radar rainfall observations in the Little Washita watershed. Our results reveal that (1) PERSIANN-CCS shows high skills in reproducing the patterns of inter-annual rainfall variability on a monthly basis; (2) both at the hourly and storm scales, the performance statistics of PERSIANN-CCS exhibit large spread, suggesting that the quality of PERSIANN-CCS product is almost unique for each hour and storm; and (3) significant improvement in performance statistics is obtained as PERSIANN-CCS products are averaged to longer sub-daily time scales. The implications of our results are: (1) PERSIANN-CCS could be used with high confidence for inter-annual rainfall variability studies; (2) PERSIANN-CCS products need to be accompanied by corresponding hourly error estimates in order to provide meaningful error estimates for hydrological applications; and (3) research is needed to characterize the tradeoff between the quality of rainfall input and the space-time resolution of hydrological modeling, as a function of watershed size and hydrologic model complexity level.

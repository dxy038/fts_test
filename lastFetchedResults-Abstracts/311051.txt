Objective. A unified mathematical model of two different modes of inception of fissures at the surface of articular cartilage in healthy and pathological joints.

Design. The superficial tangential zone of articular cartilage is modeled as a three-phase medium consisting of collagen fibers, matrix, and of infiltrated thin constituent of synovial fluid.

Background. The author’s general mesomechanical concept is applied to the analysis of deterioration of articular cartilage.

Methods. Theoretical analysis based on the results of the author’s preceding paper.

Results. The presented analysis shows that superficial fissures in articular cartilage can also be caused by pathological thinning of synovial fluid.

Conclusions. Whereas in healthy joints the probable cause of creation of fissures at the surface of cartilage was shown to be fast impact loading, in joints with inflammatory synovial fluid the fissures can be caused by plain walking.

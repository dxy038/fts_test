Constrained Via Minimization is a typical problem in VLSI channel routing. The objective of via minimization is to improve the circuit performance and productivity and to reduce the completion rate of routing. In CVM problem, some vias may be non essential to the given layout. Here we have to be selected and remove from the layout. In this paper, we present a procedure to find out non essential vias. This procedure we used to solve constrained via minimization problems. Then, we show the experimental results and hardcopy solutions of some layout to prove that our approach obtains better results compared to conventional algorithms.

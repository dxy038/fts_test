Rate-distortion control algorithms are used in perceptual audio coding for assigning suitable parameters to achieve bit constraint and keeping quantization distortion under audition masking threshold. The common rate-distortion control algorithms, such as the two-loop search, usually have poor performance and high computational complexity. In order to solve the problem, a JNLD psychoacoustic model is given to provide bit allocation estimation and a bit allocation method based one-loop structure valley search quantization rate-distortion control algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithms provide low computational complexity and high objective quality when applied in MPEG-4 AAC.

Our objective was the integration of mobile computing in our web based documentation software DocuMed.rh to improve process organisation and quality of care. We focused on self-administered standardized patient questionnaires which are implemented in DocuMed.rh. Validity of online obtained data and the capability of disabled patients to handle a Tablet PC were assigned. On a regularly scheduled visit 117 patients completed prearranged sets of self-administered questionnaires as a paper-pencil and an electronic version using a Tablet PC in a cross-over design. Patients experiences with the Tablet PC and history of computer/internet use were assessed. Positive ethics approval and signed patients consents were obtained. Though only 65% of the patients reported computer experiences no major problems with the Tablet PC occurred. Scores obtained by direct data entry on the Tablet PC did not differ significantly from the scores obtained by the paper-pencil questionnaires in the complete group and in subgroups. Application of self-administered questionnaires on the new medium Tablet PC is efficient and capable in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease. Mobile obtained data are rapidly available and can easily be merged with clinical data, thereby contributing intensely to improved patient care.

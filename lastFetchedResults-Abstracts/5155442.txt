In modern scenario as we are going for low power VLSI design, an useful technique is to design the combinational part of any circuit in cyclic way. Combinational circuits are generally considered as acyclic structured. However, cyclic loops can be introduced in combinational circuits. The main aim of cyclic circuit is to introduce structural feedback &amp; to avoid the logical feedback in order to get combinational primary output. The study of cyclic circuit includes functional analysis i.e. to determine what values will appear, the timing analysis which determine when these values will appear and the area, as a measure of the number of transistors in the final fabrication. The objective of the study is to design &amp; verification of different combinational circuits in cyclic combinational method by optimizing the area, power and delay. Detailed study of circuit model, its functional and temporal behavior, Synthesis of circuit using cyclic combinational method, Simulation of circuit using standard simulator, Analysis framework including area, power, timing consideration are studied in this work.

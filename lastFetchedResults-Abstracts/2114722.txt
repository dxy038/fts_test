Cesarean section (CS) is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures worldwide. The complications following a CS include fever, wound infection, post-operative pain and bleeding which are not usually found in a normal vaginal delivery. Traditionally, suturing of peritoneal layers for CS patients has been done, but in some studies it has been shown that this procedure could be eliminated without affecting the rate of morbidity. The objective of this study was to assess the short-term outcomes of two different cesarean delivery techniques. A total of 100 cases who underwent CS were randomly assigned equally to either closure of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum or no peritoneum closure. Duration of operation, pain scores, analgesic requirements, alterations in hemoglobin levels and febrile morbidity were assessed accordingly. Pain scores, analgesic requirements assessed at 24 hours and operation duration were significantly lower in the non-closure group as compared to the closure group. Febrile conditions and changes in hemoglobin levels were similar in both groups. Non-closure of both visceral and the parietal peritoneum when performing a CS produces a significant reduction in pain, fewer analgesic requirements and a shorter operation duration without increasing the febrile morbidity and changes in hemoglobin levels as compared to the standard methods.

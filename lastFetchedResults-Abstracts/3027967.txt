In this paper, a scheme to enhance the image quality and utilize the network resources optimally is proposed. The gain is achieved by statistical multiplexing in VBR transmission but the network quality is variable since buffer controlled and network enforcement is both inactivated. Hence, enforced VBR transmission is employed in the proposed method. The objective is achieved by developing an optimum coder model in which enforcement and buffer control is done to maintain subjective image quality, constant and avoid buffer underflow and overflow. In addition, the optimum resource utilization is achieved by developing a dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm in which the available bandwidth is redistributed among the various uses at each node in the ATM network.

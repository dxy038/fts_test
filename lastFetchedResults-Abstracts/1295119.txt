In this paper, we consider the problem of designing urban optical networks. In particular, given a set of telephone exchanges, we must design a collection of ring-stars, where each ring-star is a cycle composed of a telephone exchange, some customers, some transition points used to save routing costs and customers not on the cycle connected to the cycle by a single edge. The ring topology is chosen in many fiber optic communication networks since it allows to prevent the loss of connection due to a single edge or even a single node failure. The objective is to minimize the total cost of the optical network which is mainly due to the excavation costs. We call this problem Multi-Depot Ring-Star Problem (MDRSP) and we formulate it as an optimization problem in Graph Theory. We present lower bounds and heuristic algorithms for the MDRSP. Computational results on randomly generated instances and real-life datasets are also presented.

2-D triangulations are useful in finite element methods as well as in modeling and interpolating surfaces. This paper suggests an improved 2-d triangulation optimization algorithm. Firstly, a new objective function for evaluating the uniformity of a given triangulation is proposed, secondly, an algorithm for get the minimum value of the objective function is deduced by steepest descent method. After the minimum value is acquired the 2-D triangulations is optimized. Step-size obtaining method is also adjusted to improve the speed of this algorithm.

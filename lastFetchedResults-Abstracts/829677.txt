One of the approaches to decrease the environmental pollutants and increase the power and efficiency of gas turbines is to inject water vapor into combustion chamber of gas turbines. In this paper,  comprehensive thermodynamic and economic modeling of steam injection into the combustion chamber of the gas turbine cycle was performed and the effects of technological, economic and environmental aspects of using this method on a simple cycle gas turbine was tested. Finally, multi-objective optimization for maximum efficiency and minimum manufacturing costs and pollutants can be fixed to the cycle gas turbines with steam injection into the combustion chamber, has been done by PSO algorithm. Our results indicate that using this approach increases the power by 37.9 % and efficiency by 43.3 %. On the other hand cost per kilowatt-hour is increased by 20.8 % and CO2 production is reduced by 14.4 %.

Objective. To evaluate the impact of a teachers' questionnaire on the outcome of school entrance medical examinations (SEMs).

ology. Retrospective audit. Routine SEMs in 17 primary schools before and after the introduction of the questionnaire.

s. Primary outcome was teachers' concerns known to school doctors, which increased from 2% of pupils to 27% (P&lt;0.001). Secondary outcome measures increased significantly: new diagnoses made by school doctors (22–31%, P=0.038) and follow-ups arranged (8–15%, P=0.034). Medical or educational intervention was required in 17% of pupils identified by teachers' concerns over the subsequent 3 years. Used as an adjunct for selection for SEMs, the questionnaire would have reduced the number of children with problems overlooked by 60%.

sions. The questionnaire improves communication between teachers and school doctors. It significantly changed the short- and longer-term outcome of SEMs. The teachers' questionnaire provides a useful adjunct for selection for SEMs.

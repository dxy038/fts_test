In recent years, there has been great interest in the study of nonlinear transmission lines (NLTLs) for high-power radio frequency (RF) generation. The periodicity of the NLTL accounts for dispersion effects, whereas its nonlinear elements (inductors and/or capacitors) are responsible for the nonlinear processes. Both of these mechanisms acting simultaneously on a propagating pulse allow the generation of high-frequency oscillations at the output. The objective of this paper is to study the quantifiable characteristics of these lines for RF generation by means of SPICE circuit simulation and on basis of experiments. The RF generation at 40 MHz is demonstrated through measurement of the fast Fourier transform of the RF signal extracted at the load and by comparison with the corresponding simulated spectrum. It is expected that the technique presented here can be useful for the design of NLTLs to drive compact RF antennas for space applications and defense mobile platforms.

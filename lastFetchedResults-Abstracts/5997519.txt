Patch-based image completion proceeds by iteratively filling the target (unknown) region by the best matching patches in the source image. In most existing such algorithms, the size of the patches is either fixed and specified by a default number or simply chosen to be inversely proportional to the spatial frequency. However, it is noted that the patch size affects how well the filled patch captures the local characteristics of the source image and thus the final completion accuracy. Thus in this paper we propose a new method to compute appropriate patch sizes for image completion to improve its performance. In particular, we formulate the patch size determination as an optimization problem that minimizes an objective function involving image gradients and distinct and homogenous features. Experimental results show that our method can provide a significant enhancement to patch-based image completion algorithms.

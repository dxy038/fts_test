Flat-slab building structures exhibit significant higher flexibility compared with traditional frame structures, and
shear walls (SWs) are vital to limit deformation demands under earthquake excitations. The objective of this study is
to identify an appropriate finite element (FE) model of SW dominant flat-plate reinforced concrete (R/C) buildings,
which can be used to study its dynamic behavior. Three-dimensional models are generated and analyzed to check
the adequacy of different empirical formulas to estimate structural period of vibration via analyzing the dynamic
response of low- and medium-height R/C buildings with different cross-sectional plans and different SW positions
and thicknesses. The numerical results clarify that modeling of R/C buildings using block (solid) elements for
columns, SWs, and slab provides the most appropriate representation of R/C buildings since it gives accurate results
of fundamental periods and consequently reliable seismic forces. Also, modeling of R/C buildings by FE programs
using shell elements for both columns and SWs provides acceptable results of fundamental periods (the error does
not exceed 10%). However, modeling of R/C buildings using frame elements for columns and/or SWs overestimates
the fundamental periods of R/C buildings. Empirical formulas often overestimate or underestimate fundamental
periods of R/C buildings. Some equations provide misleading values of fundamental period for both intact and
cracked R/C buildings. However, others can be used to estimate approximately the fundamental periods of
flat-plate R/C buildings. The effect of different SW positions is also discussed.

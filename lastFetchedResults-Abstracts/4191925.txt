At a given wind velocity, the mechanical power available from a wind turbine is a function of its shaft speed. To maximize the power captured from the wind, the shaft speed has to be controlled. In low-cost wind energy conversion systems, the turbine shaft speed is not regulated and a squirrel-cage induction generator is used to convert the turbine mechanical power to electric power. Power electronic converters are used to interface the induction generator with the grid and maximize the power captured from the wind. In this paper, a wind energy conversion scheme based on the matrix converter topology is proposed. As the commutation problems in the conventional nine-bidirectional switch matrix converter topology impairs its performance in industrial applications, an improved topology which does not have any commutation problems, has been adopted for the system presented in this paper. Through matrix converter, the terminal voltage and frequency of the induction generator can be controlled in such a way that the wind turbine is operating at its maximum power point for all wind velocities. The power factor at the interface with the grid is also controlled by the matrix converter to ensure purely active power injection into the grid for optimal utilization of the installed wind turbine capacity. Furthermore, the reactive power requirements of the induction generator are satisfied by the matrix converter to avoid self-excitation capacitors. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are used to support the claims made on the advantages of the proposed scheme.

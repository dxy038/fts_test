Engineering scheme optimization is of particular importance in the concept design process, which involves multiple objectives with uncertainty. Also, the objective set, used to evaluate and select the satisfying alternative, consists of many qualitative and quantitative factors. So it is a problem of semi-structured multi-objective decision making (SEMODM). This paper develops a framework and methodology for evaluation of engineering alternatives, where a fuzzy optimum model (FOM) is proposed to integrate the influence of each objective in the criteria set, and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is adopted to calculate the weight vector, which can mimic the decision makerÂ´s experience and preference based on complementary pair wise comparisons. A case study is given to show the efficiency and robustness of the new framework and methodology.

The success of schema integration operation in multidatabase systems relies heavily on the identification of correct and complete correspondence relationships between them. Thus, their data elements must be rich and precise semantically, i.e., each of them must be sufficiently defined for to be distinguished from others or to be identified to some of them. To reach this objective, we propose a scheme integration method based on terminological reasoning (product of description logics) and semantic enrichment. The conjunction of these two techniques allows us to define fine correspondence relationships which express any semantic and structural link between the schemas to be integrated

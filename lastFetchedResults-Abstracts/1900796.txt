Abstract: Segregation of speech in presence of noise and other interferences is a challenging problem, especially in monaural case. Since accurate choice of time-frequency (T-F) units has great impact on segregation results, in this paper, we propose new methods for choosing T-F units in monaural voiced speech segregation. In the proposed system first, the units are marked using envelope cross-channel correlation in the initial segregation stage. Then, the system uses different features in the low and high frequencies for labeling of units in the pitch tracking and unit labeling stage. We use the enhanced envelope autocorrelation function (EEACF) for labeling T-F units in the high frequency range. We also consider the impact of each method on the segregation results. The evaluation of the monaural voiced speech segregation system based on different objective criteria is done for different types of noise mixed with speech signals which shows better segregation results than conventional methods.

In this paper the analysis of two topologies of solid state transformers, three-phase, DC to AC, bidirectional, isolated, single-stage conversion, based on the principle of operation of dual active bridge converters is presented. The principle of operation and strategy of modulation used in each topology is explained. Finally simulation results are shown to evaluate and compare the performance of both converters.

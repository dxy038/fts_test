Objective. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the effects of filling technique, cavity configuration and use of a low-viscosity composite liner influence resin bond strength to the dentin of class II cavities gingival floor; and analyze the failure modes of fractured specimens.

Methods. Standardized class II cavities were prepared in the proximal surfaces of freshly extracted third molars, which were randomly assigned to 10 experimental groups. All prepared surfaces were acid-etched, bonded with Single Bond adhesive system and restored with TPH composite, according to each technique: G1 and G2-horizontal layering, G3 and G4-faciolingual layering, G5 and G6-oblique layering, G7 and G8-bulk filling, G9 and G10-control (flat dentin surfaces). Groups were tested, with or without a low-viscosity composite liner (Tetric Flow Chroma). After storage in water for 24 h, teeth were vertically serially sectioned to yield a series of 0.8 mm thick slabs. Each slab was trimmed into an hourglass shape of approximately 0.8 mm2 area at the gingival resinâ€“dentin interface. Specimens were tested in tension at 0.5 mm/min until failure. Fractured specimens were analyzed in an SEM to determine the failure modes.

Results. No significant difference was found between groups restored with and without a low-viscosity composite liner (p>0.05). Among filling techniques, the bulk filling groups presented the lowest bond strength values (p<0.05), while incremental filling groups did not differ from control (flat dentin surfaces). Failure modes varied significantly among groups restored with and without the low-viscosity composite liner.

Significance. Bond strengths were not improved when a low-viscosity composite liner was applied, but it remarkably influenced the failure modes. Incremental techniques improved bond strength.

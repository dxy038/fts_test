The paper presents quantization schemes for the magnitude spectra of the slowly evolving waveform (SEW) and rapidly evolving waveform (REW) components in a 2 kb/s waveform interpolation (WI) coder. The SEW magnitude spectrum is quantized using a DCT-based predictive vector quantization approach. The REW magnitude spectrum is quantized using a matrix quantizer based on the combined dimension conversion method. Objective measures and subjective results indicate that the proposed quantization schemes are effective in achieving good quantization accuracy.

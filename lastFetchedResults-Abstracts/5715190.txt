In this paper, placement of Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVRs) in distribution systems at presence of distributed generators (DGs) by a multi-objective fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FAPSO) algorithm is proposed. AVRs help to reduce energy losses, to improve energy quality of electric utilities and to compensate voltage drops through distribution lines in distribution systems. In order to help electric companies in the decision-making process, it is necessary to find the optimal location of AVRs in distribution systems. The objectives that are considered consist of energy generation costs, electrical energy losses and the voltage deviations. The best solution is obtained by using the max-min operator. Finally, the obtained results are compared with other evolutionary algorithms.

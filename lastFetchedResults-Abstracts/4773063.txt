The WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) Mesh network is based on IEEE 802.16 standard. It was developed with the goal of providing easy, fast and cost-effective network set-up, deployment and extension. One of the important challenges for the mesh WiMAX is to know the availability of the system. In the WiMAX Mesh mode, multiple nodes are available to select a sponsor node. The multiple node technique increases the fault tolerance and the availability of the network. The objective of this paper is to propose a generalized connection availability model based on multinode for a sponsor node selection to measure the availability. An analytical modeling framework also is developed to determine the availability of the network. Finally, the effective factor on the availability of WiMAX mesh networks is presented. The simulation results show that the model has increased the connection availability and the fault tolerance.

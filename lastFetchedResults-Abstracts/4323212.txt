This paper concerns product model distribution in network-based collaborative design based on a peer-to- peer 3D streaming method. CAD meshes are transmitted incrementally from a coarse representation to a finer one in a sequence of LODs (Levels of Detail) defined by form features. A scenario of online design collaboration demonstrates how the streaming method facilitates CAD data sharing in real time. In this scenario, one peer is requesting a LOD model concurrently from multiple peers who own the model in different LODs. An optimization scheme combining Dijkstra Â´s Algorithm with simple heuristics helps determine how the requested model is aggregated from the ones possessed by the others and the transmission routes of individual LOD data. The objective is to minimize the total transfer time, considering the role of each peer in the collaboration and network throughputs. A prototyping system is implemented to verify the streaming method. The implementation result shows that it improves the efficiency and practicality of sharing CAD data of large size in networked engineering collaboration.

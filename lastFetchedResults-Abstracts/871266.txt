In a recent work, cited in the Introduction, a concept of generalized pseudoconvexity
was used to obtain optimality results in nonlinear programming. In the
present work we give sufficient optimality conditions, in the context of the
multiobjective programming problem under the assumptions of generalized pseudoconvexity
on objective and constraint functions. An application of such a result is
given for fractional programming also.

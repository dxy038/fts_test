Day by day, the amount of the marble dust (MD) as a waste material is significantly of increasing in Turkey. Therefore, the utilization of the waste MD in self-compacting concrete (SCC), as filler material, is the main objective of this study. Besides, the MD is used directly without attempting any additional process. Thus, this would be another advantage for this objective. For this purpose, MD has replaced binder of SCC at certain contents of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 kg/m3. After then, slump-flow test, L-box test and V-funnel test are conducted on fresh concrete. Furthermore, compressive strength, flexural strength, ultrasonic velocity, porosity and compactness are determined at the end of 28 days for the hardened concrete specimens. The effect of waste MD usage as filler material on capillarity properties of SCC is also investigated. According to the test results, it is concluded that the workability of fresh SCC has not been affected up to 200 kg/m3 MD content. However, the mechanical properties of hardened SCC have decreased by using MD, especially just above 200 kg/m3 content.

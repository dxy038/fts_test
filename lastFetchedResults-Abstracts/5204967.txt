The article considers the objective of providing for radar jamming immunity by optimizing the radar structure, parameters or operating algorithms on the basis of correct recognition of jamming in progress. Procedure of recognition in the determined feature space is examined. Viability of this approach is demonstrated using the example of airborne radar operation against the source of polarization and blinking jamming.

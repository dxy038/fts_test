Take-off is considered as a critically important phase in Long Jumps. Efficient transformation of velocities from horizontal to vertical forms the fundamental goal of this part. The objective of this article is to compare the take-offs performed by elite Asian long jump athletes and their world-class counterparts. 37 performances from 8 male long jump athletes with averages of 7.68Â±0.28 m, in Fourth indoor Asian senior athletics championships held in Tehran were recorded at 300 Hz. The intended variables were analyzed using motion analysis software and one-sample t-test with significant level of 0.05 was adopted to make comparison to data available on world class elite. Differences were observed both in velocity profiles and in take-off performances. Variables such as vertical (p < 0.001) and horizontal velocity (p < 0.001), lowest knee angle at the take-off (p=0.046) and the last stride length (p < 0.001) were lower and contact time (p=0.003), inclination angle (p < 0.001) and touch-down knee angle (p=0.001) were found to be higher than the available data on world class elite athletes. Furthermore, a sharp fall of velocity in the first phase of take-off was observed. It would seem that those attending the Asian championships were unable to provide a suitable technical performance, although they were obviously familiar with the techniques. Constant supervision of practice sessions through implementation of motion analysis systems, to identify, reduce or eliminate technical mistakes is highly recommended. In addition, conditioning programs to enhance eccentric strength of knee extensors and thus improve the maximum velocities are highly recommended to improve individual records.

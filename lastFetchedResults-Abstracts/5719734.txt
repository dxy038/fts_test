In this paper, a flux search controller is proposed to increase the efficiency of a direct torque controlled induction motor with light load. The reference flux value is determined through a two stage minimization algorithm with the amplitude of the stator current as the objective function. In the transient state, a great flux step is used to speed up the convergence. In the steady state, a noise cancellation algorithm is used to let using small flux step and improves the steady state behavior of flux controller. Simulation and experimental confirm the fast dynamics of the proposed method and its superiority compared to the other optimal flux search controllers

The objective of the paper is to propose a power aware routing method in a geographical zone, using Bluetooth sensorÂ´s for efficient Irrigation Management System (IMS). Research on wireless sensor networks has recently received much attention as they offer an advantage of monitoring various kinds of environments by sensing physical phenomenon. The dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive environment has led us to develop a model for an intelligent field irrigation system to solve the issue of water scarcity and labor, as it is the key issue in irrigation. We describe here a multi hop Bluetooth ad-hoc network with multiple gateways for data acquisition and remote administration. The model implements an economically feasible irrigation monitoring system whereby the Bluetooth sensors are embedded in the fields, which transmits various kinds of ambient conditions like temperature, humidity and water levels. The model uses the power-aware zone based routing protocol for routing the data from the Bluetooth sensors to the data acquisition system and thereby alerting the farmer with a suitable alert mechanism through mobile phone. The system is evaluated using simulations to identify the master among the nodes and to calculate the path to reach the gateway.

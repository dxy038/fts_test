The 0/1 knapsack problem is a very well known and it appears in many real life world with different application. The solution to the multi objective 0/1 knapsack problem can be viewed as the result of a sequence of decisions. The problem is NP - complete and it also generalization of the 0/1 knapsack problem in which many Knapsack are considered. A evolutionary algorithm for solving multi objective 0/1 knapsack problem is introduced in this paper. This algorithm used a genetic algorithm for direct comparison of two solutions. Few numerical experiments are realized using the best and recent algorithm in this paper. Experimental outcome show that the new proposed algorithm out performance the existing evolutionary approach for this problem.

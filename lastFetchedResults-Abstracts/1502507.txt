The objective of this research is to analyze the effectiveness of wind power and solar energy to supply electricity to the grid during peak demand periods in the Northeast of Brazil. To achieve this objective, a comparative analysis is performed between the electricity load curve for a typical year and a typical day and statistical data for wind speed and solar irradiation. The results obtained indicate that correlations exist and renewable energy can help support regional temporal demand in the existing electricity grid in an efficient and more environmentally friendly manner than fossil fuel power plants. Another interesting finding was the complementarity between hydroelectricity (the region's main energy resource) and wind and solar energy. That is, in the months of the dry season (when the cost of energy is more expensive) there is a greater availability of wind and solar energy. This makes investments in these two renewable sources more economically viable and also helps to diversify the electricity grid power supply, securing it against the effects of droughts.

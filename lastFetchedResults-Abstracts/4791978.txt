As real-time mobile multimedia becomes more and more popular in modern life, Quality of Service (QoS) has drawn more and more attention. IEEE 802.11 has been widely deployed to provide broadband wireless network access due to its low cost, simplicity and high bandwidth capacity. However, its poor network availability and frequent network disconnection in a mobile scenario challenge real-time services. This paper presents a caching and pre-fetching mechanism based on the usage of Content Centric Network (CCN) in mobile environments. The idea is to anticipate disconnections and prefetch the content that a user is expected to access in the near future. Hence, when to trigger the caching and pre-fetching module is an essential part of the objective. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of a disconnection predictor algorithm. The method is to predict the time before a terminal disconnects from an Access Point (AP) by monitoring Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). This paper evaluates and compares the used algorithms by experiments.

A non-expensive insulation box for aero-acoustic experiments at moderate Reynolds numbers Re < 2 Ã— 104 and low Mach numbers M < 0.2 is presented. Its performance is evaluated with particular attention to unwanted noise sources inherent to the flow facility. Objective acoustic parameters of the insulation box are assessed.

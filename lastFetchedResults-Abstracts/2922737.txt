Quality has become the hallmark of the economy and the prerequisite for good customer/supplier relations. In an ever-more demanding context, EDF has to live with its times and has to make power supply quality its prime objective. In addition to the standard of service to be rendered to the clientele, this general desire necessitates improvement of the quality of supply. Vis-a-vis its customers, this willingness formalises its commitment which comprises indemnification should it fail in its duty. In this respect, two broad complementary lines of action are in progress: the `EMERALD´ contract, with the optional `System Plus´ contract; and the service `Quality´ Plus and the `High Quality´ Zones in which responses to customer´s problems are provided in collaboration with the installers and the local communities, which enables each actor to play its role in the quest for customer service

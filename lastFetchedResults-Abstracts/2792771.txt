The high performance Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) currently manufactured by Texas Instruments are heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures. Programming these architectures is a complex task often reserved to specialized engineers because the bottlenecks of both the algorithm and the architecture need to be deeply understood in order to obtain a fairly parallel execution. The PREESM framework objective is to simplify the programming of multicore DSP systems by building on dataflow programming methods. The current functionalities of this scalable framework cover memory and time analysis, as well as automatic deadlock-free code generation. Several tutorials are provided with the tool for fast initiation of C programmers to multicore DSP programming. This paper demonstrates PREESM capabilities by comparing simulation and execution performances on a stereo matching algorithm prototyped on the TMS320C6678 8-core DSP device.

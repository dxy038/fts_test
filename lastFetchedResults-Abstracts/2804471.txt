A bidirectional secondary LLC resonant converter with auxiliary switches and an additional inductor is proposed to achieve the high gain characteristics of LLC resonant convertors. Auxiliary switches, an additional inductor and a resonant capacitor are connected in the high voltage secondary side of the proposed converter. The ac analysis and operating characteristics of bidirectional secondary LLC resonant converter are investigated. A 1kW prototype bidirectional secondary LLC resonant converter connected to the 400V<sub>DC</sub> buses is designed and tested to confirm the validity and applicability of the proposed converter.

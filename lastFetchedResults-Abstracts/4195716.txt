The DCT-based image compression quality is studied by experiments in the subjective and the objective two evaluation methods in the paper. At first, the DCT coefficients option is important to affect the static image compression quality, the option method of DCT coefficients is illustrated. Next, according the experiments data and simulation images, in the objective evaluation method, by computing the MSE and PSNR, the different DCT image coding bit rate how to affect the compression image quality is further analyzed, the result indicates: the bit rate of less than 0.75bbp is the most applicable for the good image compression quality.

Detecting weaknesses in students’ knowledge may constitute an objective of testing. Computerized test systems, which can be tailored to students’ knowledge level, are appropriate to realize this objective. These systems are not only used to reveal the students’ knowledge, but also help tutors understand the problems in the educational process. This paper reviews the student modeling problem for computer-based test systems, and also proposes a novel method for the graphical representation of student knowledge. First, we present our test practice system ‘Intelligent’, which is followed by the evaluation of the system in real classroom conditions as well as the effect over students’ knowledge acquisition.

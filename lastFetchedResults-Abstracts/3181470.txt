We investigate flow interception problem of multi-type of facility and flow on the network with known O-D path flows, under the consideration of the facility at the same point will bring the customers incident demand. To be more practical, the objective is to maximize the total revenue from flows in the path and minimize the location cost. The decision-maker can decide where and how base on the model of balance of cost and revenue. The hybrid multi-objective evolution algorithm (HMOEA) to solve this model is developed and computational experiment is described. It is showed that this model and algorithm can apply to the location decision of the Multi-type Facility FIP with Incidental Demand, and can efficiently obtain an approximate solution.

Elements of constitutive model formulation for simple materials within a thermodynamic, finite deformation framework are reviewed. Recent developments in addressing the second law and entropy existence are discussed. Caratheodory-based approaches are emphasized for their simplicity and ease of interpretation. An original treatment of finite thermoviscoelasticity is developed in this context. A broadened Caratheodory-based entropy is proposed, and compared to recent work of Casey (Casey J., On elastic–thermo-plastic materials at finite deformations. Int J Plast, 14, 173–91.). Frame indifference, objective rates, and spins are briefly addressed, introducing application of the broadened framework to (cited work in) finite thermoviscoplasticity. Fundamental references are provided.

In this paper, we propose a news display system for a human-centered active display service using Ubiquitous display(UD). In our system, UD is a display device of which the objective is to display visual information on the surface of a wall where a user is watching in Intelligent Space. Its characteristic is to display visual information without the restriction by place. After estimating a user´s position and recognizing a user´s face by Intelligent Space, the proposed news display system shows a news article which includes the meaning of the user´s query sentence extracted by paraphrase patterns, which find similarity between the query sentence and news articles. In the experimental results, we evaluated the performance of our system through comparing three systems: Boolean search system, a system without paraphrase patterns, and a system with paraphrase patterns. Especially, the proposed news display system with paraphrase patterns shows above 10% of &#8220;recall&#8221; result than the system without paraphrasing. Finally, our demonstration shows that UD moves to a user and displays a news article on the surface of a wall where a user is watching.

Objective: During labor every woman is likely to be apprehensive about some aspect of
labor. Patient's morale is important in progress and outcome of labor. Mother's anxiety can
cause release of catecholamines and decrease uterine contraction, A Supportive companion is
a great source of strength to the woman. This study evaluates the effect of labor support from
a supportive companion on labor process.
Subjects and Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 150 primigravid women who
randomly assigned into either a supported group (n=75) or a control group (n=75). In
additional to the routine care, the women in the supported group received continuous support
from a female companion, who was from the patients' family or a friend and has experienced
at least a successful vaginal delivery). The companion person accompanied the patients from
the time of admission to postpartum ward. The support provided were: encouragement,
appeasement, touch, patting and reassurance.
Results: Continuous labor support by a companion significantly reduced length of active
phase (P<O.OI), need for oxytocin augmentation (P<O.OI), pain intensity (P<0.05), cesarean
section (P<0.05) and increased mother's satisfaction of childbirth experience (P<O.OOI), but
length of the second stage oflabor was not significantly affected.
Conclusion: Labor support from a companion person is an inexpensive and uncomplicated
method that has significant positive effects on labor process

Objective(s): This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of total flavonoid extract from Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt.(CTF)against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) using an isolated Langendorff rat heart model.
Materials and Methods: Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and the maximum rate of rise and fall of LV pressure (±dp/dtmax) were recorded. Cardiac injury was assessed by analyzing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) released in the coronary effluent. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined. Myocardial inflammation was assessed by monitoring tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Myocardial infarct size was estimated. Cell morphology was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining.
Results: Pretreatment with CTF significantly increased the heart rate and increased LVDP, as well as SOD and GSH-Px levels. In addition, CTF pretreatment decreased the TUNEL-positive cell ratio, infarct size, and levels of CK, LDH, MDA, TNF-α, CRP, IL-6, and IL-8.
Conclusion: These results suggest that CTF exerts cardio-protective effects against MIRI via anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities.

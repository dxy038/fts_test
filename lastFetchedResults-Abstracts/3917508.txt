The design problem of a permanent split capacitor (PSC) single phase induction motor is presented as a nonlinear multicriterion optimisation problem. A computer package is built which receives the initial values of motor parameters and gives the optimal values of these parameters with more than one objective function and nonviolated constraints. Two design problems as an application of this approach are presented. The study is supported by actual models

The objective of this study is to determine the infrared optical constants of
polyimide films in the spectral range between 2000 and 7000 cm&1 using a five-
oscillator Lorentz model. Model parameters are preseInted, in addition to the
derived values of the complex refractive index and dielectric constant. The
parameters were obtained using electromagnetic theory for thin films to model
reflectivity data from two film samples with different thicknesses (5.17 and
12.4 +m) on gold substrates examined at two incident angles. Measurements
were taken using a polarizable reflectometer device in a Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The real part of the refractive index, n, is shown
to be about 1.67, while the imaginary part, k, is less than 0.01 over the spectral
range examined. Results are consistent with findings of other experimentalists,
and new data preseInted here show that polarization effects on thin film layers
are predictable from the proposed model

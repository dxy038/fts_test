The main goal of optimal design of single
phase induction motors with permanent capacitor is
maximization of the efficiency and minimizing the
manufacturing cost. Mathematical classic methods can be
used for design of these motors but they need to
linearization and simplification in model and formulas.
This linearization is caused that design precision
decreases while random search methods such as genetic
algorithm (GA) and advanced particle swarm
optimization (APSO) do not need to model linearization.
Regarding the fact that random search methods can be
used for design and optimization processes with relative
high precision, in this study, APSO algorithm is used for
designing single-phase induction motor with permanent
capacitor. The objective function is motor efficiency. The
results evaluation reveals that the motor design by APSO
algorithm is caused that the efficiency increases in
comparison with classic methods and GA.

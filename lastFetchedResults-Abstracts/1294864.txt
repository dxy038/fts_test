For a multi-resource service request task (MRSRTask) in manufacturing grid (MGrid) system, in addition to the search for all qualified resource services according to each subtask, the system selects one candidate resource service for each subtask. Then the system generates a new composite resource service (CRS) and selects the optimal resource service composite path from all possible paths to execute the task with the given multi-objective (e.g., time minimization, cost minimization and reliability maximization) and multi-constraints. The above problem is defined as multi-objective MGrid resource service composition and optimal-selection (MO-MRSCOS) problem. The formulation is presented for an MO-MRSCOS problem. The correlations among resource services are taken into account during MGrid resource service composition, and a QoS description mode supporting resource service correlation is presented. The basic resource service composite modes (RSCM) for CRS are described, and the principles for translating a complicated RSCM into a simple sequence RSCM are presented for simplifying the resolving process and complexity of MO-MRSCOS problem. A new method based on the principles of particle swarm optimization (PSO), is proposed for solving MO-MRSCOS problem. Unlike previous works: (a) the proposed PSO algorithms combine the non-dominated sorting technique to achieve the selection of global best position and private best position; (b) the parameters of particle updating formulation in PSO are dynamical generated in order to make a compromise between the global exploration and local exploitation abilities of PSO; (c) permutation-based and objective-based population trimming operators are applied in PSO to maintain diversity of solutions in population. The experimental results and performance comparison show that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.

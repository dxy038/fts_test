Objective: Bone marrow and umbilical cord stromal cells are multipotential stem cells
that have the ability to produce growth factors that play an important role in survival and
generation of axons. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of the two different
mesenchymal stem cells on peripheral nerve regeneration.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, a 10 mm segment of the left sciatic
nerve of male Wistar rats (250-300 g) was removed with a silicone tube interposed into
this nerve gap. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical cord stromal
cells (HUCSCs) were respectively obtained from rat and human. The cells were separately
cultured and transplanted into the nerve gap. The sciatic nerve regeneration was
evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and light and electron microscopy. Moreover, histomorphology
of the gastrocnemius muscle was observed.
Results: The nerve regeneration in the BMSCs and HUCSCs groups that had received
the stem cells was significantly more favorable than the control group. In addition, the BMSCs
group was significantly more favorable than the HUCSCs group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that both homograft BMSCs and heterograft
HUCSCs may have the potential to regenerate peripheral nerve injury and
transplantation of BMSCs may be more effective than HUCSCs in rat.

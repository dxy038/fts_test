Abstract
Lead is a microelement naturally present in trace amount in all biological materials, in soil, water,
plants and animals. It has no physiological function in the organism. The main source of lead
contamination are smelting works, application of wastewater treatment sludgeâ€™s to soil,
transportation, rain, snow, hail and other. Lead enters the organism with food and air and tends to
accumulate more in hard tissue than in soft tissue. Bone lead levels increase with age at rates
dependent on the skeletal site and lead. In this research we analyzed teeth samples of 9 humans of
Bronze Age from Gohar Tepe in north of Iran. These samples were analyzed for Lead by graphite
furnace atomic absorption spectrometry to establish levels of this element in area. Our objective is
to find out if Lead can prevent forming a settlement in site.

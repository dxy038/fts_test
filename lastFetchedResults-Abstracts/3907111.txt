With this scheme, the inverter switching frequency and output switching pattern are both predefined. Particular output voltage patterns can be selected by minimising a suitable objective function. Thus, the proposed scheme achieves precise current control along with the simultaneous optimisation of a performance objective. These features yield near-sinusoidal currents in the load with reduced current peaks, lower inverter switching frequency, and reduce inverter and load stresses. This type of current control scheme is especially suitable for potentially high performance applications such as AC motor drives and UPS systems. Finally, detailed experimental investigation of the current control scheme is presented

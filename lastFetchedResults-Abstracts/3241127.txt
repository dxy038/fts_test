Coal blending technology has attracted much attention in coal-fired power plant of China, especially used to solve the conflict of actual supplied coal and designed coal in the boiler. According to blending schemes and relations between single coal and blending coal used in the factory, this paper formulates a resource-constrained 0-1 mixed integer programming model considering inventory by using the minimum coal blend costs as the objective function. This model determines the proportion of each component coal that is in a ton of the optimum coal blend. In addition, all coal quality parameters calculated by linear constraints in the coal blend should be within the range of given border. Finally, we get the optimum solutions of the model by setting different inventory problems and prices of each single coal in the CPLEX software. The results provide a good reference for coal blending.

Simulation-based surrogate models have been used for a variety of application in automotive industry. In this paper, based on the FEM analysis, both of the response surface model (RSM) and kriging model are used to optimize an ADI control arm, where the weight of the lower control arm is considered as the design objective, and the maximum allowable von-Mises stress the constraint objective. The initial FEM analysis shows the stress distribution and maximum stress on the lower control arm under a very severe loading condition, by virtue of the result of FEM analyses, fifty simulations with six design variables are performed for RSM and kriging model to construct the approximation of the weight and maximum stress to obtain the optimum result. In addition, the optimized results obtained by using RSM and KRG are confirmed by the verified FEM analysis. The result shows that both of them can get the optimum result well.

Objective- Evaulation of analgesic and sedative characteristics of xylazine/ketamine
combination for caudal epidural analgesia in comparison with two routine agents in donkey.
Design- Cross over study.
Animals- Five healthy adult donkeys of both sexes with body weights ranging from 150-200 kg.
Procedures- Three treatments [lidocaine HCl 2% (0.22 mg kg-1), xylazine HCl 2% (0.17 mg kg-
1) and xylazine HCl 2% (0.17 mg kg-1) combined with ketamine HCl 10% (1 mg kg-1)] were
evaluated and animals received each of treatments randomly at one-week intervals.
Cardiopulmonary parameters and rectal temperature were recorded before and every 15 minutes
after epidural administration. The onset and duration of analgesia were evaluated every 5
minutes, using noxious stimulus (pin prick and pinch tests) on the skin of tail, perineum, anus
and back thigh. Ataxia was assessed qualitatively between onset of anesthesia and return of
sensation. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test; a Pvalue
<0.05 was considered significant.
Results- Administration of xylazine along with ketamine resulted in more rapid onset and longer
duration of analgesia (P<0.05), without any measurable cardiopulmonary side effects in
comparison with the other treatments. However, severe ataxia was observed after the injection.
Conclusion and Clinical Relevance- In a clinical point of view, despite early induction and
longer duration of analgesia, this combination at these doses is not suitable for standing surgeries
of hindquarters in donkey because there was unacceptable likelihood of recumbency.

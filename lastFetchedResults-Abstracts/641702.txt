OBJECTIVE: We collected preliminary safety and efficacy data on the effects of Cholestin, a statin-containing dietary supplement, in individuals with dsylipidemia related to human immunodeficiency virus.

METHODS: Fourteen adults with dsylipidemia related to human immunodeficiency virus characterized by hypercholesterolemia, hypertriacylglycerolemia, or both participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in an infectious disease clinic based in an academic medical center. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1.2 g of Cholestin twice daily (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) for 8 wk. The main outcome measures were safety (hepatic function tests, plasma human immunodeficiency virus-1 RNA levels, CD4+ cell counts, adverse effects) and efficacy (fasting serum cholesterol: total, high- and low-density lipoproteins, and fasting serum triacylglycerols). Safety and efficacy outcomes were evaluated at 2- and 8-wk intervals.

RESULTS: Twelve participants (n = 6 per group) completed the 8-wk treatment protocol. After 8 wk of treatment with Cholestin, there were significant declines from baseline in mean (± standard error of the mean) fasting total cholesterol (−30.8 ± 8.8 versus 7.7 ± 5.6; P = 0.01) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (−32.2 ± 7.2 versus 26.3 ± 14.2; P = 0.01) versus placebo. Moreover, the decline in fasting total cholesterol was significant (−40.2 ± 4.8 versus 2.8 ± 11.9; P = 0.006) after 2 wk of therapy, at which time the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol approached significance (−30.2 ± 7.4 versus 4.4 ± 15.2; P = 0.068). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels did not change at either time point. No adverse effects were seen with Cholestin.

CONCLUSIONS: Cholestin may safely lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with dsylipidemia related to human immunodeficiency virus. Larger and longer-term trials of this approach are warranted.

This paper presents a simple temperature control for high efficiency induction cooker based on class-E DC-AC resonant inverter. The active switch can be operated under the zero-voltage switching conditions. The conduction loss of the anti-parallel diode of the active switch and the harmonic currents injected into the public supply system can be reduced. The high power-factor and low line current harmonic distortion can be obtained, which are very attractive in term of commercial production. In order to achieve upon this objective, the induction cooker´s parameters need to be designed properly and details of analysis and design of this induction cooker´s components are described. A proposed high efficiency induction cooker is designed for an operating at a 32-kHz frequency, a 220-V line rms voltage, a 50-Hz line frequency and a 1.2-kW output power.

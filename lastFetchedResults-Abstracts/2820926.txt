Emerging multimedia services are spreading significantly thanks to the availability of high speed wireless networks. Network operators are facing the challenges to accommodate these services (e.g. Skype, interactive gaming, and other multimedia applications) with high user satisfaction. This paper presents a Quality of Experience (QoE) driven approach to allocate the radio resources in Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless networks, in order to get higher user satisfaction. The main objective is to enhance the user experience while using the multimedia services such as VoIP, by jointly considering the user QoE and available wireless radio resources in the LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) network. Specifically, we propose a new downlink scheduling algorithm known as &#8220;QoE Scheme&#8221; for multimedia VoIP service in LTE-A networks. The main advantage of the proposed QoE Scheme is its measurement of user satisfaction and its feedback mechanism to the scheduler at evolving NodeB (eNodeB) in order to make the scheduling decision.

Simulation is a powerful tool that is used to understand and analyze the effect of changes on real systems. However, developing and using simulation models requires high-level engineering skills. The objective of this research is to put state-of-the-art problem-solving technologies into the hands of decision makers, e.g. planners and supervisors. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) that utilizes discrete-event simulation models and heuristic optimization, yet permits effective use without detailed knowledge of the methodologies. The system is developed for the panel shop at Northrop Grumman Ship SystemsÂ´ (NGSS) Pascagoula Operations; the shop is considered the bottleneck for the shipyard. This system focuses on two key opportunities for improvement: sequencing panel production and resource allocation among steps in the production processes. The DSS is designed to be reused in similar operations at other shipyards and portions of the DSS may be used to apply simulation optimization to most industries

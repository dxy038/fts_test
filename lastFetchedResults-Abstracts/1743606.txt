The grip movement is essential for performing daily activities. However, the assessment of this movement is currently made subjectively, due to the lack of appropriate quantification equipment. The objective of this study was to develop, validate and test a virtual environment controlled by five trigger devices used to analyse cylindrical, spherical and hook grips as well as tip-to-tip pinch and pulp-to-side movements. Sensors and electronic circuits that detect the correct grip, the threshold of grip strength and the range of motion were inserted into the devices. To validate this system, tests were conducted with 20 children while being evaluated by three physical therapists, all specialists in neurology. The results from the evaluators and the system agreed to an extent of 86.6%. Following validation, the system was used by 35 children with no motor impairment and by 10 children with mild motor abnormalities in an upper limb; these assessments provided efficient and reliable results. The developments presented in this study may help to assess grip and pinch movements and facilitate the choice of strategies in therapeutic processes.

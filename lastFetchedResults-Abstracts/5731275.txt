Bidirectional pulse-width modulated dc-dc converters are popular in many applications such as rechargeable power supply units, where power flow in both directions is necessary. In this paper, the design of a synchronous bidirectional dc-dc buck-boost converter operating in CCM is presented. PSpice simulation results are shown to verify the designed converter operation and bidirectional power flow.

The Mars Volatiles and Climate Surveyor (MVACS) is an integrated payload on the Mars Polar Lander (MPL) launched on January 3, 1999. The MPL will land on Mars on December 3, 1999. MVACS consists of Surface Stereo Imager (SSI), Robotic Arm (RA) including Robotic Arm Camera (RAC), Meteorology Package (MET) and Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA). The major science objective of MVACS is to study where the Mars volatiles are now and what determines the behavior of Mars volatiles over time. The MVACS will accomplish most science activities during 3 months primary mission and will conduct an extended mission if the Lander continues to function

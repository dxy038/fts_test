This paper presents a proposed procedure to obtain maximum benefits in terms of reactive power reserve and power losses using the multi-objective fuzzy linear programming (MFLP) technique A multi-objective fuzzy linear programming is proposed to optimize total costs of reactive power purchase and minimize the total transmission losses. In this new paper, the author limits to exchange total cost of reactive power by reactive power reserve, looking for maximizing reactive power reserves and minimizing active power losses. The proposed procedure is very significant to eliminate violation constraints and give an optimal reactive power reserve for multi-operating conditions. The proposed MFLP is applied to 52-bus system at West Delta region as a part of the Egyptian Unified network. The numerical results show that the proposed MFLP technique achieves a minimum real power loss with maximal reactive reserve for power systems for different operating conditions.

Objective: To assess the association of alcohol intake with progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Although moderate drinkers have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than abstainers, the relation of alcohol use and coronary atherosclerosis has not been well studied. Methods and results: In the Stockholm Female Coronary Risk Angiographic Study, we evaluated 103 women, aged 65 years or younger, hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris who underwent serial quantitative coronary angiography 3–6 months following their index event and repeated an average of 3 years and 3 months (range 2–5 years) later. Individual alcoholic beverage consumption was assessed by a standardized questionnaire. We used mixed model analysis to estimate the effect of alcohol consumption on progression of coronary atherosclerosis, as measured by mean luminal diameter change, controlling for age, smoking, body-mass index, education, physical activity, index cardiac event, menopausal status, diabetes, and history of dyslipidemia. Of the 93 women with complete information on alcohol intake, 14 consumed no alcohol (abstainers), 55 consumed up to 5 g of alcohol per day (light drinkers), and 24 consumed more than 5 g of alcohol per day (moderate drinkers). Coronary atherosclerosis progressed by a multivariate-adjusted average of 0.138 mm (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.027–0.249) among abstainers, 0.137 mm (95% CI: 0.057–0.217) among light drinkers, and −0.054 mm (95% CI: −0.154 to 0.047) among moderate drinkers (P<0.001). The inverse association persisted in analyses stratified by index event. No beverage type appeared to confer particular benefit. Conclusions: Among middle-aged women with coronary heart disease, moderate alcohol consumption (over 5 g/day) was protective of coronary atherosclerosis progression.

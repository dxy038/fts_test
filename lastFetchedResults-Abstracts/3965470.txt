The paper considers the problem of determining an optimal design of a reliability system with multiple properties and integer variables. This problem is formulated as a multiobjective nonlinear pure-integer programming problem. The method for solving this problem consists of three techniques: 1) narrowing a given feasible region if the region is too wide, 2) obtaining exactly the set of Pareto-optimal solutions, and 3) selecting the best one for decision makers from the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. An increase in the number of objective functions scarcely affects the size of problem. An example is included.

Objective
esent study was designed to evaluate psychiatric risk factors for child and adolescent suicide, and to determine the association between impulsive-aggressive and other personality traits, and suicide completion in this population.

atric diagnoses, impulsive-aggressive and other personality traits were assessed in 55 child and adolescent suicide victims and 55 community controls using semi-structured proxy-based interviews and questionnaires.
s
st significant psychiatric risk factors associated with child and adolescent suicide were depressive disorders (OR = 48.414, 95% CI 6.247–375.185), substance/alcohol abuse disorder (OR = 5.365, 95% CI 1.434–20.076), and disruptive disorders (OR = 13.643, 95% CI 2.292–23.16). Additionally, suicide victims showed higher scores on lifetime aggression/impulsivity, and harm avoidance. However, after logistic regression, the only independent significant predictors of suicide in this age group were the presence of depressive disorders (Adjusted OR (AOR) = 39.652, 95% CI 4.501–349.345), substance/alcohol abuse disorders (AOR = 7.325, 95% CI 1.127–47.62), and disruptive disorders (AOR = 6.464, 95% CI 1.422–29.38).
tions
vely small sample size, and cross-sectional design.
sions
ndings confirm the existence of a particular clinical profile of children and adolescents at high risk for suicide. Additionally, our results reinforce the need for improved understanding of the interrelationships between stressors, depression, substance/alcohol abuse disorders, disruptive disorders and personality traits/dimensions in youth suicidal behavior.

An effective method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) for the determination of kanamycin in human serum was developed and validated. Off-line SPE was employed for the isolation of kanamycin from serum on a carboxypropyl-bonded phase (CBA) weak cation-exchange cartridge. A mixture of 0.2 M borate (pH 10.5)–methanol (50:50, v/v) was used as analyte eluting solvent. After pre-capillary derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde/mercaptoacetic acid reagent, the sample was analyzed by CE with a separation buffer of 30 mM borax, pH 10.0, containing 16% (v/v) methanol. A linear response over the concentration range 5–40 μg/ml was obtained with a detection limit of 2 μg/ml. Intra-day and inter-day precision were 6.2 and 10.3% RSD, respectively. Recoveries of approximately 90% were found. For the determination of lower levels of kanamycin (&lt;5 μg/ml), NH4OH (25%, w/v)–methanol (30:70, v/v) was used for analyte elution. After evaporation, reconstitution and derivatization, the sample was analyzed by on-line field-amplified sample stacking (FASS) CE. Good linearity in the concentration range 0.4–5 μg/ml was obtained with a detection limit of 0.1 μg/ml. Intra-day and inter-day RSD were 3.4 and 11.2%, respectively. Recoveries of approximately 60% were found. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of kanamycin in sera of tuberculosis patients at peak level and trough level concentrations.

In traditional Online Examination System, only objective type questions are assessed and according to that marks are given to the student. However, this technique lacks the capability of evaluating descriptive answers. In university examinations, there are many types of question included for evaluation of the students. Therefore, the automated system must be capable of evaluating the descriptive answers. The online examination system checks the student answer by matching the answer with predefined set of answer. The predefined answers are saved on the server and evaluation is done automatically using the automatic assessment tools. Here the machine learning approach is used to solve this problem using text mining. Measuring the similarity between, sentences, words, documents and paragraphs is an important component in various tasks such as text summarization, information retrieval, automatic essay scoring, document clustering, and machine translation and word-sense disambiguation. In this system JSON is used for transferring data between web application and server, serving as an alternative to XML.

The problem of speed control of a DC shunt motor is considered. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the strengths and limitations of three different nonlinear control design methods for the speed of a shunt DC motor. These methods are: feedback linearization, input-output linearization, and fuzzy logic control. These three methods are described in the paper. The simulation results are presented for a DC shunt motor while load torque is changing

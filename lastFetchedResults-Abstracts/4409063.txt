In this paper, we applied two methods of process mining techniques (from Discovery class/approach) in order to extract knowledge from event logs recorded by an online information system. The event log was created via information received from an online proceedings review system in Thailand. Accordingly, Alpha and Heuristic algorithms were used with the objective of automatically visualizing the models in terms of Petri nets and animated simulations. The paper eventually aimed at improving the handling of online reviews by providing techniques and tools for discovering process, control, data, organizational, and social structures from the created event log.

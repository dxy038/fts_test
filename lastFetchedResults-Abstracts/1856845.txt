The construction industry in the Middle East represents a significant part of the world's economy. Millions of dollars are spent each year on different construction projects. These projects normally pass through several phases starting from pre-investment phase, conception design phase and finally the construction and commissioning phases. Financial management is a creative organized approach with an objective to minimize financing risks. It focuses on financial evaluation as an important issue; in that it has long been an area of attention of construction practitioners and researchers.

ocument represents a proposed program which is coded into a computer language designed to facilitate the financial evaluation process for construction projects at the pre-investment phase for a developing country. The results of this proposed program reveal that it is capable of giving investors pertinent financial information at the different stages of the project, particularly the construction field. The validity of the proposed model is tested using a case study.

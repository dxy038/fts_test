During 2008-2010, EPRI, in collaboration with the electric utility industry, identified various technologies to enhance the efficiency and utilization of the electric transmission system, and developed a framework, including approaches and tools, for assessing a broad array of benefits that can be derived from implementing these technologies. Since 2010, EPRI has worked with a number of utilities to develop and execute demonstration projects on these technologies. American Electric Power (AEP) actively participates in the Transmission Efficiency Initiative. AEP, along with EPRI has carried out four projects to assess energy savings, CO2 emission reductions and cost effectiveness of different technology options to reduce transmission system losses. For each of these projects, the benefit assessment approach and tools were selected based on the project scope, objective, and the available data and resources. This paper summarizes these four demonstration projects, primarily to document the methods used, the results obtained, and the lessons learned. These projects provide relevant information and learning on the economic and environmental benefits of implementing measures to improve transmission efficiency.

Protein crosslinking and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) depletion are characteristic of disc degeneration. The objective of this study is to analyze the role of these biochemical changes on the mechanics of annulus fibrosus extra-fibrillar matrix (EFM). It was found that GAG depletion decreased ionic contribution, but not the nonionic contribution of the EFM. Additionally, crosslinking increased the stiffness of annulus fibrosus EFM.

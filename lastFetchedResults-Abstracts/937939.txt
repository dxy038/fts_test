This paper presents a parameter estimation method for suspended sediment transport processes subject to random
wave environments. An objective function was constructed based on measurements of suspended sediment concentration
profiles and the governing equation of sediment transport. The Chebyshev least square method was employed
to approximate the process parameters, i.e. vertical eddy diffusivity  «. and net vertical velocity  w.. The objective
function of sediment transport processes with Chebyshev’s parameters is well posed and does not require boundary
conditions. First, second, and third order « and w Chebyshev orthogonal functions were determined for monochro-
matic  MONO., narrow-banded  NBR. and broad-banded  BBR. random wave conditions. In the BBR and NBR
conditions, the best fit Chebyshev approximations of « and w were 2nd degree, while the best approximations in the
MONO condition were 2nd degree for « and 1st degree for w. The Chebyshev method provides a quick, accurate
and direct estimation of two prime parameters in sediment transport dynamics

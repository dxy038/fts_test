With the proliferation of Web services and the evolution towards the Semantic Web comes the opportunity to automate various Web services tasks. A number of approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem of automatic web service composition. Most of them are inspired by the researches in AI planning. As heuristics plays a key role in the promotion of planning efficiency, the selection of heuristic mechanism is very important. In this paper, we propose the conception of composition distance, and propose a heuristic bidirectional search algorithm based on composition distance. The most contribution of this paper is: (1)propose the conception of composition distance: (2)a heuristic bidirectional search algorithm. The algorithm we proposed is effective and efficiency when applied in web service composition engine.

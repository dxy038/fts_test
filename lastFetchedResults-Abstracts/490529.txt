Obesity was defined as having a BMI> 95th percentile of Iranian reference. Thereafter, 114 pupils were selected as obese children and the control group was chosen from students having 15th <BMI<85th percentiles. Two groups were matched by age, school and classroom. Twelve non-obese students left the study because of not willing to corporate (n=102 students). Mothers were categorized based on BMI to 3 groups: "<25.0 kg/m2 = normal weight", "25.0-29.9 kg/m2= overweight", ">30 kg/m2= obese". Demographic questionnaire was completed by interviewing the mothers.
Results: Fifty five percent of obese pupils and 12.9% of control group had overweight mothers (P<0.001). There was a significant association between childhood obesity and mothers' age, parental occupation and education (P<0.001). Sixty eight percent of obese students had family history of obesity, while only 2.0% of control group had similar background (P0.001). More than 21.1% of obese children were categorized as good economic status, but 2.0% of second group were in this rank. Family size was significantly different in two groups (P<0.001).
Conclusion: In this study, mothers' obesity, family history of obesity, family size, economic status, mothers' age, parental education and occupation were the risk factors of obesity in Neishabour school children.

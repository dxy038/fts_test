Flexibility has been a major design factor in the formation of socio-spatial characteristics of the Iranian traditional houses. Today, architects and designers could benefit from the great lessons of such houses in their approaches to design residential communities.
In general, the issue of "flexibility in housing" is related to some functional, social, psychological, and economic factors with respect to the characteristics of a family. Flexibility issues could include some changes related to the system of housing, the size of a family, the periodical needs of a family, and the activities in which the members of a family may be engaged in.
The objective of this article is to examine the issue of flexibility in traditional houses of Iran and to develop an analytical method for studying about "flexibility" and its effective design issues. This article develops a theoretical context in relation to flexible housing, and examines those theories through the use of an in-depth case study. The outcome of this article proposes a matrix with two sets of variables. One set of variables classifies different types of flexibility which include: "versatility", "adaptability", and "variability"; and the other set of variables classifies traditional houses into three scales of: "micro", "middle", and "macro". Using this model could provide an opportunity to analyze the flexibility of the houses based on their functional, structural, and spatial organization with respect to the "fixed", "semi-fixed", and "informal" features of a house. The results of such an analysis could be helpful to develop a design guideline for design of residential communities.

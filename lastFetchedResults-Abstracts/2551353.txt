Totality or comprehensiveness is one of the most outstanding qualities of the perfect man. This means that the perfect man possesses all ranks of the world of the being and all qualities and aspects of past and present dgrees of the existance have been manifested in him. The Reality of the Existance, i.e. the Almighty God, has both the interior and manifestation. The world of the creature is his manifestation and his interior is are the “Divine Attributes”. The perfect man is as a mediator between the two of them. In other words, the perfect man possesses all attributes and qualities of the Divine worlds and manifestations from the world of the unseen to the material world.
The perfect man has been also called the minor world because of possessing all the ranks of the world. Due to the totality of Divine names and attributes in him, he is also the Caliph of God on Earth, and deserves authority over others. On the other hand, since the intermediate realm is located in between the manifestation and interial, the perfect man possesses the authority for scientific and objective mediation and granting his merits to the entire world of the existence. And since the world in existence depends upon the presence of a friend of God, the rank of the centrality of time belongs to him and therefore, he is the high ranking sign of God and he will never be absent in the world.

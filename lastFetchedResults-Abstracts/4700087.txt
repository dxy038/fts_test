SERVQUAL model has been used to measure service quality in different industries. In most cases, this model was validated by confirmatory factor analysis approach. The objective of this research is to validate SERVQUAL model with higher order factor analysis approach to find whether or not there is a second-order component of service quality in the context of information system use. For this objective, an empirical study is proceeded to validate one IS-adapted SERVQUAL model in the context of an e-learning system use. Results under higher order factor analysis approach reveal good fitness and effectiveness, which will provide support for the future research on relationships among affected factors with service quality.

In Belgium, two types of cables with different compositions have been installed for underground transmission of electricity, namely XLPE (cross linked polyethylene) and XLPE-EA copolymerised with ethylacrylate. Part of the study was devoted to obtain a better characterisation of their capacity to store space charges. The ultimate objective will be to compare the cable laid in the ground after some years ageing with the reference cable, in order to evaluate their evolution. More than thirty cables have been measured by the thermal step method (TSM) so that statistical results can be presented

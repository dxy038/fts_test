Soil disturbance is a wildlife habitat management tool that retards succession and promotes early seral vegetation. Our objective was to determine responses of two invasive herbaceous species (Pennisetum ciliare and Salsola iberica) and native perennial grasses to disking on different soils. Two 10 Ã—40 m plots were delineated within each of 4 blocks on Ramadero loams and 4 blocks on Delmita fine sandy loams. On Delmita soils, canopy cover of P. ciliare, S. iberica, and native perennial grasses averaged across all years was not affected by disking (ANOVA, P>0.05). On Ramadero soils, P. ciliare canopy cover was similar (Tukey's, P>0.05) on control and disked plots for the first 4 years post-disturbance, but P. ciliare cover was 10-fold greater (Tukey's, P=0.02) the 5th year after disking on disked versus control plots. On Ramadero soils, S. iberica canopy cover averaged across all years was 221 times greater (ANOVA, P=0.05) on disked plots than on control plots. Disking did not affect native perennial grass canopy cover. Land managers should consider soil series when disking for wildlife management, as disking disturbance may exacerbate exotic plant ingress and establishment on certain soils.

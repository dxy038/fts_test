The two-machine sequencing problem for a repetitive production system that is viewed as a deterministic discrete-event dynamic system is considered. The objective is to minimize the steady period, which is also the average weight of the critical circuit of the timed marked graph describing the system. The classification of the sequencing problems is done according to the ordering ranks of the ordering matrices. The two-machine sequencing problem is completely solved. The discussion is based on the theories of time-marked graphs and max algebra

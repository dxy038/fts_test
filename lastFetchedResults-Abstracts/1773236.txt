Summary
 colloidal iron staining of 8 chromophobe cell carcinomas (CCC) was compared with that of non-chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (RCC), renal oncocytomas, and renal adenomas. Six non-chromophobe RCC showing diffuse and moderate cytoplasmic staining contained extensive areas with translucent cytoplasm as observed in CCC. Seventeen of 25 conventional RCC of the clear cell variant (randomly chosen from 130 cases), 21 of 26 RCC with areas of chromophilic cytoplasm, and 16 of 20 papillary RCC, 7 of 14 adenomas and 14 of 16 oncocytomas displayed focal areas with mild to moderate staining of the cytoplasm. Hale's colloidal iron staining was partially reduced by digestion with neuramidase but not with hyaluronidase. This positive staining demonstrated glycoproteins containing sialylated glycoconjugates, probably a type of acid epithelial mucin. We suggest that there is a spectrum of mucin-like changes in typical CCC representing RCC with extensive and marked “mucin-like changes”. The eosinophilic variant of CCC and some RCC with extensive chromophobe cell features represent renal neoplasms with moderate changes. The other RCC, oncocytomas and papillary renal neoplasms with mild to moderate staining with Hale's colloidal iron represent renal neoplasms with focal mucin-like changes. RCC with extensive chromophobe cell features may pose a differential diagnostic problem with CCC.

The objective of the paper is to analyze the bound of addition proposed by D.J. Barros et al. (1997) in contrast to the GMD bound (G.D. Forney Jr., 1966) and the cone bound (W. Godoy Jr., 1990) which shows the Voronoi region of the zero code-word for a specific vector. A new algorithm, which associates the ZNA algorithm (L.B. Levitin and C.R.P. Hartmann, 1985) with the bound of addition, is proposed for soft decision techniques

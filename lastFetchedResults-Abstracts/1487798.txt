The objective was to evaluate high pressure processing (HPP) on postmortem metabolism and pork quality. Six pigs were randomly selected immediately after slaughter. After splitting, one side was randomly designated for HPP of 215 MPa for 15 s with water temperature at 33 Â°C and the other side (non-pressure treated) served as the control. Chilled sides were fabricated into loins, boneless picnic, boneless Boston butt, and ham. Samples were cut from the loin, inside portion of the ham and cushion (M. triceps brachii). Pork quality, lipid oxidation, connective tissue solubility, protein functionality, sensory analysis, and processed characteristics of restructured hams were evaluated. HPP partially inhibits postmortem metabolism, indicated by lower muscle lactate levels and higher ultimate pH values. Cook and drip loss were both reduced in HPP treated muscles compared to controls. HPP treated sides were more tender than controls. Collagen content was not different between HPP and control groups.

Objective: To determine the long-term behavior of the clinical AIDS survivability curve for a cohort undergoing anti-HIV therapy and for a comparison cohort undergoing no such therapy.

s: Zidovudine therapy is shown to increase the average longevity of a cohort with clinical AIDS a maximum of 5.7 months. Not only does zidovudine eventually fail to prevent death, evidence is presented that suggests that long-term use of the drug may be counterproductive and actually decrease survivability. The analysis herein suggests that to maximize longevity in those with clinical AIDS, zidovudine therapy should be administered for a short period (on the order of several months or less) and then ended.

sions: The usual practice in controlled anti-HIV drug trials of prematurely ending the experiment as soon as the drug is shown to significantly increase survivability in those with AIDS is shown to be a mistake. Anti-HIV drugs typically have a negative impact on the immune system, and long-term use of these drugs can actually shorten survivability rather than prolong it. Evidence is presented showing that short-term zidovudine therapy increases longevity in those with AIDS, but long-term continuation of the therapy may actually shorten it.

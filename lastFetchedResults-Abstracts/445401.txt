Background: Trovafloxacin, a broad-spectrum fourth-generation quinolone with gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacterial activity, is available in oral and intravenous formulations. The objective of this prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study was to compare the efficacy of trovafloxacin with that of cefoxitin, an approved drug for treatment of acute gynecologic infections, together with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as oral follow-on treatment.

Methods: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute pelvic infection received either intravenous alatrofloxacin with oral trovafloxacin follow-on (trovafloxacin) or a combined regimen of cefoxitin followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for a maximum of 14 days. The primary endpoint was clinical response to therapy on follow-up at day 30.

Results: Clinical success rates were comparable between the trovafloxacin (n = 107) and comparative (n = 119) groups at study end (90% vs. 86%, respectively; 95% confidence interval, âˆ’4.5, 12.5). Among clinically evaluable patients, clinical success rates for infections involving Enterococcus species were higher with trovafloxacin than with the comparative regimen at the end of treatment (96% and 85%) and at study end (96% and 86%).

Conclusion: Intravenous alatrofloxacin followed by oral trovafloxacin for a maximum of 14 days of total therapy was efficacious in the treatment of acute pelvic infections.

The Embedded Systems Project is at the core of the second-year electrical and electronic engineering course at the University of Manchester. The objective is to construct a working buggy based on microcontroller, which is able to autonomously detect a white line from a black surface then navigate around a track via the white line. It must be able to tackle obstacles, including slopes, different break points on the track and corners and reach the end of the track successfully. In addition, not only the operation, but also the speed of the buggy should be taken into consideration; the faster, the better.

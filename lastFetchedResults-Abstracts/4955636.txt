Precedence-constrained parallel applications are one of the most typical application model used in scientific and engineering fields. Almost all efforts, on this kind of applications, have focused on the minimization of makespan (completion time). It is only recently that much attention has been paid to energy consumption. In this paper, we address the precedence-constrained parallel applications on heterogeneous computing systems (HCSs). We propose a new bi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm that takes into account, not only makespan, but also energy consumption. This metaheuristic adopts dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) to minimize energy consumption. Our study provides promising results showing the significance and potential of DVS. The experimental results from our comparative evaluation study confirm the superior performance of our approach over the other known heuristics on the two criteria energy saving and completion time.

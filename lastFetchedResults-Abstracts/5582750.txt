Broadband networks require high-capacity switches in order to properly manage large amounts of traffic fluxes. Electronic and photonic technologies are being used to achieve this objective both allowing different multiplexing and switching techniques. Focusing on the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), the inherent different characteristics of electronics and photonics makes different architectures feasible. In this paper, different switching structures are described, several ATM switching architectures which have been recently implemented are presented and the implementation characteristics discussed. Three diverse points of view are given from the electronic research, the photonic research and the commercial switches. Although all the architectures where successfully tested, they should also follow different market requirements in order to be commercialised. The characteristics are presented and the architectures projected over them to evaluate their commercial capabilities

Social networks of the Web 2.0 have become global (e.g. FaceBook, MSN). In 1977, L. C. FREEMAN published the first generic metrics for Social Networks Analysis (SNA), mainly based on static graph-mining models. The objective of our work is to introduce new dynamic SNA models dedicated to SNA and to take the conceptual aspects of enterprises and institutions social graph into account. Our work is based on the definition of new multidimensional measures in SNA for new decision-making functions in Human Resource Management (HRM). The presented contributions makes it original. They are: (1) a measure of tension of a social network, (2) an electrodynamic and predictive system for semantic recommendations on social graphs evolutions and (3) a measure of reactance of a social network used to evaluate the individual stress of its members.

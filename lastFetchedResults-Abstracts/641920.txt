Objective
We investigated the value of resting energy expenditure (REE) in healthy neonates and evaluated the impact factors on REE.
Methods
One hundred eighty healthy neonates (95 boys and 85 girls) with birth weights above 2500 g were measured by indirect calorimetry, and the effect of birth weight evaluated. Measured and predicted REEs were compared, and the effects of sex and delivery method on REE were examined in 154 newborn infants with birth weights of approximately 2500 to 4000 g.
Results
Birth weight had a significant effect on REE. There was a negative relation between REE and birth weight (r = −0.289). The REEs of newborn infants weighing more than 4000 g were statistically lower than those of infants weighing 2500 to 4000 g (44.5 ± 5.9 versus 48.3 ± 6.1 kcal • kg−1 • d−1, P = 0.01). The measured and predicted REEs of 154 newborn infants were 48.3 ± 6.1 and 54.1 ± 1.1 kcal • kg−1 • d−1, respectively. There was a significant difference between the two values. Sex and delivery methods had no effect on REE in healthy neonates.
Conclusion
The value from the predicted equation is not suitable for neonatal energy supplementation in clinical practice. The normal REE value for healthy neonates with birth weights of 2500 to 4000 g is 48.3 ± 6.1 kcal • kg−1 • d−1.

In the (mobile) communications domain, Quality of Experience (QoE) has become the ultimate metric influencing the success or failure of new applications and services. Since it is increasingly argued in the literature that QoE should be seen as a multi-dimensional concept, this paper focuses on QoE from an interdisciplinary perspective. In this paper, we discuss a framework that can be used for the evaluation of QoE in mobile settings. Additionally, QoE related to a mobile video-streaming application was evaluated by a user panel in a semi real life context. In this study, usersÂ´ subjective evaluation of relevant QoE dimensions is related to a set of objective parameters.

Objective
To investigate the participation of clonotypic MM B cells in the IL-6 network in patients with multiple myeloma.
Methods

CD19+ B cells from 45 patients with multiple myeloma and from 18 healthy donors were sorted and their expression of IL-6, IL-6 receptor (CD126) characterized by flow cytometry, in situ RT-PCR, and ELISA measurement of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R. Expression of CD31 was detected by flow cytometry.
Results

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine often overexpressed in multiple myeloma (MM). IL-6 induces growth and inhibits apoptosis of MM plasma cells, and upregulates the activity of osteoclasts. MM plasma cells, the most mature component of the MM clone, secrete IL-6 and induce IL-6 production from other cell types. However, the MM clone also includes circulating clonotypic B lymphocytes. Using ELISA and in situ RT-PCR we demonstrate here that, unlike the healthy control B cells, MM B cells express IL-6 mRNA and secrete IL-6 protein. In vitro, MM B cells were the major producers of IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. On average, 50% of MM B cells express the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R, CD126), suggestive of autocrine stimulation. They also express CD31, potentially facilitating their paracrine interactions with osteoclast precursors.
Conclusion

Secretion of IL-6 by circulating clonotypic B cells in MM may contribute to the autocrine and paracrine cytokine networks that maintain the malignant clone and are responsible for disruption of normal bone metabolism in this incurable disease.

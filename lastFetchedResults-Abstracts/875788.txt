The Reggeon field theory is governed by a non-self adjoint operator constructed as a polynomial
in A, A
∗, the standard Bose annihilation and creation operators. In zero transverse dimension, this
Hamiltonian acting in Bargmann space is defined by
Hλ
 
,μ
= λ
 
A
∗2A2 + μA
∗
A+ iλA
∗ 
A
∗ +A
 
A,
where i2 =−1, λ
 , μ and λ are real numbers and the operators A,A
∗ satisfy the commutation relation
[A,A
∗] = I . As the quantum mechanical system described by Hλ
 
,μ has a velocity-dependent
potential containing powers of momentum up to the fourth, the problem of existence of Hamiltonian
path integral for the evolution operator e
−tHλ
 
,μ of this theory is of interest on its own. In particular,
can we express e
−tHλ
 
,μ as a limit of “integral” operators? In this article one considerably reduces
the difficulty by studying the Trotter product formula of Hλ
 
,μ to reach two objectives:
• The first objective is to prove a very specific error estimate for the error in a Trotter product
formula in trace-norm for H viewed as the sum of the operators λ
 
A
∗2A2 and μA
∗
A+iλA
∗ ×
(A
∗ + A)A.
• The second objective of this work is to give a approximation of the semigroup generated by
Hλ
 
,μ when Hλ
 
,μ is split in the sum of λ
 
A
∗2A2 + μA
∗
A and iλA
∗
(A
∗ + A)A. We notethat this case is entirely different. In fact, the usual Trotter product formula is not defined, because
the interaction operator A
∗
(A
∗ +A)A is not the infinitesimal generator of a semigroup on
Bargmann space. For λ
 
> 0 andε >0, we choose an approximation operator θε = [I −εiλA

(A

−εHλ
 
,μ. This
choice allows us to give in [A. Intissar, Note on the path integral formulation of Reggeon field
theory, preprint] a “generalized Trotter product formula” for Tμ = μA

This paper investigates multi-criteria decision-making of power distribution system planning with different types of distributed generations. Uncertainties of the distributed generations make it difficult to determine the exact numerical values of the criteria governing the planning. A method that can determine the interval entropy weights is thus proposed for solving such a multi-objective problem. The interval entropy weights can efficiently integrate the subjective preferences of the decision makers through introducing the interval orness measurement. Finally three distribution system planning modes including energy storage and renewable power sources are evaluated to justify the rationality and flexibility of the proposed method.

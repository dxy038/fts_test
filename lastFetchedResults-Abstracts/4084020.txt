This paper presents a search method based on lexicographic order, and an upper bound on the objective function, for solving redundancy allocation problems in coherent systems. Such problems generally belong to the class of nonlinear integer programming problems with separable constraints and nondecreasing functions. For illustration, 3 types of problems are solved using our method. Numerical investigation shows the performance of the method for large problems

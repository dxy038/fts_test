This is the second part of a two-part paper in which application methods to enhance distribution horizon planning for a 20+ year period are described. The optimal horizon planning model encompasses all distribution design requirements for primary and secondary systems. The model formulation is described in the companion paper Part I. The model makes use of a generalized feeder layout viewed as a tree-like circuit serving a circular sector of a round or hexagonal service area of uniform load density. The horizon model optimization objective cost function and constraint equation applications are described in this paper. The horizon planning model is validated with analysis of case studies and sensitivity evaluations for input and output variables. The case studies are assessed under various conditions such as changing consumer density, consumer characteristics, cost of energy, and economic assumptions. The application of the model is demonstrated using Snohomish PUD future expansion assumptions with case studies to examine impacts of horizon assumptions on future conductor sizes, primary voltage classes, voltage drop designs, reliability, and consumer cost of service

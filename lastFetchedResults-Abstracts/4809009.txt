One of the major difficulties with an autonomous reverse parallel parking is how to find a trajectory of travel from start to goal without any collision. In this paper, a bidirectional search is suggested to find the shortest pathway from an initial vertex to a goal vertex in a directed graph, implying that the initial and goal states must be known in advance. In each step for searching, there are three possible nodes generated from the configuration space (or C-space), that the algorithm must decide to traverse to based on a best first search algorithm. Giving a start and goal points, the designed path is obtained by simulation in MATLAB. The experimental results show an ability to perform a parking maneuver using the simulated path.

We propose an integrated approach for dynamic route guidance and ramp metering control using model predictive control (MPC). The main control objective is to minimize the total time spent in the network by giving accurate travel times as controller input to the network while taking into account the effect of other traffic control measures, such as ramp metering. The travel times shown on the dynamic route guidance panels allow the drivers to make a choice based on possible alternatives. By aiming at minimizing the total time spent as well as the difference between travel times shown to the drivers and the travel times realized by the drivers, the interests of both the individual drivers as well as the road administration are pursued. Simulation results for a case study show that the proposed integrated MPC traffic control results in a lower total time spent while the drivers get accurate travel time information.

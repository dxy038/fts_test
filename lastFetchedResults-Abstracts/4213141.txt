We present a novel converged inter/intra data center network architecture to enable on-demand rack-to-rack connectivity across data centers. The hardware architecture includes a bidirectional software-defined optical gateway that aggregates racks or pods on a conventional data center data plane and provides both east-west and north-south connectivity. The software architecture consist of two Software-Defined Networking (SDN) agents over the data center and transport network control planes that manages connection requests and finds the optimal routing and wavelength configuration from the available WDM channels. We present bulk data transfer and Virtual Machine (VM) migration on a testbed of three data centers.

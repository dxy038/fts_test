A modified FKCL (MFKCL) algorithm for automatic segmentation of MR brain images is proposed in this paper. This algorithm is an extension of traditional fuzzy KohonenÂ´s competitive learning algorithm. In our method, a factor that can estimate the effect of the neighbor pixels to the central pixel is introduced into the objective function of the standard FKCL algorithm as the local information. The local information is applied to trail off the effect of noise to the result of MRI segmentation. Experiments with simulated MR data and real MR data show that our algorithm can resist not only the little, but also the heavy noise compared with standard FKCL segmentation and other reported methods.

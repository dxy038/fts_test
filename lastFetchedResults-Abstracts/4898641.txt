An interval method is suggested for globally solving optimization problems of the following type: minimize a given objective function subject to both functional inequality constraints and simple bounds on the variables. The present method appeals to a new interval linearization of each nonlinear function and is based, essentially, on two computation techniques: linear programming and constraint propagation. The use of these techniques in the computational scheme of the present method seems to lead to improved performance as compared to other known interval methods of the same class

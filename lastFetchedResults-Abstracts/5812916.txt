Internet of Things (IoT) is an inter-network to which innumerable smart devices are connected, and eventually integrate the objective world with the information world. IoT is able to greatly improve the efficiency of productive process and promote the harmony between man-made and natural environments. Due to the variability and complexity of the future wireless network environment and the scarcity of its resources, satisfying the requirements of IoT applications faces severe challenges. Therefore, a new resource management and control model, Uniform Cooperation and Control Entity (UCCE), is proposed. This layered information base of network state in UCCE helps to fully share resources among different users and even among heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, UCCE innovatively classifies the context information affecting network connections according to their time scale. This effectively provides guarantees of lifetime connection availability.

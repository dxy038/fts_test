Objective of this study is to analyze the performance of a straight sealing labyrinth in gas turbine engines in static as well as dynamic conditions. The study contains the effect of Reynolds number and ratio of tooth width to tip gap (t<sub>w</sub>/C) on the performance of straight sealing labyrinth. The analysis was carried out for different pressure ratios (PR) and different rotational speeds (RPM). The results are in good agreement with the available experimental results.

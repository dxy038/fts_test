Ontologies are increasingly used in many domains, such as knowledge management, information extraction, the semantic Web and so on. More and more ontologies have been published on the Web, with different scope and quality. Ontology evaluation has been proposed as one strategy for quality assurance of ontologies. In this paper, we propose a democratic ranking system analogous to that used by Amazon.com and eBay, with an innovation that we separate the reviewers into deferent groups of domain experts, ontology researchers, and common users. By using the server side Java technologies and Ajax technology, we developed a prototype system which can evaluate ontologies uploaded by users in both an objective and a subjective way.

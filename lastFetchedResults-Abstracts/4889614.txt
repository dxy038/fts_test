In repeat-pass SAR interferometry, errors in the satelliteÂ´s state vector and the atmospheric excess path delay degrade the measurement accuracy of geodetic information (topography and surface deformation). Although this information requires centimeter order precision in phase measurement, the current state vector of the satellite does not meet the accuracy requirement. The atmospheric excess path delay caused by water vapor may differ by several tens of centimeters from day to day, and it must be corrected. The author investigates a method to correct the atmospheric excess path delay using the global objective analysis data (GANAL) and to estimate the state vector using ground control points. They also have evaluated this method by using Mt. Fuji and Mt. Iwate data, both observed by JERS-1, and found it to be very effective

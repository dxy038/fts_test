This paper investigates the optimal power flow in a power system network with Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) using Differential Evolution (DE )Algorithm. Minimization of real power generation cost is taken as the main objective which is subjected to various constraints. TCSC is placed in various lines in the test system and its significance is clearly discussed. This methodology is validated by testing on standard benchmark test systems like 5-bus and IEEE 30-bus systems. The advantages of OPF model, based on DE is compared with conventional LR based method in terms of bus voltage, power flow, active power loss and power generation.

Background: Hepatopathy induced from toxic chemicals and some drugs has harmful effects on the metabolism. Carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) able to make liver damage in humans and animals. In the absence of some drugs that are able to protect the liver against damage, conventional medicine requires the use of herbal medicines that may have antioxidant activity in this field.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Pleurotus Osteratus and Pleurotus Djamor herbal extracts on liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.
Methods: In this study, 35 male rats were divided into seven groups, which the respective groups, carbon tetrachloride, fungal extracts and silymarin (The positive control group) were injected. To evaluate the effect of injected compounds, biochemical tests were carried out.
Results: High levels of serum enzymes indicative of leakage and loss of hepatocyte membrane integrity followed by injection of carbon tetrachloride were observed. In the groups treated with extracts, the serum levels of certain enzymes decreased compared to the group treated with carbon tetrachloride. It is also possible to compare groups of receiving silymarin extract suggests that the protective effect of the extracts on hepatocytes, is comparable with silymarin.
Conclusion: The results show that the extracts used in this study by maintain the structure and integrity of the hepatocytes membrane or repair damaged cells could decrease the serum levels of liver enzymes and liver protective effects following administration of carbon tetrachloride.

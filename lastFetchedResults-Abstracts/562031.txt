The task of efficient utilisation of poultry farm excreta is a global problem and technologies that are developed towards this objective are protected into patents. Strategic mining of globally available open access patent databases using a wide range of keywords related to poultry farm excreta yielded 341 relevant patents. The information contained in patents are analysed and compiled into seven groups. Poultry farm excreta are converted into fertiliser, feed, energy/fuel and also used for certain non-conventional applications too. Further, methods for reducing odour/ ammonia volatilization from poultry farm excreta and development of microbial consortia for rapid degradation of excreta are presented. A search on commercial utilisation of poultry farm excreta reveals it utility as a fertiliser. It is either used as a sole component of fertiliser or used in combination with other plant and animal wastes. The article highlights the technological details involved in patents falling into various groups and provides an analysis of strategies employed in processing and utilisation of poultry farm excreta.

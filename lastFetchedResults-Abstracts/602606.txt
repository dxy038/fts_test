Abstract:The objective of this research was to evaluate the qualitative characteristics of pearl millet silage. Whole pearl millet (Pennisetumtyphoid) was harvested in early growth period,heading and soft-dough stages of maturity. The forages enriched with three levels of ground barley (0, 1.5 and 3 percent of DM) and three ensilingday (45, 90 and 150 days) in a completely randomized design with a factorial 2×3×3 arrangement. Theharvesting stage of forage had a significant effect on dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, water soluble carbohydrate, calcium and phosphorus contents of silage (P < 0.05). Ammonia/Total nitrogen ratio and pH was lower in soft-dough stage than other stage (P < 0.05). Ground barely had significant effect on CP, Ca and P content, but had no significant effect on pH and Ammonia/Total nitrogen ratio. Apparent judging was 12.4 and 15.1values for early heading and soft-dough silage respectively. Apparent judging value increased when three percent of ground barely added. It can be concluded that soft-dough stage was the best time to pearl millet forage harvest and necessary to add carbohydrate source for decrease moisture content of pearl millet forage in order to obtain good quality silage.

The objective of this paper is to examine the effects of foreign and domestic R&D capital stock via importing capital and intermediate goods on total factor productivity (TFP) growth in Iran's manufacturing sector using the data over the period 1338-1387. Because of the absorption of foreign R&D spillovers, it is theoretically expected that the foreign domestic R&D spending will improve total factor productivity growth. Moreover, domestic R&D spending will positively affect TFP growth. The results of the study show ihat human capital and foreign R&D capital stock have the most positive impact on TFP growth. The estimated coefficient of domestic R&D capital stock is positive while it is statistically insignificant. In addition, the cross effect between foreign R&D capital stock and human capital stock is positive and statistically significant.

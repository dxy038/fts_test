This paper presents a demonstration of solving optimal power flow problems by using one of swarm intelligences, called artificial bees algorithm. The objective of the problem can be expressed by taking the total production cost into account with required constraints. Among potential intelligent search methods, artificial bees algorithm is new and just developed since 2005. In this paper, the artificial bees algorithm is exploited to demonstrate its use of solving the optimal power flow problem. A 6-bus power system was situated for test. Sets of optimal parameters with respect to economic objectives can be efficiently found. This revealed that the artificial bees algorithm is one of efficient methods for solving the optimal power flow problem.

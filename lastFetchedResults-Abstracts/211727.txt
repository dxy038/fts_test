Classic sarcoidosis usually presents as bilateral hilar adenopathy on chest radiograph.
Definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis requires demonstration of noncaseating granulomas in tissue biopsy
and exclusion of other disorders known to cause granulomas. Over the five years, from 1994 to 1999,
25 cases of sarcoidosis were diagnosed on the basis of clinical, radiologic and histological criteria in
Sabol, an area with high prevalence rate of tuberculosis (TB). During the follow up period,
development of new clinical and radiological symptoms in nine patients resulted in final diagnosis of
tuberculosis in six patients and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the three remaining patients. Tuberculosis
was confirmed by the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and lyn1phoma by the tissue biopsy.
In geographic areas with a high prevalence rate of TB, hilar adenopathy and noncaseating granulomas
which are essential components for diagnosis of SA, do not generally indicate SA, but warrant a careful
follow up with the special consideration for exclusion of TB.

This paper presents a physical and geometrical design sensitivity algorithm for the optimal temperature control of induction heating devices. The exciting coil positions and the source current density are taken as design parameters together and renewed simultaneously in every iterative step by using the Levenberg-Marquardt method, which can achieve better results. This method can also give a faster and more stable convergence of the objective function than conventional steepest descent method. The proposed algorithm is applied to a numerical example and verified

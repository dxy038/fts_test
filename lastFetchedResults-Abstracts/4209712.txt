A common practice in medical diagnosis and patient management is the comparison of two chest radiographs images. The difference between two digital images at two time points is a measure of the effect of treatment on the patient. Two measures of similarity, the ordinary regression coefficients, R<sub>S</sub> <sup>2</sup> and coefficients of determination for the unreplicated linear functional relationship model (ULFR), R<sub>F</sub> <sup>2</sup>, are used to compare images for the particular case of mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Our results suggest that a series of R<sup>2</sup> values indicates gradual declining trends with values falling within a band. New patients with a series of R<sup>2 </sup> values falling within this band may be consider as making a good or acceptable recovery

An embedded audio-video synchronous coding scheme based on mode selection is proposed in the paper. In H.264, many mode types are employed to conduct inter prediction for determining the best one to achieve good coding efficiency. In the paper, the audio information is embedded into video stream by modulating the best mode in inter prediction, and then synchronous coding is applied to the mixing video and audio. The modulation is based on the cost function and mapping rules between the mode types and the audio bits. We have verified the proposed scheme based on H.264/AVC using JM 11.0 and evaluated it by four objective indicators: the video quality, the embedded cost, the change of bit-rate and the change of total encoding time. The experimental results show that this scheme has achieved synchronous coding between audio and video with small influence on the above four objective indicators.

This paper presents a novel Electric Energy Management compensator based on Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization search technique MOPSO for use in hydrogen and island electricity generation. It combines a fuel cell power source and a micro hydro water turbine. The novel control strategy is designed to achieve the high-efficiency coordinated operation of the two individual power sources and to regulate current and voltage for maximum utilization, without compromising the power quality and performance of the overall system. To achieve these conflicting objectives, a novel dual action Modulated Power Filter and Compensator at the AC bus (MPFC) and Green Power Filter GPF scheme at the DC bus using real time self regulating error tracking scheme for voltage stability, energy conservation, loss reduction, power factor correction, and power quality enhancement for hybrid multi source energy utilization systems. Multi Objective Optimization MOPSO technique is used to find the optimal control gain settings that dynamically minimize the global dynamic error.

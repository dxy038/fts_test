Objective (s): Health inequality and inequity had been assessed in many studies within and between countries. Reducing this inequity can be achieved through the adjustment of social determinants of health and primary healthcare. These two paradigms, social determinants of health and primary healthcare, are the main concerns of policy making in health care system. 
The aim of this study was to design a model for integrating social determinant of health into primary healthcare system. The implementation of this model can help to reduce health inequalities and promote health equity.
Methods: This study was conducted in two phases. First, the integration models were compared between selected countries. Then, based on the results obtained and the capabilities of Iranian primary healthcare system, we designed and proposed an integration model of social determinants of health in primary healthcare system for Islamic Republic of Iran.
Results: Successful integration of social determinants of health in the health system requires policymaking and an appropriate mechanism that include policies, a comprehensive healthcare system, welfare system and the evaluation strategies and indicators. 
Conclusion: We proposed a model of integration of social determinants of health compatible with the Iranâ€™s primary healthcare system. This model contains three levels, national, meso, and micro level. Implementing this model is more likely to improve the health equity indicators.

Objective: Estimation of the role of main dietary compounds in the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Research methods and procedures: Literature published till 2010 was reviewed and selected for further analysis. The used terms were: red meat, minced meat, ham, bacon, sausages, white meat, poultry, vegetables, fish, eggs, fruits, lifestyle, diet, pancreatic cancer and pancreatic neoplasm. The collected data were meta-analysed with calculation of combined relative risk and 95% confidence interval as well as studies heterogeneity. Results: A meta-analysis of 11 case–control studies indicates that red meat ingestion elevates pancreatic cancer risk by 48% (95% CI = 1.25–1.76). The vegetables and fruit reduce the risk by 38% (95% CI = 0.54–0.73) and 29% (95% CI = 0.59–0.84), respectively. The pooled analyses of 10 cohort studies do not show significant relations between main dietary compound ingestion and pancreatic cancer risk. Conclusion: The red meat intake is associated with elevated risk of pancreatic cancer in contrast to vegetables and fruit ingestion. The ingestion of red meat, vegetables and fruit in cohort studies was not influenced on pancreatic cancer risk. The role of fish, poultry and eggs was not significant in both case–control and cohort studies, thus further studies were needed.

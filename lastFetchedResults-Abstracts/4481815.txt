This paper presents a design of fuzzy logic control for 2DOF laboratory helicopter model (Humusoft CE 150) which represents a nonlinear and highly cross-coupled system. The controller is composed of two fuzzy logic controllers for azimuth and elevation controls. The main objective of the paper is to obtain robust and stable controls for wide range of azimuth and elevation angles changing during the long time flight. The quality and effectiveness of both fuzzy controllers were verified through both simulations and experiments. Also, a comparative analysis of proposed fuzzy and traditional PID controllers is performed.

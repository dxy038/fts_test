In this paper, we investigates idle user as a potential relay node to improve performance of system in 60 GHz millimeter wave wireless communication. We analyze the performance of the relay assist dual-hop transmission, and derive a closed form outage probability (OP) solutions. To minimize the OP for relay position selection, we formulate the objective task as a minimization problem. This position is a function of the transmit power, path loss and height of the access point (AP), and it can be obtained numerically. In addition, we compare the performance for different transmission schemes, including optimal user relay node (URN) assisted transmission, dual-hop transmission assisted by a fixed relay node (FRN), and the single-hop direct transmission. The simulation results have demonstrated that the optimal relay position selection transmission can provide significant higher throughput than FRN assisted transmission as well as direct transmission, therefore it is very promising for the future 60 GHz wireless systems.

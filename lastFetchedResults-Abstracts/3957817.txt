Multicast is an important service relied upon by many applications in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), which unfortunately is limited by the subscribing station with the lowest data rate. A key approach to address this problem is to employ an association control strategy to ensure stations are organized in a manner that optimizes a given objective. To this end, this paper studies the NP-hard, Multiple Multicast Sessions (MMS) problem. It proposes a novel greedy algorithm that aims to minimize the average APs load. Simulation results show that our algorithm reduces the average APs load by up to 70.4% as compared to prior approaches.

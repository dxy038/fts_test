Objective
rpose of this study was to evaluate the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) in aggressive periodontitis (AgP), chronic periodontitis (CP) and periodontally healthy control subjects, before (BT) and after (AT) the non-surgical periodontal treatment.

ically healthy 12 CP and 13 AgP patients and 20 control subjects were included in this study. Plaque index, gingival index, probing depth and clinical attachment levels were recorded and GCF samples were collected BT and AT. Assays for GCF t-PA and PAI-2 levels were carried out by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The χ2, Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney U tests and Spearman correlation coefficient were used for data analyses.
s
tically significant reductions in clinical index scores were noted in both periodontitis groups after treatment. No significant differences were detected in GCF levels of t-PA and PAI-2 between CP and AgP groups at either BT or AT. There was a statistically significant decrease in GCF PAI-2 levels in CP after therapy (p &lt; 0.01). GCF t-PA levels in CP and AgP groups exhibited significant correlations with PD and CAL measurements at both BT and AT (p &lt; 0.01).
sion
icant decrease was detected for GCF PAI-2 levels in CP and clinical parameters in both CP and AgP by non-surgical periodontal treatment.

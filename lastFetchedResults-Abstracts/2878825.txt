Instructors are not using well-designed computer-based visualization as widely as expected. Even among instructors using visualizations in teaching, their integration strategy is not aligned to their objectives with the visualization to bring about effective learning. As a result, the higher level learning outcomes possible with visualizations is often missed. In such context, we present a web-based tool, Customized Visualization Selection and Integration (CVIS) tool that selects visualizations customized to the specified instructional setting. It also guides instructors to implement the appropriate instructional strategy with visualization that is aligned to their instructional objective. The tool has been pilot tested for usefulness and effectiveness with engineering instructors with instructors accepting it as a practical solution towards effective teaching with visualizations.

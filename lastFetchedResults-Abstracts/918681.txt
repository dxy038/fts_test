5-Azido-5-deoxy-xylo-, ribo-, and arabinofuranoses were prepared by the reaction of the respective 5-O-(methanesulfonyl) or p-toluenesulfonyl derivatives with NaN3 in DMF. The intermediate 5-azido-5-deoxy glycofuranoses on 1,3-cycloaddition with different alkynes in the presence of CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate gave the corresponding sugar triazoles in very good yields. The synthesized sugar triazoles were evaluated for their antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, where one of the compounds displayed mild antitubercular activity in vitro with MIC 12.5 Î¼g/mL.

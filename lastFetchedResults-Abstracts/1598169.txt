In this paper we discuss the question: among a group of decision making units (DMUs), if a DMU changes some of its input (output) levels, to what extent should the unit change outputs (inputs) such that its efficiency index remains unchanged? In order to solve this question we propose a solving method based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Multiple Objective Linear Programming (MOLP). In our suggested method, the increase of some inputs (outputs) and the decrease due to some of the other inputs (outputs) are taken into account at the same time, while the other offered methods do not consider the increase and the decrease of the various inputs (outputs) simultaneously. Furthermore, existing models employ a MOLP for the inefficient DMUs and a linear programming for weakly efficient DMUs, while we propose a MOLP which estimates input/output levels, regardless of the efficiency or inefficiency of the DMU. On the other hand, we show that the current models may fail in a special case, whereas our model overcomes this flaw. Our method is immediately applicable to solve practical problems.

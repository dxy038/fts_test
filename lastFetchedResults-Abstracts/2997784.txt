Considering that mobile communications systems and the Internet are key technologies for the development of the information society, one objective of the European IST project BRAIN is the design of a mobile broadband IP radio interface. This radio interface is based on the ETSI HIPERLAN Type 2 standard with some enhancements necessary to optimise the system for the delivery of IP broadband services with high QoS and mobility requirements. The project is working on optimising layer 2 algorithms and protocols for IP mobile services such as adapted schedulers, optimised handover procedures, handling of a standby mode and specifying a dedicated LP Convergence Layer able to transport efficiently IP version 4 as well as version 6 packets over the air and interworking with LP mobility and QoS functions

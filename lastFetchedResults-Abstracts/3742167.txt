The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of using electrostatic atomization to produce fine ceramic particles starting from highly conducting ceramic precursor solutions. The work was directed towards carrying out experimental investigation for the production of uniform droplets formed by the breakup of a permanent jet extending from the capillary nozzle. To control the atomization process an AC field (sine wave) was superimposed on a DC field. For given parameters of electrostatic field, capillary diameters, resistivity of liquids, and flowrate, the jet formation and breakup process was investigated. Several regimes were observed to be in synchronization with the applied potentials and frequencies. In these regimes uniform droplets were produced. Optical techniques were employed to study the breakup process

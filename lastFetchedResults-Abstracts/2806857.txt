This paper presents a method to determine the optimal capacities of a set composed by PV system, diesel generator (DG) and battery bank. The problem is posed as a constrained optimization. The objective is to minimize the annual cost of system (ACS) with zero unmet loads and to maximize the usage of the PV system while restricting the CO<sub>2</sub> emission. The optimization problem is constrained by the system operations, reliability and battery bank state of charge. The decision variables are the number of PV, the capacity of battery and diesel generator power rating. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated by means of the simulation results.

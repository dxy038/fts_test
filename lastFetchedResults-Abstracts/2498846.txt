The objective of present study was to conduct a self-assessment of services' quality, receiving student feedback, and initiate corrective actions to step towards EFQM model. The RADAR Logic was used to conduct self-assessment. To deploy RADAR Logic a descriptive â€“ cross sectional study conducted on total students (270) at bachelor degree in Kashan University of Medical Sciences in first semester in 91-92. A questionnaire according to current performance and student expectations were evaluated and scored from good to poor. Variance and frequency were employed to describe qualitative variables. Consolatory and supportive services, management services and educational quality indicate major existing gap between current performance and students expectations. Using EFQM self-assessment method would work as quality improvement tools in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Due to the unfamiliarity of quality management philosophy in HEIs, corrective actions should focus on infrastructure functions including resources, processes, policies, and people to pave the way. To achieve and continue quality improvement, establishing a quality management committee at Medical Universities seems to be essential.

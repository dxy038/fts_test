This paper considers the problem of out-of-band failure localization in all-optical mesh networks using bidirectional monitoring trails (bm-trails), where every possible link set with up to <i>d</i> arbitrary links is considered as a shared risk link group (SRLG). With the SRLG scenario, the bm-trail allocation problem is firstly formulated, which includes the phases of code assignment and bm-trail formation. In the first phase, each SRLG is uniquely coded by assigning each link with a nonadaptive d&#773;-separable combinatorial group testing code. Then, the second phase manipulates a sophisticated yet efficient bm-trail formation process through a novel greedy code-swapping mechanism, such that any SRLG failure can be unambiguously localized by collecting the alarms of the interrupted bm-trails. The algorithm prototype can be found in . Extensive simulation is conducted on hundreds of randomly generated planar topologies to verify the proposed approach in terms of the number of required bm-trails and the computational efficiency. Our approach is compared with previously reported counterparts, by which its merits are further demonstrated.

This study was based on the prevailing need to reproduce customers´ preferred images. Therefore, we propose a new subjective image quality assessment consisting of languages that customers and manufacturers can easily understand based on the objective image quality measurement factors. In order to examine subjective image quality assessment, these objective image quality measurement factors are expressed by general adjective language throughout the experimental process. To draw adjective languages, the objective image quality measurement factors are presented by stimuli, and subjects expressed their perception of an image quality. The resulting languages are used to question an image quality. According to the analysis, there are meaningful correlations between image quality measurement factors. Moreover, the results indicated that items which strongly affect preference are color reproduction, dynamic range, resolution, and noise, respectively. The study concurs with Engeldrum´s The Complete Image Circle and affirms the positive role of interaction between manufacturers and consumers to assess and enhance image quality preference and equipment performance.

In our related work, we proposed Cognitive Stereo Auto Focus for stereo camera. Instead of moving optical axis, Cognitive Stereo Auto Focus shifts one side image to the opposite side for setting focus. In the shifting process, focus point should be set on the proper place not to cause any side effect produced by visual fatigue to user. To perform low visual fatigue focusing, Cognitive Stereo Auto Focus analyzes the input scene and find how many objects are in the image and how big they are. Based on the analysis information, the algorithm sets the focus where user feels less visual fatigue. In this paper, we suggest a mass object analyzer hardware whose objective is analyzing disparity map for generating information on the objects in the scene for Cognitive Stereo Auto Focus. Through experiment results, we confirmed that the performance of the suggested system is enough for practical use.

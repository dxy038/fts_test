This paper proposes a nonlinear control for a dual active bridge converter (DAB) using properties of flatness system. This converter system is used for a DC microgrid. Losses in the system are modeled as a resistance connected in parallel with the output capacitor. The control algorithm also takes this resistance into account. With a small-scale test bench, bidirectional power flow capability is demonstrated. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through experimental results.

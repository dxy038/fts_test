BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The goal of breast cancer screening (BSC) is early detection. Among all diagnostic strategies, BSE is an easy, without any side effects, accessible and less expensive way for women to detect breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of BSE education on increasing knowledge and practice of women.
METHODS: This study was performed on 149 women referred to health center of Ramsar during three consecutive months. Their knowledge and practice about BSE were examined by questionnaire and practical exam, respectively. They were educated with pamphlet, Molage poster and practical ways of BSE and after 3 months they passed post-test. FINDINGS: Results of statistic analysis showed that there was a significant difference between the rate of knowledge and practice before and after education (p<0.0001). In pre-education, 30.8% of people had good knowledge and after education this rate increased to 89.9%. The rate of appropriate practice in pre-education was 13.5% and after education this rate increased to 70.4%. There was a significant relationship between age and educational level of women and their knowledge and practice about BSE (p<0.0001) (p-0.003).

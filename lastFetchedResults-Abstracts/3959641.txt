For the last few years, much attention has been focused on arc flash hazards by the electrical community; however, statistics indicate that the majority of electrical injuries and fatalities are the result of shock. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and NFPA 70E <i>Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace</i> both require electrical conductors and circuits that operate at 50 V or greater to be de-energized before working on or near those conductors or circuits. This requirement is generally interpreted to mean that a shock hazard does not exist below 50 V. The objective of this paper will be to explore the validity of this assumption and to determine whether there may be a more appropriate level at which de-energizing should be considered.

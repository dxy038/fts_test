Background: para-nonylphenol (p-NP) is able to induce malformations in male
reproductive system.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the preventing role of vitamin E
(Vit.E) on sperm parameters and reproductive hormones in developing rats.
Materials and Methods: Pregnant rats were divided into 4 groups: control, p-NP, Vit.E
and p-NP+Vit.E. Treatments were performed on day 7 of gestation and continued
during weaning. The male pups were then divided into the same groups as the mothers
and were treated till 90 days of age. Finally, body and left testis weight were recorded
and left epididymis was cut in Ham’s F10. Released sperm were used to analyze
number, motility and viability of the sperm. Blood serum was used to assess follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen and testosterone.
Results: In p-NP-treated rats, a significant decrease was found in body and testis
weight, sperm number and sperm motility compared to control and p-NP+Vit.E groups.
A significant increase was also found in sperm viability in Vit.E group (83.3±7.6)
compared to both p-NP (59.5±7.5) and control (66.3±9.7) groups. Rats treated with p-
NP showed a significant decrease in FSH level and a significant increase in estrogen
level. However, testosterone and LH level remained constant. In p-NP+Vit.E group, the
change of estrogen level but not FSH was significantly reversed compared to p-NP
group.
Conclusion: Vit.E not only is able to compensate the toxic effects of p-NP on testis
weight, sperm number, sperm motility and estrogen level, but also increases sperm
viability in developing rat.

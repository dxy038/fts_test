The curvature control problem for a class of hyper-redundant robot arms with continuum elements characterized by an elastic backbone system is analyzed. The main parameters of the arm shape as curvature and curvature gradient are estimated. The stability analysis and the resulting controllers are obtained using the concept of boundary geometric control and a weighted state control methods. The proposed algorithm determines the control solutions using the dynamic model expressed in terms of curvature parameters. The objective of this paper is the curvature control problem of a tentacle arm with continuum elements HHR 02 (Hybrid Hyper-redundant Robot 02). Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithms and techniques.

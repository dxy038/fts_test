The availability of the saturated DNA marker maps in livestock has made it possible
to locate quantitative trait loci (QTL) in these domestic animals. The objective of this
research was to investigate the principles of applying the simple regression for QTL
analysis in paternal half-sib (PHS) design commonly used in livestock species. The
theoretical aspects of the simple regression approach for QTL mapping in PHS design
were studied. Simulation study showed that the power of QTL detection using the
regression method increased as the sample size and QTL effect increased. Also
increasing family size led to improved precision and accuracy of QTL parameters
(estimates of QTL location and effect). The experimental beef cattle weaning data
recorded on 366 animals from three half-sib families genotyped for 189 microsatellite
markers were analyzed exploiting the simple regression approach. The results revealed
two large QTLaffecting weaning weight. The two detected QTL were located on Bovine
chromosome 14 (BTA14) and (BTA 16)at 29 and 81 cM, respectively.

Background and objective: The HBV subtypes are considered valuable epidemiological markers for identifying the infection sources. Subtypes can be exploited to determine the route of infection. This study aimed to evaluate the relation between HBV subtypes, risk factors and the pattern of HBsAg subtypes distribution in high risk groups in Tehran.

Materials and methods: To detect HBs-Ag subtypes in HBsAg carriers, serum samples from 161 patients and chronic carriers at Tehran hospitals were tested by competition inhibition ELISA method.

Resulths: From 161 samples , 98(60.9%) had ayw subtype and 63(39.1%) of samples had adw subtype. Subtyping of HBV in high risk groups showed that 61.8 % of IV drug addicts and 57.9% of alcoholic patients had adw as their dominant subtypes. These results indicate a significant relation between IV drug addiction and alcoholic consumption with HBV subtypes.

Conclusion: Results confirm the independent virus rotation diagram in independent societies. Subtypes distribution can be used to identify the sources and route of transmission of HBV infection in epidemiological studies.

This paper describes the qualitative simulation modeling applied to a supply chain management. The main objective is to use complex system modeling methods to model the SCM (supply chain management) and then to determine the main parameters which have influence on the performance of the SCM. In this paper, the time series of the demand information from the customers will be analyzed and the forecasting and inventory policies would be discussed according to the analysis. The results of this paper will be listed finally, and some other research should be completed.

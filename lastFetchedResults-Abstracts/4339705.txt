AUTOMATIC generation control (AGC) has been used for several years to meet the objective of maintaining the system frequency at nominal value and the net tie line power interchange from different areas at their scheduled values. One of the main components of AGC is Load frequency control (LFC), one of the major requirements in providing reliable and quality operation in multi-area power systems. In interconnected large power systems, variations in frequency can lead to serious large scale stability problems. A new model derived from [3] with substantial modifications is presented in this paper. One principal modification concerns the turbines and consists of the creation of aggregate turbine for each type of turbine, another important modification is the consideration of several types of turbines participating in the secondary control, and the final modification is the consideration of aggregate generation coefficient in forming the rotor angle input of the tie-line model.

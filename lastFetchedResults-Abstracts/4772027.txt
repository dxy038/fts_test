As ground source heat pump system has been widely applied, the feasibility analysis becomes more and more important. The investment, system cost, energy consumption, maintenance, equipment room area and other things, should be considered when making a decision for a ground source heat pump compound system as an energy solution. The paper applies the way of TOPSIS, which is a kind of Multi-objective analysis methods, and takes some real project for example, to evaluate some energy solution for an air-condition system to make sure the result is feasible. Comparing to the conventional method which only concerns investment and running cost, the method of TOPSIS not only insures the energy solution reasonable, but also helps to make the optimal decision.

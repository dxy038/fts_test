The general characteristics of a dynamic simulator for advanced robotics are discussed. The features of a dynamic simulator, ARS, for advanced robotic applications, currently under development at the University of Genova, are outlined. The flexibility of ARS makes it suitable for the simulation of underwater vehicles and robots. With this objective, simple models of the hydrodynamic effects are presented

The Self-Organizing Network (SON) paradigm enables automated management of next generation mobile communication networks by introducing a set of autonomous functions that jointly achieve self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. Each SON function is driven by a specific objective to optimize one or more Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). If a function encounters situations in which the given targets cannot be achieved, it can produce undesired behavior, resulting in an impaired SON. This paper presents the idea of SON Operational Troubleshooting function and outlines a concept for the automatic detection, analysis, and mitigation of operational problems.

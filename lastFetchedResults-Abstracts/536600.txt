Many algorithms of grammatical inference were developed for several types of grammars.  The grammatical inference problem consists of finding, from a set of strings, a grammar that producesall the strings of this set [3]. We are interested here by the inference of particular grammars, noted Lsystems, which are parallel rewriting systems most famously used to model the growth processes of plantdevelopment. We present a survey on methods of L-system inference proposed since the creation of thisrewriting system by Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968 [15]. The grammatical inference of L-systems has beenstudied over the past 30 years, and that in relation to several areas of application of produced L-systemsWe are interested in looking at this problem from the point of view of a possible use of these methodsfor an application in biological modeling, particularly in the modeling of plants. In order to providea better understanding of the research challenges of L-system inference, this article presents a detailedinvestigation of current state-of-the-art algorithms in L-system inference, with an analysis highlightingtheir positive and negative points. Open research issues are also discussed, with an objective to sparknew research interests in this field

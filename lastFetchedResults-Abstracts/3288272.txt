In this paper, the virtual machine placement problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The objectives are maximizing profit, maximizing load balancing and minimizing recourse wastage. Results of Genetic algorithms, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II are compared with common solution representation, penalty and benefit values. All the three algorithms reported good solutions whereas GA and NSGA are subjected to premature convergence and duplicate solutions. NSGA-II gives good and diversified range of solutions.

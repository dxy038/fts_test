Background&Objective: Wound infection in post-operation is one of the side effect that bothering the patients' quality of life. This study was done to determine the effect of Subdermal irrigation with normal saline on the wound infection in abdominal surgery of obstetrics and gynecology.
Materials&Methods: A randomized clinical trial of subdermal irrigation with normal saline versus no irrigation was performed on 200 patients who were candidate for abdominal surgery of obstetrics and Gynecology. Contaminated wound was excluded. In the case group (100 patients) after facial repair and complete hemostasis, subdermic Tissue was irrigated with 1000-milliliter normal saline and skin was closed. In the control group (100 patients) after facial repair and complete hemostasis skin was closed without subdermal irrigation. All of the patients were followed until complete repair of skin.
Results: Two groups were similar in age, BMI, duration of surgery and the type of operation. Wound infection was observed in 1% of case group and in 7% of control groups which was statistically significant. (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Subdermal irrigation with normal saline is effective, simple, safe and not expensive which can reduce the wound infection and can be offered particularly in high risk patients for wound infection.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential use of a direct headspace-mass spectrometry electronic nose instrument (MS e_nose) combined with chemometrics as rapid, objective and low cost technique to measure aroma properties in Australian Riesling wines. Commercial bottled Riesling wines were analyzed using a MS e_nose instrument and by a sensory panel. The MS e_nose data generated were analyzed using principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS1) regression using full cross validation (leave one out method). Calibration models between MS e_nose data and aroma properties were developed using partial least squares (PLS1) regression, yielding coefficients of correlation in calibration (R) and root mean square error of cross validation of 0.75 (RMSECV: 0.85) for estery, 0.89 (RMSECV: 0.94) for perfume floral, 0.82 (RMSECV: 0.62) for lemon, 0.82 (RMSECV: 0.32) for stewed apple, 0.67 (RMSECV: 0.99) for passion fruit and 0.90 (RMSECV: 0.86) for honey, respectively. The relative benefits of using MS e_nose will provide capability for rapid screening of wines before sensory analysis. However, the basic deficiency of this technique is lack of possible identification and quantitative determination of individual compounds responsible for the different aroma notes in the wine.

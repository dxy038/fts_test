The operation condition of the main drainage pumps in mine directly affects the safety production of mine. In order to ensure the mine safety itÂ´s essential to real-time monitor the operation condition of the main drainage pumps. This remote monitoring and warning system for the main drainage pumps is mainly divided into the sensor layer at the bottom, the equipment layer on the lower computer and the monitoring layer on the upper computer. The monitoring data acquired by the sensors on the pumps could be real-time collected by the multifunctional monitor in the equipment layer and sent to the monitoring layer, finally the various monitoring parameters could be real-time displayed and stored in database in the monitoring layer developed based on the configuration platform on the upper computer. The system will real-time alarm when the operation condition of pumps is abnormal, therefore various sudden accidents could be avoided. The monitoring parameters could provide objective references for maintenance decision of the pumps in the future. This system being used has good extensibility, modifiability, reliable performance and has significantly enhanced the level of enterprise safety management.

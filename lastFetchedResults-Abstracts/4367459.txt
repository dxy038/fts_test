Conventional teaching of sensors, based on lectures, static written materials, laboratories, etc., has become rather difficult at all levels of education, recently. The main objective of the described project is the development of a multimedia supported education material that teaches the application of microelectronics and packaging technologies in designing smart sensor devices for the next generation intelligent systems. The new approach of teaching sensorics tries to exploit all advantages of multimedia computer aided teaching not only for keeping the competitiveness but also in order to overcome the above specific difficulties of the particular area. The course material will be available for the technical community, for other university professors for teaching, and also will continuously be developed on the Internet and on CDs. The paper will highlight the structure of the course material and demonstrate the animated sensor examples

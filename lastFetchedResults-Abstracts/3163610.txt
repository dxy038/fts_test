Combined with the characteristics of conventional distribution network planning, this article proposed a new power distribution network planning optimization method that based on the minimum life cycle cost (LCC) to decide distribution network planning scheme. The life cycle cost calculation model for distribution network planning scheme is made on the premise that the power network operate safely and steadily, in order to obtain the minimum life cycle cost (LCC) as the objective function and use the multi-particle swarms cooperative optimization algorithm to optimize the distribution network path planning, while according to comparative analysis of different layout patterns of switch with LCC to obtain the minimum LCC planning scheme. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by the result of applying it to a test system.

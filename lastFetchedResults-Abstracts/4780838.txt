From the appearance of the satellites communications one has been to improve two aspects keys in the systems of communications: the quality of the service (greater quality and bandwidth of the signal) as well as the costs (smaller investment for the operation and maintenance), during the process of improvement of these two aspects one of the ways concludes that to obtain it is to miniaturize the communications components, and is in this process that is discovered the technology microstrip. The objective of the present paper is to compare models of designed microstrip antennas for purposes of satellite communications.

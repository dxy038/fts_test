This paper discusses the adoption of bottom- up social software tools in formal learning environments. This is believed to enhance the learning experience of todayÂ´s young generation characterized by being technology savvy and keen on social networking. As a first step towards this objective, the 3A interaction model that aims at aiding the design of personal and collaborative learning platforms is presented. It accounts for interaction paradigms widely used in Web 2.0 applications and builds on Distributed Cognition and Activity Theory while remaining at the right level of abstraction to be easily &#194;&#191;translatable&#194;&#191; into tangible applications supporting both formal and informal learning.

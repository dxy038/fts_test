In this paper, a new bidirectional decision feedback equalizer (BiDFE) is proposed. The novelty of the proposed structure is that the proposed equalizer design is based on channel zeros, which is different from traditional BiDFE designs. The proposed bidirectional zero-based decision feedback equalizer (BiZDFE) efficiently exploits the time reversal operation, which results in that zeros of the equivalent channel seen from equalizer are the reciprocals of the actual channel zeros. It is shown that BiZDFE is more efficient in fading channel equalization than traditional BiDFE and minimum mean square error-decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE).

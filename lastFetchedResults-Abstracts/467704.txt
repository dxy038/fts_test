OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to review a single subspecialty practice experience with a uniform approach to delayed-interval delivery. STUDY DESIGN: A 66-month retrospective review of our maternal-fetal medicine practice database was completed. Fifty-nine sets of twins or triplets delivered at <30 weeks' gestation were identified. No cases of twins or triplets who came to our care, either in consultation or as primary providers, were excluded. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were excluded as candidates for delayed-interval delivery because of monochorionicity, abruptio placentae, severe preeclampsia, and the need for hysterotomy. Sixteen pregnancies were identified as candidates for delayed-interval delivery, and we actually attempted to delay delivery in 9 of them. The details of the interval deliveries are summarized; there was a mean latency interval of 34 days with a range of 3 to 76 days. Pregnancies in which delayed-interval deliveries were attempted were significantly less mature at the time of presentation than those managed by delivery of all infants initially. Perinatal mortality was significantly lower in the retained fetuses. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective consecutive case review from a single maternal-fetal practice documents that selected multichorionic pregnancies may benefit from delayed-interval delivery. Modest intervals between siblings during critical gestational ages can improve newborn survival and decrease neonatal morbidity. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:20-3.)

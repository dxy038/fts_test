One method of evaluating the quality of stereoscopic video is the use of conventional two dimensional (2D) objective metrics. Metrics with good representation of the Human Visual System (HVS) will present more accurate evaluation. In this paper we propose a perceptual based objective metric for 2D videos for 3D video quality evaluation. The proposed Perceptual Quality Metric (PQM) shows better results for 3D video quality evaluation and outperforms the Video Quality Metric (VQM); as it is sensitive to slight changes in image degradation and error quantification starts at pixel level right up to the sequence level. Verifications are done through series of subjective tests to show the level of correlation of PQM and user scores.

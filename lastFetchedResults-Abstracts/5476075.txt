The authors show that switched-level models can be written in VHDL (VHSIC hardware descriptive language) without special-purpose knowledge in the VHDL simulator. As a result, such VHDL switch-level descriptions may be executed on any simulator supporting the VHDL. The authors present a VHDL switch-level value system, discuss resolution functions, modeling tools written in VHDL, and describe an algorithm coded in VHDL for the modeling of bidirectional pass transistors.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Distributed video coding (DVC) is based on a new paradigm in coding, which has received many interests recently. This paper proposes a hybrid spatial and temporal error concealment scheme to conceal errors in Wyner-Ziv (WZ) frames. We first use a spatial concealment based on edge directed filter. This step is exploited to improve the performance of subsequent temporal concealment. An enhanced temporal concealment based on motion compensated temporal interpolation is proposed, including motion vector refinement and smoothing, optimal compensation mode selection, and a new matching criterion for motion estimation. Simulation results show that the objective qualities as well as the perceptual qualities of the corrupted sequences are significantly improved by the hybrid error concealment, outperforming both spatial and temporal concealments alone.

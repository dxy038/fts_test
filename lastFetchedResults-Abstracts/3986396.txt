A novel approach is proposed for modeling speech parameter variations between neutral and stressed conditions and employed in a technique for stressed speech synthesis and recognition. The proposed method consists of modeling the variations in pitch contour, voiced speech duration, and average spectral structure using hidden Markov models (HMMs). While HMMs have traditionally been used for recognition applications, here they are employed to statistically model the characteristics needed for generating pitch contour and spectral perturbation contour patterns to modify the speaking style of isolated neutral words. The proposed HMM models are both speaker and word-independent, but unique to each speaking style. While the modeling scheme is applicable to a variety of stress and emotional speaking styles, the evaluations presented focus on angry speech, the Lombard (1911) effect, and loud spoken speech in three areas. First, formal subjective listener evaluations of the modified speech confirm the HMMs ability to capture the parameter variations under stressed conditions. Second, an objective evaluation using a separately formulated stress classifier is employed to assess the presence of stress imparted on the synthetic speech. Finally, the stressed speech is also used for training and shown to measurably improve the performance of an HMM-based stressed speech recognizer

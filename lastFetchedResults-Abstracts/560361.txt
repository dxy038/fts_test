Objective: The present study was undertaken to evaluate anti-depressant activity of Myristica fragrans (MS).
Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to imipramine and herbal extract of MS for their antidepressant activity using Forced Swimming Test (FST), Reserpine Reversal Test (RRT), Haloperidol-Induced Catalepsy (HIC), and Pentobarbitone Sleeping Time (PST).
Results: Administration of MS and imipramine revealed a statistically significant reduction in immobility time in FST, RRT, and protection against HIC, compared to the control group. However, there was no significant potentiation of PST. 
Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the potential antidepressant activity of MS.

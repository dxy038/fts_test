In this paper, power system multi input-multi output identification methods that are useful for simultaneous coordinated design of power system stabilizer and thyristor controlled series capacitors controller are presented. The output error and the auto regressive exogenous input structures are used separately to identify the multi input-multi output transfer function of a power system. Different time domain responses and mode comparisons are presented to evaluate the identified models. In order to add more damping to low-frequency oscillations, a coordinated design of controllers is carried out by optimizing suitable objective functions using genetic algorithm. The performances of the actual system and the identified models under the controllers are simulated extensively. A comparison of the results confirms the effectiveness of the proposed power system identification methods.

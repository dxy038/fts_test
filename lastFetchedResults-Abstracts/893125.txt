A study was carried out in the state of Mexico, MÃ©xico with the objective to evaluate time related risk factors associated with the mortality rate occurring between catching and slaughtering of broiler loads slaughtered at a Mexican processing plant. Variables under study were divided into two categories: water and feed withdrawal time:  < 8 h and  >  8 h, catching and loading:  <  20 km and  >  20 km, transport time:  <  45 min and  >  45 min, lairage time:  <  30 min and  >  30 min.  For each of these categories, the number of broilers transported and the number of broilers that died during transport was ascertained, and the percentage of transport deaths of the total number of broilers transported was calculated. Logistic Regression procedure was used to model the relationship between the mortality rate and the previously described variables. None of the variables were shown to be significantly associated (P > 0.05) with bird mortality in all the categories under study. Average mortality rate was 1.63% ranging between 1.56% in bird deprived of feed less than 12 hours and 1.69% in bird deprived of water more than 8 hours. Bruises caused by unexperience of some catchers explained most of the bird losses recorded. It can be concluded that time of water and feed withdrawal, catching, loading, transport and lairage has no effect on broiler mortality. Thus, attempts to reduce losses in broilers be done by focusing on a achieving a set of recommended catching practices.

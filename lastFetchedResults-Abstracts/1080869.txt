The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the performance of a GAC postfilter-adsorber for the removal from the drinking water of Athens, Greece, of the two main groups of chlorination by-products, trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), as well as of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The analyses performed during the whole operation period (638 days) showed that the GAC breakthrough capacity for DOC was much higher than the capacity for total HAAs, which was higher than that for total THMs. The removal of THMs and the most part of the removal of HAAs and DOC should be attributed to adsorption by GAC, while that of a smaller part of HAAs and DOC may be attributed to biodegradation in the adsorber bed, where dechlorination, caused catalytically by the carbon surface, favoured microbial growth. Additionally, the GAC postfilter-adsorber showed a much higher adsorption efficiency than a GAC filter-adsorber, due to the smaller size of the carbon and the lower hydraulic loading rate. Also, observed desorption incidents of THMs (mainly) and HAAs, especially during the postfilteradsorber operation, were favoured by the same factors. Formation of THMs within the GAC bed was also indicated by the mass balance of total THMs during the whole cycle.

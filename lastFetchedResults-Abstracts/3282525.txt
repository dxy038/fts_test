Taking a picture containing all-focus objects with regardless of distance is difficult. A feasible strategy to generate an all-focus image relies on multiple images with different focus settings. Furthermore, image refocusing with side information is applied to all-focus image to generate depth-adjustable image which is like to real-world photos at the specified depth-of-field. In this paper, we propose image fusion and refocusing methods for generation of all-focus image and depth-adjustable image. During fusion procedure, measuring pixelsÂ´ blurriness of multi-focus reference images is the first process. Then, all-focus image composed of sharpest pixels among reference images, index map, and standard deviation-index table are yielded. The objective of standard deviation-index table is to connect relationship between Gaussian lowpass filter and index. During refocusing procedure, different Gaussian lowpass filters applied to all-focus image by referring to index map and standard deviation-index table, and then depth-adjustable image is generated. The experiment results demonstrate the proposed methods are better than the compared approaches in computational complexity and quality of all-focus image and depth-adjustable image.

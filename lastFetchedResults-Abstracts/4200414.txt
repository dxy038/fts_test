Medical imaging is the process of creating images of the human body for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. In medical imaging various modalities provide different features of body because they use different principles of imaging. Since no single image modality provides a complete information in all cases, fusion will be very useful. The objective of image fusion is to improve the image content, by combining information from multiple images. In this paper three transform based fusion rules, The Wavelet transform(WT), Contourlet transform(CT) and Nonsubsampled contourlet transform(NSCT) are compared. Experimental results show that the image fusion method based on NSCT performs better than the other two methods.

This work presents a novel technique for dynamic optimization of the electric power grid using brain-like stochastic identifiers and controllers called ObjectNets based on neural network architectures with recurrence. ObjectNets are neural network architectures developed to identify/control a particular object with a specific objective in hand. The IEEE 14 bus multimachine power system with a FACTS device is considered in this paper. The paper focuses on the combined minimization of the terminal voltage deviations and speed deviations at the generator terminals and the bus voltage deviation at the point of contact of the FACTS device to the power network. Simulation results are provided for the identifier and controller ObjectNets for the generators and the FACT device.

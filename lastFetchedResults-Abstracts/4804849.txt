The authors describe a unique energy management System architecture which is based on industry standards and the objective of insuring extensibility and upgradability to meet the new requirements imposed by electric power utilities. It is a distributed network architecture which is predicated on local area network (LAN) topology and the application of formal and widely used de facto industry standards. This unique architecture provides a solid and highly portable platform for continuous upgradability which is inherently extensible without practical limit

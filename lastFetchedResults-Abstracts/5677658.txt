One main aspect in the development of uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) is the elimination or the reduction of ferromagnetic components. In this paper, the effects of reducing ferromagnetic components is illustrated by the example of two different single phase UPS topologies. In the first part of the article, the transformer in a continuous mode UPS is eliminated, and in the second part of the contribution, the couple line inductance in a bidirectional UPS is replaced by different kinds of AC/AC converters. Several advantages and disadvantages of these two different UPS-topologies are discussed

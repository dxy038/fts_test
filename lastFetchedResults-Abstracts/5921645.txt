In this work, porous GaN was prepared by UV assisted electrochemical etching method. This method was employed in this work due to several advantages such as low processing temperature, low structural damage, process simplicity, versatility and low processing cost. The sample is required to be connected to power supply and biased positive and ultra-violet (UV) illumination is used to assist in the generation of electron-hole pairs. The porous GaN structures fabrication and their quantitative structural characteristics study are based on mathematical morphology analysis by using the scanning electrons microscope (SEM) images. The quality of porous GaN quality can be carried out by performing a nondestructive investigation of its nanostructures which can be performed by adapting image analysis techniques to obtain rapid, objective and quantitative information.

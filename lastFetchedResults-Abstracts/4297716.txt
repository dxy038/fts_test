In North America most producers and users of magnet wire are very familiar with the standards which describe and specify the various types in use. However on a worldwide basis there is group of international standards which also encompass magnet wire or, as it is called under these standards, winding wire. Since international trade in magnet wire has rapidly expanded, it is import for producers and users to be aware of the existence and status of the relevant standards sanctioned and issued by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This paper endeavors to give the reader a basic awareness of such standards and, at the same time, tries to give the status of the relevant standards. Additionally, a correlation is given between these standards and the national standards covering magnet wire in North America which are developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). A final objective of this paper is to underscore the similarities found between the two and to describe some of the efforts being made to further harmonize those standards

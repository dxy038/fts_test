This work describes the application of both field programmable analog arrays (FPAAs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for signal conditioning and processing in smart sensor applications. The main objective is to exploit their natural reconfiguration capabilities, which will expand the application field to more complex measurement and control systems. On the other hand, the introduction of IEEE 1451-compliant sensors allows for the development of multi-sensor and multi-purpose platforms, that may benefit from programmable technologies. Thus, this paper includes initial developments for IEEE 1451 smart sensor interfacing and its application to instrumentation.

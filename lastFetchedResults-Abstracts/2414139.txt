Excessive menstrual bleeding, cause decreased quality of life and anemia.This study aimed to assess the effect of Vitexagnus and Flaxseed on menstrual bleeding in women referred to health centers of Tabriz, 2014.
Materials and Methods: This triple-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted on 159 women. Using block randomization, subjects were allocated into three groups (n=53 per group). Group I received 25 grams of Flaxseed powder daily; group II received 3.2-4.8 mg Vitex agnus tablet daily and control group received placebo of two drugs for two menstrual cycles. Participants completed Pictorial Blood Lost Assessment Chart (Higham) at baseline, 1, and 2 months after the intervention. Data was analyzed using ANOVA tests. 
Results: There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of the demographic and the Higham score before the intervention. The menstrual bleeding score reduced significantly in both intervention groups during the first and second months after the intervention. Mean Higham score was significantly lower than that in the control group in the first month after the intervention in the Vitex agnus group [adjusted mean difference: [-7.9 (95% CI: -11.8 to -4.0)] and Flaxseed [-9.6 (-13.5 to -5.6)] and the second month after the intervention in Vitex agnus [-10.1 (-15.2 to -5.0] and Flaxseed [-10.4 (-15.5 to -5.2]. There was no significant difference between Vitex agnus and Flaxseed groups.

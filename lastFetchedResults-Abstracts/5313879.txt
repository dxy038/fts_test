This paper introduces a methodology to simulate a particular kind of the fracture phenomenon : the tearing one. The objective of the method is to provide realistic tearing simulations, occuring on 2D deformable objects, and working in real-time. This method can find applications in surgery simulators, where tearing human tissue is an important feature to provide. It can also be applied, in a more general scope, in virtual environment applications. The central idea in this scheme is to &#8220;separate&#8221; the physical simulation elements, instead of destroying or dividing them. This avoids the increase of physical elements that need to be simulated (which occurs when they are divided) and gives a more accurate simulation than when they are destroyed

The objective of this study was to analyze whether advanced simulation platforms provide the effectiveness, accuracy, reliability, and efficiency to predict impairment of mobile-phone RF performance under various usage patterns. The investigation was based on the mechanical CAD data of a commercial phone with two alternative antennas. Three significant hand positions were modeled and evaluated with the device against the SAM head. The results demonstrated high reliability and suitability for providing decision rationale for the design of complex high-end multi-band mobile phones.

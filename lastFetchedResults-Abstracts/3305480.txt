With the accelerated pace of expressway construction and the increasing of expressway mileage in China, the competition among different expressways and between expressway transportation and other modes of transportation is increasingly fierce. So far, uniform expressway service quality evaluation and management indicator system has not been established in our country. In the context of Hebei Qingyin expressway service quality evaluation standard research project, from the expressway road conditions, traffic operations, management systems, information services, cultural services, safety performance, transportation environment and the quality of user perceived, a system to evaluate the service quality of expressway is accomplished with analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Test results show that the system can greatly improve the work efficiency, and give an objective, fair, and comprehensive evaluation report, and provide multi-level, multi-angle data statistics function according to the evaluation results which make managers analysing key factors affecting the quality of expressway service more convenient.

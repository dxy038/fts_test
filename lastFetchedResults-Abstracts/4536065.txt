The paper presents results of our studies on electrical properties of microstrip antennas mounted on minisatellites. The main feature of minisatellite antennas is a lightweight structure and a high degree of integration of antenna elements and feeding circuits. The antennas onboard minisatellites is divided into two groups: telecommand/housekeeping telemetry antennas (TT&amp;C) and payload antennas. The main objective of the research is the optimization of antenna placement onboard the minisatelliate.

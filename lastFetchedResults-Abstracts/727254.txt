The chemical synthesis of 4-phenoxybenzamide adenine dinucleotide (3), a NAD analogue which mimics isoniazid-NAD adduct and inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis NAD-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase (InhA), is reported. The 4-phenoxy benzamide riboside (1) has been prepared as a key intermediate, converted into its 5′-mononucleotide (2), and coupled with AMP imidazolide to give the desired NAD analogue 3. It inhibits InhA with IC50 = 27 μM.

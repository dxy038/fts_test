Achieving QoS objective in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that deals with multimedia information is of paramount importance in the WSN research community. From the application point of view, meeting application specific QoS constraints is equally important as designing energy efficient embedded circuitry for WSN nodes. Among various WSN communication protocol stack, the transport layer functionality has gain fundamental fame lately in addressing the application specific QoS objectives by supporting Source prioritization besides the reliability and congestion control aspects of the design that helps in gaining high throughput with minimum end-to-end packet latency. This paper present the design of a new transport layer protocol that prioritizes sensed information based on its nature while simultaneously supporting the data reliability and congestion control features. The proposed transport protocol is tested in three possible scenarios i.e. with priority, without and distributed priority features. Simulation results reveal that by prioritizing the Source information and prioritized intermediate storage and forwarding reduces the End-to-End (E-2-E) latency of Source packets having &lt;;100 msec except for Source A where it is slightly higher than 400 msec compared to non prioritized case where the E-2-E Source packet latency accounts to &gt;400 msec which is quite significant. Simulation test has been performed for distributed prioritized intermediate storage and forwarding among which the network distribution with node K as prioritized intermediate storage node (DIST-K) outperformed all of the mentioned cases by having 100% achieved Source priority,0% packet drop rate and 0.28 Mbps achieved bit rate.

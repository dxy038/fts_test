The objective of the Embedded Instrumentation Systems Architecture (EISA) initiative is to develop a comprehensive methodology for large-scale, non-intrusive, flexible data collection for test and evaluation (T&amp;E) needs. These needs include system-level developmental, operational, and continuous T&amp;E. The architecture can also be useful in monitoring, diagnostics and health management, as well as protection in control applications. This paper briefly explains how EISA architecture offers a metadata driven methodology for heterogeneous data collection and aggregation in a synchronized and time-correlated fashion. It also supports real-time instrumentation and sensor management as well as virtual (synthetic) instrumentation.
